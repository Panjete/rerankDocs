woman fig 5 the woman had a repeat ct scan 2 days later and showed decreased number of the ggos the 2 patients were transferred to another hospital with antiviral drugs lopinavir-ritonavir and supportive care the world health organization declared the china coronavirus as a global health concern on january 30 2020 on february 28 there have been a total of 78959 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pneumonia and an additional 2308 suspected cases have been reported in china with 2791 deaths according to a recent report from china most patients of the novel coronavirus pneumonia had a history of contact with livestock recent travel to wuhan and contact with people from wuhan but still 260 of patients outside of wuhan did not have a recent travel to wuhan or contact with people from wuhan5 in our 5 cases of the novel coronavirus pneumonia 2 patients were affected from a family cluster 1 patient had contact with people from wuhan and the other 2 patients had long-distance travelling or flight these findings also verified the human-to-human transmission of the virus as none of our patients had a direct contact with livestock the patients probably were infected from asymptomatic individuals6 the most common symptoms of the disease are fever and cough which were also found in our patients underlying disorder ie hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were more common in severe cases5 and among our cases only 1 patient had comorbidity of hypertension for laboratory findings at presentation elevated levels of c-reactive protein were demonstrated in most patients and lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and leukopenia can also be found in severe cases5 in our 5 cases 4 patients had elevated levels of c-reactive protein and 1 patient had both leukopenia and lymphopenia chest ct is an important modality in the early diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia for patients with suspected infection ggos and consolidation are the main ct findings followed by opacities with a rounded morphology reticulation and crazy paving7 the lesions also had a peripheral predominance from the previous report7 ggo are the most common finding in our patients and one patient manifested the typical crazy-paving pattern which is described as thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines with superimposed ggo the lesions in our cases also had a peripheral distribution follow-up chest ct is important for the evaluation of the progression of the disease as it may change fast within a few days coexistence of ggo consolidation and septal line thickening is the main manifestation in the progression of the disease the second ct showed progression in 7 of 8 patients in a previous report with increasing number of opacities and density of consolidation7 in our cases 4 patients had a follow-up chest ct 2 days after admission three cases demonstrated new lesions of consolidation and septal line thickening or expansion of the lesions of ggo and only 1 patient showed improvement from ct images the ct findings of the covid-19 pneumonia are similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers89 however multifocal involvement was more common in the covid-19 pneumonia while unifocal lung involvement was more common in sars10 a basilar and subpleural airspace and extensive ggo are more common in mers8 which were less typical of the covid-19 pneumonia in conclusion given a history of exposure or travelling symptoms of fever and cough and the typical ct manifestation like ggo with a peripheral distribution the radiologists should also be vigilant about the possibility of the covid-19 pneumonia for patients from cities other than wuhan  covid-19 postmortem diagnostic and

lakshmanan sathyavagiswaran wendy stroh suzanne utley   sars-cov-2 is a novel human coronavirus that was detected as the causative agent of human respiratory infection covid-19 in wuhan china in december 2019 it is related to sars-cov and mers-cov other human coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome first detected in china in 2002-2003 and in saudi arabia in 2012 respectively 1 based on currently available global data covid-19 is thought to cause mild limited or no symptoms in at least 80 of those infected 24 a substantial portion of covid-infected individuals are suspected to be asymptomatic carriers estimates derived from select populations of quarantined individuals who underwent widespread testing eg cruise ship passengers and japanese citizens evacuated from china range from 18-3356 of those known to be covid-19 positive approximately 20-30 will develop more severe disease necessitating hospitalization such disease may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards sepsis multiorgan failure and death 79 risk factors for severe disease have been reported to include advanced age hypertension and diabetesalthough recent data suggests hospitalization may be more common among younger covid-19 patients than previously suspected 78 case fatality ratios range widely from 02-77 depending on the population age prevalence of comorbidities testing criteria and availability health care capacity and how cases are defined1013 a variety of electronic databases provide ongoing daily monitoring of covid-19 cases tabulated by country1416 inevitably there will be an increased number of suspected or confirmed covid-19 deaths encountered at autopsy while multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected or confirmed covid-19 deaths there is some variability in the recommendations 1721 additionally limited recommendations to date have been issued regarding scene investigative protocol we present a case of sudden unexpected death due to covid-19 as a means of illustrating suggestive autopsy findings diagnostic considerations and recommended scene and morgue biosafety practices in novel coronavirus deaths a 58-year-old woman reported a week of fevers and respiratory difficulty her medical history was significant for insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus hemoglobin a1c range 7  11 obesity hyperlipidemia mild intermittent asthma and chronic lower extremity swelling with ulceration she was instructed to stay home and self-quarantine by her retail store employer she was found dead in her bedroom after last being known alive the night before emergency medical services responded to the scene and attempted resuscitation before pronouncing death and notifying the medical examiners office two medicolegal death investigators performed a scene investigation family members were interviewed outside the residence eliciting the information that several of the decedents coworkers and an adult member of her household had also developed respiratory illness symptoms at least 6 feet ie 2 meters of separation was maintained between investigators and family members during interview prior to entering the residence investigators donned personal protective equipment ppe sufficient for contact and droplet precautions including gloves fluid-resistant gown a barrier face mask and goggles171820 a camera was employed to document the scene photographically otherwise minimal equipment was brought into the residence following documentation the body was examined and placed in a plastic shroud and then sealed in a body bag and loaded into the transport vehicle after the body was secured investigators doffed their ppe and performed hand hygiene with an alcohol-based gel the body was then transported to the morgue and logged in without opening the outer body bag the transport vehicle was disinfected with a dilute bleach solution an autopsy was performed in a separate negative pressure isolation suite adjacent to the main morgue room but on its own heating ventilation and air-conditioning hvac circuit with 16 air changes per hour only two operators ie a pathologist and a technician were permitted in the isolation suite during the case a second technician acted as a circulator and monitored the case via an observation window communication was facilitated via inexpensive low-power walkie-talkies a small isolation cooler attached to the isolation room acted as an airlock to facilitate transfer of materials into and out of the isolation suite during the prosection fig 1 in accordance with guidelines ppe utilized by autopsy prosectors included scrubs dedicated autopsy footwear with shoe covers a long-sleeve water resistant gown or tyvek suit a long-sleeved splash apron double gloves and cut gloves hair covers and a powered air-purifying respirator papr with full-face shield fig 2 1721 grossly soiled ppe was frequently wiped down with disinfectant wipes or dilute bleach solution during the procedure doffing of ppe at the end of the procedure occurred in the isolation cooler airlock and was monitored by an inspector the autopsy was performed with minor modifications to standard procedures in order to minimize potential organism aerosolization the sink-mounted vacuum aspirator sink drain tissue grinder and station hose were not used all fluid collections were ladled from body cavities although the head was opened with a powered oscillating saw the upper half of the body head of the table and floor surrounding these areas was misted with disinfectant immediately upon cessation of powered sawing and before brain removal only one prosector remained in the room during the sawing for at least 10 minutes afterwards ie 2 full air changes no additional personnel entered the room cleaning of the body and autopsy table was accomplished with towels that were subsequently discarded limited body and specimen photography was accomplished either in situ or on a small photography board near the body following autopsy the body was closed in the standard fashion and cleaned with damp towels and disinfectant a clean body table with a clean body bag and plastic shroud spread out on it had been placed in the isolation cooler airlock by the second technician this was moved into the isolation suite and the body was transferred onto the clean shroud wrapped tightly and sealed with tape then zipped into the clean body bag this procedure allowed the outer surfaces of the shroud and body bag to remain essentially clean once sealed the outer bag was labeled and signed by the pathologist and technician each verifying the identity of the decedent the outer surface of the body bag was then sprayed with disinfectant and the body table was removed to the isolation cooler where residual liquid disinfectant was removed and the bag labeled as infectious release procedures were modified to prevent opening the body bag or shroud for visual identification confirmation by funeral home staff while the body was still in the facility the dual signatures of the pathologist and technician acted as the confirmation that the body bag contained the correct decedent and release to the funeral home was performed without opening the outer bag the infectious nature of the case was disclosed to the funeral home personnel at the time of release notably none of the personnel involved in this index case ie pathologist technicians scene investigators suffered any symptoms consistent with covid infection in the two weeks following their involvement in the case nor since external examination revealed an obese bmi 38 kgm2 middle-aged adult woman with fully developed rigor mortis and blanching livor mortis changes of lower extremity venous stasis and scarring consistent with the history of lower leg ulcers were present on internal examination there were no pleural effusions or other abnormal fluid collections thick mucus was noted in the airways however the lungs were moderately heavy and edematous right 818 g left 705 g and had a relatively firm texture throughout areas of hemorrhage were evident in the right upper and middle lobes and to a lesser extent in the left lower lobe fig 3 hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes appeared enlarged the heart weighed 438 g and exhibited moderate coronary atherosclerosis in each of the main coronary distributions but there were no occlusions or critical stenoses the myocardium was free of obvious infarcts and had the expected firm texture and red-brown color the left ventricle was 12-14 cm thick the cardiac valves were normal there was moderate infrarenal aortic atherosclerosis the kidneys were finely granular and had focal cortical scars right 170 g left 183 g the spleen had a normal appearing capsule and parenchyma 148 g the liver 1990 g was grossly unremarkable the brain 1221 g exhibited hydrocephalus ex vacuo the frontal horns measured 28 cm in greatest dimension at the level of the temporal poles tissue sections were placed in 10 neutral-buffered formalin and allowed to fix for 72 hours prior to histologic sampling hematoxylin and eosin he staining was performed by an outside laboratory histologic examination of the lungs revealed diffuse proteinaceous edema and dense amphophilic concretions along alveolar septae consistent with hyaline membranes the lung architecture was preserved and the septae were of normal thickness but mild mononuclear infiltrates were present throughout there was prominent desquamating pneumocyte hyperplasia with focal multinucleated cells and bizarre forms acute alveolar hemorrhage and collections of reactive foamy alveolar macrophages were focally present as were collections of alveolar fibrin fig 4 no viral inclusions or specific cytopathic changes were identified suppurative inflammation was absent no fibroblastic foci fibrosis granulomas or foreign bodies were appreciated sections of myocardium demonstrated myocyte hypertrophy with interstitial and perivascular fibrous tissue but no acute ischemic changes or inflammatory infiltrates the liver exhibited mild steatosis and central lobular pallor and congestion but no significant portal or lobular inflammation renal changes included arteriolosclerosis mesangial sclerosis and hypercellularity and focal global glomerulosclerosis a section of medulla had no inflammatory or ischemic changes an incidental adrenal cortical nodule and a focus of papillary adenocarcinoma of the thyroid were also detected dacron-tipped swabs of the right and left main bronchi were procured placed into viral transport medium and submitted to the washington state public health laboratory for both sars-cov-2 and influenza testing bacterial swabs of areas of potential consolidation were placed in amies transport media tubes and submitted to the university of washington microbiology laboratory for culture the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr results for sars-cov-2 returned as positive 115 hours after submission negative influenza results returned several days later bacterial cultures were positive for methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans given the lack of acute histologic inflammation in the lungs these bacterial culture results were interpreted as being most likely contaminants or postmortem artifact based on the above autopsy and investigative findings and in accordance with us national vital statistics certification guidelines the cause of death was determined to be acute respiratory distress syndrome due to viral pneumonia due to covid-19 22 other significant contributory factors included type 2 diabetes mellitus hypertension and obesity the state department of health was notified it is suspected that sars-cov-2similar to sars-cov and mers-covbegan as a zoonotic coronavirus that subsequently spread to humans 1 community and healthcare-associated person-to-person transmission were documented early in the pandemic and direct or close contact with infectious persons is believed to be the major mode of transmission2829 transmission occurs through exposure to infectious droplets originating from the respiratory tract infectious droplets may be released from an infected individual via sneezing coughing talking or undergoing an aerosolizing procedure such as intubation or autopsy3031 reportedly droplets do not typically spread beyond 6 feet 2 meters nor linger in air although some evidence has suggested a longer range of spread may be possible3132 less commonly infection may arise as a result of indirect transmission through fomites especially if the eyes face or mouth are contacted after touching an infected surface3133 sars-cov-2 has also been detected in blood and anal swabs increasing evidence suggests that fecal-oral transmission may be another potential route of spread3436 as in the current presented case investigators are advised to mitigate risk of potential sars-cov-2 exposure at death scenes by standing at a distance  6 feet when conducting interviews and requesting interviewees to remain outside the residence while investigators enter as the cdc has recently issued recommendations for the public to wear cloth facial coverings when at risk of social-based transmission scene investigators may consider encouraging interviewees to don cloth facial masks 37 scene investigators should don contact and droplet precaution ppe when entering residences decontamination of all potentially contaminated equipment careful body bagging procedures and investigator hand hygiene are also encouraged anecdotally this has been the scene investigative policy of the snohomish county medical examiners office which despite being the country with the second highest number of positiveconfirmed covid cases in the state of washington has had no scene investigators test positive for sars-cov-2 to date in order to more efficiently triage cases mec offices may elect to have scene investigators procure nasopharyngeal viral testing swabs at the scene scene investigative recommendations are summarized in table 1 each office is advised to carefully assess its own infrastructure supplies and staffing to determine whether suspected or confirmed covid-19 deaths can be safely prosected on-site current cdc and who recommendations are that suspectedconfirmed covid-19 autopsies be prosected in an airborne infection isolation rooms at negative pressure relative to surrounding areas and ideally with at least 12 air changes per hour though 6 will suffice in older structures 1720 air from isolation rooms should be exhausted directly outside or else pass through a high-efficiency particulate air hepa filter if recirculated 1718 recommended ppe includes standard autopsy protection ie double surgical gloves interposed with a layer of cut-proof synthetic mesh gloves scrub suit worn under an impermeable long-sleeve gownapron goggles or face shield shoe covers and surgical cap 1720 as autopsy prosection may generate aerosols respiratory protection consisting of a disposable n-95 respirator or powered air-purifying respirator papr with hepa filter is also indicated1721 given national ppe supply limitations mec offices are encouraged to restrict autopsy attendance to key personnel only ie prosector and technician38 in order to preserve eyewear preferential use of powered air purifying respirators or goggles which can be reused following appropriate disinfection should be considered39 in general paprs are preferable to n95 respirator masks as they provide even higher protection to prosectors andwith appropriate disinfection of reusable elements after usecan be repeatedly employed thus assisting with ppe conservation efforts40 papr filters should be replaced in accordance with manufacturer recommendations some studies have suggested the possibility of decontaminating and reusing n95 masks via ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi hydrogen peroxide vapor sterilization and simply allowing respirators to hang to dry for 3 days384145 proposals for respirator mask construction have also been offered38 further details regarding ppe conservation strategies are beyond the bounds of the current review but are available through the cdc39 aerosol generation at autopsy may occur through inadvertent splashing of fluids puncturing of fluid pockets under pressure and use of vacuum-assisted suction devices and sink-mounted tissue grinders3842 however the most likely aerosol generating autopsy procedure is use of powered oscillating bone saws particularly during brain removal4650 high densities of aerosolized particles are generated in the region of the saw placing the user at risk while n95 respirator masks physically filter 95 of particles at least 1m in size from the inspired air cdc and osha guidelines nonetheless suggest avoiding use of an oscillating bone saw at autopsy in cases of suspectedconfirmed covid-19 if a saw is employed it is recommended that a vacuum shroud be attached to assist in capturing aerosols1718 other oscillating saw aerosol reduction techniques to consider include moistening the saw blade before cutting using autopsy tables with built-in ventilation tenting plastic around the decedents neck and head to entrap aerosols and wearing a hepa-filtered papr rather than n95 mask4649 as in the current presented case other general splash and aerosol reduction techniques eg eschewing use of vacuum assisted aspirator sink tissue grinder or hose are also advised autopsy protocol recommendations are summarized in table 2 while much literature has been published regarding covid-19 signssymptoms and clinical course there is currently a paucity of data regarding expected postmortem gross and histologic findings the case presented herein adds to those few previously published studies lungs are often heavy and histologically reveal edema with focaldiffuse hyaline membrane formation pneumocyte hyperplasia patchy mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates some multinucleated cells and a lack of definitive intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions5152 overall pulmonary pathologic features generally appear consistent with earlyorganizing diffuse alveolar damage and resemble those seen in sars autopsies51-53 while myocarditis has been reported in association with covid-19 it appears to be a less common complication5455 most typically as in the presented case minimal mononuclear myocardial inflammatory involvement is found rarely covid-19 associated encephalitis has been reported56 in one experimental study viable sars-cov-2 was detected up to 72 hours after being placed onto plastic and stainless steel surfaces it also remained viable in an experimentally created aerosol for at least 3 hours although infectious titers per liter of air decreased over time57 a recent review and analysis of literature found that generally human coronaviruses can remain infectious for up to 9 days on inanimate surfaces depending on surface type and temperature at temperatures  30 c ie 86 f viral persistence shortened58 given that sars-cov-2 may remain viable on a variety of inanimate surfaces for a matter of days careful morgue decontamination procedures are key surface disinfection with diluted household bleach solutions ie of 01 sodium hypochlorite 05 hydrogen peroxide solutions or alcohol solutions ie with at least 70 ethanol have been shown to inactivate human coronaviruses within 1 minute5859 for hospital-grade disinfectants staff should verify their suitability for use against sars-cov-2 and ensure disinfectants remain on surfaces in accordance with us environmental protection agency recommendations6061 while conclusive data regarding how long infectious human remains may harbor infectious sars-cov-2 is lacking autopsies in cases of sars found that sars-cov could be recovered from lung tissue and grown in cell culture up to seven days after death6263 considering that there is reportedly 75-80 similarity between the viral genomes of sars-cov-2 causative agent of covid-19 and sars-cov causative agent of sars these results suggest that protective precautions are called for even in cases of delayed suspected covid-19 death investigations or autopsies 164 while limited data exists regarding formalin inactivation of sars-cov-2 infected tissue formalin fixation at room temperature has been shown to inactivate most of sars-cov ie close to assay detection limits within a day6465 in cases of suspected covid-19 in which full autopsies are performed submission of sars-cov-2 swabs from both upper and bilateral lower respiratory tracts is recommended by the cdc 17 if nasopharyngeal as well as bilateral tracheobronchiallung swabs are procured it is recommended they be submitted in separate vials each containing 2-3 ml of viral transport medium17 mec offices however must be cognizant of their current state health department testing capacity and proceed accordingly1719 a rational strategy for minimizing the number of swab submissions per autopsy is to submit swabs only from the lower respiratory tract additionally sampling both lungs with a single swab may increase recovery of viral rna concurrent testing for other causes of respiratory illness such as influenza is also strongly encouraged1719 in order to preserve limited viral testing kit supply mec offices are encouraged to communicate with their testing laboratories to verify whether covid-19 as well as other respiratory viral pathogen testing can be performed on a single swab prosectors should submit a separate samples for bacterialfungal organisms as indicated in cases of suspected covid-19 in which autopsy is not performed nasopharyngeal swab testing for covid-19 as well as other respiratory pathogens is recommended 17 only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts should be submitted for sars-cov-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing as others may inactivate virus or otherwise inhibit the testing in the event that swabs were not procured at autopsy fixed autopsy tissue specimens may also be submitted to cdc in suspected covid-19 deaths for immunohistochemical molecular or other assay characterization17 recent diagnostic advancements include the food and drug administration fda emergency use authorization eua enabling us laboratories already certified for high complexity testing to develop and validate their own sars-cov-2 testing this markedly augmented diagnostic capability as previously all testing was performed mainly by us public health laboratories66 additionally there has been eua approval of rapid covid-19 pcr diagnostic tests that some manufacturers report can deliver results in less than an hour67 recently a serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa testing to assess for covid-19 antibodies has received fda approval and more are in development these are expected to prove of utility in more accurately calculating disease transmission and mortality rates6769 previous surveys have indicated that morgues are heterogeneous in their preparedness to handle highly infectious disease cases7071 facility environmental controls availability of personal protective equipment ppe and staffing are all factors that mec must carefully assess in determining whether suspectedconfirmed covid-19 deaths will be autopsied1719 the majority of known covid-19 deaths technically should not fall under mec office jurisdiction as they are natural deaths predominantly occurring in hospitalized patients72 while autopsy is unlikely to be necessary in such casesand is in fact discouraged by osha mec may nonetheless be called upon to facilitate death certification ensuring accurate public health disease tracking or in cases of medicolegal significance homicides accidents or suicides where a decedent expires in the hospital and is covid-19 positive due to community spread 1872 in deaths occurring outside of the hospital setting mec offices are tasked with determining whether deaths are attributable to covid-19 or not and performing autopsies as needed72 mec offices may elect to triage cases by taking viral np swabs in suspected covid-19 deaths and reserve autopsy for those decedents with negative testing results or else cases in which sars-cov-2 infection is thought to be incidental rather than the cause of death performing a nasopharyngeal np swab for sars-cov-2 requires neither a negative pressure room nor n95 respirator basic contact and droplet precaution ppe are sufficient17 in cases in which autopsy is merited the above described precautions should be followed to prevent morgue staff-acquired covid-19 infection some offices have elected to perform limited autopsies eg precluding brainspinal cord removal in cases of suspectedknown covid-19 positivity to reduce morgue staff aerosol exposure others have incorporated antemortem or postmortem ct radiology as a means of helping triage decedents meriting testing andor autopsy1921 establishing collaborative relations with larger mec offices capable of safely autopsying suspected highly infectious disease cases should be encouraged globally mobile biosafety autopsy facilitieslaboratories with sophisticated infrastructure have been deployed during disease epidemics such as sars and ebola virus advantages include the ability to mobilize rapidly to areas of need with minimal footprint7375 such mobile facilities may be advisable in the us as well neither cdc nor who guidelines require double-bagging of known covid-19 positive decedents however mec offices should ensure that any body fluids leaking from orifices are contained1720 utilizing cotton packing of orifices a plastic shroud or a second body bag are all potential methods of preventing fluid leakage following appropriate decontamination of the body bag a method of clearly designating the infectious nature of contents to funeral home personnel should be employed eg body bag notification sticker mec offices may want to consider modifying body release procedures to preclude contamination risks of opening body bag in morgue for funeral personnel identification76 there is currently no cdc nor who requirement for cremation of covid-19 positive decedents1720 while decedents can be buried or cremated as per current state requirements burial may result in storage difficulties as social distancing-related funeral service delays further details of recommended funeral homemortuary protocol in cases of covid-19 positive decedents can be accessed on both the cdc as well as national funeral directors association websites7778 mec offices are encouraged to closely collaborate with funeral homesmortuaries to ensure body transportation and storage needs are met in jurisdictions with a required waiting period prior to cremation eg 48 hours investigating the possibility of a waiver in order to alleviate decedent storage issues may be advisable although much remains to be learned about sars-cov-2 recommendations for handling decedents with known or suspected covid-19 are available from multiple national and international organizations1721 additionally much can be inferred from experiences with prior coronavirus outbreaks such as sars-cov and mers-cov in order to ensure safety of scene investigators medical examinerscoroners mec and morgue staff developing an understanding of sars-cov-2 transmission presentation and prevention strategies is key the current case presentation with literature review are intended to better inform and provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for mec offices encountering covid-19 at autopsy as community spread of covid-19 increases mec offices are encouraged to employ these biosafety principles broadly as covid carriers may be presymptomatic or asymptomatic and yet still present infectious risk at autopsy mec offices are cautioned that suspicious scene investigative history eg nursing home resident or individual from homeless encampment cannot necessarily be relied upon to identify covid carriers it is hoped that by documenting and sharing postmortem findings mec offices can provide new insights into the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 and potentially assist in formulating therapeutic strategies to reduce disease mortality  shell disorder analysis predicts greater resilience of the sars-cov-2 covid-19 outside the body and in body fluids gerard goh kian-meng a dunker keith james foster a vladimir uversky n   in december of 2019 a mysterious virus that causes pneumonia and produces pneumonia-like symptoms ie dry cough and fever was noticed to be spreading in wuhan hubei province china 1 2 3 4 the culprit was quickly identified as a new respiratory coronavirus cov this virus and its disease are currently known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 and coronavirus infectious disease 2019 covid-19 respectively 1 2 3 4 sars-cov-2 is observed to be even more contagious but fortunately less fatal than sars-cov that was seen in 2003 in 20112012 just before the outbreak of the middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers-cov we built an empirically-based model that measures the percentage of intrinsic disorder pid of the membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins in viruses 56 the main tool uses ai technology to recognize intrinsic disorder given the protein sequence the model involves the listing of shell disorder by coronaviruses that is easily clustered into three groups which incidentally correlate with the known levels of fecal-oral and respiratory transmission of the various coronaviruses the model predicts that the 2003 sars-cov m pid  8 and n pid  50 is included into a category of covs with intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials an opportunity to test the validity of this model came when mers-cov first struck the middle east in 2012 upon the availability of the sequences of both mers-cov m and n proteins the authors were able to confirm that mers-cov falls solidly into a category of viruses that have lesser respiratory transmission potential but have greater fecal-oral transmission capabilitie 67 the categorization of mers-cov within this category was supported by the observations that mers-cov is not efficiently spreading among humans unlike sars-cov and requires close contact 8 furthermore it is now known that camels are the natural reservoir for mers-cov and viruses that are associated with farm animals such as camels tend to have greater fecal-oral transmission potentials 9 in this study we will have the opportunity to once again test the model this time it will involve the sars-cov-2 we shall see that not only the model is reliable and consistent but is able to detect something very odd about this virus that could account for its quick spread protein intrinsic disorder is found when portions of or an entire protein has no structure it is also called by other names such as unstructured natively unfolded 10 11 12 the main tool used to develop the covs shell disorder model involves the use of neural networks that had been trained to recognize ordered and disordered regions of a protein given its sequence a suite of such artificial intelligence tools ai have been named pondr httpwwwpondrcom of a particular interest pondr vlxt has been found to be accurate for structural proteins with protein-protein and protein-rnadna interactions 13 14 15 16 17 in fact pondr vlxt has shown consistency and reproducibility when used for the study of structural viral shells that protect the virion from environmental damage a wide range of viruses have been studied using pondr vlxt including equine infectious anemia virus eiav human

proteins the m protein of cov was chosen over the e protein because the m protein is a major transmembrane protein that is found in large numbers in the virion whereas e protein is a minor protein of the envelope also in previous studies membrane or matrix proteins of various viruses were analysed with respect to their intrinsic disorder content and roles in protecting the respective virions the n protein is also important for our model as it has been shown that greater disorder in the inner shell is associated with the mode of infection and virulence in other viruses 23 24 25 26 the protein sequences of the selected cov m and n proteins were downloaded from uniprot httpwwwuniprotorg the sequences were fed into a mysql database using java 19 the sequences were fed into the pondr vlxt and the corresponding results were archived in the database pondr vlxt provides intrinsic disorder predisposition scores for each residue residues with the scores of 05 and above are considered disordered and conversely residues with the scores below 05 are taken as ordered we represented the outputs of these analyses in the form of the percentage of intrinsic disorder pid which is defined as the number of residues predicted to be disordered divided by the total number of residues in a query protein statistical analyses using regression analysis and analysis of variance anova were done using r statistical package 34 regression analyses were done using category as the dependent variable with m and n pids as independent variables or n pid as a sole independent variable categories were assigned the values of 1 2 and 3 to the three groups as according to the level of respiratory transmission potential the amino acid sequences of the sars-cov-2 m and n proteins are available at ncbi httpswwwncbinlmnihgovnuccoremn908947 as aforementioned the model predicting the mode of viral transmission was built before the 2012 mers-cov outbreak this model was based on the analysis of mainly the pids found for n proteins the viruses were clustered into three groups according to their transmission mode while the m pids provide an indicator of resilience of the virus in the harsh environment the three groups are represented in table 1
 a two-way anova p  0001 indicates that the groups are statistically identifiable the table shows that category a consists of viruses that have greater respiratory transmission capabilities but lower fecal-oral transmission potentials category b involves coronaviruses that have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials whereas category c comprises of viruses with lower respiratory transmission furthermore a higher inner shell disorder is often associated with the greater infectivity especially with regard to respiratory transmission potential since disorder allows greater promiscuity of binding 67 
table 1 shows that sars-cov is grouped into category b along with other viruses that have intermediate respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials mers-cov falls into category c lower respiratory potential but higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities these are consistent with what we know about transmission behaviour of sars-cov and mers-cov 5 6 7 835 it should be noted that category a are viruses with n pid above 53 whereas category c comprises of those with n pid below 47 since sars-cov-2 has an n pid of 48 which is above 46 but below 54 it must be considered as being in category b as already mentioned based on the similar analysis of the sars-cov-2 m pid  6 n pid  48 it is clear that this virus has to be placed in category b along with sars-cov table 1 however our data also pointed to something odd about the sars-cov-2 in fact table 1 and fig 1
show that data for the sars-cov-2 the m pid is 6 which is second lowest in our sample of a fairly diverse selection of covs this means that the sars cov-2 has one of the hardest outer shells among its counterparts the model is consistent with the theme that viruses that remain in harsh environments require harder ie less disordered shells to survive furthermore the outer shell is likely to play an even greater role in protecting the virion 202227 this has important implications pertaining to the characteristics and behaviors of the virus as we shall see below a superficial glance at the model that places sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in the same category with intermediate levels of respiratory transmission potentials may mislead the reader to believe that the model is not reliable given the fact that we have now seen that sars-cov-2 is much more contagious than sars-cov we believe that this is not the case if sars-cov-2 would be placed in category c the same category as mers-cov then the model would be definitely wrong in terms of reproducibility on the other hand the placing of sars-cov-2 in category a would be an inconsistency that would be difficult to explain one would further notice that very few covs fall into category a with the exception for hcov-229e and infectious bronchitis virus ibv which make the chance of any covs including sars-cov-2 to be in category a slim more importantly because sars-cov-2 is zoonotic and the only non-human cov in category a is the avian ibv placing sars-cov-2 in category a could suggest that this virus is likely to be of avian origin which is inconsistent with what we know about sars-cov-2 phylogenetic study has confirmed that the closest relatives of sars-cov-2 are bat covs 436 we also noticed that at least three of closest neighbors with similar n pids of 4748 are those of bat origin see table 1 this suggests that bat covs are likely to have an optimal mix of fecal-oral and respiratory transmission potentials that reflect their n pid range of 4748 which provides for greater fitness for the spread of the viruses among bats and that sars-cov-2 is likely to be of bat origin too given its n pid is 48 there are highly debatable suggestions that snakes or pangolins 33738 may be an intermediary host of the virus even if any of these is later deemed as true our data imply that the virus had not the chance to evolved much with any intermediary host except bats unlike the cases of sars-cov and mers-cov in which the model does suggest that they had evolved with hosts such as civet cats and camels respectively this suggestion is however based on n pid alone the cov shell disorder model was originally conceived as part of a spin-off from a parent research project that studied relationships among the mode of transmission shell disorder and the absence of vaccines for certain sexually transmitted viruses such as hiv hsv and hcv 192027 at that time even after 2003 sars-cov the wealth of cov knowledge lies in the field of veterinary medicine 56 using what was then known about behaviors of porcine covs a successful attempt to correlate m and n pids to modes of transmission was made 56 the results were similar to those found in table 1 and fig 1 without the data pertaining to mers-cov and sars-cov-2 of course since the mers-cov and covid-19 outbreaks had yet to occur then evidence of a strong correlation of m and n pids to the mode of transmission r2  083 p  0001 can be seen in the regression analysis furthermore a strong but oddly weaker correlation r2  077 p  0001 can also be found when n pid is the sole independent variable even if poor correlation r2  021 is found when m pid is the sole independent variable this basically means that the model should include both m and n pids as the statistical model seems to suggest that m pid does contribute even if slightly to the mode of transmission in conjunction to the major contribution by n pid this is consistent with the idea that both m and n play roles in protecting the virion from environmental damage and the need to protect the virion is dependent on mode of transmission a qualitative inspection of the viruses in the three groups also reveals consistency for example as in table 1 canine cov-respiratory falls into category b while canine cov-enteritis is in category c the porcine covs are also consistent with observation of their behaviors as we will later see we need to keep in mind however that the outer shell is likely to play a greater and more immediate role in protecting the virion from environmental damage as it encases the entire virion whereas the n protein is likely to protect only the rna m pid is therefore a more crucial indicator of the hardness of the virion however because of the higher correlation of n to the mode of transmission our model is apparently suggesting that some other mechanisms are involved in fact studies of inner shell of other viruses such as nipah virus ebola virus and flaviviruses 23 24 25 26 have indicated strong correlations between inner shell disorder and virulence in the case of nipah virus the virulence and inner shell disorder were linked to the modes of transmission 26 the mechanism in which the virus acquires greater virulence via inner shell disorder arises from the ability of the viral protein to bind promiscuously to the host protein 623 24 25 26 this ability provides for rapid replication of the viral proteins and particles this quick replication is also an efficient way to evade the host immune system by reproducing a large number of viral particles before the immune system even recognizes the virus which then often goes on to overwhelm the body leading to the death of the host 623 24 25 26 one highly plausible explanation for the link between rapid replication and the modes of transmission is that viral load in the body fluids of the infected host needs to be sufficiently high before the virus can be infectious via the respiratory mode this therefore explains the fact that rapid viral replication and inner shell disorder were found to be the common link between virulence and respiratory transmission in the case of nipah virus 26 we dont however know if there is correlation between cov virulence and inner shell disorder even though the authors believe it exists just like the other viruses if so n will make an excellent target for cov vaccine developmentthe difficulty in the search for such links is that covs infect a large variety of animals and each cov often uses a different receptor 4639 for example mers-cov has a case-fatality rate of above 30 8 for humans but is generally harmless to camels 27 furthermore covs were generally not known to be virulent before the 2003 sars-cov outbreak and therefore lack adequate data for us to work with the reason that we can make the necessary above-mentioned extrapolations pertaining to inner shell disorder among unrelated viruses with somewhat greater confidence is that inner shell proteins of different species of viruses often share similar functions and structures 304041 for example the cov n proteins like the nucleocapsids in other viruses are responsible for assembling viral particles by forming complexes with other viral proteins and rna 242541 the n protein also helps with the packaging and budding of viral particles in the host er endoplasmic reticulum 233040 such tasks require binding to host proteins and the promiscuous protein binding capabilities of a more disordered n will certainly help towards rapid replication of the virus since both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have intermediate respiratory transmission potentials how do we account for the greater contagiousness of the latter we need to understand that the respiratory transmission potential of a single viral particle is just one of several factors that might contribute to the contagiousness of the virus other factors include how many particles are released by the host and how long does the particle remain in the environment we mentioned that our model has detected something odd about sars-cov-2 this virus has one of the hardest outer shell within the family as seen in fig 1 and table 1 m pid  6 since the outer shell plays the greater role in protecting the virion in comparison to the inner shell the harder outer shell provides virus greater resilience to outside the body environment and to the presence of digestive enzymes found in the saliva mucus and other bodily fluids 202242 43 44 45 46 as a result the virus with the harder outer shell is able to remain active for a longer time and therefore a lesser number of viral particles is required for a chance to infect someone furthermore because the virus is more resistant to the digestive enzymes in the bodily fluids an infected body is likely to discharged more infectious particles evidence of the protective role of the outer shells be seen in a wide variety of viruses viruses associated with saliva eg yfv zikv eiav rabies or fecal-oral transmission eg poliovirus have hard outer shells with low pid whereas sexually transmitted viruses eg hiv hsv-2 hcv have higher outer shell pids 620 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 also viruses that are notorious for lasting in the environment for a long time such as the smallpox virus have low outer shell pids before the sars-cov outbreak coronaviruses were not considered medically important as in the past they had been primarily associated with cold viruses that cause minor sniffles this is however not true in the field of veterinary medicine where coronaviruses have posed a menace to livestock this is especially so in the case of tgev transmissible gastroenteritis virus and pedv porcine epidemic diarrhea virus tgev could move rapidly among farm pigs to quickly devastate the farming community if not controlled early 5 6 7 our analysis reveals that tgev is of category c higher fecal-oral lower respiratory transmission potentials with m and n pids at 14 and 43 respectively the reason that it is able to move rapidly is that its high fecal-oral transmission potential represents a more efficient mode of transmission among the farm animals there is an antigenically related cousin pedv which has similar characteristics as tgev 29 like tgev diarrhea and vomiting are main symptoms of pedv infection while tgev is highly infectious pedv is less contagious among farm pigs a peculiar characteristic has been observed by farmers and veterinarians pedv can reappear out of nowhere from within the same pen that was previously occupied by infected pigs even after the disease has passed on several months ago an inspection of the m and n pids reveals the reason showing that pedv belongs to the category b along with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 unlike tgev and mers-cov this means that pedv has a higher respiratory transmission potential than tgev and that implies greater chances of fecal-respiratory transmission for the former obviously viral particles in fecal materials that was somehow inadvertently left behind go on to infect a new population of pigs several months later 5 6 7 infectious droplets from mucus vomit or feces have actually been seen during the sars-cov outbreak a stark example happened in a 2003 outbreak at amoy gardens a housing complex in hong kong where a huge cluster of infected patients was found and the inefficient sewerage and toilet ventilation systems were responsible for the spread 53547 we need to be reminded that pedv sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are all under the same category b and that sars-cov-2 has the hardest outer shell within the entire cov familysars-cov-2 is thus likely to be able remain infectious in the environment for the longest time regardless of being in feces mucus vomit sweat or saliva a puzzling thing can be observed is when we notice that pedv m pid  8 has a harder outer shell than tgev m pid  14 given that tgev is predicted as having higher fecal-oral transmission potential we would think that having greater fecal-oral potential requires harder outer shell among covs apparently the result is implying that this is not necessarily true as we have seen and having higher fecal-oral transmission potential can actually provide greater efficiency in the spread among farm animals as we have seen in tgev such that the virus does not have to stay long outside the body the ability to stay longer in the environment could however provide advantages to a virus with greater respiratory transmission potential especially with respect to spread via airborne virus from feces or body fluids this is likely the case for sars-cov-2 we have presented here a set of data that not only place the sars-cov-2 within the category of covs that have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials alongside sars-cov and pedv but have also predicted sars-cov-2 to have one of the hardest outer shells among most covs this peculiarity is likely responsible for its high level of contagiousness since hardness of its outer shell could provide the virus with the greater resilience to the conditions outside the body and in body fluid as the harder shell will better protect the virion from damage as a result of the hostile environment and action of the digestive enzymes found in bodily fluids as a result it is likely that the infected body can shed more infectious particles that have a greater chance of infecting a person over its lifetime chances of infections via indirect contact and airborne virus from feces and bodily fluids are therefore greater the results of our research could have important implications for epidemiologists and public health officials gkmg conceived the idea collected and analyzed the

for the research gkmg is an independent researcher and the owner of gohs biocomputing singapore gkmg has also written a book viral shapeshifters strange behaviors of hiv and other viruses on a related subject the authors have no other potential conflict of interests  rigidity of the outer shell predicted by a protein intrinsic disorder model sheds light on the covid-19 wuhan-2019-ncov infectivity gerard goh kian-meng a dunker keith james foster a vladimir uversky n   before the mers-cov outbreak in 2012 we built a model using artificial intelligence ai tools for the identification of the levels of predicted intrinsic disorder pid in a query protein using its amino acid sequence as the only input 1 next this information was applied to rank various coronaviruses based on the levels of disorder in their inner and outer shells ie pid values evaluated for their nucleocapsid n and membrane m proteins respectively and to find if these shell pid values were indicative of how long the given virus was able to stay in the environment 123 the application of this model ranked coronaviruses into three groups categories a b and c members of which differ not only by the levels of their shell disorder but also by their respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potential 123 the model was consistent with the hypothesis that viruses remaining in harsh environments require harder ie less disordered shells to survive 23 furthermore higher levels of inner shell disorder could be associated with greater infectivity especially with regard to the viruses with high respiratory transmission potential 345  on the basis of these considerations category a coronaviruses are characterized by more disordered inner n shell and higher levels of respiratory transmission combined with lower levels of fecal-oral transmission category b coronaviruses are characterized by the n shell having intermediate levels of disorder and intermediate levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission whereas category c coronaviruses possess the most ordered n proteins and are characterized by higher levels of fecal-oral transmission and lower levels of respiratory transmission 12345 notably some not all of the viruses with lower outer shell rigidity higher m pid are in category c with greater fecal-oral transmission potential because these viruses do not have to be in the environment for a long time given that the fecal-oral route is an efficient mode of transmission among some farm animals according to this pid-based classification sars-cov with pids of 9 and 50 for its m and n proteins respectively falls into category b which includes the coronaviruses with the intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral potential however mers-cov whose m and n proteins are characterized by the pid values of 10 and 44 respectively were placed into a group with a higher fecal-oral and lower respiratory transmission potential category c 5 importantly this classification of coronaviruses which is based on the rigidity of their shells was generally supported by clinical observations of their transmission modes  the usefulness of our model is now becoming obvious considering the current covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov outbreak 6 currently the analysis suggests details of this analysis will be published elsewhere 7 that covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov belongs to category b indicating that similar to sars-cov covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov can be efficiently transmitted via the respiratory mode however due to the fact that the outer shell of this virus is among the hardest in the coronavirus family the model suggests that covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov is likely to be more resilient in body fluids and the environment than most of its cousins including sars-cov and mers-cov  therefore our model predicts that covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov can be efficiently spread by respiratory means as in the case of sars-cov but it also has the potential to remain outside the body longer than sars-cov and probably mers-cov the possibility of fecal-respiratory transmission of covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov is especially of concern as was the case for sars-cov in the amoy garden hong kong3 furthermore the intermediate levels of fecal-oral transmission potential of covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov should also be kept in mind as in the case of all other viruses in category b  although the ability to last longer outside the body provides better fitness of the virus that relies more on the fecal-respiratory route of transmission as seen in pedv35 transmission of the more rigid virus can occur via feces but also in airborne form released from mucus vomit and other body fluids these properties can also explain the higher contagiousness levels of the covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov than with sars-cov 6 in fact the ability of covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov to remain infectious outside the body for a longer period than sars-cov could imply that it requires fewer viral particles for greater chances of infection furthermore an infected body can shed more active viral particles in greater concentrations as more particles are able to resist the digestive enzymes found in most bodily fluids including saliva 23 all these can explain not only high contagiousness of the covid-19wuhan 2019-ncov but also the reported capability of this virus to be spread even before the patient begins to show symptoms 6  inside-out versus outside-in models for virus induced demyelination axonal damage triggering demyelination ikuo tsunoda robert fujinami s  the primary target in multiple sclerosis ms is believed to be either myelin itself myelinopathy or the myelin-forming cell the oligodendrocyte oligodendrogliopathy although axonal injury occurs in ms it is regarded as a secondary event to the myelin damage here the lesion develops from myelin outside to the axon inside outside-in model recently gray matter lesions and axonal injury in normal-appearing white matter have also been reported in ms this raises two questions 1 is axonal injury exclusively secondary to myelin damage or from a direct insult to the axon or neurons axonopathy 2 is the injured axon regarded as only an end result of pathology or disease or can axonal injury contribute to the spread of secondary damage including demyelination the former is raised from the fact that axonal damage has been reported in several virus infections including human immunodeficiency virus human t-lymphotropic virus 1 herpes simplex virus and coronavirus which also cause demyelination the latter possibility where axonal injury leads to other changes is raised from the rather unexpected similarity between spinal cord injury sci and ms where axonal injury oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination are all present in sci transection of axons leads to delayed oligodendrocyte apoptosis with secondary demyelination neurofilament immunostaining of spinal cord sections demonstrates that axonal injury with oligodendrocyte apoptosis also precedes demyelination in an animal model for ms theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus infection this implies that axonal injury could trigger demyelination in this instance lesions develop from the axon inside to the myelin outside inside-out model correspondence to rs fujinami be an immune-mediated disease occurring in genetically susceptible individuals precipitated by one or more environmental agents most likely infectious in nature virus infections have been associated with ms or models of ms 7 26 88 99  the primary target of ms is believed to be either myelin itself myelinopathy or the myelin-forming cell the oligodendrocyte oligodendrogliopathy although axonal injury has been demonstrated in ms 23 84  it is believed to be secondary to myelin injury 48  in this scenario the lesion develops from myelin outside to the axon inside outside-in model fig 1a  in this outside-in model myelin andor oligodendrocytes can be damaged by 1 direct virus infection 2 cytotoxic t cells and macrophages 3 toxic substances including cytokines and proteases produced by t cells macrophages and glial cells andor 4 autoantibodies against myelin and oligodendrocytes recently gray matter involvement occurring in normal-appearing gray matter nagm 78  and axonal injury present in normal-appearing white matter nawm have been demonstrated in ms 12 43 48  this raises two questions first does axonal injury arise from destruction of myelin surrounding axons due to a bystander effect or from a direct insult to axons or neurons primary axonopathy second regardless of the cause of axonal damage is this simply an end product or could this contribute to secondary damage or trigger demyelination can axons be the primary target in ms axonal form of guillain-barr syndrome this question relates to the recent proposal for an axonal form of guillain-barr syndrome gbs while ms is an inflammatory demyelinating disease in the cns its counterpart in the peripheral nervous system pns is acute or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy aidp or cidp classical pathological studies of gbs showed the presence of prominent demyelination and inflammatory infiltrates in the spinal roots and nerves on this basis gbs has been considered to be 106 i tsunoda rs fujinami   fig 1a b outside-in and inside-out models for demyelinating diseases a outside-in model the lesion develops from the outside to the inside the primary target is myelin or the myelin forming cell oligodendrocyte after primary myelin destruction the axon is damaged secondarily b inside-out model the lesion develops from the inside to the outside the primary target is the axon or its cell body the neuron primary axonal injury leads to secondary demyelination inside-out versus outside-in models for virus induced demyelination 107 108 i tsunoda rs fujinami  is multiple sclerosis a pure oligodendrogliopathymyelinopathy but not an axonopathy multiple sclerosis ms is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system cns  although its precise etiology is unknown ms is considered to synonymous with the pathological designation aidp 21  in 1986 however feasby et al 22 described an axonal form of gbs and challenged the existing notion of gbs being a primarily demyelinating disease 14  in axonal gbs axonal degeneration can be seen without demyelination or lymphocyte infiltration 29  this is contrary to the traditional belief that axonal involvement in gbs occurs secondarily to or by a bystander fashion following severe demyelination in axonal gbs frequent associations with antecedent campylobacter jejuni infections and with anti-ganglioside antibodies have been demonstrated molecular mimicry between c jejuni and a neural epitope has been proposed as a mechanism for immunopathology this is further supported by an animal model of axonal gbs that is induced by sensitization with gm1 ganglioside 103  although axonal degeneration is increasingly recognized in ms it is regarded as only a secondary or bystander event is there primary axonal damage in ms and its animal model theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev infection this question is raised from a rather unexpected area spinal cord injury sci recently similarities in neuroimmunology and neuropathology have shown that in both ms and sci axonal injury oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination are all present 9 10  in sci transection of an axon leads to delayed oligodendrocyte apoptosis and secondary demyelination neurofilament immunostaining of spinal cord sections from tmev-infected mice visualizes axonal injury with oligodendrocyte apoptosis preceding the demyelination 90  this suggests that axonal injury may well trigger demyelination in this review we propose a new model for the development of demyelination in which lesions develop from the axon inside to the myelin outside inside-out model fig 1b  the first section of this review provides a brief overview of the findings and theories in axonal pathology both in ms and a variety of virus infections and introduces recent findings of axonal pathology and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in tmev infection in the second part we will discuss similarities between tmev infection and sci and review possible mechanisms of close association between axonal injury and demyelination 1 disruption of cross-talk between the axon and the oligodendrocyte 2 activation of microgliamacrophages and induction of oligodendrocyte apoptosis and 3 induction of autoimmunity by cns injury lastly we will discuss the possible association of the inside-out versus outside-in models in which the two models are not mutually exclusive and could be useful in explaining different pathological features which in reality may be simply due to looking at different aspects of a consecutive series of events using a silver impregnation technique and electron microscopy 82  early studies demonstrated axonal degeneration in ms 32 37  however little attention was paid to this axonal degeneration as compared to primary demyelination extensive myelin loss with relative preservation of axons previous emphasis was on relative preservation of axons not on the detectable axonal degeneration three pathological and neuroimaging studies in recent years have challenged the historical view of preserved axonal integrity in ms 80  first immunostaining studies provided direct evidence of axonal damage using antibodies against two markers for injured axons nonphosphorylated neurofilament nf 84  and amyloid precursor protein app 23 28  this made possible the identification of earlier and subtler changes than those seen by silver staining 28  the number of macrophages correlated with the extent of axonal damage that showed spheroid enlargement or axonal swelling however acute inflammatory demyelination was not demonstrated to correlate with axonal injury at least in secondary progressive sp-ms lovas et al 43 demonstrated a significant reduction of axonal density in sp-ms and there was no significant difference in axonal density in the ms plaque versus contralateral nawm they suggest that the equally decreased axonal density in the nawm and in the plaque could represent the final outcome of multisegmental long-standing inflammation affecting the tracts second magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs analysis provided information on axonal pathology by analyzing the chemical composition of brain tissue 48  in practice the ratio of n-acetyl aspartate naa to creatine cr naacr is used as naa is confined to neurons and neuronal processes and cr is more evenly distributed a reduction in the ratio in the white matter has been attributed to axonal loss atrophy degeneration or metabolic dysfunction patients with ms have lower levels of naa than normal controls partially reversible signal decrease is observed during the active inflammatory phase which becomes irreversible during the chronic inactive state the reversibility is interpreted as the result of the presence of edema reactive astrocytes and inflammatory cells or as reversible axonal atrophy or metabolic dysfunction the naacr signal decrease was also observed in nawm in both patients with relapsing-remitting rr-ms and sp-ms while sp-ms patients showed lower naacr ratios than those in rr-ms 24  third atrophy of the brain and the spinal cord has been described on ct and mri and it is associated with disturbances in neuropsychological and clinical function 81  volume loss occurs in the corpus callosum cerebellum spinal cord and in tissues surrounding the third and lateral ventricles in addition to myelin loss and tissue contraction from gliosis axonal loss is believed to contribute to the cns atrophy although there is evidence of axonal injury in ms the axon has been regarded as an innocent bystander not as a specific immune target axonal destruction however may be due to immune attack directed at axonal components 80  antibodies to neurofilament and tubulin have been reported to be present in some ms patients it is uncertain whether these anti-axonal antibodies play a pathogenic role or merely reflect a release of axonal components to the systemic circulation following axonal degeneration viruses disseminate in the cns by three ways 1 within the extracellular space 2 by axonal transport and 3 via direct cell-to-cell transmission infectious agents including viruses prions and bacteria have been shown to spread within axons 38  neurovirulent viruses including herpes simplex rabies influenza and borna disease viruses can be anterogradely or retrogradely transported in axons 38 55  in some instances viruses can be transported intra-axonally more than 1 m yet this journey occurs intracellularly therefore the virus cannot be inactivated by neutralizing antibody during its transit and may spread in the cns without inducing an anti-virus immune response while within the cell when viruses can spread only intra-axonally andor via direct cell-to-cell contact they could potentially escape the attack of antiviral drugs or neutralizing antibodies although axonal transport of virus can lead to axonal degeneration 53  neuronal infection and axonal transport of virus may not result in axonal injury a recombinant virus vector has been shown to be axonally transported in neurons without tissue damage 13  conversely infections in the neurons or axons are not necessarily required to induce axonal injury as seen in the human demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml which is caused by jc virus infection of oligodendrocytes although the lesions of pml are characteristically described as demyelinating the sparing of axons is only relative and accumulation of app was detected within the areas of demyelination 28  retrovirus infection also induces axonal injury without infection in the neuronal cell body and axons although myelin pallor multinucleated giant cells and neuronal loss are well-established pathological findings in human immunodeficiency virus hiv encephalitis axons have long been considered to be unaffected in hiv encephalitis until the terminal stages by app immunostaining axonal damage was demonstrated not only in hiv encephalitis 28 66  but also in hiv-positive asymptomatic patients 5  raja et al 66 demonstrated that the prevalence and abundance of app-positive staining axons paralleled the severity or pallor of myelin staining in the cerebral white matter where oligodendrocytes were neither reduced in number nor infected giometto et al 28 showed that the appearance of the immunostaining varied from globular or ballooned structures to bundles of parallel rods 28  the globular structures co-localized with areas of poor myelin staining in the deep white matter and were indicative of chronic lesions the presence of bundles was predominantly in the peripheral regions of the white matter including the gyri and correlated with acute changes the authors hypothesized that axonal changes could contribute to retrograde neuronal degeneration and loss where neurons are not the target of hiv infection similarly adle-biassette et al 2 suggested neuronal apoptosis occurred via axonal retrograde degeneration in hiv infection since there was a topographical correlation between neuronal apoptosis microglial activation and axonal damage human t-lymphotropic virus 1 htlv-i is another retrovirus that causes axonal degeneration and myelin pallor without infection of neurons iwasaki 34 reviewed the neuropathology of htlv-i-associated myelopathy ham or tropical spastic paraparesis tsp using myelin and phosphorylated nf staining in long-standing lesions both myelin and axons degenerated equally while tissue appeared spongy due to the swelling of the myelin sheaths with a concomitant preservation of axons at the margin of the lesions although hamtsp requires differentiation from the spi-nal form of ms severe symmetrical degeneration of the lateral funiculi accompanied by wallerian degeneration of long tracts is unique to hamtsp and not found in ms 34  using app immunostaining umehara et al 93 also found axonal damage not only in active inflammatory lesions but also in inactive chronic lesions without any relationship to inflammation app-positive staining axons had intact myelin sheaths while myelin abnormality without axonal changes was rarely found therefore the authors suggest that axonal injury is not secondary to demyelination but the primary instigator herpes simplex virus hsv type 2 has been reported to be transported axonally and to cause demyelination with minimal axonal damage hsv 2 can produce multifocal cns demyelination in infected mice and gray matter lesions if found are relatively minor if neuronal cell bodies are infected virus subsequently appears in axons and virions are axonally transported using electron microscopy martin 46 observed virus particles in a very small portion of axons in demyelinating lesions but not in surrounding zones of normal white matter axonal abnormalities were infrequent relative to the dominant demyelinative pathology martin 46 proposed that neuronal infection and axonal transport of virus may lead to foci of oligodendrocyte infection with destruction and cns demyelination close to or distant from the infected neuronal cell bodies fig 2a  here virus may spread cell-to-cell or extracellularly 1 from an axon to multiple oligodendrocytes via the inner tongue process of the glial sheath or 2 from the cell body of one oligodendrocyte to the next oligodendrocyte which are apposed to one another in longitudinally oriented interfascicular rows thus as previously suggested by martin 46  the relatively minor gray matter lesions in ms may be important in and not secondary to demyelination as we will discuss later axonal transport of virus  fig 2b  and oligodendrocyte infection  fig 2c  are seen in tmev infection where a similar pathomechanism of lesion development is observed some viruses including tmev and polyomavirus are known to induce both axonal injury and demyelination murine hepatitis virus mhv belongs to the genus coronavirus family coronaviridae mice and rats infected with neurotropic strains of mhv eg jhm and a59 develop demyelinating disease and are used as experimental animal models for ms 31  using antibody against nonphosphorylated nf dandekar et al 18 observed a modicum of axonal damage with extensive viral replication but without demyelination in mhv-infected rag1 -mice that are defective in recombinase activating gene 1 expression and thus lack mature b or t cells adoptive transfer of spleen cells from immune mhv b6 mice into mhv-infected rag mice resulted in demyelination with increased axonal damage macrophages or microglia were abundant in areas of demyelination and axonal damage but viral antigen was present at lower levels than in mice not receiving transferred immune spleen cells this suggests that both direct virus infection and mhv-specific immune responses contribute to axonal injury in mhv infection theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev is a non-enveloped icosahedral positive-sense single-stranded rna virus belonging to the genus cardiovirus family picornaviridae tmev is a common cause of asymptomatic enteric infections in mouse colonies tmev is subdivided into two subgroups gdvii and to the gdvii subgroup is neurovirulent and its representative strain is the gdvii virus the to subgroup is less virulent and da and bean viruses are its representative strains serological evidence indicates that mus musculus family muridae subfamily murinae is the natural host of tmev 42  although anti-tmev antibodies have been detected in a different subfamily microtinae including meadow water and bank voles 19  112 i tsunoda rs fujinami  intracerebral infection of mice with the gdvii subgroup causes a fatal polioencephalomyelitis 89  and was once widely used as an animal model for poliomyelitis fig 3a  on the other hand intracerebral infection of mice with the to subgroup causes a biphasic disease fig 3a  during the acute phase 1 week after infection tmev predominantly infects neurons in the gray matter and causes acute polioencephalomyelitis mainly of the brain although infected mice recover from the acute disease mice develop an inflammatory demyelinating disease in the white matter of the spinal cord 1 month after infection during this chronic phase the anterior and lateral columns including the ventral nerve exit zone are first involved and the posterior column changes occur usually as a later event here the cuneatus fasciculus is demyelinated but the gracile fasciculus and the corticospinal tract are relatively spared 92  although the reason for the predilection of the cuneatus fasciculus is unclear this may reflect the observation that small-diameter fibers are relatively preserved compared to larger fibers in tmev infection 50 76  small diameter axons are present within the corticospinal tract and the center of the posterior column while larger diameter axons comprise the lateral part of the posterior column 56  in the demyelinating lesion tmev has been reported to persist in oligodendrocytes astrocytes and microgliamacrophages but not neurons  61  reviewed in 88  oligodendrogliopathy and myelinopathy caused by the to subgroup of tmev in general virus infection causes damage in the nervous system by two mechanisms direct infection of neuronal cells and immune-mediated tissue injury immunopathology the mechanisms leading to tmev-induced demyelinating disease are also believed to involve either virus-induced pathology or immunopathology in the cns both depending on viral persistence table 1  since oligodendrocytes the myelinforming cells are infected with tmev during the chronic phase 104  direct lytic infection could result in demyelination in contrast virtually all types of immune responses have been proposed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of demyelination and in virus clearance one possibility is that the demyelination is caused by a similar immune-mediated mechanism to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis eae another animal model of ms in which cd4  th1 cells mediate a delayed- 52  tmev-induced cd8  t cells have been suggested to function as autoreactive cytotoxic cells or regulator cells 73 85  antibody against tmev cross-reacts with galactocerebroside and passive transfer of anti-tmev antibody can augment demyelination in eae 100  intracerebral inoculation with a tmev-infected macrophage cell line induces acute focal demyelination 89 and depletion of macrophage ameliorates tmev-induced demyelination 61 71  apoptosis is involved in the pathogenesis caused by a variety of viruses such as poliovirus and influenza virus 4 25 54 55  accumulating evidence has suggested that apoptosis may serve the innate host defense mechanism against intracellular pathogens thereby curtailing their further spread to surrounding tissues on the other hand because of the post-mitotic nature of neurons apoptotic neuronal death would result in permanent loss of cerebral functions precipitating disease in addition apoptosis of the oligodendrocyte can lead to demyelination oligodendroglial apoptosis has been demonstrated in several demyelinating diseases including ms 44 57 96  eae 62 87 and the twitcher mouse a murine model of globoid cell leukodystrophy 83  during the acute stage of both da to subgroup and gdvii virus infection both infected and uninfected neurons have been demonstrated to die by apoptosis using terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dutp-biotin nick-end labeling tunel 91  the number of apoptotic neurons is much greater in gdvii virus-infected mice than in da virus infection although elimination of virus-infected host cells by apoptosis prior to the assembly of infectious virus could inhibit viral replication the absence of an inflammatory reaction 4  another feature of apoptosis may favor viral spread in gdvii virus infection leading to fatal encephalomyelitis during the chronic phase of da virus infection tunel-positive nuclei were co-labeled with oligodendrocyte and macrophagemicroglia markers but not with viral antigen or the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap 74 91  while tunel-positive cells were co-labeled with gfap in bean virus to subgroup infection 60  interestingly oligodendrocyte apoptosis is detected in the white matter as early as 1 week after infection either in gdvii or da virus infection fig 3d  in vitro tmev infection results in apoptosis of neurons in explant cultures of the murine cerebellum 6  neuroblastoma cell line 91  macrophage cell lines 27 35  and microglia 104  but not of astrocytes 104  axonal transport of tmev tmev shifts from infection of gray matter in the brain during the acute phase to white matter in the spinal cord during the chronic phase although the mechanism of the transition is unknown one hypothesis is that the virus first spreads from the neuronal cell body of the gray matter to axons in the white matter by axonal transport and then infects neighboring cells such as oligodendrocytes and microglia tmev has been demonstrated to use axonal transport in vivo viral antigens have been detected in axons dendrites and the neuronal cell body by immunohistochemistry fig 2b  wada and fujinami 97 showed that the limbic system is important for the spread of tmev in the brain using footpad inoculation of mice with the gdvii virus martinat et al 47 showed that gdvii virus infection in the spinal cord was prevented by sectioning the sciatic nerve and was delayed by treatment with colchicine which inhibits fast axonal transport since viral rna was first detected in the spinal cord 2 days after footpad inoculation the authors estimated the rate of transport in the sciatic nerve at approximately 20 mmday which is consistent with fast axonal transport although an early ultrastructural study by dal canto and lipton 17 demonstrated primary demyelination myelin destruction with intact axons in sjlj mice infected with da virus they also reported a few dystrophic axons occasionally detected on days 100 and 214 post infection in this study it was not shown whether axonal injury was accompanied by mononuclear cell mnc infiltration or demyelination recently axonal damage during the late chronic phase of tmev infection has been studied by moses rodriguezs group in sjlj mice infected for 6-9 months with da virus reviewed in 95  using plastic-embedded 1-m sections mcgavern et al 50 51 demonstrated spinal cord atrophy in the anterior and lateral columns but not in the posterior column a significant reduction in spinal cord areas was observed at 195-220 days after infection in which a 25 reduction in the anterior and lateral columns was detected compared with the 12 area reduction seen at 45 and 92-100 days post infection a significant decrease in medium to large myelinated axon fibers was also detected in normally myelinated areas on days 195-220 neurological deficit correlated with demyelination spinal cord atrophy and axonal loss in the nawm axonal loss was examined in regions with minimal pathology because automated calculation of axonal area frequencies was not possible in regions with demyelination or other extensive pathology 51  since resistant c57bl10 mice infected for 195 days showed no spinal cord atrophy compared with uninfected sjlj mouse spinal cord the authors suggested that the atrophy was the result of a chronic demyelinating disease but not the result of neuronal infection during the acute phase which is seen in both resistant and susceptible mice analyzing a single demyelinated spinal cord lesion ultrastructurally the same group showed results similar to the previous studies 76  they also found increased intra-axonal mitochondria which can be an indicator of axonal injury in normally myelinated remyelinated and demyelinated axons in addition ure and rodriguez 94 demonstrated that retrograde fluoro-gold labeling from t11t12 of rubrospinal reticulospinalraphespinal and vestibulospinal neurons was reduced in mice 9 months but not 1 month after da virus infection they suggested that the majority of neurons in descending populations had lost their normal connectivity to t11t12 which was either due to axon or neuron degeneration or to functional impairment of retrograde axonal transport in this study it is unknown whether da virus infects these neurons during the acute phase the precise mechanism of axonal damage during the late chronic phase of tmev infection is not clear rivera-quinones et al 67 have suggested a role for major histocompatibility complex mhc class i-restricted cd8  t cells in the development of axonal injury since axons were relatively preserved in class i-deficient mice compared to susceptible sjlj mice signifying a role for immune-mediated pathology although axonal damage has been demonstrated in both ms and tmev infection it has been interpreted to be solely secondary to myelin destruction recently however we demonstrated that the axonal injury heralds demyelination in tmev infection 90  using nonphosphorylated nf immunostaining we found obvious axonal injury in the white matter of the spinal cord of da virus-infected mice 2 weeks post infection approximately 2 weeks earlier than the onset of demyelination the number and distribution of damaged axons correlated with that of microgliamacrophages but not that of viral antigen during this subclinical phase prior to the onset of clinical signs and demyelination axonal injury was seen in regions where subsequent demyelination usually occurs such as the ventral root exit zone 87  similarly axonal damage was rarely seen in the posterior column where demyelination is not usually observed 92  in gdvii virus infection severe axonal damage was observed in nawm within 1 week post infection fig 3bd  the distribution of damaged axons in the white matter did not correlate with the presence of t cells or viral antigens which was mainly present in the gray matter this suggests that neither t cells nor direct virus attack on axons is necessary for the induction of axonal injury axonal damage was also detected without myelin damage in vitro in myelinated mouse cerebellar explant cultures infected with da variant ds 6  we do not know whether the axonal damage in this early phase of tmev infection is permanent or reversible functional axonal damage would not necessarily be followed by fragmentation and degeneration an et al 5 found accumulation of app in the cns of hiv-positive individuals without aids they suggested that this axonal damage might be reversible and the axonal flow re-established and the accumulation of app could disappear it appears that hiv dementia can partially be reversed and brain metabolic changes visible on mrs in aids patients disappear after retroviral treatment 28  during the preclinical stage of tmev infection axonal injury and oligodendrocyte apoptosis with microglia activation can be seen only after special staining techniques in otherwise nawm unexpectedly this situation parallels in some aspects the pathological changes observed in sci the initial mechanical tissue disruption of sci is followed by a period of secondary injury that increases the size of the lesion this includes chronic demyelination of fiber tracts away from the injury 9 10  during the acute stage a central region of hemorrhagic necrosis characterizes the lesion later time periods however are characterized by the apoptosis of a substantial number of oligodendrocytes which occurs along the fiber tracts undergoing wallerian degeneration extending into regions far remote from the lesion 1 15 fig 4  the oligodendrocyte death seems to be associated with axonal degeneration induced by the injury the later stage lasts for a surprisingly long time at least 3 weeks 98  since apoptotic oligodendrocytes are sometimes directly apposed by activated microglia the oligodendrocyte apoptosis may be due to toxic factors from the microglia such as tumor necrosis factor tnf- however it is not known whether oligodendrocyte death or microglial activation comes first microglia can also show condensed and fragmented nuclei that are positive for tunel 79  some of these profiles might represent microglia that have phagocytosed apoptotic bodies from other cells or apoptosis of microglia resulting in controlling microglial number tunelpositive microgliamacrophages are also detected in tmev infection 91  inside-out versus outside-in models for virus induced demyelination 117 fig 4  axonal injury and delayed oligodendrocyte apoptosis in sci sci induces axonal degeneration at the distal part of the spinal cord from the transection site along the fiber tracts undergoing wallerian degeneration microglial activation and oligodendrocyte apoptosis can be detected even in the regions far remote from the transection site oligodendrocyte apoptosis can lead to demyelination of not only transected axons but also intact axons since a single oligodendrocyte myelinates multiple axons in the latter case demyelinated axons can appear as typical primary demyelination morphologically in areas where ascending and descending fiber tracts are intermixed both tracts may undergo demyelination if apoptosis occurs in individual oligodendrocytes that ensheath multiple axons in both groups sci spinal cord injury the mechanism of oligodendrocyte apoptosis is unclear and still controversial saito et al 75 showed the expression of apoptosis-related molecules p53 p21 bcl-2 and bax as early as 30 min after experimental sci another hypothesis for the oligodendrocyte death is glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in an in vitro model of isolated rat dorsal column compression li et al 41 demonstrated a toxic efflux of glutamate through the reversal of na  -dependent glutamate transport most likely occurring from axons they also showed that myelin damage was prevented by glutamate receptor blockade or glutamate transport inhibitors suggesting that glutamate spillover from the lesion can damage oligodendrocytes 41  oligodendrocytes are known to be vulnerable to excitotoxic signals mediated by glutamate receptors ampa and kainite 49  the apoptosis of oligodendrocytes could lead to demyelination of not only damaged axons but also intact axons since a single oligodendrocyte myelinates multiple axons indeed demyelinating axons that appear ultrastructurally intact are present after sci this is the typical neuropathology of primary demyelination but not of myelin damage secondary to axonal trauma 63  an alternative mechanism for oligodendrocyte apoptosis in sci is that the oligodendrocyte may respond to loss of trophic elements from axons as axons undergo degeneration clinical and experimental evidence support the hypothesis that a failure of cell communication between the axon and oligodendrocyte is involved in axonal or oligodendroglial pathology 3  in the pns demyelination in uremic neuropathy and friedreich ataxia may well be axonally induced 20  similar cellular events occur in experimental permanent axotomy in cats where nerves proximal to the permanent axotomy sequentially undergo axonal atrophy and myelin wrinkling this is followed by secondary segmental demyelination and finally myelin ovoid and ball formation 20  the survival of the oligodendrocyte depends on the presence of axons at least during development 8  apoptosis of oligodendrocytes occurs selectively in transected neonatal optic nerves in which the axons degenerate 65  the cell death does not occur in optic nerves from c57blwld mice wallerian degeneration slow mutant mice formerly known as c57blola 65  which show prolonged survival of the distal stumps of transected axons this prevents the normal influx of monocytes into transected nerves in both the cns and pns purified neurons but not neuron-conditioned culture medium promote the survival of purified oligodendrocytes in vitro 65  therefore the axonal signal that regulates oligodendrocyte survival is contact mediated this supports the hypothesis that there is competition for axon-dependent survival signals by oligodendrocytes that normally helps adjust the number of oligodendrocytes to the number of axons that require myelination conversely griffiths et al 30 suggested that myelinated axons could require local oligodendrocyte support although myelin proteolipid proteins plp and its dm20 isoform are the major membrane proteins of cns myelin the plp gene knockout mice develop normally and assemble compacted myelin with morphologically normal oligodendrocytes unexpectedly the mice develop widespread axonal swellings and degeneration associated with predominantly small-caliber nerve fibers the authors hypothesized that glial ensheathment provides a necessary signal that induces the axonal dependency on glial support 30  mutations of the plp gene cause the dysmyelinating diseases pelizaeus-merzbacher disease and spastic paraplegia type-2 in 118 i tsunoda rs fujinami man 77 102  in tmev infection a decrease in plp mrna expression not only in infected but also uninfected oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord has been reported 58 59 70 101  oligodendrocytes have also been suggested to play a role in maintaining normal axons during development 11  demyelination develops from outside to inside or from inside to outside if the initial step of demyelination is either the loss of contact between the axon and the oligodendrocyte or cell-to-cell transmission of virus from the axon to the oligodendrocyte lesions are most likely to be seen first in the innermost part of myelin the inner loop however oligodendrocyte damage can also result in degeneration in the most distal part as suggested by a dying-back process in the demyelinating disease induced by cuprizone oligodendrocytes can undergo a dying-back process with degeneration starting in the most distal part the inner loop of the oligodendrocyte cell processes this eventually progresses proximally to involve the perikaryon with resulting demyelination dying-back oligodendrogliopathy 45  rodriguez 68 demonstrated a similar ultrastructural disease picture during the early stages of da virus infection 11 28 45 days after infection prior to the degeneration of the myelin sheaths although ultrastructural abnormalities were seen in the inner oligodendroglial loops viral antigen was expressed in both the inner and outer loops 69  using electron microscopy rodriguez et al 72 found a widening of the inner myelin lamellae and degeneration of the inner glial loops in biopsy brain specimens from clinically definite ms patients the presence of early degeneration in the inner myelin sheaths and in the glial loops of oligodendrocytes was noted in most biopsy specimens such changes were not described in biopsy cases of ms by others 82  kirk 36 also demonstrated vesicular degeneration most frequently in the inner myelin sheaths in a single case of sp-ms a similar observation was made in myelinassociated glycoprotein mag-deficient mice 40  in ms lesions loss of immunoreactivity against mag is seen in nawm 33  since mag is localized in periaxonal regions of the myelinated fiber this finding also supports the hypothesis that the damage in the inner loops precedes that of myelin or oligodendrocytes in contrast dal canto and lipton 17 suggested that demyelination in tmev infection develops from the outside to inside demonstrating vesicular disruption at not only the inner but also the outer border of myelin sheaths due to stripping of myelin by invading mnc as seen in eae 39  in support of this dal canto and barbano 16 found preferential disappearance of myelin basic protein mbp compared to mag the disappearance of mag never preceded that of mbp in demyelinating lesions a uniform widening of the myelin lamellae beginning with the outer layer has been observed in some but not all 86  immune-mediated demyelinating diseases of the pns and cns including paraproteinemic neuropathy 64 and eae 39  respectively therefore in tmev infection there is an apparent paradox does lesion development progress from the inside to the outside or from the outside to the inside we have reviewed the evidence that axonal injury can lead to demyelination where the lesion develops from the inside to the outside a model for lesion development in inside-out versus outside-in models for virus induced demyelination tmev infection with this inside-out model is presented in fig 5  tmev infects neurons in the gray matter of the brain and induces degeneration in their processes the axons in descending tracts that run mainly in the anterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord here induction of axonal degeneration can be protective to the host since this will prevent virus from spreading axonally tmev is transported axonally which may result in axonal damage axonal transport could also lead to direct cell-tocell infection at the inner loop of myelin that attaches to the axon tmev can further spread centripetally from a distally infected site to the oligodendrocyte body since a single oligodendrocyte myelinates multiple axons tmev will spread centrifugally at 120 i tsunoda rs fujinami inside-out and outside-in models in tmev infection the lesion first develops from the inside to the outside tmev infects neurons in the gray matter of the brain and is transported axonally leading to axonal injury in the white matter of the spinal cord virus further infects the inner loop of the myelin and spreads centripetally to the oligodendrocyte cell body from which it spreads centrifugally to multiple myelin sheaths resulting in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination axonal injury disrupts cross-talk between the axon and the oligodendrocyte and induces microglia activation contributing to oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination activated microgliamacrophages phagocytose damaged andor infected axons myelin and oligodendrocytes and present viral and neuroantigens at this time point the lesion develops from the outside to the inside autoimmune and anti-viral immune responses attack myelin specifically or in a bystander fashion causing primary demyelination severe inflammatory reactions further damage axons secondarily which results in wallerian degeneration in the distal part of the axonal transection sites this secondary axonal injury triggers the second cascade reaction of demyelination forming a vicious cycle this stage from the oligodendrocyte cell body to its distal processes then to myelin sheaths and eventually to axons again fascicular oligodendrocytes are located close to each other and this will also contribute to spread from one oligodendrocyte to the other infected oligodendrocytes and myelin will be phagocytosed by microgliamacrophages resulting in demyelination and persistent infection in andor viral antigen presentation by microgliamacrophages on the other hand axonal degeneration itself induces oligodendrocyte apoptosis either by activation of microglia or the loss of support from axons in most areas of white matter in the lateral and anterior columns ascending and descending fiber tracts are not discrete bundles but are intermixed or overlapped so that individual oligodendrocytes ensheath axons in both groups if either the ascending or descending fiber tracts degenerate to the extent where an oligodendrocyte undergoes apoptosis from loss of trophic support axons that survived the initial injury may undergo demyelination activated microglia will release toxic cytokines such as tnf and this too will enhance demyelination at this time point lesions can develop from the outside-in table 1  although the original lesion developed from the inside-out activated microgliamacrophages phagocytose degenerated oligodendrocytes myelin and axons whether they are infected with tmev or not then microglia can produce chemokines and up-regulate adhesion molecules in the cns leading to recruitment of t cells t cells will recognize neuroantigens or viral antigens presented by the activated microgliamacrophages this will lead to a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to virus or induction of anti-myelin autoimmunity via antigen spreading cns tissue damage could also result in the release of neuroantigens into the systemic circulation that would also contribute to further induction of autoimmune t cell and b cell responses these autoimmune t cells and autoantibodies might attack myelin from the outside-in therefore the inside-out and outside-in models are not mutually exclusive and may act in synergy in this review we proposed a new model for the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases inside-out model in which lesions develop from the inside to the outside primary axonal injury triggers demyelination that leads to immunopathology if virus is transported by the axons this will lead to infection in neighboring cells including oligodendrocytes and macrophages contributing to lesion development after initial destruction virus antigen and neuroantigen will be released and presented by cns antigen presenting cells resulting in the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses and autoimmunity at this time point the myelin is attacked from the outside leading to secondary axonal injury outside-in model thus the inside-out and outside-in models can collaborate in a vicious cycle or initiate a cascade of events therapeutic strategies targeting each step including axonal injury inflammation and demyelination in these models will be important to prevent disease progression particularly in primary and secondary progressive

information 1 9 1620 2750 fig 191 isolation regimens should not prevent treatment but be included in the diagnosis and treatment nb good hand hygiene is important it prevents the spread of infection  ultrastructure of human nasal epithelium during an episode of coronavirus infection bj6rn afzelius a  the nasal epithelium from a young girl was examined by electron microscopy and found to be infected by coronavirus virions are seen within and outside the ciliated cells but not outside or within the goblet cells or other cells of the nasal mucosa some virions are located near the microvilli others in pockets in the apical cell membrane the cytoplasm contains many small vesicles with a single virion large apical vesicles containing hundreds of virions and lysosome-like cytosomes with a moderate number of virions some viruslike particles devoid of an electron-dense interior are seen both in the cytosomes and extracellularly virus budding was observed in the golgi apparatus but nowhere else in the cell the ciliated cells seem not to be destroyed by the viruses although in many cases the cilia are withdrawn into the cell body the loss of cilia is likely to cause rhinorrhoea  coronaviruses are considered to account for about 10 of all cases of common cold gwaltney 1985 mclntosh et al 1974 stott and garwes 1990  yet their distribution in the ciliated epithelium and their multiplication there has not been studied either in an in vitro system or in situ the same is true of ciliated epithelia infected with viruses of other kinds although human nasal and bronchial epithelium have been studied electron microscopically during episodes of common cold carson et al 1985 giorgi et al 1992 rautiainen et al 1992 winther et al 1984  or other viral infections cornille et al 1984 konradova et al 1982  the viruses within the epithelial cells causing the infections seem to have eluded the investigators certain changes in the infected ciliated nasal epithelium have been reported such as a detachment of ciliated cells from the epithelium ramphal et al 1979 turner et al 1982 winther et al 1984  or a loss of cilia from the ciliated cells rautiainen et al 1992  but the mechanisms by which the viruses cause these effects remain unknown replicating coronaviruses have been studied in some cell cultures such as human fetal diploid lung cells oshiro et al 1971  human wi-38 cells hamre et al 1967  canine kidney cells takeuchi et al 1976  feline kidney cells everman et al 1989  feline embryonic lung cells beesley and hitchcock 1982  and chick kidney cells chasey and alexander 1976  these cells are non-ciliated virions are recorded in several components within these cells endoplasmic reticulum perinuclear cisterna golgi apparatus lysosomes and cytoplasmic vesicles budding viruses have been found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum intruding into its cisternae during the last 15 years i have examined the nasal or bronchial epithelium from several hundred persons with respiratory tract disease suspected to suffer from the immotile-cilia syndrome afzelius 1979  in a single case the biopsy contained a multitude of virus-infected cells the viruses have the morphological characteristics ofcoronavirus and were seen at several sites in the ciliated cells the infection has apparently caused a loss of most of the cilia from the ciliated cells a 25-year-old girl was examined because of her chronic rhinitis and bronchitis the girl showed no signs of common cold at the time of the biopsy nor according to the mother on the days following the biopsy a brush biopsy rutland and cole 1980 was taken from concha inferior of the nose and immediately immersed in a fixative consisting of 25 glutaraldehyde in 01 m cacodylate buffer ph 70 fixation time in this case was 9 days followed by post-fixation in 1 osmium tetroxide in the same buffer after a brief rinse the sample was dehydrated in ethanol embedded in an epoxy resin agar 100 agar scientific cambridge england sectioned and section stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate sections were examined with a jeol 100 s electron microscope no second biopsy was taken as it was considered to be of no benefit to the patient the nasal epithelium in the examined brush biopsy contained a mixture of ciliated cells and mucus-producing cells in about the same ratio as is found in healthy persons it is impossible to decide from a brush biopsy whether some ciliated cells have detached from the epithelium as a consequence of the infection since all brush biopsies will show cell fragments and isolated cells in addition to a morphologically intact epithelium however ciliated cells remained in the epithelium at the time of biopsy in a number that seemed normal some ciliated cells were devoid of virions others contained a few virions and still others contained hundreds or thousands of them in all blocks studied from this subject a heavily infested cell could be seen side by side with one that had few virions or none goblet cells were always free from virions and none were seen in the mucus outside the mucus cells the basal cells underlying goblet cells and ciliated cells were also devoid of virions as were leucocytes mast cells and other migrating cells the virus thus showed a considerable cell specificity in its association virions were seen at the following sites in the ciliated cell or at its surface some virions adhered to the microvilli or to the apical cell membrane between microvilli and cilia fig l  a number of virions can be seen in pockets in the plasma membrane these pockets may penetrate deeply into the cell body and contain a row of virions fig 2  the apical cytoplasm of some cells had large vesicles that contained a great number of virions no virions were seen in the rough surfaced endoplasmic reticulum or in the perinuclear cisterna or in the nucleus or mitochondria all infected cells also contained vesicles with a diameter of 01-02 gin each with a single or a few virions that were embedded in a matrix of medium high electron density fig 3  an alternative and less likely interpretation of these images is that the vesicles in reality represent cross-sections of deep winding invaginations of the cell surface and that the virions hence lie in invaginated portions of the extracellular fluid most vesicles were seen in the apical cytoplasm but some were seen in deeper parts of the cell in particular in and near the golgi apparatus some cells fig 4 contained a further virion-containing structure characterized by the following features large size 1-4 gm a superficial location in the cell a great number of contained virions a matrix of such a low electron density that the club-shaped surface projections of the coronaviruses are clearly visible fig 5  the structures will here be called apical vesi-cles in a longitudinal section through the cell there may be four or more apical vesicles each virion contained electron-dense material 70-80 nm in diameter and was surrounded by a triple-layered membrane the surface projections peplomers are 20 nm long the golgi zone is the second zone of the cell that contained many virions it was located just apical to the nucleus and at a depth of about 20-30 gm from the free cell surface most golgi cisternae in the infected cells had lateral bulbs with one or a few virions fig 6  it is only at this location where budding viruses were seen a membrane of the golgi vacuole then made an invagination and dense material could be seen to be accumulated at the membrane fig 7  occasionally an electrondense thread-like material could be seen in the vicinity of such a budding virion possibly it is nucleocapsid material fig 7  cytosomes with a content of viruses or virus-like particles could also be found in the cytoplasm mainly in the apical half of the cell fig 8  some particles were compact whereas others appeared to be empty these cytosomes may represent lysosomes with virions in varying degrees of degradation particles of the same empty type could also be seen in some apical vesicles  fig 9 or extracellularly along the microvilli of the ciliated cell arrows in fig 4  although a single cell may contain thousands of virions mainly in the apical vesicles there were no signs of the infected cell being moribund or dead organelles and cytoskeleton rather gave the impression of a cell with intact synthetic activity however some degenerative changes could be seen which affect the cilia in some cells a single axoneme had migrated into the cell body whereas the neighbouring cilia remained at the cell surface fig 10  in other cells all axonemes were relocated to sites within the cell body fig 11  whereas in still other cells the ciliary basal bodies had migrated into the cell and had lost the axonemes fig 12  the apical surface of such cells had microvilli but only few free cilia mucus vacuoles could sometimes be seen in the apical cyto- plasm of these cells they could however be distinguished from the goblet cells both by their lacking glycocalyceal bodies in the glycocalyx afzelius 1984 and their content of some basal bodies and also of virions which were never seen in the goblet cells the electron micrographs do not permit a rigorous reconstruction of the sequence of events during infections of the nasal epithelium with a coronavirus infected cells were a chance finding rather than the result of a planned experiment or of a study with several consecutive biopsies taken at different stages of an infection it was thus not possible to use the present material for an immuno-electron microscopical study which presumably would have given more detailed data on the route of the infecting virus particles and their multiplication in studies where the ultrastructural effects of common cold viruses have been examined no virions have been seen in mucosal cells and isolated virions only have been reported from extracellular sites carson et al 1985 dourmashkin and tyrrell 1970  on the other hand many virions are seen in nasal washings of patients during naturally acquired colds larson et al 1980 mclntosh et al 1967  i have also attempted to locate virions in the nasal mucosa from some patients during episodes of a common cold but been unable to find any the reason for these negative results is unknown the number of virions in the mucosa may be small or their presence of short duration in contrast several studies have been published of coronavirus-infected cells in in vitro systems beesley and hitchcock 1982 chasey and alexander 1976 david-ferreira and manaker 1965 everman et al 1989 hamre et al 1967 mcintosh et al 1967  os- et al 1971  or in an in vivo system takeuchi et al 1976  although none to my knowledge on a ciliated epithelium in the present study cells at different stages -or different degrees of severity -of virus infection have been seen a possible sequence of events is as follows coronaviruses contact the microvilli of the ciliated cell and enter it in apical membrane invaginations from there they are taken up in small vesicles and transported to the golgi apparatus where virus multiplication takes place they are then transported back to the apical cytoplasm and are stored there in the large apical vesicles before release into the nasal lumen the formation of the apical vesicles causes the basal bodies to be displaced from the cell surface and to retract into the cell as a consequence thereof the cells become deciliated and the patient will experience rhinorrhoea alternatively the invading virions are degraded and uncoated in the large apical vesicles before being transported to the golgi apparatus this scheme of virus replication differs somewhat from that seen in studies of cell cultures coronavirusinfected cells are reported to contain virions in the perinuclear cisterna and in the endoplasmic reticulum where they also replicate becket et al 1967 beesley and hitchcock 1982 chasey and alexander 1976 hamre et al 1967 takeuchi et al 1976  these compartments were free from virions in the present case and budding was seen only in the golgi apparatus it has also been suspected that a virion notably a myxovirus in some way might exploit the sweeping action of a cilium in order to enter the cell dourmashkin and tyrrel11970  the hong-kong virus a rhabdovirus is also claimed to adsorb to cilia although not to enter the cells in chicken embryo tracheal culture blaskovic et al 1972  the images obtained in the present case rather indicate the microvilli to be the site of a first contact and the apical cell membrane to be the site of viropexia in some previous studies of cells infected by coronavirus a condensed tubular network oshiro et al 1971  or a reticular inclusion david-ferreira and manaker 1965 has been described and suspected to represent an accumulation of virus precursors such tubular aggregates have not been seen in the present case although occasionally a small coil of electron dense material is seen near the budding virus in the golgi apparatus in conclusion the coronavirus of the examined patient displayed a strict cell specificity and the virions upon entering the cell were restricted to a few cell compartments only the virions seem not to have damaged the ciliated epithelium unduly except for a partial deciliation of some cells  advances in the relationship between coronavirus infection and cardiovascular diseases mengmeng zhao menglong wang jishou zhang jing ye yao xu zhen wang di ye jianfang liu jun wan   at the end of 2019 a number of patients with fever and clinical pneumonia of unknown origin were found in wuhan hubei china 1 through virus isolation gene detection and the analysis of protein structure in the laboratories the disease was identified as 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by a new kind of coronavirus researchers have found that this new coronavirus belongs to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 2 3 4 this novel coronavirus is currently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on february 12 2020 the world health organization who announced that the disease caused by sars-cov-2 was officially named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 covid-19 is another serious infectious disease caused by coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2015 sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans 1 since january 2020 covid-19 has rapidly spread throughout china causing serious harm to human health up to april 27 2020 at least 2878196 patients have been confirmed to have covid-19 all over the world of whom 198668 have died 5 the who characterized covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 after it announced that covid-19 in china was a public health emergency of international concern pheic on january 31 2020 67 due to the severe outbreak of covid-19 and its wide-ranging scope strict prevention and control strategies should be implemented in the affected countries and the treatment of infected individuals should receive more attention as reported by the china centers for disease control and prevention approximately 128 of patients with covid-19 have hypertension and 4 of patients have cardiovascular disease cvd the mortality rate of patients with cardiovascular disease is much higher than that of patients without comorbidities 8 growing evidence suggests that combined cardiovascular disease may increase the severity of coronavirus infection and lead to a poor prognosis 9 10 11 12 13 at the same time there is also evidence suggesting that serum levels of cardiac necrosis biomarkers have increased to varying degrees in both mild and severe covid-19 patients suggesting different degrees of myocardial damage 9 10 11 12 13 14 moreover the study found that the markers of myocardial necrosis in severe and deceased covid-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild covid-19 patients suggesting that cardiac damage may be related to poor prognosis 9101213 existing evidence suggests that covid-19 is closely related to cardiovascular disease but the specific interaction between the two is unclear this paper describes the relationship between coronavirus and cardiovascular diseases through a review of the literature and datasets about sars mers and other diseases caused by the human coronavirus hoping to provide some assistance for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 coronaviruses covs are the largest group of viruses belonging to the nidovirales order which includes the coronaviridae arteriviridae and roniviridae families covs are further subdivided into four groups the    and  covs 15 the newly discovered sars-cov-2 belongs to the -covs 2 all covs are enveloped nonsegmented positive-sense rna viruses 15 the most significant feature of covs is the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion therefore cov look like a tiny corona as depicted in studies by cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy prompting the name coronavirus 16 17 18 cov is a respiratory virus that exists widely in nature its natural hosts include humans and other mammals such as pigs dogs cats mice and bats 19 at present seven human coronaviruses hcovs have been discovered in which hcov-229e 20 hcov-nl63 2122 hcov-oc43 23 24 25 hcov-hku1 26 sars-cov 27 28 29 30 and mers-cov 3132 are included in addition to sars-cov-2 recently isolated from the respiratory tracts of patients with covid-19 in wuhan 2 3 4 hcovs mainly cause respiratory infections of which four endemic hcovs hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 mainly cause mild respiratory infections and the other three epidemic hcovs sars-cov mers-cov sars-cov-2 can cause acute severe pneumonia 1933 coronaviruses originally discovered as hcov-229e are the cause of respiratory infections in children and adults but they are not particularly dangerous patients respiratory symptoms are mild similar to those of the common cold 34 most clinically significant coronavirus infections occur in children under two years of age although adults can also be severely infected 3536 mortality is negligible 37 however sars-cov and mers-cov which have appeared since 2003 are highly contagious and cause a high incidence and mortality rate of pneumonia 3337 38 39 in addition to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is another human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia 1 the researchers compared the sequence of sars-cov-2 from wuhan with that of sars-cov and mers-cov through genetic testing and found that the gene sequence of sars-cov-2 is almost identical with a homology to mers of approximately 40 and a higher degree of homology to sars of approximately 70 40 the differences between the sequences are mainly in the orf1a gene and the spike gene encoding s-protein which is the key protein for the interaction between coronavirus and host cells 40 the coronavirus spike protein is a multifunctional molecular machine that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells it first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface through its s1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its s2 subunit 4142 some cellular receptors of human coronavirus have been identified including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 404344 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 45and aminopeptidase n apn 46 coronavirus enters the human body through receptors on the surface of host cells multiplies in the body and causes inflammation in the body and diseases such as pneumonia similar to sars-cov ace2 was found to be a receptor for sars-cov-2 434748 ace2 is also an important member of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas it catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin ii ang ii to angiotensin 1-7 activates downstream mas receptors and finally exerts anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects 49 in addition ace2 can also decompose ang ii into angiotensin 1-9 angiotensin 1-9 not only can be catalyzed by ace and further decompose into angiotensin 1-7 but also can directly activate ang  type 2 receptor at2r exerting its anti-inflammatory and anti-angiotensin  type 1 receptor at1r effects 50 ace2 is primarily expressed in the heart kidneys and testes and it is widely distributed in human alveolar epithelial cells small intestinal epithelial cells arterial smooth muscle and endothelial cells and vein endothelial cells 5152 in the heart ace2 is expressed in the endothelium 51 and cardiomyocytes 53 increasing evidence suggests that ace2 enzyme activity has a protective role in cardiovascular disease the loss of ace2 can be harmful because it may lead to worsened heart function and the progression of heart and vascular disease 4954 virus-induced ace2 down regulation may attenuate its function diminish its anti-inflammatory role and heightened angiotensin ii effects in the predisposed patients 55 the tissue localization of the receptors correlates with covid-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction in the lung ace2 is expressed in type i and type ii alveolar epithelial cells in addition 83 of type ii alveolar cells express ace2 56 the combination of sars-cov-2 with ace2 results in increased expression of ace2 which can lead to alveolar cell damage in turn triggering a series of whole-body reactions and even death 48 wrapp et al 18 found that the receptor-binding ability of sars-cov-2 is 10-20 times stronger than that of sars-cov providing a laboratory basis to prove that sars-cov-2 is more infectious than sars-cov 3 there is evidence showing that ace2 levels are higher in men than in women 48 however the male-to-female ratio of ncp-confirmed cases is 0991 in wuhan 1041 in hubei province and 1061 in china 8 meaning that there are few differences in prevalence between men and women however the crude case fatality rate for men 28 is slightly higher than that for women 17 8 however the relationship between ace2 expression level and sars-cov-2 infection rate and mortality remains unclear raas inhibitors including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor acei and angiotensin receptor blocker arb drugs are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension heart failure and myocardial inflammation they can control the level of ang ii in the body slow down the deterioration of inflammation and improve patient survival aceis and arbs can also exert their protective effects by activating the ace2angiotensin 1-7mas axis which may lead to increased ace2 in patients 5758 increased ace2 expression levels may lead to an increased risk of infection however there are no reports indicating that patients using aceisarbs are more likely to become infected whether acei  arb can be widely used in covid-19 patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease was unclear or even controversial 59 but recently guo et al reported that although more patients with higher troponin t tnt were using acei and arb medications owing to their baseline cvd their use was not associated with patients mortality rate 60 a research published in circulation research by zhang et al showed that among hospitalized covid-19 patients with hypertension inpatient use of acei  arb was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with acei  arb non-users 61 we can see that in-hospital use of acei  arb was not associated with an increased mortality risk there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei  arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicine hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 35 were discovered in the 1960s and hcov-nl63 22 and hcov-hku1 26 were later discovered in upper respiratory tract infections asthma bronchiolitis and pneumonia there is evidence showing that infant elderly and immunocompromised patients are more likely to be infected with high mortality rates 3762 63 64 these infected patients are more likely develop severe disease states 65 66 67 68 varghese et al 37 retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 261 children with hcov infection including 229e hku1 nl63 oc43 and found that approximately 165 of the children had cardiovascular disease hcov-infected children with cardiovascular disease are more likely to receive respiratory support and enter a pediatric intensive care unit picu suggesting that the underlying cardiovascular disease increased the severity of hcov infection in the children cabea et al found that children with heart disease are more likely to be infected by hcovs 69 the presence of congenital heart disease was a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus infection in children who were less than five years old 70 table 1
 hypotension was found in a small number of patients with these four hcov infections 70 table 2
 there is no relevant evidence showing that hcov infection can cause heart injury however kim et al reported that hcovs were detected in children with kawasaki disease which is characterized by acute systemic vasculitis in childhood and may induce severe cardiovascular complications 71 serological tests suggest that hcov-229e may be involved in the occurrence of kawasaki disease 72 therefore we still need to pay attention to cardiovascular complications when facing these four kinds of hcov infection the severe acute respiratory syndrome 27 that broke out globally in 2003 is different from the human coronavirus described previously it is a severe acute respiratory infection with clinical manifestations of fever and dry cough with the lungs as the main locations of lesions some patients quickly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure with high mortality 73 74 75 76 77 there is much relevant evidence showing that pre-existing comorbid conditions are one of the major determinants of fatality 7678 79 80 81 82 83 it has been reported that the presence of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart disease is associated with adverse outcomes and mortality in sars patients 84 85 86 87 wong et al reviewed the medical records of fatal cases and found that 60 of the patients who died had comorbid conditions such as hypertension and coronary artery disease 88 chen et al found that patients with combined hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases are more likely to develop ards 89 another study by hu et al showed that the incidence rates of critical conditions and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome  mods  among sars patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were 18-fold and 19-fold higher than those of patients without underlying disease suggesting that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are major risk factors for sars patients to devolve into critical conditions and mods and eventually lead to death 90 table 1 regarding the cardiovascular complications of sars patients it was found that sars patients had subclinical diastolic impairment without contraction involvement and this damage may be reversible upon clinical recovery 91 another study by yu et al found that cardiovascular complications including hypotension and tachycardia are common in sars patients but are usually self-limiting bradycardia and cardiac hypertrophy were less common and arrhythmias were rare 92 acute myocardial infarction can also be seen in a few sars patients 93 sars-cov was reported to be found in 40 718 patients of heart samples from patients who died of sars during the toronto outbreak 76 which might explain the myocardial damage discovered in sars patients 89 there are reports indicating that sars-cov also attacks small blood vessels throughout the body causing systemic vasculitis 94 table 2 in addition to clinical studies laboratory studies were performed to look for the pathophysiological mechanism associated with myocardial dysfunction caused by sars-cov infection 95 96 97 98 99 it was reported that pulmonary infection with sars-cov in mice led to a myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression which may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars 99 mers is a severe respiratory infectious disease caused by mers-cov that was first reported in saudi arabia in september 2012 29 the symptoms are similar to those of sars and severe cases can manifest as pneumonia with ards and other severe life-threatening complications such as septic shock acute myocarditis and multiple organ failure 100 101 102 103 104 105 the mortality rate of mers is 355 which is much higher than that of sars 10 39 it has been reported that people with underlying diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular disease renal failure obesity and immune deficiency are more likely to develop severe diseases after being infected with mers-cov 105106 badawi et al found that 50 of mers patients have diabetes and hypertension and that approximately 30 of patients have heart disease 107 they believed that these underlying disease conditions inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines damage the hosts natural and humoral immune systems and lead to an increased risk of severe mers complications another study found that 462 of the patients who died had hypertension suggesting that the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease increased the mortality of mers 108 banik suggested that sufficient attention should be paid to mers patients with combined underlying diseases to reduce the occurrence of serious complications and mortality 109 table 1 heart damage was also reported in mers patients 110 mers-cov was found in the kidneys of deceased patients but was not detected in the heart tissue and the heart showed no significant histological changes 111112 however an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue implying direct cardiac pathology 113 the mechanism of heart injury in mers infection remains unclear and requires more research covid-19 which broke out at the end of 2019 is a disease caused by infection with sars-cov-2 124 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is a -cov 2 covid-19 is similar to sars and mers and manifests as extensively pathological viral lung inflammation 1 although similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 has its own characteristics 1114 early cases suggest that covid-19 may not be as severe as sars and mers however the rapidly increasing number of cases and increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission suggest that sars-cov-2 is more contagious than sars-cov and mers-cov and has a lower fatality 39115 116 117 up to april 27 2020 the overall mortality of covid-19 was 69 globally 5 but the fatality rate is different in different regions and times ranging from 07 to 135 5118 the symptoms of covid-19 infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 64 days 119 fever fatigue and dry cough are the main manifestations of covid-19 and a few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion runny nose sore throat and diarrhea 29120121 patients with severe cases often experience dyspnea andor hypoxemia one week after onset 122 severe cases of covid-19 progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock and metabolic acidosis which is difficult to correct and coagulopathy 10 current case reports show that sars-cov-2 infection may have cardiovascular symptoms in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms a small number of patients have atypical clinical manifestations and may start with cardiovascular symptoms such as chest tightness palpitations and chest pain a study by liu et al found that 73 10137 of patients had palpitations as the first symptom 123 it was also reported that 2 of patients experienced chest pain during hospitalization 11 in addition wang et al found that 167 of patients with covid-19 had arrhythmias 10 according to relevant studies 9 10 11124 the proportion of covid-19 patients with comorbid cvds such as hypertension coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease was larger than that of patients with other comorbidities or without comorbidities suggesting that patients with cvd may be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection moreover the incidence of cvd in patients with severe or fatal cases with covid-19 was higher than that in patients with nonsevere cases or in those who survived 1213124 according to the reports of the chinese center for disease control and prevention 157 of the deaths were hypertension and 9 had other cardiovascular diseases further suggesting that underlying cardiovascular diseases may be one of the important risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 8 it can be seen not only that the number of covid-19 patients with cardiovascular disease is large but also that these patients have poor tolerance to severe pneumonia and are more likely to develop severe cases table 1 cardiac complications such as electrocardiography abnormities diastolic dysfunction and acute myocardial injury were reported in patients with covid-19 124 125 126 127 cases of severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function have been reported after covid-19 128 129 130 and sars-cov-2 infection-related myocarditis is likely associated with myocardial injury 60128 according to the study by li et al the most common organ damage outside the lungs was heart injury 13 serum myocardial necrosis markers such as hypersensitive troponin i hs-tni and creatine kinase ck increased to varying degrees in patients with mild and severe cases of covid-19 9 10 11 12 13 14131 132 133 134 however the risk of heart injury was higher in patients with severe cases approximately 222 to 31 912126133134 than in patients with mild cases approximately 2 to 4 910 the percentage of heart injury in covid-19 patients who died approximately 28 to 89 1213132 was higher than that in those who survived n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide nt-probnp levels were also reported to be increased 13134135 increased hs-tni and probnp expression levels may be risk factors for severe illness and high mortality of covid-19 133 134 135 furthermore it was found that high hs-tni levels were associated with increased levels of inflammation neutrophils il-6 crp and pct and decreased levels of immunity lymphocytes monocytes and cd4 and cd8  t cells suggesting that cardiac injury may have something to do with the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response 131132 table 2 two recent studies published in jama cardiology reported the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 in detail 60136 shi et al found that cardiac injury was a common condition among hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan china and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality 136 guo et al reported that myocardial injury was significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19 myocardial injury was associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury 60 table 2 covid-19 may induce new cardiovascular diseases and  or aggravate potential cardiovascular diseases the short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects of covid-19 and the effects of specific treatments are unclear and need further investigation as the epidemic spread sars-cov-2 evolved multiple subtypes in a recent study researchers proposed the subdivision of the global sars-cov-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural nsp3 nsp4 nsp6 nsp12 nsp13 and nsp14 cistrons structural spike and nucleocapsid and accessory orf8 genes 137 six virus subtypes were predominant in the population accounting for more than 97 of the samples isolated from around the world and the subtypes showed some geographical structure with two clusters a smaller one comprised of isolates mostly sampled from western hemisphere subtypes ii vi ix x and xi and a larger one whose isolates were sampled from western and eastern hemispheres subtypes i iii iv v vii viii xii xiii xiv xv and xvi 137 the researchers believed that the genetic structure determined for the sars-cov-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs 137 in another earlier study population genetic analyses of 103 sars-cov-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types designated l and s that are well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms snps 138 the l type 70 is more prevalent than the s type 30 but the s type was found to be the ancestral version the l type is more aggressive and spread more quickly and it was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan but the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 for more severe selective pressure placed by human intervention on the l type 138 contrary to the l type the s-type which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive might have increased in relative frequency due to the weaker selective pressure 138 it was also reported that among the 27 viruses isolated from wuhan 26 963 were l type and only 1 37 was s type 138 however among the other 73 viruses isolated outside wuhan 45 616 were l type and 28 384 were s type 138 this comparison suggests that the l type was significantly more prevalent in wuhan than in other places and recent studies about the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with covid-19 in wuhan 9 10 11139 or outside wuhan 134140141have showed that the mortality of covid-19 patients and the proportion of patients with cardiac injury outside wuhan was lower than that in wuhan table 3
 although there were many reasons for the different incidence of cardiac injury and outcome of covid-19 in and outside wuhan such as the shortage of medical resources in wuhan the role of different sars-cov-2 subtypes cannot be ignored the relationship between sars-cov-2 subtypes and the mortality of covid-19 or the cvd complications need for further immediate comprehensive studies that combine genomic data epidemiological data and records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 according to the references above we can see that patients with underlying cvd may be more likely to become infected with coronavirus and cvd may be one of the risk factors for poor prognosis and high mortality of cov infection few studies however have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations we believe that the possible mechanisms may be related to inflammation cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are all metabolic-related diseases it has been reported that metabolic syndrome can downregulate the key mediator of the hosts innate immune response to pathogenesis affecting the function of the innate and humoral immune systems 142 chronic low-grade inflammatory disease has been widely recognized as a feature of coronary heart disease and its occurrence is closely related to inflammation 143 the occurrence of hypertension is associated with oxidative stress inflammation and the activation of the immune system 144 il-6 il-1 and tumor necrosis factor  tnf- levels are higher in patients with hypertension than in patients with normal blood pressure 145 this may explain why patients with underlying cardiovascular disease found in the clinic are more susceptible to infection kulcsar et al showed that mers-cov infection can lead to prolonged respiratory tract inflammation immune cell dysfunction and changes in the expression profile of inflammatory mediators 146 lymphopenia and increased inflammatory mediators were found in sars-cov-2 infection 147 immune disorders caused by sars-cov infection have also been reported 148 these may lead to the exacerbation of the original cardiovascular disease which is related to the death of some patients found in the clinic due to heart failure 88103132 according to information released by the shanghai municipal health and family planning commission the first covid-19 death in shanghai was in an individual who was 88 years old with a severe history of hypertension and cardiac insufficiency an analysis of the cause of death suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction therefore sars-cov-2 infection was just an inducement for exacerbations 124 overall the heart and lungs are inseparable in the normal physiological functions of the human body on the one hand comorbidities and complications of the heart increase the risk of pneumonia infection and exacerbation on the other hand pneumonia infection may aggravate existing cardiovascular diseases such as increased blood pressure increased heart failure and the recurrence of myocardial infarction fever is a common symptom in patients with coronavirus infection 927149 fever promotes the immune functions of humans and some animals and decreases the pathogenicity of some microbes antibody production t-cell activation neutrophil function and macrophage oxidative metabolism have been reported to increase in the presence of fever 150 151 152 153 154 however to avoid excessively elevated body temperature affecting normal physiological functions the body will activate sympathetic nerves and regulate circulatory function which will increase the heart rate and cardiac output 155 an increase in heart rate over a long period of time will lead to increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased cardiac output which may cause ischemia or heart failure 156 many diseases with fever symptoms may be complicated by myocarditis such as spotted fever rickettsioses infection 157 severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome 158 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 159 dengue 160 161 162 complicated scrub typhus 163 herpes simplex virus infection 164 enteric fever 165 a decrease in cardiac function may occur in febrile illnesses but whether myocardial damage is due to fever or the underlying infection is not known 166 weissinger et al found that in pigs with a bacterial infection with elevated body temperature serum ck lactate dehydrogenase ld and gamma-globulin gg levels were increased the administration of antibiotics to these pigs and lowering their body temperature reduced ck and ld levels but gg levels remained elevated suggesting that the infection did not decrease this study indicated that the levels of ck and ld were elevated due to fever caused by infection 167 k l et al discovered that a longer duration of fever was related to the occurrence of pericarditis after myocardial infarction 168 therefore heart injury in coronavirus infection may be related to fever severe pneumonia can cause significant gas exchange disturbances and lead to hypoxemia hypoxia reduces the energy production required for cell metabolism and increases the bodys anaerobic digestion acidosis and oxygen free radicals accumulated in the cell destroy the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane as hypoxia continues the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases significantly leading to a series of cell damage processes including apoptosis 169 at the same time hypoxia can also induce inflammatory reactions such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines leading to further tissue ischemia and may even cause myocardial infarction 13170171 previous lessons from coronavirus and influenza have shown that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndrome 172173 arrhythmia 174 and exacerbation of heart failure 175 mainly due to a combination of significant systemic inflammation response and localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque along with other effects 176 177 178 evidence has shown that sars-cov induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp-1 transforming growth factor-beta 1 tgf-beta1 tnf il-1 and il-6 and interferon- ifn- in sars patients and experimental animal models infected with sars-cov 179180 tnf and il-1 family and il-6 family cytokines are considered proinflammatory mediators of heart failure and they have obvious negative inotropic effects which may explain heart failure complications in sars infection 181 the acute heart injury might be due to the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to sars infection 30 there is evidence indicating that myocardial inflammation induced by sars-cov is mainly mediated by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines 9596 the nuclear factor-b nf-b signaling pathway associated with the induction of proinflammatory cytokines is activated in sars-cov-infected mice treatment with drugs that inhibited nf-b activation led to a reduction in inflammation in both sars-cov-infected cultured cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after sars-cov infection indicating that the activation of the nf-b signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after sars-cov infection and that nf-b inhibitors are promising antivirals in infections caused by sars-cov and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses 182 sars-cov-2 appears to affect themyocardium and cause myocarditis 128 myocardial injury is likely associated with infection-related myocarditis andor ischemia 60 increases in inflammatory factors such as crp il-1 and il-6 were also discovered in sars-cov-2 infection 131132147 wu et al believed that sars-cov-2 may cause heart damage by the cytokine storm 131 evidence has shown that sars-cov-2 may mainly affect t lymphocytes especially cd4  t cells resulting in a significant decrease in lymphocyte numbers 183 the extent of lymphopenia and an increase in inflammatory cytokines are related to the severity of the disease 147 critically ill covid-19 patients had higher levels of il6 il10 tnf lactate dehydrogenase ldh and c-reactive protein than patients with mild covid-19 9139184 suggesting that inflammatory indicators are an important factor in the early diagnosis of severe covid-19 most patients with coronavirus infection are in an inflammatory state which places the patients in a hypercoagulable state for example covid-19 leads to an increase in d-dimer levels in 40 of patients a decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time aptt in 16 of patients and a decrease in pt in 30 of patients further increasing the risk of embolism 11 hypercoagulability induced by inflammation might contribute to plaque rupture with subsequent thrombosis and myocardial injury 185 therefore clinicians should pay attention to covid-19 patients with coronary heart disease to prevent myocardial injury and myocardial infarction septic shock can be seen as a serious complication in sars mers and covid-19 1376103 approximately 62 of sars-cov-2 infections are complicated by shock 126 it was reported that left ventricular dysfunction occurs in approximately 20 of patients within 6 hours after the onset of septic shock and the incidence can increase to 60 by 1 to 3 days after the onset of septic shock 186 myocardial dysfunction and cardiovascular inflammation might lead to elevated creatine kinase and troponin 187 which might explain the high hs-tni in deceased patients in addition to the abovementioned accompanying symptoms anxiety and stress can also lead to adverse reactions such as accelerated heart rhythms and elevated blood pressure especially in critically ill patients 188189 health anxiety could be found in coronavirus-infected patients 190 generally everyone experiences health anxiety to some degree and the associated vigilance to a potential health-related threat can be protective however excessive health anxiety can be detrimental 190 the literature indicates that stress can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system leading to an increase in peripheral glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels 191 high plasma catecholamine levels are associated with an increased risk of heart failure altered autonomic activity during depression can lead to arrhythmias the activated sns alters cardiac wall contractility and increases apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes contributing to cvd development although there is no relevant study on covid-19 patients suffering from anxiety medical workers have been reported to be anxious after direct contact with the patients 192193 a study by sun et al showed that some chinese showed acute posttraumatic stress symptoms during the covid-19 outbreak 194 therefore psychological counseling should be conducted on patients in a timely manner and anxiolytic drugs could be used when necessary as mentioned above sars-cov was reported to lead to myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression which may be responsible for myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars 99 direct sars-cov infection of cardiomyocytes may also lead to myocarditis and impaired myocardial function coronavirus-induced myocarditis and its subsequent progression to dilated cardiomyopathy have been described in rabbit models 195 sars-cov was found in heart samples from patients who died of sars 76 pathological findings showed a marked increase in macrophage infiltration in patients with sars-cov in the heart with evidence of myocardial damage mers-cov was not detected in the heart tissue and the heart showed no significant histological changes in mers patients 111112 however an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue implying direct cardiac pathology 113 although myocarditis was reported in sporadic autopsy cases 128 there is still no clear pathological evidence supporting that sars-cov-2 can directly cause heart damage the most frequently used drugs during hospitalization are glucocorticoids and antiviral drugs as well as antibiotics the secondary qt interval prolongation caused by the use of drugs during hospitalization cannot be ignored antiviral drugs lopinavir ritonavir antibiotics azithromycin moxifloxacin levofloxacin antifungal drugs glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs there is a potential risk of prolonging the qtc interval 196197 drug-associated qt prolongation is associated with increased arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic mortality and it therefore continues to be an important metric of drug safety 198 a small study in france enrolling 26 treated patients and 16 non-randomized controls showed that hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin shortened the time to resolution of viral shedding of covid-19 199 based on this study clinicians in many countries have begun using these medications in clinical practice and multiple randomized trials are being initiated but there were occasional case reports of hydroxychloroquine prolonging the qt interval and provoking torsade de pointes when used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus 200 201 202 203 the widely used antibiotic azithromycin was gradually recognized as a rare cause of prolonged qt severe arrhythmia and increased risk of sudden death 204 205 206 207 although there were no reports of arrhythmia death caused by the use of hydroxychloroquine the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should also be noted 208 active support with expected management based on early prognostic indicators may improve recovery appropriate treatment of heart failure arrhythmia acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis are still important with continued global cooperation on multiple methods specific evidence-based treatment strategies for covid-19 will emerge in order to protect the wider population antibody testing and effective vaccines will be needed to make a history of covid-19 and some treatment related issues need attention firstly the use of acei  arb drugs was controversial in the earlier phase of covid-19 epidemic but recently published studies suggested that there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei  arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicine 6061209 some conjectures 210 based on the disease mechanism in the early stage of the outbreak that acei  arb may increase the infection of new coronavirus and the aggravation of covid-19 by increasing the expression of ace2 have been denied by more and more clinical evidence we see that the continuous treatment of covid-19 patients with hypertension with acei  arb will not only cause the deterioration of the condition but also continue to exert cardiovascular protection and even improve the prognosis 6061209 secondly we should pay attention to the application of hydroxychloroquine 200 201 202 203 and azithromycin 204 205 206 207 for their side effects of prolonging the qt interval other drugs used to treat the covid-19 patients such as antiviral drugs lopinavir ritonavir antibiotics moxifloxacin levofloxacin antifungal drugs glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs can cause the qt interval prolongation and should attract more attention reference by sapp et al would help to minimize risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmia during treatment of covid-19 211 thirdly a recent study from jama reported that the mortality rate of patients with mechanical ventilation treatment was 881 212 multiple studies around the world have shown that the mortality rate of covid-19 patients using ventilator was still high 213 214 215 and it was believed that the ventilator should be used more cautiously in patients with covid-19 which can reduce the mortality of patients using the ventilator by more than 50 216 new guidelines should be established for when to use a ventilator for patients with covid-19 we advocate the application of staged breathing support methods to delay the use of ventilator simple oxygen treatment like nasal oxygen supply may be safer and more effective fourth methylprednisolone are the classical immunosuppressive drugs which are important to stop or delay the progress of the pneumonia and have been proved to be effective for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in recent study 217 wu at al found that the administration of methylprednisolone appeared to reduce the risk of death in covid-19 patients with ards however of those who received methylprednisolone treatment 23 of 50 patients died this is a rather high mortality of 50 the indication timing dosage and duration the application of methylprednisolone needs further investigation fifth the early report showed that remdesivir was highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 218 but recent study published in lancet showed that remdesivir did not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients 219 however another clinical trial showed that remdesivir accelerates recovery from advanced covid-19 220 another clinical trial showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the 5-day and 10-day course of remdesivir 221 these data suggested remdesivir does not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients but have an effect on shortening the course of disease in mild patients and early medication may be better the application of remdesivir needs further researches clinical data indicate that comorbid cardiovascular disease will aggravate the severity of coronavirus infection leading to a poor prognosis coronavirus may cause myocardial injury and the prognosis of patients with complicated myocardial injury is poor the mechanism of coronavirus causing myocardial injury and drug treatment options remain to be further studied this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work  common cold and flu wang lee jae   respiration can be defined as gas exchange between o2 and co2 which takes place in the lungs pulmonary respiration in which o2 moves from air space to capillaries while co2 moves in the opposite direction as well as in tissues tissue respiration in which o2 moves from blood to cells while co2 moves in the opposite direction the final goal of respiration is to supply all cells in the body with o2 one of the important components for power generation and to expel out co2 generated in the cells during the power generation process the respiratory system is a group of structures for pulmonary respiration consisting of an air conduction portion and a respiratory portion fig 51
 the air conduction portion is composed of the nasal cavity pharynx larynx trachea bronchus divided in a dichotomous manner more than 20 times and finally terminal bronchiole in that order from outside to inside where gas exchange never takes place but gases o2 or co2 are transported from the outside to inside or vice versa the main functions of the air conduction portion are conditioning the air for pulmonary respiration as well as air conduction as its basic function conditioning of the air includes three actions 1 air cleaning 2 air warming and 3 air moistening interestingly the nasal cavity the first part of the conduction portion has complicated structures for conditioning of the air such as dome-shaped nasal alae their inner space is the nasal ventricle making air warm and moistened by slowing the air speed and three shelves inferior middle and superior conchae projected from the nasal septum in the nasal cavity making air warm moistened and clean by increasing the contact of the ingested air with typical respiratory mucosal epithelium having moisture and warmth from the rich capillaries by causing air turbulence in addition to its basal function air conduction especially mucin secreted from the typical respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity is so sticky that it gets rid of the particulate materials such as dusts and microorganisms easily through their adhesion to the sticky mucin which is called the air cleaning process the larynx also has its proper function phonation for which it has several small cartilages and small muscles connecting each cartilage besides its air conduction function needless to say the air passing through the entire air conduction portion is fully conditioned air eg cleaned moistened and warmed appropriately arriving at the respiratory portion the air conduction portion from the bronchus to the terminal bronchiole is called the bronchial tree which also has a typical respiratory epithelium on their luminal surface the typical respiratory epithelium consists of several cell types 1 tall columnar cells are the most abundant ones and have numerous cilia on their apical surface 2 mucous goblet cells looking like a typical wine glass have many polysaccharide-rich mucin droplets on their surface and 3 there are some miscellaneous cells functionally all cilia of the tall columnar cells are fully covered by spreading out the polysaccharide-rich mucous droplets produced by mucous goblet cells forming the mucociliary blanket the sticky mucin component laid on the cilia adsorb chemical substances tiny particles and even microorganisms which are removed effectively by one-way movement from inside to outside of the mucociliary blanket therefore a substantial amount of mucous fluid drains from the bronchial tree into esophagus a pathway to the gi tract that is the crossroads in the laryngopharyngeal area between the respiratory and gi tracts every day in humans the respiratory portion starts from the last and smallest bronchiole called respiratory bronchioles which have alveoli intermittently on their way to the terminal portion of respiratory pathway the alveolar sacs which are composed of numerous alveoli wide networks of capillaries cover the external surface of each alveolus forming the blood air barrier consisting of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium of its covering capillary and the fused basal laminae present between them fig 52
 conclusively o2 in the alveoli moves into blood capillaries through the blood air barrier while co2 in the blood capillaries is transported to the air spaces in the alveoli through the blood air barrier eventually evacuated to the outside of the body there is no doubt in the fact that the direct initiating factor of the common cold is low temperatures ie coldness especially relative coldness which means a sense of feeling cold due to an unexpected sudden change in the temperature from high to low here coldness does not mean an absolute extremely low temperature routinely experienced in both arctic areas year-round therefore although the outdoor temperature can be higher than 30 c people attending a meeting in a room where the air-cooling system is operating well with the indoor temperature kept around 2425 c cannot help but feel cold for a relatively long time and they can catch the common cold generally speaking traditionally the incidence rate of the common cold during the hot summer has been very low in the korean proverb even the dogs do not catch colds in may and june of the lunar calendar understanding that may and june in the lunar calendar indicate a midsummer time it means that korean people rarely catch cold in the midsummer time however nowadays the rate has become relatively high such that it is very common to see cold patients during the summer time because air-cooling systems are found everywhere it is no wonder to see that the incidence rate of the common cold is not particularly high in the arctic areas where absolute coldness persists year-round as well as during the cold winter time when severe cold temperatures persist because they do not usually feel cold due to routinely being exposed to severe coldness as wells as having low viral colonization due to severe low temperatures actually relative coldness means the temperature at which people feel cold in real life when people feel cold or chilly a couple of responses take place in their body to keep the core body temperature constant 375 c first vascular constriction around the inlet area of air occurs typically the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity resulting in a reduction of mucus secretion containing various antiviral soluble mediators such as interleukins tnf- ifn- and so on and followed by an explosive increase in the nasal viral flora such as adenovirus and rhinovirus by their rapid proliferation the nasal viral flora proliferates easily in the relatively cold weather which causes the relative humidity to become low a relatively low temperature and dryness are good conditions for viral proliferation and invasion to the body dryness usually causes injuries in the nasal mucosa which supplies the route for the initial viral invasion when the human physical defense system weakens or is broken and viral proliferation increases the balance between the human body defense system and the viral flora tends to shift to the viral flora resulting in catching the common cold that is the reason why there are common cold or flu outbreaks in the late fall season and the transitional season from the hot summer to the cold winter when the common cold starts just after a prolonged exposure to relative coldness the first symptom of the common cold is usually a runny nose which functions to wash out the increased viral flora so that the number of virus infected cells decreases moreover people in good physical condition ordinarily do not catch the cold while people who are not healthy ordinarily due to prolonged fatigue overwork or insomnia usually catch the cold once people catch the cold the next symptoms after a runny nose are a sore throat and systemic fever a sore throat means that tissue invasion by the proliferated viral flora has started followed by inflammation which usually consists of four classical signs of redness swelling pain and heat systemic fever is a very important innate defense the higher the body temperature is to some extent the lower the proliferation rate of the virus is therefore normal body temperature itself 375 c is a very important body defense against bacterial or viral infection actually bacterial or viral proliferation is strongly inhibited by high temperatures higher than 375 c because it takes a little time minimally 23 days to activate the adaptive specific immunity for invading bacteria or a virus the body defense system uses the high fever as a non-specific defense tool immediately upon viral infection which works in a very short time that is the reason why early use of antipyretic agents should not be done for a high fever occurring in the common cold or flu however a high fever should be cautiously controlled by pediatricians in the case of young-aged people in whom brain damage is likely to be caused by febrile convulsions acute symptoms of the common cold are usually terminated within 3 days at the longest 57 days before the specific adaptive immune system is fully active unless a secondary bacterial infection is also present there are a couple of reasons why actually vaccines for the common cold are not available one is that the common cold comes from an imbalance between the human defense system and the normal viral flora which normally reside at the initiation part of the respiratory system such as the nasal cavity and nasal or oral pharynx so that they usually do not induce new immunity against the normal floral virus the second reason is because there are more than 200 viruses that cause the common cold the third reason is because the common cold has been called a self-limited disease in which it takes just a few days to be cured so that mainly the innate immunity must work but the adaptive immunity does not need to be activated for the eventual termination of the common cold one more thing is to be considered seriously the common cold and flu are totally different the flu is never a severe cold clinically it is not easy to tell the flu from a common cold although there have been some differences in clinical symptoms briefly the main symptoms of the common cold are runny nose mild fever cough and sometimes sore throat while those of the flu are high fever myalgia muscle pain headache sore throat and generalized weakness lethargy table 51
 unlike the common cold which is usually not infected by a foreign pathogen but is just a kind of battle between the body defense system and the normal flora of viruses residing in the upper respiratory system the flu is a disease caused by an influenza virus infection thus the common cold takes place at any time year-round whenever people feel coldness for a relatively long time while flue outbreaks occur only during some restricted periods in korea from october to april of the next year when the influenza virus is prevalent in march 2003 the who reported officially that a new unidentified fatal disease has appeared in hong kong it was discovered that the disease is a kind of variant of the common cold caused by a variant coronavirus which supposedly originated from musk cats raised by some farmers in guangdong china in november 2002 the coronavirus is a single-stranded rna virus and has a species specificity as the causative viral agent of infection however a genetically modified coronavirus of the musk cat has a new capability to infect beyond the interspecies barrier it was not just the matter of crossing the interspecies barrier even though its genetic structure has changed it is just one of the new causative agents of the common cold which causes people to become infected with the common cold unfortunately some of the patients infected by this variant coronavirus have died the autopsy of the dead cases revealed that the specific cause of death was viral pneumonia which rarely occurs in routine common cold patients since then the common cold caused by the variant coronavirus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemiological data show that the mortality rate of sars has reached around 10 about 780 people dead out of about 83000 patients which is high enough to cause people to panic considering that the mortality rate of the original common cold is near zero at the end of march 2009 a new strain of type a influenza virus was reported for the first time from a 10-year-old child admitted to one clinic located in san diego usa with the chief complaints of high fever cough and vomiting it turned out to be a novel swine-origin influenza a h1n1 virus that caused the infection thereafter this novel flu has spread out to the whole world resulting in the occurrence of more than 130000 patients and dead cases of more than 800 people fortunately this novel flu could be controlled successfully by the administration of tamiflu which does not have any treatment effects on the seasonal flu despite having the same serotype h1n1 therefore many researchers think that the actual mortality rate of this novel swine-origin influenza a might be more than 10 influenza virus has two kinds of antigens which consist of hemagglutinin h and neuraminidase n hemagglutinin has 15 subtypes h1h15 while neuraminidase has 9 subtypes n1n9 a combination of h subtypes and n subtypes makes theoretically 135 sub-serotypes of influenza a virus such as h1n1 h3n2 h5n1 h7n9 and h15n9 according to scientific reports humans are usually infected by influenza virus with low numbers of h h1h3 while avian are usually infected by influenza virus with high numbers of h h5h15 the h protein is known to be used for viral attachment to the host cell after which the virus proliferates using the replication machinery of the host cell the h protein has high species specificity unfortunately this principle has been broken welcoming a new millennium in 2000 in late 2003 shocking news was reported that some people living in east asia had been infected by a highly pathogenic avian influenza ai for which their serotype was h5n1 which had never been reported before in human medical history at that time even worse this h5n1 avian influenza showed an extremely high mortality rate about 70 even though its infectivity is low however there is good fortune in this misfortune because infection cases between humans have not been identified yet recently spring 2013 a new serotype of ai has appeared in some areas of china for which the serotype is h7n9 according to some reports presented at the meeting of options for the control of influenza held in cape town from september 5 to 9 2013 this new ai is expected to have a higher infectivity and toxicity than h5n1 ai and in the fall of 2013 a pandemic of this new ai was forecast by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc of the usa in korea for the last 20 years the number of people taking a couple of grams of vitamin c daily has increased steadily such that in 2017 it was presumed that about 15 million people were taking a megadose of vitamin c daily the most frequent cases which i have observed by telephone or e-mail interviews have been many people taking a megadose of vitamin c for more than 45 years and for a couple of years they have never caught a cold which they used to suffer from one to two times a year when they did not take a megadose of vitamin c twelve years ago i was asked to meet a ceo who was in his mid-50s and suffered from multiple episodes of a cold yearly for more than 30 years he was admitted regularly to a hospital for 1 month due to pulmonary complications from the cold immediately after meeting with me he started to take a megadose of vitamin c daily since then he has never caught a cold for more than 10 years this longitudinal study has very meaningful value in estimating the effects of vitamin c on the common cold even though it is only a single case clinical studies on the effects of vitamin c on colds presented by some clinicians have shown generally negative results regular vitamin c consumption may decrease the duration of cold symptoms but does not affect the symptom severity or act as a prophylaxis heimer et al 2009 the failure of vitamin c supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in a normal population indicates that preventing a cold by taking routine megadoses of vitamin c is not rationally justified for community use however evidence suggests that it could be justified in people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise or cold environments douglas et al 2007 their conclusion is that vitamin c does not have a curative or preventive effect on colds but shortens the duration of the illness the common cold is a self-limited viral disease for a curative treatment the optimal dose of vitamin c and the right method of administration should be considered according to a pharmacokinetic study of vitamin c after oral administration it is most desirable to take vitamin c every 6 h because vitamin c has a 6-h cycle of metabolism as mentioned in chap 101007978-94-024-1713-51 the introduction actually when it is orally administered it reaches peak concentration in the peripheral blood 3 h after the administration and it comes back to the basal level of concentration 6 h after the administration however almost all clinical experiments on the effects of vitamin c published so far have been performed on a single dose of vitamin c furthermore the daily vitamin c dose used in the above published papers was less than 1000 mg in addition it is actually impossible to perform clinical experiments that can confirm if vitamin c can cure or prevent a cold because a cold has a short period as a self-limited disease once cold patients visit the clinic for treatment the number of viruses is too high to be controlled by any potent medication such that the balance between the host and the virus is shifted to the virus and the patient usually becomes severely ill during such an active phase of the cold no drug can stop the disease process of a cold from occurring in the upper respiratory tract vitamin c can prevent the onset of a cold if people follow a strict regimen taking a megadose of vitamin c three times daily because it can inhibit the initial phase of viral proliferation when the number of viruses is not so high and still controllable by the host defense system furuya et al 2008 that is the case with tamiflu which has been used for successful prevention of the swine flu h1n1 the correct method of administering tamiflu is to take it within 48 h after the occurrence of fever if it is taken 48 h or later after a fever occurs it has no effect on the treatment of swine flu considering the operating mechanism of tamiflu which binds to the hemagglutinin protein of the influenza virus and inhibits viral attachment to the host cell resulting in failure of viral replication using the replication machinery of the host cell tamiflu does not cure the cold but prevents it because tamiflu blocks the initial proliferation of the influenza virus there have been some reports on the effects of vitamin c on the flu li et al 2006 sladkova and kostolansky 2006 banerjee and kaul 2010 to observe the effects of vitamin c on flu an in vivo experiment using gulo mice which are unable to synthesize vitamin c like humans because the gene encoding l-gulono--lactone oxidase is knocked out artificially has been performed by my research team the experimental animals were divided into three groups with six mice in each group group 1 wild-type normal mice group 2 gulo mice without supplementation of vitamin c and group 3 gulo mice with supplementation of oral vitamin c the mice in each group were infected with h3n2 influenza virus and then the survival rate was checked all the mice in the three groups showed symptoms of the flu such as fever rhinorrhea lethargy and so on interestingly 5 days after infection 80 of the mice in group 2 were dead while no mice in groups 1 and 3 died fig 53
 the autopsies showed that the lung tissues from the dead mice were loaded with so much influenza virus indicating that the mice in group 2 died of viral pneumonia however the lung tissues from the mice in groups 1 and 3 which did not die from the infection did not have the influenza virus fig 54 kim et al 2013
 these results strongly suggest that vitamin c in a living body might prevent influenza virus from spreading down from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory system such as the bronchi bronchioles and alveoli even though the mechanism involved in the preventing process has not been elucidated yet however vitamin c deficiency causes inhibition of camp-dependent secretion of chloride in the mouse airway epithelium so that the epithelium does not maintain fluidity on their surface our unpublished data fig 55
 the dryness of the mucosal epithelium facilitates viral proliferation and invasion furthermore vitamin c deficiency dramatically decreases svct expression on the mucosal epithelium of respiratory tracts leading to an abolition of the prevention effects of vitamin c from flu infection our unpublished data fig 56
 in addition levels of interferons ifns in the bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid fig 57 which have very critical roles in the defense of viral infection are markedly low in vitamin c insufficiency group however levels of representative pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-1 and il-1 in bal fluid are significantly high in vitamin c insufficiency group inflammatory cells are also markedly increased in bal fluid fig 58 kim et al 2013

 these all in vivo data provide the immunological evidences that daily supplementation of high-dose vitamin c can prevent influenza infection and that in extreme case it can save the life  surveillance of covid-19 in the general population using an online questionnaire report from 18161 respondents in china travis sanchez brian dixon onicio leal neto hongxing luo yongchan lie frits prinzen w   the recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease covid-19 has caused over 752000 confirmed cases and 36000 deaths as of march 30 2020 1-4 despite a proactive policy of identifying and treating patients with infected symptoms it remains resource intensive to screen the general population that is at risk for infection 56 moreover inequality of health care systems among different areas brings challenges to cover remote areas which are also at risk of the covid-19 infection therefore a new way of surveilling the general population could contribute to our understanding of covid-19 7 the wide use of the internet throughout china and in the rest of the world may be sufficient to provide such information participatory disease surveillance has been increasingly investigated in recent years as a promising tool to complement traditional facility-based surveillance platforms 8 it has the advantage of providing quick coverage of a large population during a disease outbreak therefore an online survey may be valuable in monitoring disease trends in communities and providing information for making policies in this paper we report the results of the first online questionnaire about covid-19 released on january 24 and with data collected up to february 17 2020 our study aims to investigate how a history of contact and fever both defined according to relevant medical guidelines have evolved during the early phase of government lockdown policies and whether an online questionnaire can be used to identify certain risk factors related to fever among those reporting history of contact the first version of the questionnaire was developed on january 24 2020 by that time little evidence was known about covid-19 our anonymous questionnaire was primarily developed from the following 3 sources 1 the diagnosis and treatments of covid-19 third version guideline 2 clinical courses of the first 17 death cases both of which were released by the national health commission of china and 3 the article that first analyzed the clinical features of 41 cases of covid-19 9-11 the guideline requires a suspected case to satisfy the following criteria any history of contact including living in wuhan or having travelled to wuhan within 2 weeks of disease onset being in contact with any person with a fever and respiratory symptoms from wuhan within 2 weeks of disease onset or belonging to a cluster of infected cases and clinical manifestations including a fever defined as a body temperature 373 c 991 f imaging evidence of covid-19 normal white blood cell count or leukopenia or lymphopenia a confirmed case is further established by positive findings of real time polymerase chain reaction or viral gene sequencing the descriptions of the guideline are in good consistency with the clinical features of the first 17 death cases and later 41 infected cases reported on january 24 2020 910 therefore our questionnaire evaluated the risk of covid-19 in the general population from the following aspects we did not include laboratory examinations eg real time polymerase chain reaction lymphopenia white blood cell count or thoracic imaging results eg multiple patchy consolidation and interstitial changes in our questionnaire because in general these would unlikely be obtained by the general population by february 17 2020 we had developed and released three versions of the chinese questionnaires to the public they were essentially similar with the following three major revisions after completing the questionnaire the respondents would be classified into one of the following 4 risk groups and given different suggestions the questionnaire was developed using a professional online questionnaire website wenjuanxing questionnaire star 12 it is the most popular website for online surveys in china with over 42 billion questionnaires recycled and over 59 million users as of february 21 2020 questionnaires were distributed online by wechat the most popular instant messaging app in china and sharing the link of the questionnaire since our aim was to have an overview of situations in china during the covid-19 outbreak we did not target any specific groups of respondents distribution and filling out the questionnaires were voluntary making our study a convenience sampling study according to the world health organization guidelines on ethical issues in public health surveillance a surveillance study in emergency outbreak situations is exempted from ethical review and oversight 13 indeed our online questionnaire was designed on january 23 2020 when the lockdown of wuhan city was officially announced and released on january 24 so it could not await the formal approval of an ethical review committee all users were informed at the beginning of the questionnaire that their questionnaire data would be used only for medical education and research purposes if the informed consent was rejected by the users they could still continue the questionnaire and obtain their results the questionnaire was released on january 24 2020 and recycled on february 17 all questionnaire results were downloaded from the website for our analysis in addition to the items of the questionnaire the downloaded data also included the date of submission for all respondents as well as the respondents location at the city level we also collected population data of each province from china statistical abstract 2019 published by the national bureau of statistics of china 14 the number of confirmed cases was followed up with on a daily basis since the release of the questionnaire using the netease news website the largest chinese hub for real time collection of data and news related to covid-19 15 the statistics of confirmed cases per province used in this study were collected until midnight of february 11 at that time clinically diagnosed cases without positive real time polymerase chain reaction results were also included in the official confirmed number of cases count data were expressed as number percentage skewed continuous data time to complete questionnaire were expressed as median iqr geographical distributions were drawn using microsoft excel visual basic a pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between two variables of interest mainly between date and percentage of respondents of interest per day comparison of respondents basic characteristics between the inside and outside of wuhan was performed using a chi-square test or a fisher exact test if the sample size was 40 risk of fever in respondents with history of contact was evaluated using a risk ratio rr and 95 ci all statistical analyses were performed using stata 140 statacorp and matlab r2018b mathworks statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed p value 05 by february 17 2020 at 233 am a total of 19449 individuals completed the questionnaires 9802 n19064 from china after removing 385 questionnaires from overseas countries 575 lacking informed consent 55 missing age 31 missing temperature 38 missing comorbidities and 4 missing symptoms information 18161 anonymous questionnaires were analyzed overall it took median 52 iqr 41-67 seconds to complete the questionnaire most questionnaires were accessed by clicking on the link of the questionnaire n11337 6242 and by visiting the wechat mini-app n6800 3744 figure 1a shows the geographical distributions of the questionnaire respondents in china the questionnaire covered all 34 province-level administrative regions for hubei province 6848 n11711710 of the respondents came from wuhan city which was most affected by covid-19 a positive relation was found between the number of respondents and the population size per province figure 1b demonstrating good coverage of the questionnaire across china table 1 summarizes the demographics and basic characteristics of respondents the population in wuhan had similar ages and comorbidities compared with those outside of wuhan age was negatively correlated with the number of respondents r2095 p001 as expected history of contact was more frequent among the respondents living in wuhan the percentage of fever was significantly lower among respondents inside versus outside wuhan symptoms were reported in a rather high percentage of respondents when restricting the symptoms to at least one main symptom and one secondary symptom the number of respondents with symptoms dropped to 1262 n229218161 a history of contact was reported by more than one-eighth of respondents however the high percentage might have been confounded considering that all respondents living in wuhan city had a history of contact according to the definition of the official guideline so we excluded these respondents from our analysis and divided the remaining respondents by every 8 days into 3 phases phase 1 was from january 24 to 31 phase 2 was from february 1 to 8 and phase 3 was from february 9 to 16 despite heterogeneous responses of different provinces the proportion of respondents reporting a history of contact had markedly decreased over these 3 phases in most provinces figure 2a b and c this observation was further confirmed by correlation analysis between the proportion of respondents reporting a history of contact and date in areas outside of wuhan city and hubei province figure 2d these findings indicate the efficacy of current policies adopted to reduce the history of contact among the general population since the lockdown in wuhan and other areas on january 23 2020 body temperature was measured in 7749 n1407318161 of respondents with a higher percentage in wuhan city n9901171 8454 and hubei province n14311710 8368 overall fever was reported in less than one-tenth of the respondents unexpectedly a lower percentage was found for wuhan city and hubei province this might be due to covid-19 developing to a further stage in wuhan and fever cases were identified early and sent to hospitals without access to the internet we further analyzed how the percentage of respondents with fever evolved with time the trend seemed to peak on around february 8 2020 figure 3 analyzing the relationship between fever and history of contact may help develop population-based strategies for prevention purposes for the respondents living outside wuhan we found a significant relation between any history of contact and fever rr 131 95 ci 113-152 p001 travelling to wuhan having any close contact with a confirmed case and having at least 2 confirmed cases at the workplace in the past 2 weeks conferred a significantly higher risk of fever rr 147 95 ci 123-177 p001 rr 198 95 ci 167-224 p001 and rr 212 95 ci 174258 p001 respectively moreover there was a significant positive relation between the number of officially confirmed cases and the number of respondents reporting a fever r2041 p001 or the number of respondents reporting a fever and a history of contact r2035 p001 on a province basis regarding risk stratification based on history of contact and fever most respondents n1426418161 7854 were classified in the very low-risk group followed by the moderate-risk group n1883 1037 and the low-risk group n1428 786 whereas only 124 n225 were classified to the high-risk group furthermore comparison of fever rates among groups of various characteristics was likely to help identify risk factors figure 4 males were at a higher risk of fever than females p001 there was a positive trend between age and fever p001 respondents reporting fatigue and headache or myalgia were more likely to report fever p001 comorbidities showed various associations with fever among which history of lung diseases seemed to confer a higher risk of fever than the others however the relationship needs to be further validated by studies with larger samples because of a relatively small number of respondents in each group to the best of our knowledge this is the first large-sample online surveillance of the covid-19 outbreak in the general population our major findings include the questionnaire had a good coverage of all provinces of china in a relatively short period of time about 3 weeks the history of contact among the population outside of wuhan and hubei province significantly decreased during the early phase of the government lockdown policy fever reported by respondents significantly increased in the short-term of the disease outbreak and levelled off in 2-3 weeks and among those with history of contact some factors male advanced age and history of lung diseases seemed to be associated with a higher risk of fever an online questionnaire is likely to serve as a complementary way of disease surveillance in the general population especially during the emergent outbreak of an infectious disease 5 it takes the advantage of low costs and efficient delivery to all areas even the most remote areas where internet access is better than health care resources 1617 our questionnaire was completed by 385 chinese respondents from 38 overseas countries including developed the united states japan canada and the united kingdom developing brazil russia india and south africa and underdeveloped countries laos uganda and cambodia translation of the questionnaire to other languages may further increase the coverage across the world and improve surveillance of the covid-19 outbreak and comparable epidemics compared with the conventional way of disease surveillance the online questionnaire covers the population with generally less severe conditions but nevertheless is at risk of infection 718 taking into account that this population helps to establish the full spectrum of covid-19 epidemiology it may also facilitate the early triage and diagnosis of high-risk groups when combined with other digital health measures such as online physician consultation which has been widely adopted since the covid-19 outbreak in china for the low-risk population the questionnaire can also be adapted to reduce unnecessary anxiety and hospital visits and thus greatly relieve the workloads of health care facilities especially when an emergent public health event occurs 19 the questionnaire approach is advantageous compared with other approaches of online disease surveillance using data from google trends twitter or facebook 20-22 it provides richer information of the respondents as most items can be designed according to medical guidelines and characteristics of target populations therefore it is a more active approach than other infosurveillance methods using social media the information such as symptoms history of contact and comorbidities provided by an online questionnaire can be further combined with vital data such as body temperature heart rate respiratory rate oxygenation level and activity level obtained from wearable devices to have a more comprehensive and reliable estimation of respondents risk of disease 23 for the high-risk group identified using an online questionnaire a case can be further confirmed by sending a home-testing kit and instructing the respondents to perform a rapid diagnostic test as shown in the goviral study 24 additionally self-reported data from an online questionnaire can be linked with electronic medical records to build a long-term monitoring system 8 an online survey is likely to be used to observe the trends of disease prevalence in communities and thus support government policy evaluation in our study the date february 8 2020 when the percentage of fever respondents peaked was 16 days following the lockdown of wuhan city which was close to the 14 days of the maximum incubation period of the coronavirus 25 the delay of the fever peak might be associated with delayed quarantine policies in other cities in china overall our data supported the efficacy of current policies quarantine social distancing and isolation of infected populations for containing the spread of covid-19 from wuhan city to the other areas of china 62627 however the period and efficacy of quarantine may differ by country 28 it depends on not only government policies but also local culture and more importantly active support from the general population for other countries which may not have quarantine policies as strict as china the time to fever peak is probably longer among the general population moreover integration of the survey data into a model for real time and long-term forecasting of disease trends is likely to provide richer information for making policies 29 of note our questionnaire is more applicable to those living in china than abroad the definition of history of contact has mostly relied on contact with a confirmed case from wuhan however this can be further modified according to the earliest and generally most severely affected area of a country of interest such as lombardy in italy our survey also indicates that some factors such as male an advanced age and a history of lung disease are likely to relate to a higher risk of infection and thus these groups should be under close observation indeed these risk factors identified from our study are consistent with the clinical features of infected cases in previous publications 930-33 by quickly disseminating an online questionnaire during the early phase of a disease outbreak risk factors can be identified at a much earlier phase rather than when enough severe cases have been collected and analyzed using a conventional surveillance method this further allows for earlier protection of vulnerable groups from potential infection and thus reduces the number of cases internet-based surveillance approaches based on twitter have been demonstrated to detect ebola avian influenza and thunderstorm asthma at an early stage even before the first official report 20-22 the approach undoubtedly has the bias of sampling primarily internet users and their relatives as a consequence the population included in our study is relatively young a previous study demonstrated that both too young age 0-10 years and too old age older than 81 years populations are underrepresented in an internet-based monitoring survey 34 a better coverage of the general population with high representativeness generally requires a more complicated study design together with robust supports from an official institution 8 the questionnaire can also be distributed through other web platforms such as sina weibo the most popular microblogging website in china and news media netease and xinhua which have a wider reach of respondents in china furthermore this study does not include a follow-up for individual patients this choice was made to respect the respondents privacy however in future studies it may be acceptable to allot an individual code to each individual thereby allowing follow-ups although systematic follow-ups will remain a problem with internet questionnaires follow-ups may be further compromised by the lack of internet access when the individual is hospitalized unlike hospitals which diagnose covid-19 using a comprehensive set of

respondents risk of viral infection from the history of contact body temperature symptoms and comorbidities may have the risk of underestimating some patients who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic

on areas of interest  management of the dead during covid-19 outbreak in malaysia lay khoo see ahmad hasmi hafizam mohamad ibrahim azaini mohd mahmood shah   a cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology was reported by the chinese health authorities in wuhan hubei province china on 31st december 2019 and subsequently the china centre for disease control and prevention cdc reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of this outbreak on 9th january 2020 1 2 the virus is phylogenetically in the sars-cov clade and is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 the disease associated with the virus is referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the pathobiology of covid-19 remains incompletely understood and significant efforts are underway to study it worldwide 3 current understanding about how the virus that causes covid-19 spreads is largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses together with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus the sars-cov-2 is the third highly pathogenic human coronavirus that has emerged in the last two decades 4 and are all categorized and considered hazard group 3 hg3 pathogens 3 5 as of the 5th april 2020 covid-19 has affected 180 countries with a total death toll of 67594 cases worldwide 6 since the initial identification of the virus in china global spread has been rapid and subsequently who announced the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic on the 12th march 2020 7 in view of this the world faces a severe and acute public health emergency while sars-cov-2 continues to spread the number of deaths continue to increase globally covid-19 is transmitted via droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact between an infector and infectee 8 airborne spread has not been reported for covid-19 yet however it can be envisaged if certain aerosol-generating procedures are conducted in health care facilities including mortuaries during autopsies 8 to date there are about 102 deaths of confirmed covid-19 cases in malaysia as of the end of april 2020 9 the first death was reported on 17 march 2020 in johor and was from a cluster of cases thought to be initiated by the gathering of a large group of people for religious purposes as shown in the distribution of covid-19 deaths in malaysia table 1 deaths due to covid-19 occur in the older members of the population with co-morbidities such as hypertension diabetes stroke chronic diseases and heart related problems from the data it is documented that covid-19 deaths are concentrated in cities like kuala lumpur johor and selangor in peninsular malaysia as well as sarawak in east malaysia table 2 although the number of deaths reported in the country is not increasing in a hyperbolic curve pattern there is a dire and urgent need to be well prepared to manage the dead from this outbreak this is important not only for the healthcare workers but also for the first responders in particular this document aims to provide an overview on ways to augment the local collective capacity to manage the deceased when our normal capacity and capability in managing the dead could be overwhelmed based on the prevailing regulations and legislation in the country there is a need to improvise procedures and guidelines for management of the dead within the existing regulations in order to find a balance between medicolegal requirements and the safety of the personnel managing the bodies of the deceased with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection at the site of death during transport during postmortem procedures storage and preparation of the body before and during burial or cremation as well as environmental cleaning and disinfection involving various agencies in the country immediately after the outbreak in wuhan china began to spread many organizations and institutions around the world started to release guidance on considerations related to the safe handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection among these are guidelines by the european centre for disease prevention and control 2 guidance on postmortem examinations for mortuary workers in suspected covid-19 cases by the royal college of pathologists rcpath 3 technical recommendations for healthcare and deathcare workers by the international committee of the red cross icrc 5 interim guidance on the infection prevention and control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of covid-19 by the world health organization 7 and many others similarly the national institute of forensic medicine ipfn malaysia has also produced a guideline on management of the dead for all covid-19 suspected or confirmed deaths within the hospital as well as from outside the hospital brought-in-dead cases by police this guideline consists of various sections including guidelines on body transport from emergency departments or wards to the mortuary postmortem examination handling of the body and religiousritual body preparation and disposal to strengthen the principles of management of the dead from this outbreak sufficient training must be provided not only for the healthcare workers but also to the first responders who are also at risk when managing the dead in this preparation phase the ipfn malaysia has taken the initiative to engage the royal malaysia police rmp to create awareness on the risk of covid-19 infection and safety precautions that must be adhered prevent infection to all rmp ground officers during the investigation of a body found at the scene training sessions were also given to the rmp on proper hand hygiene and washing donning and doffing of the standard full personal protective equipment ppe which consists of a surgical mask double surgical gloves face shield impervious gown or apron with full sleeve coverage shoe covers and surgical cap 10 concurrently personnel working in the mortuary are given refresher hands-on and practical training on the use of the powered air-purifying respirator papr as well as donning and doffing of the standard full ppe in all forensic medicine centers in the country deployment of resources and personnel to fully utilize and maximize local capacity are put in plans at this level hospitals and local agencies also worked closely to coordinate this training activities in malaysia the leading agency in an inquiry into death is the rmp section 329 of the criminal procedure code cpc specifies the police are bound by law to investigate all sudden death reports including homicide suicide and accidental deaths 11 the police then arrange for a postmortem examination to be conducted as stipulated in section 330 of the same code similarly under the same act section 331 states that the mandate to conduct a postmortem examination of a body is given to a government medical officer which includes a forensic pathologist 11 the police as first responders to a scene of incident will invariably come in close contact with the dead due to the fact that covid-19 virus carriers can be asymptomatic the police or emergency responders are particularly vulnerable to infection hence the role of the public health officers under the provision of the prevention and control of infectious diseases act 1988 will be to assist the police at the scene for all suspected or confirmed covid-19 cases before transporting the deceased body to mortuary the public health officer at the scene of incident after being notified of a suspected or confirmed covid-19 body supervises and guides the police officers at the scene on proper donning and doffing of the standard full ppe before attending to the deceased body the body is wrapped in three layers first the body is wrapped in a layer of white cotton linen the body is then placed in a cadaver body bag the body with its two layers is then put in another cadaver body bag the third layer and the outer surface is disinfected with 05 sodium hypochlorite subsequent to the transportation of the body to the mortuary area decontamination of the scene as well as the hearse is performed by the public health officer postmortem examinations are performed in the bio-safety level 3 bsl-3 autopsy suite in the ipfn adhering strictly to the protocols and precautions on the use of recommended full ppe with papr as stated in the guidelines for handling infectious disease cases including sample collection after examination the body is then wrapped in three layers as described above to prepare for disposal preparation of the body and its release to the next-of-kin is conducted under the supervision of the public health officer claimants or next-of-kin are prohibited from performing normal religious or ritual practices including opening the sealed coffin or touching the body the only allowable religious or ritual practices are the funeral prayer for non-muslims and tayammum dry purification for muslims performed on the outer body bag layer by the islamic authorities under the supervision of the health authorities all probable or confirmed covid-19 positive bodies are not allowed to be embalmed and it is recommended they are taken for burial or cremation directly from the mortuary preferably within the same day of the postmortem examination the family of deceased individuals are able to accept the limitations due to the current pandemic this type of facility identified by nadma and situated at various locations functions as temporary mortuary centre for all covid-19 deaths in the country it is a holding area for all the dead whereby its security is maintained by the rmp apm or atm and is equipped with cold body storage containers in which bodies are properly tagged documented and stored the centre should be big enough to accommodate thousands of bodies as well as be able to function as the administration centre rest area and accommodation for first responders personnel working around the clock for unknown bodies buccal swabs will be taken for dna profiling to keep as a record for future identification the body will then be subjected to religious body preparation and last rites all procedures are done by trained personnel in full ppe temporary controlled burial is a method for a long-term temporary storage of unidentified bodies the temperature underground is lower than at the surface therefore providing natural refrigeration 16 it is done by performing a burial procedure for all human remains where each body will clearly be marked with gps to facilitate future exhumation in the event of the identification of the next-of-kin 16 17 temporary controlled burial was used as a practical solution to deal with a large number of unidentified decedents presumed victims of a human trafficking ring along the malaysia-thai border in 2015 when authorities exhumed one hundred and sixty three unidentified bodies from clandestine graves 17 temporary controlled burial provides a fundamental solution for unidentified victims to be treated with dignity and respect as well as an opportunity to be identified in future there remain large uncertainties in the underlying determinants of the severity of covid-19 infection and how these translate across settings however clear risk factors include age with older people more likely to require hospitalization and to subsequently die as a result of infection and underlying co-morbidities including hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease serving to exacerbate symptoms 4 variation in these factors between countries namely the economic status age-specific contact patterns and social mixing will have material consequences for transmission of sars-cov-2 due to the different legal requirements and mortality rate between countries there is no one-size-fits-all approach on the management of the dead the essential ways to react to such situations are rapid decision making by the relevant higher authorities and flexibility of the purview of the existing regulations in terms of managing the dead in a resilient direction as the number of active positive covid-19 cases in malaysia has continued to rise since march 2020 the national institute of forensic medicine ipfn malaysia has had to prepare for the worst case scenario of a sudden multiplication in the number of deaths due to covid-19 which may overwhelm the capacity of the forensic service in preparation for possible large scale deaths from this pandemic ipfn malaysia has improvised procedures and guidelines for management of the dead within the existing regulations in order to achieve a balance between medicolegal requirements and the safety of personnel managing the bodies of the deceased with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection it is impossible for ipfn malaysia to work and plan in isolation and thus local collective contributions from various government agencies has been assembled to maximize the capacity to manage the dead based on the prevailing regulations and legislation in the country in the initial phase a guideline on management of the dead for all covid-19 suspected or confirmed deaths within the hospitals as well as from outside the hospitals brought-in-dead cases by police is produced and sufficient training is delivered not only for the healthcare workers but also to the first responders who are also at risk when managing the dead due to covid-19 when mortuaries are overloaded with infectious remains adopting the concept of a quarantine centre to locate covid-19 patients if their numbers become overwhelming there is a need to relocate the remains of all decedents who were infected with covid-19 to a temporary mortuary centre known as the covid-19 centralized body facility this paper aims to share malaysias strategies for management of the dead in different phases of the covid-19 pandemic whereby every opportunity and assistance must be given to suffering families and communities to mourn their loved ones these steps include allowing next-of-kin the chance for a modified but safe religious or ritual last rites and a dignified temporary controlled burial for unidentified victims in times of crisis and emergency the dead can still be managed with the appropriate level of dignity and respect as part of the core of the humanitarian forensic approach everyone in the society must be treated without discrimination in relation to the measures put in place to address this covid-19 pandemic including the proper management of the dead particularly the unidentified deceased who should also be treated with dignity and respect forensic disciplines contributes equally in the combat of covid-19 integrating law and medicine and working closely with police funeral directors and other related authorities in managing the dead issues with storage and decomposition shortages of staff and appropriately equipped mortuaries and other crippled resources can cause bodies to accumulate if they are not managed in a timely manner improvised procedures and guidelines for the management of large numbers of decedents have to be put in place to handle the increased volume of bodies there is a need to integrate sufficient legal complexities into the social context as well as the consideration of the safety of personnel managing the dead during this unprecedented time it is imperative to plan and take every necessary step during this pandemic for the management of the dead in the country as a basic human right 
in times of crisis and emergency the dead can still be managed with the appropriate level of dignity and respectmanagement of the dead is flexible where improvised procedures within the structure of the existing regulations can be modified to handle the increased volume of bodies during pandemicthere is no one-size-fits-all approach to the management of the deada covid-19 centralized body facility is a temporary mortuary centre for all covid-19 deaths within a countrytemporary controlled burial has been adopted as an option that allows the future identification of victims of the pandemic

predicted to process the n-proximal regions of the ecov pp1a fig 1 and table 2 the most striking differences between the ecov replicase and other group 2 coronaviruses replicases were identified in nsp3 the ecov nsp3 protein has 3 aa deletions and 55 aa insertions compared to the nsp3 proteins of bcov hcov-oc43 and phev three viruses phylogenetically most closely related to ecov these insertions and deletions are clustered at two regions the ac domain and the region between the pl2pro and the y domain the functional significance of these insertions and deletions is unknown as yet however the functions of pl1pro pl2pro and adrp are not anticipated to be affected since insertions and deletions are not located in the functional domains of these enzymes fig 1 orf2 nt 2161022446 of ecov-nc99 encodes the predicted ns2 protein with 278 amino acids the ns2 of ecov has 67 67 and 45 amino acid identity with the respective ns2 proteins of bcov hcov-oc43 and phev the lower amino acid identity with phev may be attributable to the fact that phev has a truncated ns2 protein vijgen et al 2006 sequence analysis revealed that the ecov ns2 protein contains a domain aa 46135 with similarity to the putative cyclic phosphodiesterase cpd martzen et al 1999 the cpd domain has also been identified in the ns2 proteins of other group 2a coronaviruses as well as in the 3end of the pp1a protein of toroviruses gorbalenya et al 2006 snijder et al 1991 snijder et al 2003 the ns2 of ecov was predicted to contain 9 potential phosphorylation sites the ns2 of ecov does not contain a signal peptide and is a non-secretory protein the function of the ns2 protein in coronaviruses has not been studied in detail it is known that the ns2 gene is non-essential for mhv replication in transformed cells schwarz et al 1990 however a recent study showed that a point mutation in the ns2 of mhv led to its attenuation in mice in spite of its wild-type replication in tissue culture sperry et al 2005 orf3

residues 13311363 following multiple alignments with the s proteins of other group 2a coronaviruses a potential cleavage recognition sequence rrqrr was identified at residues 764768 which would predict a cleavage between amino acids 768 and 769 separating the ecov s protein into s1 and s2 subunits fig 1 the ecov s1 subunit is expected to contain a receptor-binding domain whose position has not yet been determined the s2 subunit is predicted to mediate membrane fusion two heptad repeat hr regions which are conserved in position and sequence among the three groups of coronaviruses and play important roles in membrane fusion see reviews of eckert and kim 2001 hernandez et al 1996 were identified in the ecov s2 subunit hr1 aa 9911092 hr2 aa 12591304 fig 1 the ecov s2 subunit is anticipated to possess a fusion peptide whose position is yet unknown some coronavirus s proteins have been shown to contain important neutralization epitopes godet et al 1994 kubo et al 1994 yoo et

transmembrane domain was predicted at residues 1836 by tmpred analysis or at residues 1537 by tmhmm analysis both programs predicted the n-terminus of the protein to be external to the cell surface or viral envelope in the case of other coronaviruses there is increasing evidence that the e protein together with the m protein is instrumental in viral assembly and budding the cytoplasmic tails of both proteins have an important interactive role in this process corse and machamer 2000 corse and machamer 2002 corse and machamer 2003 vennema et al 1996 orf8 nt 2866129353 of ecov-nc99 encodes the

tmpred analysis or at positions 2544 4971 and 81103 by tmhmm analysis the n-terminal 24 amino acid residues were predicted to be outside and the c-terminal 127 or 128-amino acid hydrophilic domain was predicted to be inside the virus one potential n-glycosylation site was predicted at position 26 nfs the presence of potential o-glycosylation sites was predicted at the extreme n-terminus of the m protein msstptpapgyt whether these sites are glycosylated or not needs to be experimentally verified previous studies have shown that the m protein of group 1 and 3 coronaviruses eg tgev and ibv are n-glycosylated whereas the m protein of group 2 coronavirus mhv is only o-glycosylated de haan et al 2002 lai et al 2006 the m protein is the most abundant envelope component and plays a key role in coronavirus assembly by interacting with the e s n and he proteins bosch et al 2005 de haan and rottier 2005 orf9a nt 2936330703 of ecov-nc99 encodes the predicted n protein containing 446 amino acids

interaction with the viral rna genome to form a viral nucleocapsid interaction with the m protein and the ability for self-association masters 1992 narayanan et al 2000 narayanan et al 2003 recently it has also been reported that the n protein may play a role in coronavirus replication almazan et al 2004 schelle et al 2005 orf9b nt 2942430044 of ecov-nc99 encodes a hypothetical protein i containing 206 amino acids within orf9a which encodes the n protein it was predicted to contain 10 potential phosphorylation sites no signal peptide or any transmembrane helix was present in the case of mhv expression of the protein i has been detected in virus-infected cells but this protein is nonessential for viral replication and viral production fischer et al 1997 it is generally accepted that the replicase proteins are directly synthesized from the coronavirus genome whereas the structural and accessory proteins are expressed from a nested set of subgenomic mrnas however the number of sg mrnas and the characteristics and expression pattern of the proteins they encode eg a sg mrna may sometimes express multiple proteins varies for each virus in order to investigate ecov sg mrna synthesis northern blot analysis was performed to evaluate the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic rnas in ecov-infected cells a digoxigenin-labeled rna probe complementary to the 3 end nt 3066030946 of the ecov genome was used for a northern blot hybridization analysis as shown in fig 2
 nine mrnas were detected in ecov-infected hrt-18g cells at 72 h pi absence of such mrnas in mock-infected cells confirms that these mrnas are ecov-specific according to the estimated sizes of the mrnas it is reasonable to assume that sg mrnas 28 express the ns2 he s p47 p127 e and m proteins respectively and that mrna 9 expresses the n protein and probably the i protein as well there is a general agreement that the trs elements determine the fusion sites of the 5 leader and the 3 body segments in coronavirus sg mrnas in order to determine the precise location of the leader and body trss used for ecov sg mrna synthesis the leaderbody junction and flanking sequences of each ecov sg mrna were determined using sg mrna-specific rtpcrs see table 3
and materials and methods for details the sg mrna sequences were aligned to the leader and corresponding body genomes as shown in fig 3
 analysis of the leaderbody junction sequences revealed that the core sequence of the trs motifs is 5ucuaaac3 the leader trs 5ucuaaac3 and the body trs 5ucuaaac3 used for synthesizing he mrna s mrna and n mrna exactly match each other there is one mismatch between the leader trs and the body trs 5ucuaaaa3 used for generating the mrna of the ns2 protein there is also one mismatch between the leader trs and the body trs 5uccaaac3 used for generating e mrna and m mrna there are two mismatches between the leader trs and the body trs 5uuaaaac3 used for generating the mrna of the p47 protein interestingly in the case of the mrna of the p127 protein the leader and the body segment is joined at the unusual consensus variant 5uaaacuuuauaa3 previously it has been shown that the mrna of the p127 protein of bcov also utilizes an unusual consensus variant for joining the leader and body segment hofmann et al 1993 from the sequence data we conclude that the ecov common leader on sg mrnas is the first 64 nucleotides of the ecov genome phylogenetic analyses of ecov and other coronaviruses were performed based on the amino acid sequences of replicase polyprotein pp1a the orf1b-encoded part of the pp1ab s e m and n phylogenetic analysis clustered coronaviruses into three major groups g1 g2a and g3 irrespective of the gene used for analysis fig 4
 the sars-cov forms a separate branch and is classified as subgroup 2b g2b as suggested previously gorbalenya et al 2004 snijder et al 2003 phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that ecov falls into the cluster of group 2a coronaviruses and is most closely related to bcov hcov-oc43 and phev to further explore the possible evolutionary relationships among ecov bcov hcov-oc43 and phev the genetic distances of ecov bcov and phev to hcov-oc43 were determined over the entire genome using the simplot analysis lole et al 1999 as shown in fig 5
 the bcov strains and hcov-oc43 had lowest genetic distances over the complete genome the genetic distance between phev and hcov-oc43 was similar to the distance between bcov and hcov-oc43 in most regions of the genome with exception of the spike gene where the genetic distance of phev to hcov-oc43 was significantly greater than the distance of bcov to hcov-oc43 the genetic distance of ecov to hcov-oc43 was significantly greater than the distance of either bcov or phev to hcov-oc43 in the regions of the first half of orf1a the central part of orf1b ns2 and he genes the genetic distance with respect to the spike gene between ecov and hcov-oc43 was similar to the distance between phev and hcov-oc43 but greatly higher than the distance between bcov and hcov-oc43 the genetic distances of bcov and phev to hcov-oc43 observed in this study are consistent with previously reported findings vijgen et al 2005 vijgen et al 2006 vijgen et al 2006 vijgen et al 2005 concluded that phev diverged from the common ancestor before bcov and hcov-oc43 our analysis suggested that ecov had diverged earlier than phev from a common ancestor in summary ecov had emerged earlier than phev bcov and hcov-oc43 notwithstanding the fact that ecov was not isolated until 1999 from a diarrheic foal in usa in this study we have determined the first complete genome sequence of ecov and provided the first comprehensive analysis of the ecov genome completion of the genome sequence of ecov will contribute to our understanding of this virus at the molecular level and also enrich the database of

2019 covid-19 which is caused by sars-cov-2 was officially named by the world health organization who on feb 11 2020 till apr 22 2020 covid-19 has caused more than 2584545 patients worldwide 1  cluster 17 c3 not included in this study population returned shaoyang city from wuhan on jan19 2020 three relatives of c3 were identified as covid-19 infection after several days of closely contacted with c3 none of them had contacted with the other suspected infectors during those days her sister-in-low c37 was confirmed on feb 1 2020 her sister c44 and mother c49 were confirmed on feb 4 2020 but so far c3 had never developed any symptoms weather c3 is an asymptomatic infection did not been identified by pcr test but the same contact history and the similar onset time of her three relatives

clinical characteristic of 104 outside-wuhan patients with covid-19 first the smoothly increase in the cumulative number of confirmations of the two centers indicates that the timely control measures work well second family clusters represent as the major body of infections transmission along the chain of 3 generations was observed the asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us it may bring more risk to the spread of covid-19 third no gender difference of patients was found indicating male and female may have the same susceptibility of this illness fourth the differences in demographics and clinical characteristics between imported patients and indigenous cases were not significant since the outbreak in wuhan it is unclear how many people truly infected and how many infected people of wuhan has imported to the other cities screening the potential infectors related to wuhan was implemented quickly by the local governments after the announced of wuhan shutdown dynamic analysis of 104 cases from two centers in hunan province showed that the imported cases mainly appeared during jan 22 2019 to feb 5 2020 then the indigenous cases became the major body suggesting the initial cases have been founded over nearly 20 days of screening compared with the accepted article contemporary growth trend in wuhan explosive increase in the confirmed cases was not observed in the two centers from jan 22 2019 to feb 12 2020 indicating that the timely control measures in the two cities worked well yet fundamental information gaps exist on how to accurately assess the transmission efficiency while the controversy of sharply increased cases and medical shortage in the early and outbreak stage in wuhan patients in wuhan may have limitation to fully reflect the true epidemiological characteristics of this illness evidence has suggested person-to-person transmission of covid-19 via droplets or skin touch 2311  the data of this study showed a notable feature is clustering occurrence most patients were infected from their family members relatives or friends through a close contact only 11 1053 of this study patients were sporadic cases that hardly identified infector source suggesting that community transmission of covid-19 is not developed rapidly in the two cities this also matches the smooth growth of total confirmed cases of note strict control measures by the local government produced a powerful effect on the slowing spread we are eager to know how infectious the virus is except the confirmed cases whether the asymptomatic covid-19-carriers has the infectious is unclear a recent study showed that the viral load in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients 12  our study directly demonstrated that the asymptomatic patient or viral-carries infected their relatives three cases c37 c44 and c49 infected from the accepted article same person c3 who ever traveled to wuhan but until now c3 did not develop any symptoms though we did not take a pcr test to confirm whether c3 was a virus-carrier the same contact history and the similar onset time of her three relatives indicate that c3 was an asymptomatic covid-19-carrier five asymptomatic patients were found in this study one patient c4 who infected three family members c92 c94 and c102 provide evidence that the asymptomatic transmission risks the spread of covid-19 which brings more difficult to cut off the epidemics transmission route we  the others  23   c1c2c3c4c8c9c15c20c24c27c29c30c33c38c46c50c62c63c64c67   seasonality and selective trends in viral acute respiratory tract infections patrick shaw stewart d   
when you have eliminated all which is impossible then whatever remains however improbable must be the trutha conan-doyle the case-book of sherlock holmes 1927
 the lack of a sound explanation for the seasonality of viral acute respiratory tract infections varis is a major problem for microbiology 1 2 3 4 other anomalous features of varis need to be explained too for example vari epidemics often erupt very rapidly after ambient temperature drops the increase may however be too rapid and too short-lived to be the result of increased transmission 5 as discussed below surveys also show that epidemics often occur simultaneously throughout wide geographical areas 5 6 7 see fig 1 fig 2
 moreover influenza epidemics often cease very abruptly even when many susceptible individuals remain in the population 7 the viruses that cause varis include many unrelated families such as double-stranded dna viruses eg adenovirus positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses eg coronavirus negative-sense single-stranded rna viruses eg respiratory syncytial virus rsv influenza measles mumps and parainfluenza virus and positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses eg hand foot and mouth virus rhinovirus rubella virus they differ in their physical forms with some having a lipid envelope eg coronavirus influenza and parainfluenza viruses which many others eg adenovirus and rhinovirus lack some are icosahedral eg adenovirus rhinovirus and rubella virus whereas many are spherical filamentous or variable eg rsv influenza and measles viruses it is notable that the great majority of these diverse and often distantly-related strains share the same seasonality in temperate regions for example hope-simpson found in both 1954 and 1955 that the number of people suffering from colds in a sample of 380 volunteers was roughly 50 times greater in february than at the beginning of september 3 fig 3
 the common cold is caused by over 200 serologically-distinct strains 8 it is clear that the great majority of these strains share the same seasonality in temperate regions since colds in general show such strong seasonality however variations in the precise timing of the various respiratory viruses within the cold season have been reported and it has been suggested that these variations might reflect fundamental differences in the mechanisms of replication or transmission of the viruses involved 4 9 10 11 for example rhinovirus is particularly prevalent in the autumn 12 while rsv and influenza usually cause outbreaks around the turn of the year 12 several comments can be made here 1 very few varis have been found that consistently show the opposite seasonality with more outbreaks in summer than in winter for example a study at a childrens hospital in mainz germany that used modern diagnostic tests found that 7 out of 10 varis displayed normal seasonality since these 7 showed significant inverse correlations with ambient temperature p-value  0001 4 the remaining 3 were weakly inversely correlated with temperature a counter-example was reported by hope-simpson 13 although the tendency was weak of the type 3 parainfluenza viruses isolated by him over 14 years 66 were collected in the warm semester 2 studies show that the reported variations in the timing of particular varis are in fact rather inconsistent for example rsv in children in mainz peaked in spring in 2002 and 2006 but in the winters of the intervening years 4 3 it is possible that certain varis are more prevalent in say spring and autumn as a result of interference by other viral strains during winter for example the immune systems of hosts may frequently be activated by certain dominant viruses during the winter months reducing the likelihood of subsequent infection by less active strains the patterns of varis in the mainz study suggest the existence of such interference compare the relatively smooth curve of all respiratory illnesses in fig 1 in 4 with the irregular occurrences of the individual varis shown in fig 1 fig 2 of that report these trends imply the existence of important mechanisms concerned with viral replication or transmission that are common to the majority of respiratory viruses in spite of their widely-differing physical structures and biochemistry it seems likely that an explanation of seasonality would have far-reaching practical and economic implications for treating and protecting humans and animals from varis microbiologists have put forward many explanations of the seasonality of varis proposed explanations of influenza seasonality for example include factors that change host contact rates school closures ambient temperature and precipitation factors that may influence virus survival outside the body relative humidity absolute humidity solar radiation and temperature and factors that may change the immunity of hosts humidity photoperiodicity temperature viral interference as well as deficiency of selenium vitamin c vitamin d and vitamin e 1 factors that may change the behavior of viruses at the biochemical level are seldom considered the same or similar explanations have been put forward for other respiratory viruses 4 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 however these well-known explanations are very difficult to reconcile with a straightforward observation the varis in question are present in many tropical regions at intermediate levels throughout the year  often at much higher levels than in the summer in temperate locations 1 2 moreover surveys show that the viral species that commonly cause varis in the tropics are similar to those in other climates for example the four most frequently identified viruses in two large hospitals in a tropical location singapore 19901994 were in order of prevalence rsv parainfluenza influenza a and adenovirus 10 most samples came from hospitalized children a similar study in an oceanic climate mainz germany 19982002 found that the four viruses that were most frequently identified among hospitalized children were in order rhinovirus rsv adenovirus and influenza a 4 in buenos aires 20032006 a city with a humid subtropical climate they were rsv influenza a adenovirus and parainfluenza 9 note that rsv influenza a and adenovirus are present on all three lists almost all of the explanations of influenza and other vari seasonality mentioned above are associated with parameters that have more extreme values in the tropics throughout the year than in temperate summers since similar viral species are present in all these locations it is likely that some strains will migrate from tropical to temperate regions where according to the explanations put forward they should be replicated and transmitted without difficulty during the summer months the migration of influenza has been investigated in great detail recently using time-stamped viral sequences these studies show that influenza does indeed frequently migrate from hotter to colder geographical regions for example the data of bedford et al shows that 50 of european ah3n2 influenza strains were descended from strains that were in tropical or subtropical regions one year earlier 19 for ah1n1 bvictoria-like and byamagata-like influenza strains the proportions were 62 17 and 32 respectively 19 ah3n2 influenza in particular circulates continuously in east and southeast asia and spreads to temperate regions from this network 19 20 so we would certainly expect it to have properties that allow it to be active during temperate summers the predominant direction of migration of influenza in china is also of interest on a one-year timescale h3n2 h1n1 and byamagata161988-like influenza were more likely to migrate from south to north china than in the opposite direction 19 the trend is not universal however bvictoria21987-like influenza was more likely to migrate from north to south china 19 note also that influenza and other varis often show clear seasonality in the tropics that is not correlated with temperature humidity or solar radiation but instead coincides with the rainy season 1 10 the strange global and seasonal distribution of influenza and other varis is shown schematically in fig 4
 these issues were discussed in two recent reviews of influenza seasonality both of which also noted the lack of a satisfactory explanation 1 2 it is a remarkable fact that almost all varis share the same seasonality in temperate regions pcr-based studies discussed below confirm this common seasonality 9 4 it is highly improbable that this common trend is coincidental and this review will assume that an unrecognized common thread runs through the transmission or replication of respiratory viruses if it were possible more consistent conclusions might be arrived at by focusing instead on particular varis but unfortunately the relevant data are not yet available i will therefore consider influenza the best-studied vari as well as colds and other varis always bearing in mind that important differences may exist between the various viral species considered ambient temperature often has a dramatic effect on respiratory disease in the uk hajat et al found that general practitioner consultations by elderly patients for lower respiratory tract infections in one uk city norwich increased by 19 for every degree that average temperature dropped below 5 c observed 020 days before the consultation 14 absolute temperature however is not correlated with varis in a simple way for example we do not see a vari that is limited to all global regions or seasons where temperatures never rise above say 15 c fig 4 instead evidence from many different sources shows that vari incidence is related to temperature fluctuations for example van loghem conducted a very extensive survey of varis in the winter of 192526 with 6933 participants from all regions of the netherlands 5 his data is shown in fig 1 together with the temperatures recorded by five dutch weather stations epidemics of varis in all seven regions were very closely synchronized with each other and closely correlated with inverted temperature with roughly a one week lag ie lower temperatures were associated with increased varis these correlations were strongest during the period when temperatures were generally falling ie the first half of the cold season note also that the highest infection rate which occurred at the start of the study coincided with almost the highest temperature in the study just prior to the start of the study however the temperature declined after remaining nearly steady during the summer months  implying that the temperature dip triggered the epidemic this emphasizes that we need to consider temperature fluctuations rather than absolute temperature levels milam and smillie found similar patterns on the tropical island of st john in the virgin islands in 1929 shown in fig 5
21 between mid-afternoon and midnight each day the temperature on the island fell sharply by 57 c when the temperature dipped in the autumn by 15 c green bar below the summer range an epidemic of colds was triggered more recently jaakkola et al found that sudden declines in both air temperature and absolute humidity in the three days that preceded the reporting of the sickness increased the incidence of influenza a and b in military conscripts in northern finland 22 paradoxically the incidence of influenza was lower at very low temperatures and it was the sudden decline of temperature rather than low absolute temperature and the authors suggested the decline of humidity that increased the risk of influenza historical studies have some advantages over modern investigations the study by van loghem was on a scale that would be difficult today and he was able to collect data from multiple geographical locations within the netherlands fig 1 the study by milam and smillie has the advantage that the island was very isolated so that a limited set of viruses was studied fig 5 modern studies however have the great advantage that they can identify the viral species involved two recent studies in argentina and germany compared weather parameters with hospital admissions of children suffering from known varis 4 9 both studies found that the combined number of cases for all pathogens was strongly inversely correlated with outside temperature viegas et al plotted the frequencies of rsv adenovirus influenza a virus and parainfluenza virus alongside mean temperature in buenos aires 9 on all plots clear seasonality is apparent but adenovirus and parainfluenza virus clearly lagged behind inverted temperature peaking in early spring du prel et al presented similar plots and reported that rhinovirus rsv influenza a adenovirus metapneumovirus influenza b and coronavirus were all strongly inversely correlated with temperature in mainz germany p
  0001 in all cases rhinovirus was also correlated with relative humidity p
  0001 4 this study and the buenos aires study used spearmans ranked correlation coefficients to find associations between meteorological parameters and hospitalizations for viral and bacterial infections 4 9 this tabular information is difficult to interpret however because correlation coefficients dramatically underestimate the closeness of a relationship when one of the parameters lags behind the other eg if two data sets are perfectly correlated except that one lags by a quarter of a cycle the correlation coefficient will be 0 it is therefore possible that associations with temperature were present in mainz for enterovirus parainfluenza types 1 and 3 mycoplasma and chlamydophila but not made evident by the correlation coefficients that the authors calculated for example rhinovirus in mainz had a spearman rank correlation coefficient with inverted temperature of only 042 but inspection of the plots shows a clear relationship with the first rhinovirus epidemic of each season closely following the first major drop in temperature at the end of summer 4 we can conclude that both papers show important correlations with weather although other important relationships may not have been fully revealed by the analysis it is also apparent that varis caused by completely unrelated viruses share the same seasonality both in a city with a humid subtropical climate and in a city with an oceanic climate it is very unlikely that these relationships are purely coincidental which emphasizes that we should look for common causes of seasonality in these and other varis studies at the individual level show that physical host chilling can increase the severity of varis the possible mechanisms involved will be discussed below the eurowinter group showed that shivering outside being stationary outside and wearing inadequate winter clothing increased respiratory disease-related mortality while outdoor exertion sufficient to cause sweating was protective 15 yanagawa et al found that 11 of 13 patients recovering from cardiopulmonary arrest who were treated with mild hypothermia developed pneumonia as compared to 6 of 15 control patients who were maintained at normal body temperature p-value  002 23 costilla-esquivel et al found a relationship between weather and acute respiratory illnesses in monterrey mexico which they were able to model very accurately using only three weather parameters weekly accumulated rainfall minimum temperature in the week and weekly median relative humidity 16 rainfall and relative humidity were positively correlated with respiratory illnesses while temperature was negatively correlated both rainfall and low temperature can obviously cause personal chilling while high relative humidity is a consequence of the other two in summary the available evidence shows that both sudden weather changes and factors that cause individual chilling frequently bring on varis or increase their severity this suggests that temperature sensitivity plays a role in seasonality but the global patterns of varis rule out the possibility that viral activity is controlled solely by absolute temperature rather respiratory viruses seems to adapt over a few weeks or months to the ambient temperature such that temperature fluctuations outside the previous range trigger varis shaman et al proposed absolute humidity as a physically sound driver of influenza seasonality in temperate regions 26 however unlike say concentrated sulfuric acid or anhydrous salts influenza virions cannot scavenge low concentrations of water from dry air since virions are produced at moderate temperatures and pressures and are in equilibrium with physiological fluids during their production the absolute humidity that virions may be subjected to therefore has little or no significance instead as with most biological phenomena temperature and relative humidity are the meaningful parameters that should be considered either singly or in combination absolute humidity does however have significance in the context of indoor viral survival and transmission since indoor temperatures in wealthy societies are maintained by heating systems at roughly constant levels throughout the year indoor relative humidity is roughly determined by outdoor absolute humidity variations in absolute humidity may therefore contribute to influenza seasonality in some instances several points need to be considered however 1 reports of the effect of relative humidity on the survival of influenza virions at room temperature are inconsistent whereas harper found that roughly twice as many viable pr8 virions were recovered after storage at 50 relative humidity in comparison to 64 27 schaffer et al saw the opposite trend with their wsn virions from cell cultures with roughly an order of magnitude lower recovery of virions at 50 relative humidity in comparison to 65 28 2 influenza and most other vari epidemics are more frequent in the tropics during the rainy season when both relative and absolute humidity levels are high 1 10 for example fortaleza in brazil has a single large peak of influenza 1 and from personal experience other varis that coincides with the rainy season january to july 3 animal experiments with guinea pigs show that while transmission of influenza generally decreased with increasing relative humidity it actually increased at 20 c when relative humidity moved from 50 to 65 29 animal experiments with influenza are further discussed below turning to another common vari du prel et al explain the observed correlation of rhinovirus with relative humidity by pointing out that rhinoviruses cannot survive in a dry environment ie they suggest that the seasonality of rhinovirus is driven by changes in the survival rate of the virions outside the body 4 however other interpretations are possible increased relative humidity is associated with rainfall which can wet individuals clothing and cause chilling moreover as noted above indoor relative humidity in temperate climates is much lower in winter than in summer due to the effects of artificial heating in winter 3 changes in the survival of rhinoviruses due to indoor relative humidity should therefore generate the opposite seasonality if transmission mainly occurs indoors which seems likely observations of the incidence of colds in the uk found no correlation with relative humidity or watervapor pressure 17 analysis of over 5000 person-years of data in two uk cities demonstrated that it is the low outdoor temperature independent of the humidity which is associated with the increased number of winter colds 17 clearly correlations of varis with both relative and absolute humidity are at best inconsistent experiments with guinea pigs suggest that the transmission of influenza a is more efficient at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity 29 lowen et al found a 35-fold increase in the transmission of human influenza a between guinea pigs at 5 c compared to at 20 c 29 in fact this was true only at 50 relative humidity at higher and lower humidity transmission rates were either similar at both temperatures or higher at 20 c these differences are in agreement with measurements of the stability of influenza a virions generated in cell cultures in air of different temperatures and humidities 27 28 this might suggest that variations in transmission due to weather changes might determine or influence the seasonality of influenza and other varis in temperate regions the results were however inconsistent for example transmission of influenza at 20 c was higher at 65 relative humidity that at 50 29 moreover a more recent study found that the transmission of influenza between guinea pigs by medium-range aerosol was eliminated at 30 c although transfer between animals in the same enclosure by short-range aerosol or direct contact was as efficient at 30 c as at 20 c 30 the authors postulate that the normal mode of influenza transmission varies depending on climate in temperate regions aerosol transmission may predominate while in the tropics short-range and contact transmission may be more important epidemics of h3n2 influenza in the temperate regions are however seeded each year from a network of temporarily overlapping epidemics in east and southeast asia 20 there is therefore no reason why influenza cannot be transmitted by the contact route in the summer months into and within the temperate regions lowen et al recognize this difficulty and they postulate the existence of unknown additional factors other than warm temperature and high relative humidity which suppress influenza transmission by all routes during the summer months in temperate regions 30 although the authors may have identified the important routes of influenza transmission at different latitudes they have therefore not provided a robust explanation of its seasonality viruses such as adenovirus 31 rsv 32 foot-and-mouth virus 33 and chickenpox virus - all of which can spread via the respiratory tract  are known to become dormant within their hosts other respiratory viruses show similar behavior sometimes on shorter timescales morikawa et al found human parechovirus adenovirus enterovirus coronavirus 229e and hku1 and rhinovirus in the gargle specimens of eight asymptomatic children using polymerase chain reaction pcr tests 34 the tests required at least 100 copies of the genetic material suggesting that the viruses in question had begun to replicate 34 however the authors noted that it is difficult to interpret pcr results because it is a very sensitive method and the positive results may reflect an asymptomatic past or concurrent infection or an imminent infection their data suggest however that at least some were imminent infections four of the children had positive results when they were asymptomatic that were followed four weeks later by a vari that was associated with the same virus or a strain that was indistinguishable using the pcr test rhinovirus was detected in a fifth child who was at first asymptomatic but experienced the symptoms of a cold caused by rhinovirus one week later similarly viral dormancy may explain the sudden arrival of autumn epidemics of rhinovirus in temperate regions granados et al studied rhinovirus activity in university students and showed that asymptomatic rhinovirus activity preceded peak symptomatic activity in september and october and was associated with lower viral load 18 influenza viruses have been detected several times in the absence of symptoms or an immune response in the host which seems to indicate that dormant influenza virus is present foy et al identified 10 asymptomatic individuals who were shedding influenza b virus but did not respond with antibody by any of the five test methods employed 35 during the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic tandale et al found that of 65 asymptomatic individuals with pcr-confirmed h1n1 12 had not seroconverted 36 during the same pandemic papenburg et al found two asymptomatic individuals with pcr-confirmed infections who had not seroconverted 37 in vietnam thai et al found that of 11 individuals shown by pcr to have been infected with pandemic h1n1 by other members of their household one remained asymptomatic and had not seroconverted 38 the authors commented that this may indicate that viral rna remained in the respiratory tract without being internalized and eliciting an immune response these observations show the reality of influenza persistence in the respiratory tracts of asymptomatic individuals and are compatible with the suggestion that virions can become dormant and later be reactivated for example by chilling observations of varis in antarctic stations after many months of complete isolation can provide evidence that is easy to interpret because varis are rare after the first month of isolation 24 and only one or a few viral species are active at a time for example after 12 months of complete isolation in 19656 a geologist jeh at the mawson station picked up a respiratory virus from a visiting field party 24 17 days later he and three colleagues were exposed to cold and damp conditions which brought on vari symptoms including muscle aches and a sore throat in jeh and two of his colleagues another study at adelaide island in 1969 found that after 17 weeks of complete isolation several men developed colds four days after the air temperature fell in one day from 0 c to 24 c 25 both studies suggest that chilling caused by particular activities or weather changes can activate dormant virions giving rise to varis similarly muchmore et al reported parainfluenza shedding by healthy young adults throughout the 8-month winter isolation period at amundsenscott south pole station during 1978 39 the study recorded two episodes of respiratory illness caused by parainfluenza at the station that year after 10 and 29 weeks of complete social isolation in principle any failure or blockage of a biochemical or physical step in the replication or transmission of respiratory viruses might give rise to dormancy moreover many respiratory viruses including coronavirus influenza measles and mumps virus require activation by proteolytic cleavage of viral proteins 40 this largely unexplained phenomenon may provide opportunities for the establishment of dormancy nevertheless visualization of the physical whereabouts of the virus during the weeks or months that dormancy can last is difficult the virus might be located on the surface of the cells that line the respiratory tract for example attached to the cell membrane or the cilia or within the cells possibly in the cytoplasm or the nuclei although it seems unlikely that respiratory viruses are usually incorporated into the host genome as is hiv there are problems with each of these explanations but pcr and antarctic studies show the reality of viral dormancy taken together the above observations strongly suggest that a variety of respiratory viruses can become dormant in human hosts for much longer periods than those reported in the literature 41 and that they can subsequently be activated by cold giving rise to varis a popular explanation of vari seasonality is that contact rates are lower in summer when children are out of school and when people spend more time outdoors however in the usa seasonal differences in crowding are minimal since the amount of time spent indoors varies by less than 10 between summer and winter 1 in the uk the number of school-days in the coldest six months of the year is less than 10 higher than in the warmest six months but like all temperate countries the uk has marked vari seasonality moreover one of the two peaks of influenza activity in singapore 1 actually coincides with the school holidays in june another negative observation is that festivals and sporting events are not associated with increased varis for example during the fifa world cup people spend more time indoors and often crowd together in bars etc to watch matches on television but no significant increase is apparent in google flu search activity in any country in the northern hemisphere during the 2014 fifa world cup 42 lofgren et al agreed that theoretical and empirical studies do not adequately explain influenza a seasonality noting in particular that no published studies show directly that variations in crowding give rise to influenza seasonality 1 another problem for this explanation of seasonality is the simultaneous arrival of influenza 6 7 and other varis 5 throughout wide geographical areas often following or coinciding with cold snaps fig 1 fig 3 fig 5 if cold weather acted on varis only by increasing viral transmission then as the temperature falls eg in autumn waves of infection should appear and move through populations we would not expect to see epidemics that arise simultaneously in both neighboring fig 1 and distant fig 2 populations this point is discussed in more detail in the next section in summary temperature-dependent changes in human crowding may well play a role in the progress of vari epidemics but there is no evidence that they provide a general or the main driver of vari seasonality this is currently the most popular explanation of seasonality the mechanism is however almost certainly not the main cause of seasonality for several clear reasons firstly this explanation cannot explain why varis are present in many tropical regions all year round but virtually absent from temperate regions during the summer months if respiratory virions can adequately survive outside the body in the tropics they should have no difficulty in surviving according to this explanation in the milder conditions of temperate summers as noted above a similar set of viruses give rise to varis that hospitalized children in temperate subtropical and tropical cities 4 9 10 and they presumably migrate between these locations seed strains of influenza a h3n2 spread from east and southeast asia to temperate regions every year 20 and other respiratory viruses may follow similar routes the suggestion 22 28 29 that low absolute or relative humidity may increase viral survival does not help because vari epidemics occur during the rainy season in many tropical locations 1 secondly consider van loghems data 5 fig 1 while temperatures were generally decreasing ie up to the end of january varis were very well-correlated with inverted temperature and extraordinarily well-synchronized across the country with no evidence of waves of infection moving between different locations which would be expected if cold temperatures increased transmission during the study we dont know which viruses were most prevalent in the study but if any had seasonality that was driven by m2 it is clear that they were not common hope-simpson made similar observations when he compared influenza epidemics 196974 in the uk and in prague czechoslovakia showing the temporal correspondence of epidemics at widely separated localities at a similar latitude 7 see fig 2 in another example magrassi was impressed by cases of influenza in 1948 among shepherds living in complete social isolation in open country in sardinia who developed the disease contemporaneously with the inhabitants of towns on the same island 6 a third consideration is that records of vari epidemics show that they frequently respond to temperature fluctuations rather than absolute temperature levels for example the rapid drop in temperature during weeks 68 of van loghems study pink band labeled i1 in fig 1 was followed with a lag of roughly one week by rapid increases in varis when the temperature subsequently hovered around 0 c in weeks 9 and 10 yellow band labeled i2 however the number of varis stabilized if the rapid 70 increase in varis that occurred at temperatures between 10 and 0 c pink band was caused by increased transmission we would then expect varis to continue to increase when temperatures stabilized around 0 c a little later weeks 12 and 13 blue band labeled i3 the temperature was well below 0 c but now it was rising and the varis fell from their highs again emphasizing that varis tend to be sensitive to temperature fluctuations rather than absolute temperature a similar argument applies to the data of hope-simpson fig 3 with the number of colds increasing very rapidly after temperature drops but falling during two periods of constant low temperatures yellow bands labeled i1 and i2 in october and december 1954 milam and smillies data fig 5 also showed fast-acting sensitivity to very small temperature drops outside the recent range with these events occurring at a range of temperatures throughout the year 21 jaakkola et al reported that sudden declines of around 5 c preceded the onset of influenza in northern finland 22 occurring at temperatures above 15 c and also below 15 c other varis can be considered an interesting and clear-cut example comes from singapore where hii et al studied the strong association of hand foot and mouth disease hfmd with the weather 11 the risk of the disease increased by 41 for every 1 c that the weekly temperature difference increased above 7 c the authors concede that the exact reasons for the relationship between weather and hfmd are not known 11 again it is difficult to imagine that weather anomalies of the order of 1 c can significantly change the survival of respiratory viruses outside the body or indeed the susceptibility of human hosts to vrtis discussed in the next section if the transmission of varis including influenza were driven purely by low temperatures we would not expect to see the rapid cessation of influenza epidemics in mid-winter 7 or the low attack rates that have been reported within families for influenza 43 44 45 and other varis 5 in summary we can see that temperature-dependent changes in viral transmission may well influence the progress of many vari epidemics but unless new evidence comes to light we need to look elsewhere for a general explanation of the seasonality of varis an interesting and ingenious recent review looked directly at the seasonality of immune responses in humans by investigating antibody responses following vaccination 46 although the authors found seasonal variation in immunity it could not explain vari seasonality seven of the studies of vaccines reviewed reported a stronger immune response in winter than in summer with only 1 showing the opposite trend there was no clear trend with regard to the dry and rainy seasons in tropical regions and several other studies showed no trend at all these data therefore suggest that variations in general host susceptibility do not explain the seasonality of varis however this leaves open the possibility that there are variations in host immune defenses that specifically affect the respiratory tract eccles suggested that host chilling may cause reflex vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the upper airways thereby reducing host defenses against viral infection during the winter 47 48 49 mudd and grant 50 and van loghem 5 made similar proposals two lines of evidence support the idea that chilling reduces host respiratory tract defenses by this or other mechanisms foxman et al found that mouse airway cells infected with mouse-adapted rhinovirus 1b exhibited significantly lower expression levels of type i and type iii interferon genes and interferon-stimulated genes at 33 c relative to 37 c 51 this is a very interesting but puzzling result and the authors offer no explanation of the possible benefits to the mouse if airway cells possess mechanisms that can reduce infections it seems strange that they should be down-regulated at lower temperatures one explanation is that the interferons severely damage airway cells and the mouse prefers to deal with the virus with milder defenses unless it reaches sites where it may cause serious illness a related proposal is that mice permit the growth of viruses in their respiratory tracts in order to raise antibodies against them before the virus can reach the internal organs we need to wait for equivalent results in the cells of other species both in vitro and in vivo before we can fully interpret these data other support for m3 comes from a study by the eurowinter group which found that exposure to cold outdoor air can affect varis in opposite directions 50 shivering outside greatly increased respiratory disease-related mortality in agreement with eccles suggestions however outdoor exertion sufficient to cause sweating reduced mortality p-value  002 although breathing cold air rapidly is known to reduce the temperature of the respiratory tract 52 this is more difficult to explain but it seems clear that variations in host defenses are involved this is discussed in the next section other evidence however does not support m3 unless it is combined with m4 below since human immune defenses act well in a wide range of temperatures and climates the climates of northern scandinavia and southern india for example we would not expect temperature changes of 12 c to have a noticeable impact on host defenses against varis great sensitivity to temperature fluctuations is apparent however for example consider again chart 1 of milam and smillies paper 21 fig 5 every night in the summer the temperature dropped by 57 c in the autumn the temperature fell by an extra 15 c which triggered an epidemic of colds can we believe that the islanders immune systems could cope well with a regular 6 c drop but succumbed after a 75 c drop note that the absolute temperature after the dip  about 23 c at night  was still very comfortable and would certainly not cause a vari epidemic in say helsinki note also that there is often a peak of varis in the early autumn often associated with a rhinovirus epidemic 4 12 17 this peak can be seen for example in the very high level of colds at the beginning of the study by van loghem on 19 september 1925 5 fig 1 the number of varis was then much higher than during the rest of the cold season if we are going to say that the increase in varis in the cold season is due to the increased susceptibility of hosts in cold weather m3 it is difficult to explain why the human immune system appears to be less efficient in early autumn than in say february another problem for m3 is the abrupt cessation of influenza epidemics hope-simpson noted that all the major influenza epidemics that he recorded in cirencester uk 1951 1957 1959 1969 and 1973 rose rapidly to a single peak within four weeks then abruptly ceased in the following 45 weeks fig 1 in ref 7 in at least one case it was clear that this was not due to a lack of susceptible persons the h2n2 subtype arrived explosively for the first time in cirencester in september 1957 with over 100 individuals suffering from acute febrile respiratory diseases by the third week of october this epidemic abruptly ceased after only six weeks it is known for certain that many susceptible individuals remained in the towns population at that time because this was the first h2n2 epidemic and there was another h2n2 epidemic 16 months later which was almost as large as the first 7 the abrupt cessation of the first epidemic is therefore unexplained the other four major epidemics listed above were in midwinter when according to this view the immune system should be at its weakest suggesting that the virus should spread and the epidemic should continue for more than eight weeks numerous studies of the common cold in the 1950s and 60s used recycled pedigree viral strains that were collected from volunteers and used to inoculate subsequent volunteers these studies weigh against m3 because they found that chilling did not increase the likelihood of volunteers getting colds 53 54 55 56 these studies are discussed below taken together the available evidence suggests that temperature-dependent changes in host susceptibility m3 may play a role in the epidemiology of varis and may contribute to seasonality however changes in susceptibility alone cannot explain many observations of varis and it appears that this mechanism is not main driver of seasonality lwoff proposed in 1959 that the degree of virulence of viruses is related to their level of temperature sensitivity ie greater sensitivity to heat is correlated with reduced virulence 57 in 1979 richman and murphy confirmed this association and reviewed its implications for the development of live virus vaccines 58 they noted that the replication of temperature-sensitive ts
1 influenza parainfluenza rsv and foot-and-mouth viruses was consistently more restricted in the lungs of a variety of animals than in their nasal cavities they also found that both naturally-occurring and synthetic ts viruses were very frequently less virulent than their non-ts counterparts in humans and animals noting several cases including influenza and vaccinia virus where the loss of the ts phenotype resulted in the restoration of the virulence or growth capacity of the virus both in vivo and in vitro
58 chu et al later tested seven h1n1 strains with varying degrees of temperature sensitivity in volunteers and found a correlation between temperature sensitivity and the severity of symptoms with strains that were more ts being less virulent 59 it is reasonable to conclude that the ts phenotype facilitates the transmission of the wild virus because it prevents or reduces multiplication of the virus in the lungs or internal organs which is likely to result in the immobilization or possibly the death of the host one possible explanation of vari seasonality m4 is therefore that the lower temperatures of winter increase the activity and virulence of respiratory viruses as a side-effect of their tropism this may explain why nearly all respiratory viruses share the same seasonality it is known that there is a temperature gradient in the human respiratory tract from around 24 c at the glottis to around 355 c at the subsegmental bronchi 52 the temperature in the respiratory tract drops rapidly when the air being breathed is cold when the host breaths rapidly or  significantly  when the host is chilled 50 52 putting these observations together a simple explanation m4 of the seasonality and temperature sensitivity of varis can be proposed1one or several steps in the life-cycle of most wild respiratory viruses are ts these ts steps might include the release of virions from cells their binding to cells their entry into cells or any subsequent step in their replication see the biochemical evidence reviewed below2
ts virions that bind to cells lower down the respiratory tract therefore at relatively high temperatures may remain dormant at some unknown cellular location which might be on extracellular material on the surface of or within the cells that line the respiratory tract3virions that bind to cells higher up the respiratory tract therefore at relatively low temperatures may become active but will not normally cause a vari because they are active in low numbers at any one time and can be removed by the hosts immune system or if a proportion of virions are defective simultaneous invasion of each cell by several virions may be required to initiate infection4each day the temperature of the respiratory tract varies and this variation clears certain populations of virions from certain regions of the respiratory tract leaving other populations intact5if the temperature of the respiratory tract drops suddenly below its normal range batches of virions that were previously dormant may be activated simultaneously giving rise to a vari
 the virions binding sites in the respiratory tract might also reflect the correlation noted by richman and murphy that more virulent strains tend to be less ts
58 for example avian influenza virions that can infect human hosts might be expected to bind to cells lower down the respiratory tract than typical seasonal influenza an important point is that m4 is sensitive to temperature fluctuations not absolute temperature because the temperature sensitivity of viruses may adapt quite rapidly as a result of selective pressures and they can bind in different regions of the respiratory tract this can explain the data of van loghem milam jaakkola and others discussed above 5 14 15 16 21 22 23 24 25 it can also explain the seasonality of varis because chilling outside of the range of the previous few days or weeks becomes more likely when the seasonal temperature drops in the autumn in the spring by contrast exceptional chilling becomes less frequent as the seasonal temperature steadily rises m4 can explain the association of varis with wind and rain in the tropics since these weather events often result in the chilling of individuals even when the ambient temperature remains constant it also provides an explanation for the strange epidemiology of influenza including the low attack rate of many epidemics within families 5 43 44 45 and the rapid cessation of epidemics when many susceptible individuals remain in the population 7 bear in mind that each member of a family has a different history of exposure to viruses and of chilling for example some family members may take regular outdoor exercise in the winter which i suggest clears virions from the respiratory tract in small batches outdoor exercise reduces mortality from varis 15 other family members may be exposed to a virus for the first time during particularly cold weather eg in midwinter so that virions bind and become dormant relatively low down the respiratory tract and are therefore not activated unless even colder weather follows still others who remain indoors much of the time but are chilled occasionally may be prime candidates for infection eg waiting for a bus in the rain may put individuals at risk - standing still outside in cold weather and shivering outside have both been shown to be a dangerous activities 15 these trends can therefore explain the low attack rates and lack of transmission within families as well as the rapid cessation of epidemics note that the natural temperature sensitivity of respiratory viruses contributes to m4 in two steps in a first step it allows virions to become dormant in a second step it provides viral activation as a result of chilling step 2 however could also be the result of the depression of immunity in the host  m3 above there is no reason to rule this out and in the absence of experimental data the relative contributions of changes in host physiology and virus biochemistry remain unknown i noted above that changes in host susceptibility alone probably cannot account for the extreme sensitivity of varis to small temperature drops but they may contribute m3 may contribute to the simultaneous arrival of varis across wide geographical areas and may be at least partly responsible for the arrival varis in tropical regions during rainy seasons however it seems unlikely that m3 is the main driver of seasonality as noted above experiments carried out in the 1950s and 60s with the common cold failed to find an effect where host chilling increased the likelihood of volunteers getting colds 53 54 55 56 however it seems likely that the procedure of recycling viruses used in these studies may have eliminated some of the wild viruss natural temperature sensitivity m4 therefore offers an explanation of the negative results of these studies as discussed in detail in the next section i noted above that the eurowinter group found that exposure to cold outdoor air can have opposite effects according to the situation shivering outside greatly increased respiratory disease-related mortality p-value  0001 while outdoor exertion sufficient to cause sweating greatly reduced mortality p-value  0020 15 the absolute values of the regression coefficients of mortality due to respiratory disease on these two cold exposure factors were far higher than any others found by the group the first point that shivering increased mortality could be explained by either m3 or m4  host defenses could be diminished or virions could be activated by cold the second point that outdoor sweating reduced mortality is more difficult to explain although heat stress may boost the immune system above its normal level the result would not be noticeably protective if virions are dormant and therefore invisible to the immune system if they were visible they should be destroyed anyway during the much greater time spent indoors a roughly neutral effect of m3 would therefore be expected m4 would suggest that mortality should increase because outdoor exertion clearly causes cooling of the respiratory tract due to rapid breathing the best explanation may be a combination of m3 and m4 the cold air and rapid breathing cools of the respiratory tract which activates some of the dormant virions that are present however the good blood flow to the respiratory tract that is associated with heat stress allows the activated virions to be destroyed by the immune system there is extensive biochemical evidence for the temperature sensitivity in respiratory viruses particularly influenza which is discussed below this includes temperature sensitivity that is associated with the steps of the uptake of virions into cells 60 rna transcription 61 62 63 64 65 including the ts control of the balance between the synthesis of mrna and replicative products 66 67 and the transport to the cell surface of hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein the protein that promotes the fusion of influenza c virions with cells 68 in summary many observations of varis cannot be satisfactorily explained without invoking the activation of respiratory viruses by temperature drops or host chilling m4 the evidence is outlined in table 1
 m4 is probably the most important driver of seasonality in varis although other mechanisms may also contribute to seasonality especially the increased susceptibility of hosts as a result of chilling m3 moreover when we consider different virus families we can expect variations in both the timing and underlying mechanisms of seasonality it is widely believed by doctors and scientists that chilling does not affect varis and that this idea is an old wives tale 75 this belief seems to come from numerous studies from the 1950s and 1960s where volunteers who had been inoculated with respiratory viruses were chilled including three influential reports by andrewes dowling and douglas 53 54 55 unfortunately these studies generally used pedigree strains of cold virus that were recycled by being collected from volunteers and used to inoculate subsequent batches of volunteers in later experiments volunteers were often kept in quarantine to avoid using natural wild strains that they happened to be carrying 53 in these studies it seems likely the researchers selected strains that very quickly caused mild varis in a significant proportion of the volunteers  but without causing dangerous infections this may well have removed some aspects of their natural temperature sensitivity since temperature sensitivity might give rise to dormancy and thereby delay infection this suggests that the results may have differed from those that would have been obtained using wild viruses which might have shown an effect of chilling one study however by jackson et al did use wild viruses that the volunteers were carrying 56 in some of their experiments volunteers in scant dress were exposed to 155 c air for four hours in others warmly-dressed volunteers breathed air at 12 c for two hours of those who were chilled only 10 developed colds in the next 7 days whereas 12 of those who were not chilled developed colds however the authors do not tells us what proportion of volunteers were chilled by breathing cold air and what proportion by wearing scant clothing breathing cold air while remaining warm can be protective 15 presumably because viruses are activated but they can be removed by the immune system more recently johnson and eccles used wild strains that the participants were carrying by chance and saw an effect of chilling by immersing the participants feet in cold water 48 of the chilled subjects 28 developed colds whereas only 9 of the control subjects who were not chilled did simple experiments along similar lines need to be carried out to resolve these apparent contradictions in an interesting review of 1975 69 preble and youngner noted that ts strains often appear spontaneously in persistent infections of cell cultures with a variety of unrelated insect-transmitted and respiratory viruses including newcastle disease virus western equine encephalitis virus sendai virus measles virus vesicular stomatitis virus and sindbis virus we can speculate that their temperature sensitivity may allow insect-borne viruses to target the skin similarly richman and murphy found that persistent infections of cell-cultures with mumps virus and vesicular stomatitis virus frequently yielded ts virus although they noted that persistent infections could also be established or maintained by non-ts mutations 58 three more recent reports described the recovery of spontaneously-generated ts strains of influenza a from persistent infections of cell cultures 70 71 72 similar tendencies are seen in persistent infections of animals foot-and-mouth viruses recovered from carrier animals are frequently ts and show evidence of high rates of mutation with frequent amino acid substitutions and rapid antigenic variation 73 preble and youngner pointed out that since ts strains tend to be less virulent they may allow persistent infections to become established because a balance between viral and cell replication is required 69 they do not however explain why ts mutations in particular should be selected in persistent infections as opposed to non-ts attenuating mutations in most cases the cells were grown in the laboratory at 37 c so temperature sensitivity should be a disadvantage if however the wild virus from which the laboratory strain was derived was ts the probability of reverting to the ts phenotype may be relatively high for example a protein might lose its ts character by a point mutation caused by a single nucleotide change so that the ts character could be restored by reinstating the original nucleotide this may be more probable than other mutations that would attenuate the virus without conferring temperature sensitivity changes to rna secondary structure discussed below may have similar effects bear in mind that many virus families include species that cause both systemic and respiratory tract infections and strains may have jumped between these sites many times in their evolutionary history for example influenza often infects the gut in birds but it usually infects the respiratory tract in mammals these considerations suggest that genetic pathways may exist that allow the rapid elimination and reintroduction of temperature sensitivity if this interpretation is correct it may explain how respiratory viruses such as influenza rsv and adenovirus are able to infect hosts throughout the world a tropical virus might cause serious illness if it arrives in colder parts of the world because it might infect sites lower down the respiratory tract since too much virulence may reduce viral transmission as patients become bed-ridden natural selection in the temperate site for reduced virulence may increase temperature sensitivity to a level that is appropriate to the viruss new location a similar argument suggests that viral temperature sensitivity and virulence may be adjusted throughout the year by natural selection to a level that is appropriate to the season since ts strains are generally less virulent in vivo 57 58 69 and are associated with persistent infections both in vivo and in vitro
58 69 it might be anticipated that the ts character would be lost in in vitro conditions that allow rapid replication of viruses and this has indeed been observed chu et al found a naturally-occurring ts influenza a strain that was a subclone of the h3n2 strain ningxia1172 59 when they passaged the strain three times through chicken embryos at a low temperature 33 c they were surprised to find that a non-ts strain was produced similarly oxford et al 74 found that a naturally occurring ts virus aeng11678 h1n1 progressively lost its ts character during five passages at low temperature 33 c both groups concluded that even at the permissive temperature 33 c the ts phenotype may confer a selective disadvantage in eggs  which allow rapid replication of influenza virions again we can speculate that virulence and greater viral activity in general is genetically linked to temperature sensitivity as a result of the evolutionary history of the virus the unexpected loss and gain of temperature sensitivity in a wide variety of viruses when increased or decreased viral activity is selected is shown schematically in fig 6
 numerous studies have found that it is easier to propagate respiratory viruses that are freshly collected from patients by incubation at temperatures below 37 c rhinoviruses were first isolated at 35 c but a greater variety of rhinoviruses was discovered at 33 c 76 and this is the temperature that is recommended today for their isolation by the clinical and laboratory standards institute 77 coronaviruses were first isolated at 33 c 78 although laboratory strains are now frequently propagated at 37 c naturally occurring influenza strains are also frequently ts for example in 1962 stern and tippett 79 propagated four viral specimens from patients with h2n2 asian influenza all of which were ts all four gave cytopathic effects in monkey cells and the production of hemagglutinatinin-positive fluids in eggs at 33 c but not at 37 c subcultures were able to adapt to culture at 37 c but grew more slowly than at 33 c the authors also found in 1962 that the fm1 h1n1 1947 and pr8 old-style h0n1 1934 strains grew more slowly in monkey cells at 37 c than at 33 c in 1977 kung et al found that nine of ten isolates of the newly emerged russian h1n1 influenza were ts
80 oxford et al found that 17 of 26 recent h1n1 isolates and 2 of 11 recent h3n2 isolates were ts producing cultures that gave at least 10 times more viral plaques after incubation at 34 c compared to 385 c 74 takashita et al found that in influenza c cann arbor150 roughly half the amount of the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein hef was found on the cell surface at 37 c compared to 33 c 68 hef in influenza c carries out the functions of both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in influenza a or b moreover membrane fusion mediated by hef was observed at 33 c but not at 37 c this was found to be due to instability of the trimeric form of hef at 37 c in an interesting study russell saw an unexpected result when he measured the uptake of the triple reassortant influenza virus ajapbel into cells 60 uptake of the virus increased steadily from 0 c with 100 of the virus entering the cells at 30 c however at 34 c and 38 c less ajapbel was taken up than at 30 c fig 2 of ref 60 this was repeated on two separate occasions using a chicken anti-h2 serum when 100 of virus escaped neutralization at 30 c compared to 50 at 38 c suggesting that viral entry into cells was ts most laboratory respiratory viruses are propagated at 37 c which may result in the rapid loss of ts characters especially since viruses mutate very rapidly when they are introduced to new hosts if however temperature sensitivity is a common feature of wild respiratory viruses we might expect to see remnants of temperature sensitivity in the biochemistry of laboratory strains it turns out that such remnants are quite common for several decades virologists have found that maximum rna transcription in influenza viruses occurs below normal body temperature in 1977 plotch and krug 61 reported that the greatest activity of the rna polymerase of wsn virus was at 3032 c this is similar to the optimum temperature of the polymerase of influenza c which is 33 c 62 63 ulmanen et al 64 found that the rate of transcription by detergent-treated wsn viruses influenza a was about 10 times greater at 33 c than at 395 c and also that the binding of a cleaved primer cap the a13 fragment to the viral cores was unexpectedly much weaker at 395 c than at 33 c scholtissek and rott 65 showed that the optimum for the polymerase of the rostock strain of fowl plague virus was 36 c five degrees below chickens normal body temperature 41 c at least two reports show that temperature affects the balance between transcription and viral replication kashiwagi et al looked at the effect of temperature on rna production for five varied influenza a strains 66 for all strains vrna unexpectedly decreased when the temperature was increased from 37 c to 42 c the pa subunit of the viral polymerase caused this thermal sensitivity in another interesting study dalton et al showed that the production of mrna by the pr8 influenza strain is favored at a higher temperature 41 c with very little vrna being produced at that temperature 67 a plasmid-based recombinant system showed that as the incubation temperature increased from 31 c to 39 c the amount of replicative rna products c- and vrna decreased and a greater accumulation of mrna was observed the crna that is used as a template to make the vrna formed a complex with the polymerase that was particularly heat-labile showing rapid dissociation even at 37 c the authors suggested that the switch that regulates the transition from transcription to replication is dependent on temperature but made no comments about how shifts in the hosts body or respiratory tract temperature may influence this transition much recent attention has focused on the role of rna secondary structure in influenza a although discussion of its role in temperature sensitivity has been limited rna thermometers are rna segments found in both microorganisms and higher organisms that respond to temperature changes with three-dimensional conformational changes that alter gene expression 81 they are frequently but not always found in the 5-untranslated regions of mrna and can act in both directions  translation can be augmented or suppressed at high temperatures 81 chursov et al used bioinformatic techniques to search for pronounced differences between mrna from cold-adapted ts influenza strains and the corresponding wild-type sequences 82 pronounced differences were found in the mrnas of four viral proteins the authors suggest that temperature-induced structural changes of mrna may constitute an unappreciated molecular mechanism of the cold adaptationtemperature sensitivity phenomena 82 little secondary structure is predicted in influenza vrna outside the untranslated 5 and 3 terminal ends of the vrna strands that form the promoter necessary for the initiation of rna synthesis 83 however the positive-sense rna is predicted to have extensive secondary structure which is conserved in segments 1 5 7 and 8 83 since ordered rna is intrinsically ts and since individual base changes may have a cumulative effect on the overall secondary structure of rna it is likely that viral temperature sensitivity can be fine-tuned by small sequence changes to untranslated regions of rna for example changes to the secondary structure of vrna crna and mrna might all affect temperature sensitivity in influenza changes to protein sequences may also be in involved of course we can speculate that temperature sensitivity might have profound effects on viral tropism many or most respiratory viruses possess temperature sensitivity and we can imagine that a respiratory virus that loses its temperature sensitivity might infect the lungs gut or internal organs some method of limiting virulence other than temperature sensitivity might then be selected that can allow the virus to survive in the long-term conversely viruses originating in the internal organs that develop temperature sensitivity could safely cause severe local infections that would be limited to the upper respiratory tract possibly in addition to other cold parts of the body such as the feet without greatly incapacitating the host incapacitation would limit opportunities for transmission of the virus obviously the resulting irritation of the respiratory tract might cause coughing sneezing and runny noses all of which might help to transmit the virus  in other words a respiratory virus has been generated influenza infects the gut of water fowl but the respiratory tract of mammals and birds and is able to move between these two ecological niches similarly some adenovirus serotypes are mainly respiratory others mainly cause gut-related disease viruses that are transmitted via skin rashes and blisters that burst such as chickenpox measles smallpox and hand foot and mouth disease in humans and foot-and-mouth disease in cloven-hoofed mammals could also benefit from temperature sensitivity that might allow them to infect the skin preferentially and so to spread by direct contact in the diseases mentioned above contact transmission from blisters etc coexists with aerosol transmission several examples indicate that what we think of as respiratory viruses can occasionally cause systemic infections virulent human influenza strains sometimes give rise to viremia 84 85 and three children who were infected with pandemic h1n1 influenza in 2009 swine flu presented with petechial rashes 86 similarly 33 patients presented with hemorrhagic cystitis caused by h3n2 influenza a in 1975 87 many suggestions have been put forward to explain the seasonality of varis especially influenza changes in crowding m1 and changes in the survival rate of viruses outside the body m2 cannot be completely ruled out but they fall short in at least one important respect they cannot explain why varis including influenza are transmitted in the tropics especially during wet weather but are mostly absent from temperate regions in the summer months an alternative suggestion m3 that chilled hosts are more susceptible as a result of ts changes to their immune defenses is a better candidate a biochemical study using cultured mouse cells supports the idea 51 and m3 also seems to be part of the best explanation of the protective effect of winter outdoor exercise 15 however evidence from vaccination studies epidemiological evidence that varis respond to small temperature changes throughout a wide range of absolute temperatures fig 1 fig 3 and evidence that varis frequently appear simultaneously throughout large geographical regions fig 1 fig 2 seem to rule out changes in host susceptibility as the main driver of vari seasonality this leaves the explanation that might seem most intuitive to the lay-person  that viruses can become temporarily dormant and are reactivated by chilling which changes their behavior at the biochemical level m4 this explanation is seldom considered by microbiologists who seem to have ruled it out on the basis of historical reports from the 1950s and 1960s which concluded that chilling does not bring on varis 53 54 55 56 however there is now so much clear evidence that chilling does increase varis that we need to look more closely at those historical experiments i suggest above that they were flawed because they generally used pedigree viral strains which were passed by the investigators from volunteers to subsequent batches of volunteers in later experiments obviously the investigators would have thought carefully about the choice of strains that they used they certainly didnt want to put the volunteers at risk so mild strains needed to be selected however they naturally wanted their experiments to fit into the time available  for example andrewes worked with volunteers who each stayed at his unit for 10 days and his experiments did not start until the volunteers had been in quarantine for three days the incubation period of the strain that he used was most frequently two to three days by selecting such a strain he and his colleagues may have eliminated the viruss natural temperature sensitivity during the early stages of infection temperature sensitivity that is predicted by m4  a flaw in the design of his experiments with potentially far-reaching implications note however that the negative results of the host-chilling experiments using pedigree strains nevertheless weigh against m3  because the lack of temperature sensitivity of the virus or possibly other characters of a virus that had undergone prolonged serial passage should not influence host susceptibility leaving aside these early experiments what is the evidence for or against the idea m4 that temperature fluctuations can activate respiratory viruses and give rise to vari seasonality epidemiological evidence shows that a surges in varis often follow a few days after temperature dips even minor dips 2 3 5 14 21 22 b in all climates it is temperature drops that are generally associated with vari epidemics rather than sustained low absolute temperature 3 5 21 22 c the attack rate and the rate of transmission within families are often low especially for influenza 5 43 44 45 d vari epidemics often appear simultaneously throughout wide geographical areas with no evidence of waves of transmission that move between neighboring fig 1 or widely separated fig 2 localities 5 6 7 and e influenza epidemics often occur in midwinter but cease while many susceptible individuals remain in the population 7 all of these observations are compatible with m4 as discussed above moreover observations of the timing and location of vari epidemics suggest that respiratory viruses can become dormant a suggestion that is confirmed by the occasional presence of varis in polar communities after many weeks or months of complete isolation 24 25 39 biochemical tests of asymptomatic individuals who shed influenza a and b without seroconversion 35 36 37 38 are compatible with dormancy and pcr tests showed directly that individuals harboring a variety of viral pathogens subsequently developed the corresponding varis 18 34 if we accept this evidence of viral dormancy and reactivation then the idea m4 that chilling increases the activity of respiratory viruses that were present before the epidemic began can provide the rapid response sensitivity to temperature dips and occasional lack of transmission that we need to explain the epidemiological events ae above it is unclear how these events can be explained by the alternative mechanisms m1  m3 we also need to explain the clear trend in the laboratory for persistent infections of cells to yield ts strains of a variety of viruses in the absence of obvious selective pressures 58 69 70 71 72 and also the converse observation that temperature sensitivity is lost when viruses are grown in cell cultures at low temperature in conditions that allow rapid replication 59 74 fig 6 moreover biochemical studies show that many steps in the replication of laboratory strains of influenza and other viruses have residual natural temperature sensitivity 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 83 in spite of many cycles of replication of most laboratory viruses at 37 c we can explain these data by suggesting a link between loss of temperature sensitivity and the acquisition of increased virulence in respiratory viruses which seems to be a legacy of their evolutionary history lwoff 1959 and richman and murphy 1979 suggested that the temperature sensitivity of respiratory viruses allows them to target the respiratory tract and to avoid the lungs 57 58 this idea and the related idea that less ts strains tend to be more virulent seems to be widely accepted by microbiologists however the corollary that ambient temperature dips can activate viruses that were previously inactive is less popular it is however compatible with the well-known trade-off model of virulence this model suggests that the benefits of virulence in particular the increased rate of virus production and shedding are balanced against the reduction of the time during which shedding takes place and also changes to the behavior of hosts that reduce transmission if virulence is too great the implication is that mechanisms are required to moderate virulence and temperature sensitive mechanisms can clearly achieve this in the case of respiratory viruses an analogy in the form of a joke may be helpful here two scientists are out hiking when they meet an angry-looking bear its no use says one scientist to the other you can never outrun a bear i dont need to outrun the bear replies his companion i only need to outrun you it is often assumed that an evolutionary arms race exists between viruses and the host immune system with each making a series of small improvements to gain an advantage over the other 88 this assumption may be incorrect  it may be that most viruses could easily overcome the defenses of hosts that lack specific immunity but that selective pressures nevertheless reduce the virulence of well-adapted viruses as predicted by the trade-off model some of the evidence for this comes from viruses that have recently jumped from one host species to another such as myxomatosis in european rabbits and in humans hiv sars middle eastern respiratory syndrome avian influenza and ebola these viruses are unusually virulent in spite of  or because of  having had little time to adapt to their hosts the main arms race may not be between viruses and hosts but between competing hosts where each needs to reduce its susceptibility to outcompete other members of the same species of course respiratory viruses comprise many unrelated families and there may be important differences in the mechanisms that give rise to their seasonality multiple mechanisms could contribute to seasonality and the mix could vary between viruses nevertheless it seems likely that that the common seasonality of these diverse viruses is not coincidental that common mechanisms give rise to this near-universal trend and that some variant of m4 is the most important in many or most cases it is unlikely that either evidence gleaned from studies that were designed to investigate other aspects of viral biochemistry or epidemiological observations can determine the causes of vari seasonality with certainty instead it will be necessary to investigate temperature sensitivity directly in vivo and in vitro working with viruses that are as close as possible to wild viruses as a start wild and laboratory viral samples should be deep sequenced ie the relative proportions of different sequences in a sample should be established at multiple genetic sites to determine the mix of ts and non-ts sequences in wild samples and to establish the impact on temperature sensitivity of propagating wild viruses in the laboratory this analysis needs to include consideration of rna secondary structure the information gained can be applied at many levels from observations and experiments with living organisms to experiments with cell cultures and in solution it may be possible to image the distribution of virions in the respiratory tracts of animals and to see eg differences in animals that were housed at high and low temperatures prior to the investigation virions might be released from tissues or cells by raising the temperature or captured by lowering the temperature note that the genetic information remains attached to the chemical probe in a manner analogous to the phage display technique the entry of virions into cells can be investigated by measuring the escape rate of pre-adsorbed virus from neutralization by antibody in temperature shift experiments 60 in tissue cultures transcription and the production of genetic material can be followed during temperature shifts for example the production of mrna crna and vrna can each be studied in influenza similarly the production of viral proteins can be followed during temperature-shift experiments experiments in solution can also yield valuable information for example the thermal stability of mutants of influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase can be investigated in solution by thermal shift assays and similar experiments can be undertaken with other respiratory viruses the thermal stability of secondary structures of wild-type and laboratory viral rna and rnaprotein complexes can be measured in solution bioinformatics can be applied to the problem for example the sequences of hemagglutinin neuraminidase and other viral proteins from wild and laboratory strains and from the viruses obtained from different animal hosts and laboratory procedures can be analyzed this analysis can consider the impact of mutations on the structures of viral proteins and complexes that have been determined by x-ray crystallography and other techniques for example the effect of changing a particular residue can be anticipated or investigated experimentally secondary structure prediction techniques can be applied to viral rna dna and proteinnucleic acid complexes yet another approach is to investigate and model viral epidemiology with these ideas in mind finally experiments can be performed at the whole organism level for example chilblains and chapped lips can be examined for the presence of respiratory and other viruses other very simple experiments can be performed with human volunteers for example groups of volunteers can be subjected to chilling in the autumn or midwinter which are the seasons when individuals are particularly susceptible to varis and compared to control groups who are kept warm the number of varis suffered by both groups can then be compared this approach would make use of dormant viruses that the participants were already carrying by chance i have no competing interests i am one of the two founders and directors of douglas instruments ltd a small uk company that manufactures automatic systems for protein crystallization i worked with professor david blow in the 1990s and have published 15 papers about protein crystallization that have together been cited over 750 times a few years ago i began to think about respiratory viruses when a friend bet me that i couldnt find biochemical evidence that chilling could trigger varis i started to write a short note but everything fell into place so neatly that it rapidly grew into the current document  journal pre-proof capacity in the time of coronavirus capacity in the time of coronavirus alex ruck keene barrister  in the course of a few short weeks many of the established legal frameworks relating  this paper is avowedly a report from the front line rather than an abstract academic disquisition it is further at best a first draft of history it reflects the experience of a practising barrister in england  wales grappling with the impact of covid-19 upon the mental capacity act 2005 mca 2005 across a range of fields in the weeks after the world appeared to change in mid-march 2020 1 in the course of a few short weeks many of the established legal frameworks relating to decision-making in england  wales in respect of those with impaired decision-making capacity were ripped up or apparently rendered all but unusable although the mca 2005 itself was not amended the impact of other legislation especially the coronavirus act 2020 meant that duties towards those with impaired decision-making capacity were radically changed questions of isolation and social distancing raised stark questions about protectionand the ends of protectionwith particular difficulties in the context of those who could not understand what they were being asked or required to do the intense pressure upon hospitals and in particular intensive care units meant that best interests decisionmaking as the choice between available options suddenly took on a new and very stark character and advance care planning startedin some casesto appear to be a threat rather than an opportunity and the court of protection itself the statutory court charged with oversight of the mca 2005 had in a matter of weeks to transform itself into a virtual court raising deep questions about the functions of justice and participation this article discusses both england and wales devolution means that there are similarities and differences between the two 2 the mca 2005 applies in england  wales as the framework through which decisions are made most often informally about capacity and best interests on the basis of a functional model of mental capacity the mca 2005 also provides an administrative route for deprivation of liberty for purposes of enabling care and treatment of adults in hospitals and care homes the so-called deprivation of liberty safeguards dols outside hospitalscare homes or in relation to those aged under 18 court authorisation will be required separately and long-predating the mca 2005 does not provide any mechanism to compel the delivery of health or social care to an individual the court of protection has a duty to act in the best interests of the person before it as do others outside the court room arena making best interests decision on their behalf but the court of protection  only has power to take a decision that p himself could have taken it has no greater power to oblige others to do what is best than p would have himself this must mean that just like p the court can only choose between the available options  37 other service-providing powers and duties outlined immediately below also have their own principles and criteria which do not depend upon what is best for the service user although that will no doubt be a relevant consideration decisions can of course be challenged on the usual judicial review principles decisions on health or social care services may also engage the right to respect for private  challenges by way of judicial review are to a different court the administrative court for which it is more difficult as a generalisation to get public funding to pay for legal assistance 5 and are more limited in scope focusing on the process of decision-making much more than the outcome of the decision the national health service act 2006 sets out the powers and duties of the national health service to provide healthcare the care act 2014 in england and the social services and well-being wales act 2014 sets out the powers and duties of local authorities to provide social care to individuals 6 if an individuals needs are such as to amount to a continuing healthcare need then it is the responsibility of the nhs to meet them and to do so for free social care is means-tested such that a charge can be made for the provision of such care by local authorities in very broad terms in relation to both healthcare outside hospital and social care the relevant public body is under a duty to assess the needs of the person determine whether they are eligible needs and then meet them finally the public health control of diseases act 1984 contains an extensive range of powers in part 2a in relation to public health protection including most materially the power to the secretary of state in england and the welsh ministers in wales to make health protection regulations for the purpose of preventing protecting against controlling or providing a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection or contamination in england and wales whether from risks originating there or elsewhere 7 section 2 health and social care outside hospital if decisions are made under the mca 2005 between the options that are actually available to the person then changes made in relation to the powers and duties upon the state to secure the needs of individuals with impaired decision-making capacity will have a dramaticknock-oneffect upon the scope of those options this is precisely what the coronavirus act 2020 ca 2020 has done and i go into the changes it has introduced in some detail for two reasons 1 for the benefit of those within england  wales who are grappling with for whatever reasons the new landscape 2 as a case study for those concerned more broadly with the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities crpd to make the point that examining whether persons with disabilities are able to enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life 8 in any jurisdiction requires examination not just of the laws that on their face govern legal capacity but also the wider framework within which those laws are placed the ca 2020 was introduced into parliament on 19 march 2020 and received royal assent under a week later on 26 march 2020 its long title an act to make provision in connection with coronavirus and for connected purposes does not adequately convey its scope reflecting the impact of covid-19 across all aspects of society the act includes provisions ranging from emergency registration of health professionals to the power to require information relating to food supply to powers relating to the temporary closure of educational institutions and childcare premises to postponement of elections to the general synod of the church of england for present purposes i focus upon the duties upon public bodies to assess and meet the continuing healthcare and social care needs of individuals the latter because of their profound indirect impact upon decision-making in relation to those within the scope of the mca 2005 framework for adult social care 9 this document in essence transposed principles that had been developed in relation to triage for inpatient medical treatment in the context of pandemic flu 10 to the social care setting recognising increasing pressures and expected demand it might become necessary to make challenging decisions on how to redirect resources where they are most needed and to prioritise individual care needs this framework intends to serve as a guide for these types of decisions and reinforce that consideration of any potential harm that might be suffered and the needs of all individuals are always central to decisionmaking it was not just local authorities but also the nhs which would be stretched i deal at section 6 below with decision-making in hospital here i focus on the position outside hospital where as noted above the nhs throughin england -clinical commissioning groups has both powers and duties to meet continuing healthcare needs 11 the ca 2020 with immediate effect suspended 12 the duty on the nhs in england to carry out assessments of whether a person is in need of continuing healthcare crucially such continuing healthcare needs are free to access unlike social care provision for which charges can be made the explanatory notes to the act rather coyly suggested this section changes the procedure for discharge from an acute hospital setting for those with a social care need  it allows nhs providers to delay undertaking the nhs continuing healthcare nhs chc assessment and pending that assessment the patient will continue to receive nhs care 13 the provisions of the ca 2020 in this respect were not in fact so limited although s14 ca 2020 does not stop clinical commissioning groups carrying out such assessments the temporary repeal of the duty mean that overnight individuals with profound healthcare needs lose any entitlement to assessment of those needs as a precursor to the potential for those needs to be met for free those of such individuals with impaired decision-making capacity therefore losein many casesthe potential for options to be made available for them in terms of their residence and care arrangements further given the abolition of the duty to assess recourse to judicial review to challenge a failure to carry out an assessment becomes a nigh-on impossible task and the court of protection can offer no assistance 14   given that there is a considerable overlap between individuals with impaired decisionmaking capacity and those with continuing healthcare needs their options have been immediately and dramatically narrowed by this legislative change the ca 2020 also introduced what the government but not the act described as easements 15 25 these are respectively 1 the local authority is satisfied on the basis of the financial assessment it carried out that the adults financial resources are at or below the financial limit 2 the local authority is satisfied on the basis of the financial assessment it carried out that the adults financial resources are above the financial limit but the adult nonetheless asks the authority to meet the adults needs and 3 the adult lacks capacity to arrange for the provision of care and support but there is no person authorised to do so under the mental capacity act 2005 or otherwise in a position to do so on the adults behalf satisfied it is not required to meet the adults needs under section 18 the statutory guidance did not explain when and how such power was to be used section 20 of the care act 2014 is also when eased watered down 26 so that that the duty to meet a carers need for support is to be tied to the necessity to avoid a breach of the carers rights under the echr i return to deprivation of liberty safeguards at section 4 below it will be clear that the watering down of duties under the care act 2014 to a bare bones approach so as to avoid a breach of the echr 28 means that in many cases the options available for individuals with impaired decision-making capacity are dramatically reduced that having been said and as a possibleand very tentativesilver lining to the cloud the sudden and very immediate focus upon the echr may mean a renewed focus by the english courts upon the positive aspects of rights under the echr and what those aspects mean in the context of those who cannot make their own choices the echr has been domesticated through the human rights act 1998 such that individuals can rely upon the rights it contains before the courts and public bodies are required to comply with it in the discharge of their functions so on one view the changes introduced by the ca 2020 do nothing other than repeat a commitment which already exists in the context of immigration control the fiction and it is frequently a fiction is that the individual concerned could always return to the country from where they came from so it is not surprising that the courts have interpreted the echr as providing a minimalist safety net designed to ensure that the uk does not breach its obligations to those individuals under the convention no such fiction could now operate across the piece it seems to me therefore that as perhaps presciently aburas might be said to recognise 38  the context is very different because in effect the echr is being required to do the heavy-lifting across the piece long experience before the courts means that i do not underestimate the difficulty in persuading either a local authority orin due coursea court that it should not follow the very high bar set by the cases discussed above which include jurisprudence up to and including the supreme court that having been said it seems to me that there are good arguments that courts should be more willing to place weight upon article 8 echr alone as opposed to the general position that absent where a family is involved 39  article 8 does not add to article 3 echr article 8 is a qualified rightie interference with it can be justified under the circumstances provided for under article 8 2 ewhc 2282 admin in which the situation was found to have breached article 8 echr even though it did not breach article 3 echr because the entire family were in such dire straits as a result of the local authoritys actions 40 art 82 applies where the interference is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security public safety or the economic well-being of the country for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f bodies and in due course the courts to proceed by reference to article 8 echr then there is undoubtedly an argument that it should be asked to do more work to address the middle ground where the persons circumstances are not so dire as to cross the very high threshold of article 3 echr but positive steps are nonetheless required so as to secure their physical health 41 or importantly psychological integrity 42 i would also suggest the courts should be willing to have regard to the recent jurisprudence from strasbourg relating to article 5 whichoddlydoes not seem to have been considered domestically before the courts in england 43 in other contexts the courts have been willing to accept that the crpd can be of assistance in interpreting the application of the echr 51 if the statute itself now directs the courts to consider the provisions of the echr and by extension the crpd then the approach in davey may no longer seem quite so tenable put another way if the statute itself asks the echr to do more work as the safety net for those with disabilities it is legitimate to ask those applying the statute to look to the crpd to assist in ensuring that safety net has as few holes in as possible whether advocates andin due coursethe courts will be willing to run with arguments such as those set out above is at the time of writing an open question but if they do they may ironically have further blurred the distinction between the civil and political rights traditionally seen as the core of the echr and socio-economic rights ie rights which actually require states to spend money j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f individual level the rights to independent living and to health enshrined in the crpd 52 such would be of inestimable benefit to those with impaired decision-making capacity the lives of those with impaired decision-making capacity have also directly and as will be seen disproportionately been affected by the public health measures taken to respond to the covid-19 crisis in the same week as the ca 2020 came into force regulations made under the public health control of disease act 1984 radically changed the legal landscape in england  wales effectively placing the population under severe restrictions which the daily mail might even characterise as house arrest for their good and the good of society the health protection coronavirus restrictions england regulations 2020 53 are set to expire in 6 months from the date of their coming into force on 26 march 2020 54 although with reviews by the secretary of state every 21 days 55 whilst the regulations are in force however there are statutory restrictions on every person in england from leaving the place where they are living without reasonable excuse 56 the regulations provided for statutory steps which could be taken to enforce this including the power for a relevant person 57 to direct the person to return the place to where they were living or remove them to the place where they are living including by the use of reasonable force the person would also be also committing a criminal offence which can be discharged by way of the issue of a fixed penalty notice 58 what constituted a reasonable excuse for these purposes is set out in regulation 62 this included taking exercise as well as to avoid illness or injury or to escape a risk of harm 59 there are some very interesting questions that arose as to whether the regulations were ultra vires the act under which they were made the public health control of disease act 1984 i do not address them here but david anderson qc wrote a stimulating blogpost on the question 60 interesting questions also arise as to whether they gave rise to the deprivation of liberty of the entire population of england  wales for purposes of article 51 echr and if so whether it is justified under article 51e for purposes of the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases these are both interesting questions my tentative thoughts being respectively 1 probably not 61 but 2 for present purposes i focus on the fact the regulations did not make any provision in relation to those with impaired decision-making capacity the question arises therefore as to how they should be applied to someone who lacks the capacity applying the mca 2005 or any common law test that might be said to apply to understand 1 that they are required not to leave the place where they are living without a statutory reasonable excuse or 2 the consequences of so doing without such a reasonable excuse and should they be subject to criminal sanction if they do so one would like to think that it would be very unlikely that any prosecution would be brought against a person who did notbecause they could notunderstand what it is that they should or should not have been doing the guidance issued by the crown prosecution service 63 in relation to prosecution of offences under the regulations provided that the guidance made no reference to the presence of impaired decision-making capacity as a factor it is also equally troubling that it would even be possible for a criminal prosecution to be in contemplation in such circumstances it may perhaps be that the answer is to be found in the wording of regulation 62 which is not exclusive in terms of reasonable excuses rather it provides that a reasonable excuse includes that a person lacks the capacity to understand what it is that the new regime requires would appear on its face to be a reasonable excuse whether any of the near constant stream of guidance coming out but not so far relating to the mca specifically will address this issue is not known but i would hope it would i should note that under regulation 84 it would undoubtedly be possible for a person to be returned to the place where they are living by the use of reasonable force whether or not they had the capacity to agree to the steps being taken interestingly and undoubtedly by a side-wind this suddenly given a previously missing power 64 to police offices and other authorised people to return individuals subject to dols authorisations in care homes 65 where they have wandered a term i put in parenthesis because in many cases it is very far from purposeless wandering on the part of a person with j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f dementia but this was undoubtedly not the purpose for which regulation 84 was enacted it would also leave anyone who does take steps to return an individual to somewhere other than a care home in a difficult position the regulations did not provide the power for the person returning the person to where they live to prevent them from leaving their home any such power would have to legally be found in another source and practically be exercised by someone and what if the person lived in their own home and did not appear to have anyone there to receive them finally i note that those caring formally or informally for those with impaired decision-making capacity are left in a very invidious position should they be seeking to prevent the individual from leaving home so as not to breach the regulations or should they let them do so in the hopes that the individual does not then encounter an unsympathetic relevant individual it is very likely that many carers will feel rightly or wrongly that they have to take steps to stop the person leaving in many cases this is likely then to mean that the individual then meets the acid test of not being free to leave the place they live and also being subject to continuous supervision and control 66 if they cannot consent to that confinement then it is very likely that they are then to be seen as deprived of their liberty for purposes of article 5 echr 67 i return to this issue below having looked at the further powers that the ca 2020 introduced in the public health sphere section 51 and schedule 21 ca 2020 contain powers relating to potentially infectious persons part 1 relates to england part 2 to scotland and part 3 to wales they are materially identical and for present purposes i will only give references to the paragraph numbers in part 1 for england schedule 21 provides public health officers constables and in some circumstances immigration officers with the means to enforce public health restrictions including returning people to places that they have been required to stay where necessary and proportionate constables and immigration officers are able to direct individuals to attend remove them to or keep them at suitable locations for screening and assessment where a person has been screened and assessed and either tested positive or the screening is inconclusive paragraph 14 of schedule 21 enables a public health officer to impose requirements including to remain at a specified place which may be a place suitable for screening and assessment for a specified period andor to remain at a specified place in isolation from others for a specified period a requirement to remain the public health officer has when imposing a requirement or restriction to inform the person of the reason for doing so and that it was an offence to fail to comply with the requirement or restriction a person can only be required to remain at a place for a maximum of 28 days 68  although can be required to remain in isolation indefinitely although with a review every 24 hours after 28 days a failure to comply with the requirement to remain at a place or in isolation is a criminal offence 69 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f removing someone to or keeping the person at a place under the powers identified here 70 failure to comply with a reasonable instruction is a criminal offence 71 a constable or immigration officer but not a public health officer can use reasonable force if necessary in the exercise of the powers outlined here 72 the recourse against the exercise of the draconian if justified imposition of a requirement to remain is by way of appeal to the magistrates court 73 none of the provisions outlined above make any reference to the position of persons with impaired decision-making capacity the closest that they come are in paragraph 14 where a public health officer is required in deciding whether to impose a requirement to remain must have regard to a persons wellbeing and personal circumstances personal circumstances here couldand arguably shouldinclude whether they have capacity to understand what it is that they are being required to do and the consequences if they do not in the event that a requirement to remain was imposed it was not obvious from the face of the ca 2020 how it is that a person with impaired decision-making capacity is to make any appeal to the magistrates court so as to comply with the provisions of articles 6 and 8 echr read alone or in conjunction with article 14 echr it is clear 74 that the appeal provisions in paragraph 17 will have to be interpreted 1 as placing the threshold for bringing an application extremely low as per the approach before the mental health tribunal or the court of protection 75  and 2 where the person does not meet that threshold enabling another person to act on their behalf to bring the application it was entirely possible that there are those who do have impaired decision-making capacity and pose a public health risk because they are either potentially or actually infectious with covid-19 precisely what legal powers could be exercised to require them to remain either in a place or within that place within isolation is a question that has exercised many commentators 76 four key issues are significant doubts remain as to the thickness of legal ice upon which professionals are standing had the mental capacity amendment act 2019 been in force professionals would have had the ability to rely upon a revised version of s4b mca 2005 making clear the basis upon which they were able to deprive an individual in need of care and treatment in an emergency and then pending completion of the relevant statutory processes 83 however the likelihood of implementation of that act requiring a substantial amount of work on the part of local authorities and nhs bodies which was already looking unlikely for 1 october 2020 receded rapidly into the distance very shortly after lockdown started the court of protection had cause to consider how dols was working in the context of a care home whichas with many othershad barred visitors it is also striking but perhaps reflective of the haste with which the application was brought on and considered that hayden j did not address the fact that the dols regime does not itself provide authority to restrict contact 94 so it is not immediately obvious upon what legal basis contact could be restricted except by going to court finally it is also perhaps striking that no arguments were addressed to hayden j or raised by hayden j of his own motion as to the risk posed to individuals within the care home by covid-19 on one view it could have been argued see further section 2 above that bps article 2 rights in fact pointed not to the cessation of contact between him and his family but for his rapid move to his daughters house and the provision of such support to her there as required to ensure he could be kept safe there not only would the court of protection have to find ways in which to ensure that family members andor informal carers did not feel excluded by the arrangements the court would have to find ways in which to ensure that sometimes painful progress towards the greater participation of the subject of proceedings -pwas not lost 100 the guidance noted above from hayden j actively solicited imaginative ideas  to ensure that p participates in their proceedings where they are able to so do safely and proportionately 101 but given that where judicial meetings with p are necessary for a determination of the issues then remote conferencing technology to facilitate that meeting is the only likely mechanism 102 immediate hurdles towards an important way in which such participation could take place were clear the energy and commitment of those concerned with the court to ensure that it could continue both to offer a service and to serve p was clear but the task at the time of writing appeared formidable space precludes a detailed consideration of the issues that arise in the context of the effect of covid-19 upon the scarce critical care resource within england  wales and also the scarce resource of ventilation 103 however they do need to be touched on briefly as radically changing the framework for medical decision-making in a series of cases starting in 2013 104 the court of protection had developed an increasingly sophisticated notion of best interests in this context in which even interventions with a very small chance of success could be said to be in the best interests of the patient if it was clear that this is what they wanted 105 this did notquitecross the line into holding that approaching matters through the prism of best interests could require that clinicians provide treatment that they did not consider clinically appropriate 106 but on occasion came very close 107 the impact of covid-19 however means that it appears clear that decision-making in the case of those with impaired decision-making and whether or not they have covid-19 might have to be undertaken on the basis not of what was in their best interests but on a utilitarian basis in order to save the maximum number of lives what had been a perennial question for ethicists and the subject of planning that had never had to be moved into anything close to an operational phrase 108 has become an ever more pressing issue however national bodies in particular national nhs bodies have been notably slow to produce guidance addressing the issues perhaps because of political including health service political concerns as to the public reactions that would be engendered by the recognition of the reality of the position they are also perhaps aware of how guidance produced under speed in countries that had been affected ahead of england most notably that produced by in the italian context by siaarti which suggested that there might need to be a simple age cut-off for admission to icu 109  would look if transposed directly into the english context further an earlyand very high-level -attempt to provide guidance the nice rapid response guideline ng159 110  was the subject of threatened judicial review proceeding within hours because of the perception that its reliance upon a tool known as the critical frailty score would discriminate against individuals with learning disability or other stable cognitive impairments 111 it was perhaps not a coincidence that it took another 10 days before any other body this time the british medical association put its head above the parapet 112 that time to press coverage including the headline virus patients more likely to die may have ventilators taken away 113 guidance from the chief medical officers who appeared frequently in the 1700 press conferences that became such a feature of the crisis was still not forthcoming at the time of writing whilst there was limited off-the-shelf material that could be drawn upon much of that material did not in fact provide the sort of detailed operational detail as to either procedures or criteria that was really required this meant therefore that clinicians have bene left at a vital period in the run up to the peak essentially trying to make it up as they went along frequently seeking to do so whilst juggling heavy and increasing clinical loads at the same time they have also been left unclearand in many cases in real moral distress in consequenceas to the point at which they were supposed to stop applying ordinary principles of medical decision-making and instead to start operating in a world governed by some form of utilitarianism a further consequence of the slowness of national bodies to give direction was that nhs trusts have not been not given either the push or the tools to start creating the governance structures which would be crucial to ensure that triage decisions take place within structures that could provide both oversight of the process and support to clinicians operating within it this has had one particularly pernicious consequence in the case of those with disabilities including those with impaired decision-making capacity whether out of a misplaced excess of zeal in attempting to undertake advance care planning a misunderstanding of the law 114 or otherwise it appeared that significant numbers of individuals were having decisions made as to resuscitation without any form of consultation in other cases it appeared that individuals were being pressured into signing their own dnacpr notices 115 many such individuals were elderly but did not have specific disabilities in other cases it appeared that judgments were being made that eg cpr should not be attempted because they had for instance a learning disability this prompted an urgent letter from the national director for mental health nhs england and nhs improvement the national clinical director -learning disability and autism nhs england and nhs improvement and the medical director for primary care nhs england and nhs improvement to remind trusts and gps that the health of some people who have a learning disability and  or a diagnosis of autism may be at risk from the presence of co-existing physical conditions and also from inequities in access to and delivery of appropriate and timely assessment and treatment for physical health conditions end of the pandemic makes a more or less cheering read than it does at present will depend in very significant part upon the actions taken by those who care about capacity law over the coming months when it will be tested as never before  m e i z h a n civet cats fried grasshoppers and david beckhams pajamas unruly bodies after sars  this article discusses the viscerality of consumption in particular consumption-as-eating and consumption-as-spending as a set of heterogeneous contestatory discourses and practices of identity production and subject formation to do so i bring together two intersecting events the chinese governments ban on wild animal markets during the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak and chinese and european media frenzy over the visit to china by the spanish football club real madrid in the wake of the epidemic in discussing these events i pay specific attention to unruly bodies-both human and nonhuman-as consumables and those who consume them in examining translocal encounters of these unruly bodies i suggest that in post-sars china discourses and practices of consumption produce emergent socialities that at once refigure racialized orientalist tropes and conjure up discrepant neoliberal imaginaries of lifestyle and consumer choice   networks in describing the entanglements of humans and nonhumans i also want to highlight ruptures where things do not stick to themselves and people refuse to socialize among themselves latour 1993  as i will show the encounters of civet cats grasshoppers david beckham and other human and nonhuman beings are always fraught sometimes contentious and on occasion even violent furthermore these translocal bodily encounters provide occasions for the production of contestatory knowledges and practices of nature culture tradition modernity and cosmopolitanism differences as anthropologists have argued have not disappeared because of globalization rofel in press tsing 2004  neither can differences be readily relegated to the realm of the receding past and out of our anticipations of futures as michael fischer puts it the current age is not one of the erasure of the past through the various postmodern tactics of late capitalism and legacies of the past continue to haunt constrain reroute and interact with the present 20037  fischer and others have embraced the concept of the emergent to talk about the increasing complexity of interactions and differentiations in everyday life today donna haraway for example argues that an analysis of emergent naturecultures would take into account vulnerable on-the-ground work that cobbles together nonharmonious agencies and ways of living that are accountable both to their disparate inherited histories and to their barely possible but absolutely necessary joint futures 20037  in this article i take the emergent seriously rather than focusing solely on the new i foreground the contested ways in which dynamic imaginaries of pasts and futures interact to create various emergent socialities neither necessarily utopic nor dystopic these entangled effervescent socialities not only deserve critical analytical attention but also are conditions with which many of us live focus on such emergent socialities and the bodily encounters enabling them allows me to critically examine technologies of consumption and discourses of consumer choice as a means of intervening in discussions of neoliberalism analyses of neoliberalism have counted the emergence of the consumer-subject-self-regulating choice-savvy-pivotal to the workings of neoliberal governmentality rose 1996 rose  1999  nikolas rose for example argues that neoliberal discourses of consumption locate an individual within a certain form of life through the identification of consumables and those who consume them 199986  whereas rose highlights the discursive and transformative nature of consumption in the production and transformation of the self i want to complicate our understandings of consumption by foregrounding its viscerality feminist anthropologists have long argued against the prevailing vision of corporeal bodies as prediscursive instead they see these bodies as intimate projects and processes of subject formation that produce multiple fractured selves through politics of desires emotions and pleasures at play in these projects and processes are contestatory practices of race gender class and other imaginaries of difference alexander and mohanty 1997 butler 1993 ebron 2002 kondo 1990 kondo  1997 rofel 1999 in press stoler 2002  drawing on these insights i here emphasize that the visceral is already discursive in examining consumption-aseating and conspicuous-consumption-as-spending i suggest that through bodily encounters of various humans and nonhumans during and after sars the uneasy conflation between these two types of consumption have refigured orientalist tropes while at the same time positioning them vis--vis neoliberal discourses of lifestyle and consumer choice 2 i am therefore not only interested in bodies at large but also specifically in both human and nonhuman bodies as consumables rose 199987  however rather than assigning the consumables to the world of goods that shapes the consumer-subject within the sphere of self rose 199985  i want to understand consumption-in its visceral and discursive dimensions-as heterogeneous and unruly discourses and practices that foreground and challenge the pervasiveness and seamlessness of neoliberal discourses of subject formation i suggest that although seemingly discrepant both the banning of wild animal markets and controversies surrounding real madrids china tour-especially the frenzy from the chinese public as well as chinese and european media over the star player david beckham-are dense moments of translocal encoun-ters through which consumption as a set of heterogeneous visceral and discursive practices proliferates furthermore these bodily encounters and proliferating practices of consumption provide occasions for the reproduction of a set of contested hybrid identities and subjectivities at stake in the production and representation of chinese bodies of both human and nonhuman sorts are not just imaginaries of chinas past but also visions of cosmopolitan futuresfutures that depend not so much on the transition to a new stage of consumption globalism or neoliberal governmentality as on situated contestatory projects and processes out of which unruly subjectivities and identities emerge i hope to understand these unruly emergences by taking a close look at the proliferation of consumables and those who consume them-as well as their historical entanglements and displacements i begin with stories of two banquets and the unruly human and nonhuman bodies they brought to the table the first banquet story begins with real madrids purchase of david beckham in july 2003 real madrid the new york yankees of the football world purchased david beckham from the english club manchester united for 35 million euros about 40 million beckham the captain of the english national team is perhaps better known for his good looks his marriage to victoria adams aka posh spice of the british pop group spice girls and for the reference to him in the film bend it like beckham 2002  which enjoyed transatlantic popularity the transaction was completed just weeks before real madrids tour of east asia where beckhams metrosexual and athletic image was immensely popular especially among young women and men even youth who do not follow football can recognize beckhams image instantly real madrids first stop in asia was kunming a scenic city in southwestern china the trip was the most ambitious marketing project ever undertaken by a football club anywhere in the world the football club was expected to receive over 99 million in appearance fees alone for their 18-day tour of china japan hong kong and thailand vanden bussche 2003  this trip generated much public frenzy and media attention in china also because it was the first visit to china by a major foreign sports team since the sars epidemic during the sars epidemic the international football governing body fifa had decided to move the 2004 womens world cup scheduled for september 2003 from china to the united states during real madrids trip a series of sars charity events were to be staged between trainings and exhibition matches in mainland china and hong kong even before their arrival reports of real madrids trip began to flood newspapers tv channels and websites and forums in europe asia and even the united states where football or soccer as it is known here is less popular chinese websites in particular followed and publicized every move of the team sinacom one of the most popular websites among the 87 million chinese internet users created an interactive webpage with updated news exclusively regarding real madrids visit the news included real madrids training and match schedules cultural activities such as banquets and sightseeing as well as stories of chinese fans enthusiasm for the team and especially beckham after real madrids landing in kunming however reports of china salutes beckham vanden bussche 2003 quickly gave way to titles such as real madrid face pr disaster in china agence france presse 2003  while chinese media mumbled about the lukewarm manners of real madrid players their european counterparts made outright accusations of real madrids disrespect for their hosts customs and culture the first crime on the list was the team snubbing the ancient chinese rite of passage for first-time guests leaving a meticulously prepared banquet in their honour a mere 15 minutes after its start agence france presse 2003  the media expressed shock over the fact that the team left the banquet early without eating anything and before the provincial governor who was the host of the evening could present them with a welcoming gift whereas french and english presses elaborated on how real madrid made their hosts lose face chinese media focused on beckham who was reported to have done nothing during the banquet except play with his cell phone the fiasco took on an even more sensational aura after the british tabloid the sun published a news report entitled becks snubs chinese grub 3 it reported the first course consisted of stinky tofu described as hell to smell but heaven to taste it was followed by a succession of dishes including crispy deep fried grasshopper fried bamboo worms which looked like maggots and glazed bees the main course of boiled chicken with mushrooms was served with noodles and a bowl of chicken fat sun 2003 these wildly exotic dishes the sun concluded were simply indigestible for beckham and his teammates sun 2003  emerging out of the encounters between real madrid and their chinese hosts-especially the media reports of these encounters-is the embodied imaginary of a traditional exotic chinese culture out of sync with a cosmopolitan world represented by the globetrotting real madrid the first point i want to make about this imaginary is that it is not the residue of a preglobalized world waiting to be wiped out by the rational and homogenizing forces of the global market rather it is precisely through encounters generated by transnational projects and processes of marketization and consumption such as real madrids far east tour that such an imaginary is sharpened and given a visceral form second these encounters of human and nonhuman bodies and objects are as much about circulation and connection as about rupture the suns description of the grasshopper as a local delicacy indexes an exoticized bodily continuity between the wild animal and the chinese people who readily consume it at the same time this continuity whether real or imagined is the condition for the production of another kind of visceral discontinuity that the grasshopper is simply indigestible for-and therefore incommensurable with-beckhams healthy athletic globetrotting body this bodily incommensurability once in place sets beckham and his teammates apart not only from the grasshopper but also from their chinese hosts indeed the banquet fiasco together with the media frenzies that ensued crystallizes the kind of translocal visceral encounters in which boundaries of nature and culture human and nonhuman tradition and modernity local and global are produced contested and reconfigured what we have in hand here is a case in which things do not stick to themselves and people refuse to socialize among themselves in their places are hybrids that reshuffle and realign the boundaries and contents of nature and culture through unruly behaviors see eg haraway 1991 haraway  1997 latour 1999 mitchell 2002 raffles 2002  this is what latour 1993 latour   1999 calls the paradox of the modern the proliferation of hybrids and the simultaneous rejection of the ontological presence of these hybrids by assigning them either to nature or culture premodern or modern yet the biggest irony of the real madrid banquet fiasco is that it took place after china banned the consumption of wild animals at the height of the sars epidemic did the sun embellish or simply fabricate the exotic menu or did the chinese hosts in kunming defy the chinese central government and stage this exotic banquet to impress their cosmopolitan guests sinacom did not list the menu in their exhaustive coverage of the real madrid tour they simply mentioned that the banquet included local delicacies a term that usually carries an exotic flavor 4 whether the menu was real or fabricated these stories themselves draw my attention why did exotic animal food become a centerpiece in the media coverage of a sports teams commercial tour what i am interested in is the heterogeneous sometimes competing ways in which particular hybrid bodies and subjectivities are produced through encounters generated by projects and processes of marketization and consumption in popular and academic discourses consumption has been a particularly relevant point of entry into descriptions and understandings of transformations in postsocialist china in what follows i offer a cautionary note on the entanglements of discourses of consumption in china with imaginaries of globality and emergent neoliberal subjectivities celebratory popular and academic discourses have invoked images of lively markets and mass consumption as convenient tropes for chinas transition from a production-based planned economy toward economic and social progress some are even hopeful that chinas market economy in producing enthusiastic consumer-subjects and cultivating horizontal relations of consumption will create a more democratic everyday sociability davis 2000  even as these discussions can help bring neoliberal discourses into focus in understanding chinas transformations i suggest that they also run the risk of privileging consumption as an unmistakable sign of modernity and globality and that they perhaps too readily translate consumption into the anticipated production of neoliberal subjectivities and identities in a recent article wang hui 2004 argues that we cannot fully understand the historicity and contradictions of neoliberalism in china if we speak the untroubled language of transition or development he points out that such narratives of transition are in fact ahistorical precisely because they ignore the specific historical conditions for the emergence of chinese neoliberalism in the 1980s and 1990s china does not fit the model of neoliberal transition through which consumption and market economy would be neatly lined up with private ownership consumer choice and eventually and naturally liberal democracy sharing wangs concerns i argue that without problematizing the linkages between the market consumption and neoliberal subjectivity we may inadvertently reproduce narratives of transition that relegate to the background other kinds of translocal networks and encounters by which meaningful bodily practices and subjectivities are produced while at the same time leaving these networks and encounters relatively intact from critical analyses it is necessary i think that we talk about transformationthrough-consumption without falling back on narratives of transition that oppose tradition to modernity local to global production to consumption one useful strategy of intervention against narratives of transition has been bringing production back into the picture in understanding economic and social transformations as well as emergent subjectivities and identities in china this strategy insists on understanding mass consumption and the emergence of neoliberal subjectivity in china as partially constituted open-ended projects and processes that are necessarily entangled in relations of production and labor practices anagnost 2004 pun 2003 yan 2003  i also suggest that an important rupture of narratives of transition comes from within consumption as a set of heterogeneous discourses and practices that are at the same time visceral and discursive persistent and anticipatory fascinations with the consumption of wild animals became a focal point in european and chinese media coverage of real madrids china trip precisely because these discourses of wild consumptions simultaneously refigured orientalist tropes of exotic epicurean traditions and neoliberal imaginations of the enthusiastic and savvy consumer-self as a new middle class emerges in urban china their choices of consumption-and desires for certain consumables-have also become subjects of international scrutiny as well as government regulation to further discuss ambivalences toward and ruptures within consumption i now turn to my second tale of a banquet in which wild animals again figured front and center-this time however through their conspicuous absence my second banquet story is itself the product of interrupted circulations and unexpected encounters i had planned for a field trip to shanghai in summer 2003 to conduct follow-up research on traditional chinese medicine my aspirations for transnational traveling however were thwarted by the travel of something else in spring 2003 the sars epidemic broke out in mainland china and hong kong and within a few months had spread to 30 countries sars visited every continent except antarctica i had no alternative but to postpone my trip until late august-after the who and the us state department lifted their sanctions against traveling in china 5 on my arrival in shanghai i was overwhelmed by post-sars feeding frenzy as my friends put it people felt as if they had just been released from prison and returned to consumption with a vengeance tourism again became favorite weekend and holiday activities after the chinese government lifted the ban on interregional traveling once-empty shopping malls were filled with bustling crowds scouring for things to buy and restaurants were busy making up for the business lost during the sars outbreak a few days after my arrival i joined some friends from high school for a sumptuous dinner at a recently opened restaurant it was located in the hongqiao area which used to be a suburb but is now an affluent and bustling commercial area the restaurant was on the third floor of a commercial high-rise in the last few years an increasing number of new upscale restaurants have been set up within commercial complexes such as shopping malls rather than standalone buildings we took an elevator to reach the restaurant the interior of the elevator was spotless the carpet read monday indicating that it was changed daily next to the buttons on the wall was a large sign that read has been disinfected today-a new practice in shanghais public buildings beginning during the sars epidemic at the entrance of the restaurant we were greeted with a wall-to-wall fish tank containing a stunning school of red tropical fish which were intended for viewing rather than culinary pleasure there were so many fish that they effectively formed a fluid red screen shielding the interior of the restaurant from the visitors once the beautiful qipao-clad receptionist chaperoned us around the fish tank i found myself in a spacious exhibition hall in the middle of the hall was a large table where vivid plastic samples and price tags of main dishes were displayed a deli was set up on the left side of the hall where various cold appetizers were showcased the other two walls were lined with fish tanks that contained a wide variety of live fish shellfish crabs and shrimps-most of which i had never seen before unlike the fish tank at the entrance these animals were destined to be eaten taking notice of my awed expression my friends told me that they selected this restaurant because of its dazzling array of live freshwater and marine animals as we sat down to order i noticed that there were no snake dishes on the menu although not a big fan of eating snake i was nevertheless puzzled by its absence because snakes-fried braised or stewed-were ubiquitous in shanghais restaurants during my visit in 1999 6 my friends told me that snakes were no longer sold in restaurants because they could not be farmed-that is humans cannot regulate the reproductive activities of snakes while keeping them in captivity-and were therefore listed among the wild animals that the chinese central government banned during and after sars snakes were not the only wild animals that disappeared from the dinner table because of sars among competing explanations for the origin of sars the hypothesis of zoonotic origin meaning animal-borne origin was most strongly favored by research scientists in and outside of china and furthermore was the theory most widely spread through mass media the internet and rumors in late april 2003 at the height of the sars outbreak and under mounting international criticism for its lack of action the chinese forestry administration and the chinese industry and commerce administration announced the banning of hunting selling purchase transportation importexport and marketing of all wild animals with the exception of necessities for scientific research peoples daily 2003  the term wild animal however was both vague and all encompassing without any clear definition of which animals were considered wild and why the farmed tiger frog-another delicacy and one of the best sellers at live animal markets-was singled out as the only wild animal exempt from the ban peoples daily 2003  moreover although land animals-including most amphibians-were strictly banned the status of freshwater and marine animals was less clear restaurants in shanghai for example stopped serving drunken seafood-a culinary method in which small live freshwater or marine animals such as shrimps and clams are dumped into a pot of rice liquor and then eaten almost immediately whether an animal was wild it seems also depended on whether it was raw or cooked for consumption in may 2003 research scientists in hong kong and shenzhen guangdong province working on civet cats isolated viruses similar to the human sars virus and suggested that the civet cat was the likely animal host of the sars virus guan et al 2003  it is noteworthy that although some of these civet cats may have been captured most were commercially farmed almost all were destined to be eaten at restaurants rather than home however the isolation of the civet cat as the animal host of the sars virus did not ease the ban on-or lessen peoples fears of-other wild animals it was only in august 2003 well after the last sars patient was released from the hospital that the ban was relaxed to exempt chinese deer african ostrich turkey scorpion and a total of 54 assorted land animals chinese forestry administration 2003  most of the animals on the list were commercially farmed many were exotic or novel food items the chinese forestry administration explained that the rationale for their exemption was that the farming technologies for these animals were mature enough so that they could be domesticated and bred for commercial purposes 2003 emphasis added-even as the administration admitted that there was no guarantee of control of germs that could potentially jump species the ambiguity of the term wild animal was also one of the topics at my dinner with high school friends we argued over which animals were wild and therefore banned-and whether the banning of wild animals indeed made much difference in dealing with sars our discussion ended not in a consensus but with the arrival of our food along with white towels soaked in disinfectant to clean our hands only at the end of the meal did i find out that we were to pay for these towels even though they were mandatory at restaurants in shanghai in spite of the absence of the snake our dinner did not suffer from the lack of exotic food in addition to novel varieties of shrimps and shellfishes i had my first taste of sturgeon-commercially farmed and braised to perfection in the subsequent weeks the topic of wild animals kept crawling back in various forms into my interviews with medical professionals in shanghai as well as my conversations with other friends when we were eating at restaurants debating the origin of sars or talking about football even though the wild animal was at the center of everyday conversations and government regulations of sars the meaning of the wild was by no means reductively natural nor could it be structurally defined in opposition to domestic or farmed i do not imply here that anything goes as far as the meaning of wild animal is concerned to the contrary i suggest that through the act of banning certain animal foods and markets during the sars outbreak the wild was marked with a set of heterogeneous meanings specifically and intimately related to if not produced by human consumption-consumption in its visceral and discursive dimensions the wildness of the civet cat came under scrutiny when research scientists the chinese government and international media identified the animal as the likely animal host of the sars virus and at the same time an item on the chinese dinner table these human entanglements in the production of the wild animal suggest that what needs to be analyzed in understanding sars is more than the physical body of the civet cat or the generic sequence of the sars-like virus it carried we also need to pay critical attention to the enmeshment of civet cats and other wild creatures deep within everyday life in what follows i argue that it was during a medical social and political crisis of potential global scale that the wild took on contingent and contested forms through a variety of actions that were at once biological political legal historical social transnational and visceral elusive and heterogeneous the wild emerged as a temporary point of convergence in discourses of sars and as i will show at the same time resisted any identification of it as the readily accessible point of origin of the sars epidemic to make this point i first turn to the competing origin stories of sars with a focus on the perhaps most sensational actor in these stories the civet cat one day in april 2004 as i was in the process of writing this article i was confronted with on the one hand reports of a new case of sars originating from a laboratory in beijing and at the same time a new article in far eastern economic review entitled why sars didnt return pottinger 2004  the argument of the article in short is that the virus disappeared because of the successful elimination of wild animal markets in south china including the killing of thousands of civet cats although contrary to the claims of the article the elimination of wild animal markets did not eradicate sars the chinese government immediately responded to the new sars case by announcing the plan to slaughter 10000 more civet cats bradsher and altman 2004  what i wondered makes the civet cat public enemy no 1 in the battles against sars in spite of obvious possibilities of alternative origins and routes of transmission to begin sars was indeed a very bad disease for biomedicine between november 2002 and the end of the epidemic in june 2003 an estimated 8422 people in over 30 countries were infected with various strands of the virus and 916 died as a consequence who 2003  however given that the 11 percent mortality rate of sars is slightly above that of the influenza sars was nowhere near a plague and the panic over sars seemed to have bordered on paranoia this panic was compounded by the fact that even as more and more people fell sick and died biomedical science was late in coming up with an authoritative explanation or effective treatment scientists were not able to identify the virus as a novel coronavirus until april 2003 7 five months after the appearance of first clinical cases holmes 2003  even now there is no effective treatment definitive prognosis or reliable preventive measures against a potential future outbreak in fact scientific communities around the world responded in diverse ways to the question of what should be done when facing such a rapidly spreading epidemic that threatened to reach a global scale whereas some labs immediately delved into the sequencing of the sars genome peiris et al 2003 webster 2004  others rushed to develop a vaccine marshall and enserink 2004  in the second case some scientists conceded that first it would be extremely difficult to develop an effective vaccine given the unusually high evolving rate of the coronavirus second even if scientists managed to produce a vaccine it would take a second large-scale outbreak to test whether the vaccine actually works marshall and enserink 2004  in short sars called into question the efficacy of biomedicine in containing infectious diseases and threw into sharp relief the uncertainties and frailties of the standardized tools and narratives that produce and authorize biomedical knowledge 8 however the inadequacy of biomedicine was not the only factor that fueled the anxiety and paranoia over sars 9 it is noteworthy that speculations over the origin of sars did not simply originate from the lab or the chinese government but had entangled roots in repercussions of recent world events the sudden explosion of media coverage of sars in and especially outside of china coincided not with the outbreak of the epidemic but with the usled invasion of iraq at the end of march 2003 although some earlier speculations in and outside of china suspected the natural and nonhuman origin of sars others spoke of biological weapons was sars a mysterious biological weapon news24com 2003  rumors of sars being a foreign biological weapon spread through chinese websites and some claimed that the novel and highly unusual virus was designed to target chinese genes tong 2003  debates about the origin of sars continue until today-for example whether the virus jumped from animals to humans or the other way around-long after the story of the civet cat as the animal culprit prevailed in research communities and mass media even as competing origin stories abounded medical sanitary and everyday practice in china targeted multiple routes of transmission especially respiratory transmission the possibility of respiratory transmission of sars was emphasized by several different sources in may 2003 the who released a conference report claiming that the major mode of transmission of sars was respiratory although the potential for infection by ingestion must also be considered medical professionals on the ground also noted that infection rates were much higher at high-tech locations such as hospitals with centralized ventilation lee et al 2003 masur et al 2003  in china and hong kong many of those who came down with sars were doctors and nurses who worked at high-tech hospitals such as the prince of wales hospital in hong kong and the peoples hospital in beijing both of which remained quarantined for months during and even after the outbreak some doctors and nurses who risked their lives fighting sars declined to be interviewed on television others agreed to be interviewed on the condition that the interview would not be conducted at their home and that their faces would be obscured so that friends and neighbors would not recognize and avoid them in shanghai there were only eight confirmed cases of sars however fever clinics for anyone who had a temperature higher than 375  celsius 995  fahrenheit and quarantine wards for potential sars patients were set up in all major hospitals a doctor who worked at one of these wards told me that on entering the ward he did not know whether he would get out again he explained i volunteered for the squad to combat sars in april and stayed in the ward without going home for more than four weeks the top floor of our hospital was quarantined for potential sars patients there were 15 beds in there we had no idea how many beds we would eventually need at one end of the ward were the patients beds at the other the beds for doctors there were three beds in between that were kept vacant when i checked on my patients i wore two protection suits three pairs of disposable surgical shoes three masks and a pair of goggles even so i knew that i was still exposed to air when i used the stethoscope i tried to use it as infrequently as possible otherwise i just had to take the risk luckily none of the patients in the ward had sars although some turned out to have measles it was such a relief to be home eventually while i was inside the hospital i heard stories about taxi drivers refusing to take people coming out of the hospital one of our nurses had to call us from her cell phone so that we could tell the driver that she did not have sars so it was just as well that i did not leave the hospital for four weeks conversation with author september 4 2003 although medical and everyday practices-such as wearing masks and frequent disinfection of surface areas with disinfectants including vinegar-worked against multiple and especially respiratory routes of transmission it was the civet cat that became the most infamous creature in the origin stories of sars in what follows i focus on the one origin story that became ubiquitous and dominant in discourses of sars-that of the civet cat and chinas wet markets 10 why among all the competing origin stories and suspected routes of transmission did the civet cat draw the most intense scrutiny from researchers and media in and especially outside of china why does the civet cat along with other wild animals continue to be the target of aggressive government regulation and media controversies even after sars why while images of masked faces on magazine covers became symptomatic of the spread of sars 11 did scientific and popular discourses zero in on practices of chinas wild animal markets in their narratives of origin underlying the fear of the civet cat was the assumptionpopularized by research scientists and mass media in and outside of china-that it was only when humans came into physical contact with the wild animal that the virus jumped species and started a deadly epidemic the story of the zoonotic origin of sars was not only boosted by the identification of the sars virus as a coronavirus similar to flu viruses but also by the speculation that the initial site of the outbreak was hong kong or the guangdong province of southern china both famous for their bold appetites for exotic animal foods moreover the first identified sars patient was reportedly an animal handler who worked in the wild animal food markets in guangdong province  the argument about the link between human appetites and the nonhuman origin of the virus was further consolidated by reports of the discovery of large quantities of sars antibodies among animal dealers in guangdong  in may research scientists in guangdong and hong kong identified the civet cat a delicacy in southern china as the original animal host of the sars virus guan et al 2003  in the meantime research scientists pleaded for the immediate closing of wet markets in china and other asian countries as a measure to stop sars in its track and prevent future outbreaks guan et al 2003  these pleas were quickly and widely publicized in scientific and medical journals as well as through mass media in and especially outside of china as discussed earlier the chinese government responded by banning the consumption of almost all wild land animals at play in the frenzies surrounding the zoonotic origin is the translocal scientific and media representation that the chinese in indulging their appetites for exotic wild animals transgressed proper barriers between human and animal the domestic and the wild and culture and nature in other words the story of zoonotic origin did not blame nature itself for the sars outbreak what went wrong was the chinese peoples uncanny affinity with the nonhuman and the wild this affinity was enabled not only by the highly mutable virus that was crafty enough to move between chinese bodies of both human and nonhuman sorts but also by the visceral act of consumption in fact in both media and scientific origin stories of sars the civet cat and the wet market in which it was sold were often conflated european north american and many chinese newspapers and websites were replete with narratives linking the age-old tradition of eating wild animals with sars these sensational reports portrayed the strange entanglements of human and animal bodies and the deadly filthiness of such entanglements lovgren 2003 rosenthal 2003 sperry 2003 webster 2004 yardley 2004 york 2003  the following is a vivid description of wild animal markets in guangdong by reuters two little boys giggle as they play hide and seek among hundreds of filthy cages packed tight with civet cats dogs porcupines and squirrels    amid the stench of death and decay traders of exotic animals-a culinary delight for many southern chinese-haggle over prices with customers occasionally turning their attention to their children pinching their cheeks or tousling their hair narrow passageways are strewn with animal dung urine entrails and grimy fodder whats there to be afraid of asked mrs huang carrying her three-month-old daughter on her back we have been working and living here for years and we have had no problems a few steps away men with iron pipes clubbed a dog unconscious and slit its throat others squatted around another dead dog plucking it clean of hair with their bare fingers virologists believe that such markets in china and farms where people live in very close proximity to animals are fertile breeding grounds for disease and viruses  reuters 2003 this excerpt is littered with interspecies bodily entanglements cages tightly packed with various animals human adults pinching the cheeks of their children and tousling their hair as they haggle over the prices of animals narrow alleys strewn with animal parts and a dead dog and humans who touch it with their bare fingers these voyeuristic images of the local culinary tradition were then contrasted with and condemned by the sanitized authoritative voice of an abstract virologist unnatural interspecies bodily encounters breed disease and viruses and the unnatural affinity with animals through eating the stories go lies in a chinese way of life that has existed for as long as anyone can remember lynch 2003 as a logical consequence of this kind of reasoning many scientists cautiously recommended the eradication of wet markets while at the same time identifying chinese peoples culinary taste as a public health hazard and a deeply rooted cultural tradition that needed to be respected bradsher and altman 2004 nature 2004 watts 2004134 webster 2004  these accusatory ambivalences and voyeuristic curiosities toward visceral entanglements of chinese bodies of both human and nonhuman sorts should come as no surprise to my readers similar discourses plague wet markets and restaurants in chinatowns in the united states in his article fish stories environmentalist disgust and the viscerality of race timothy choy 1997 examines environmentalist discourses surrounding fresh kills in the wet markets of san franciscos chinatown and what he calls the racial signification of the accusation you eat fish he argues that the identification of the chineseness of certain food practices begs a critical analysis of race that takes into account the visceral qualities of racial discourse i find choys observations useful for thinking through similar accusations you eat dogs you eat civet cats you eat grasshoppers the proliferation of these you-eat-animalss in everyday discourse of chineseness and even asianness underscores the viscerality of racialized orientalist tropes that produce various exotic others through their excessive pleasures and enjoyments in the case of scientific and popular discourses of sars we see the recurrence of a familiar narrative strategy that visceralizes the traditional and the uncanny as the origin of a culturally specific disease that-if not contained-threatens to destroy the global the civet cat in particular became a protagonist in the origin stories of sars because it conjured up familiar orientalist representations in which the wildness and exoticness of chinese bodies-of both human and nonhuman sorts-emerged out of visceral acts of consuming although these tropes are nothing new i am intrigued first by their obsession with the viscerality of consumption and the effectiveness of the visceral in producing racialized bodies identities and subjectivities moreover i suggest that while mass media and scientific representations constructed a visceralized ancient epicurean tradition of china as the real origin of the sars outbreak they also did so by locating narratives of excess squarely within the sphere of the market and mass consumption which is not an emblem of ancient chinese culture but a product of recent economic social and political transformations in china as has been pointed out by judith farquhar the largescale marketization and consumption of food in china today has as much to do with the general deficiency of the mao era as with the excess of a post-mao china in which desires for consumption are discursively cultivated and embodied farquhar 2002  farquhar argues that the practice of excess in postsocialist china is a response to the general state of deficiency-if not hunger itself-of the mao era she further points out that such excess is often localized compared to the pervasive state of deficiency that characterized the chinese state and society in general during the mao era the excess in consumption has so far been restricted to urban areas and the emerging middle class it is no surprise perhaps that the sars outbreak was at its worst in the prosperous guangdong province and the capital city beijing i am interested then in how persistent strategies of othering are refigured for discourses and practices of middle-class lifestyle and consumer choice i suggest that in contrast to orientalist representations that conjure up the familiar image of one uniformly exotic china a closer look at the heterogeneous discourses and practices of consumption suggests a more elusive and fragmented picture of china and the chinese rather than being emblematic of an anonymous chinese culture visceral practices of consumption in china today are intimately entangled in the emergence of an urban middle class the rest of this article then is a preliminary examination of the ways in which competing visions understandings and practices of cosmopolitan bodies and subjectivities are produced in the wake of the sars epidemic instead of discussing marketization and consumption strictly in terms of chinas participation in the global domination of neoliberalism i now want to focus on how competing visions and practices of the cosmopolitan are produced through consumption in particular the production of contested middle-class cosmopolitan subjectivities mapped onto racialized disciplined healthy bodies let me now return to real madrid and david beckhams tour of china although the european medias interest in real madrids china tour waned after the welcoming banquet fiasco the chinese media and public in contrast continued to be fascinated by every move of the team and beckham in particular is he getting along well with his new teammates he lets his hair down today is this a new fashion statement or is he in a bad mood one report asserted that beckham has such an extraordinary body that even his sweat-drenched jersey smelled fragrant all these observations were duly posted on sinacom and further proliferated through chat rooms and personal websites in contrast to beckham his teammate ronaldo one of the most famous brazilian football players today received comments on his body that were far less favorable the chinese media joined european commentaries on ronaldos weight problem giving him the nickname feiluo lit fei means obese and luo is the first character in the chinese translation of ronaldos name the chinese reports during the real madrid tour moreover focused not only on ronaldos weight but also more importantly on the presumed lack of control over his appetites sinacom gave ronaldo an amount of attention second only to beckham it suggested that ronaldos decadent lifestyle during his summer vacation on the mediterranean island of sardinia made him fat he was always hungry and looking for good food and he had become so overweight that he could barely run on the pitch sinacom 2003  the contrast between the chinese medias treatment of beckhams and ronaldos bodies is indicative of incongruous visions for cosmopolitan bodies and neoliberal subjectivities whereas beckhams body was blond disciplined healthy and sexy ronaldos racially ambiguous body was depicted to embody failures in disciplining an excessive appetite-which as we recall was blamed for the outbreak of sars the chinese media then was already steeped in racialized orientalist and neoliberal discourses of the body unlike their european counterparts however their anxieties over delayed modernity were palpable in the salient juxtapositions of beckham and ronaldo ronaldo is perhaps as cosmopolitan as beckham but in choosing unwisely he proved not to be a very good neoliberal consumer which also made him not a very good neoliberal consumable the ridicule of ronaldo further set up the disciplined beckham as the neoliberal poster boy and a very good consumable at the same time the desire for beckhams body reached its climax not during real madrids china trip but after after real madrids departure from beijing which was the last stop of their china tour a number of memorabilia were publicly auctioned the most curious items were things used by david beckham at the hotel slippers pajamas and bed sheets-unwashed the slippers and pajamas were auctioned at 2800 yuan about 350 apiece reportedly purchased by a chinese father for his daughter sinacom 2003  the money ironically went to a charity fund for children orphaned by the sars epidemic british broadcasting company 2003  here the fear of germs was apparently forgotten beckhams body was not seen as a pollutant but something when consumed that could contribute to the fight against virulent germs this moment of identification mediated by the consumption of fragments and peripheries of beckhams body crystallizes a particular anticipatory discourse of neoliberalism one in which china and chinese desires are to be articulated and included not exoticized and othered in this last story of encounters of bodies as consumables the distinction between the world of goods and the sphere of human identities were again called into question this time the chinese human body was not aligned with the civet cat and the grasshopper but david beckham emerging out of this realignment of human and nonhuman bodies is a different vision and articulation of the cosmopolitan world and chinas place in it persisting anxieties over a world of out-of-place unruly bodies are subdued by the aspirations for membership in an emerging middle-class cosmopolitan world of disciplined healthy sexy bodies even as these anxieties make such aspirations all the more urgent instead of subscribing to the view that pitches tradition and culture against neoliberal subjectivities and practices i have endeavored to understand the heterogeneous discourses and practices of consumption in relation to persisting orientalist tropes as well as neoliberal imaginaries in post-sars china rather than assuming or anticipating the flourish of a more or less uniform neoliberal subjectivity in post-sars china i have focused on the divergent compet-ing and embodied visions and practices of identity production and subject formation i have argued that the unruly human and nonhuman consumables and those who consume them challenge us to critically rethink the ways in which nature and culture wild and domestic traditional and modern past and future are invoked and refigured in diverse and meaningful ways by focusing on consumption-as-eating and consumption-as-spending i have brought to the foreground the importance of the visceral in contemporary knowledge production by arguing for the visceral i am not proposing a phenomenological approach to the body nor am i interested in setting up eating or tasting as non-western ways of knowing and being rather what i want to highlight here is that the visceral is already discursive as noted by gary shapiro 2003  michel foucaults notion of disciplinary power is intimately connected to the technology of the vision a notion that is itself visualized through foucaults discussion of jeremy benthams design of the panopticon the idea of which hinges on a fictional gaze a simple architectural equivalent of the traditional eye of god 2003298  foucaults analysis of disciplinary power then has its own genealogy of vision which has been a privileged position of modern knowledge production i here think of for example haraways critique of the gods eye view that authorizes the universality of a masculine science 1991  i also think of voices from within medical anthropology that tell us that vision is but one of the senses through which we have come to know the world however these other senses-taste hearing touching and smelling-have often been relegated to archaic or non-western modes of knowledge production and subject formation in his article on cassette sermons in contemporary egypt charles hirschkind 2001 argues for an ethnography of the sensorial that considers listening as a disciplinary practice and its role in subject formation likewise miyako inoue 2003 has described the ways in which listening shapes japanese womens language and their emergence as modern gendered subjects i find these discussions tremendously helpful in broadening our understanding of knowledge production and subject formation in the contemporary world in placing the visceral at the center of this piece then i have tried to draw attention to the ways in which the visceral is already discursively produced and cultivated if the civet cat is not always good to eat it is still good to think 1 i here adopt the more widely used term football rather than the us term soccer 2 the oxford english dictionary has a long list of alternative definitions for consume all of which involve connotations of degeneracy wastefulness or exhaustion-a far cry from rational consumption circulated through neoliberal discourses relevant to my topics in this article are consume 2 to spend goods or money esp wastefully and consume 3b to make away with food devour swallow eat up drink up 3 becks is a nickname for beckham 4 sinacom did include however images of heavily made-up young women clad in ethnic minority clothing welcoming the real madrid players who looked bewildered or bored 5 during my trip i found that sars still fresh in peoples memories was a recurring theme in my conversations with medical professionals as well as other friends and acquaintances who lived through the epidemic even the most mundane daily activitiestaking the elevator for example-somehow turned into a conversation about sars in this article i juxtapose personal stories with articles from science journals popular magazines newspapers and websites to examine the lingering presence of sars and how it speeded up consumption activities the form of this article then also serves as a reflection on the media of circulations encounters and ruptures 6 the popularity of snakes at restaurants in shanghai was related to the rise of medicinal food and female beauty products in urban china snake is considered a good source of yin energy the cool feminine descending and nurturing energy it is commonly recommended for women as a medicinal food to nourish their yin energy and thus give them smoother and more beautiful skin fried snakes are not recommended for beauty purposes because the frying process depletes yin energy 7 a coronavirus is a type of virus that contains single-stranded rnas and is shaped like a crown when seen under a microscope it is a main cause of respiratory infections among humans and animals 8 as biomedical researchers struggled to identify the virus practitioners of traditional chinese medicine used sars as one of the opportunities to advertise the clinical efficacy of traditional herbal medicine in contrast to biomedicine zhan 2001  for example students at beijing university were given herbal packages that contained eight different herbs as a preventive measure the jade screen a yuan dynasty prescription was used to treat patients with sars symptoms before the virus was identified proponents of traditional chinese medicine argued that because traditional chinese medicine uses syndrome differentiation to treat patients it does not rely on the identification of the pathogen as a prerequisite for reliable diagnosis and effective treatment 9 medical professionals in shanghai told me that they believed that the first cases of sars probably occurred as early as november 2002 however the international media explosion over sars did not happen until the end of march 2003 there have been several explanations for this delay one explanation-especially from north america and europe-is the cover-up by the chinese government north american and european scientists and media criticized the chinese government for its authoritarian and secretive approach to the epidemic and urged for more democratic ways of handling the crisis in china however some suggest that the public disclosure of sars and the subsequent intervention by the chinese government were not only because of international pressure some medical professionals pointed out to me that the clinical symptoms and autopsies of sars patients were easily confused with those of pneumonia on the other hand it was impossible to keep sars a secret because of the fast rate at which the disease spread-causing entire hospitals to be quarantined 10 wet market is a term that describes markets in which livestock and wild animals are sold alive especially as food items the word wet emphasizes the wet and slippery floors-and filthiness by association-of these markets interestingly although wet market had been used to describe markets in chinatowns of the united states its popularity in english usage soared during media coverage of the sars outbreak 11 for example the april 26 2003 issue of the economist adopted on its front cover an image of chairman mao wearing a mask the may 5 2003 issue of time presented on its cover a blond-haired blue-eyed young woman wearing a mask to alert the readers to the global threat of sars most images however depicted not individuals but masses of asian bodies wearing masks this focus on the spread of sars through sneezing and other forms of contact thus also played on an old orientalist image of china-and east asia-as a densely crowded place where contamination is spread very easily  asymptomatic novel coronavirus pneumonia patient outside wuhan the value of ct images in the course of the disease chen lin yuxiao ding bin xie zhujian sun xiaogang li zixian chen meng niu   in wuhan china in december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology appeared soon after diagnosed as being caused by a novel coronavirus initially titled 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and subsequently officially named covid-19 by the who on february 11 2020 1 as of february 14 2020 there are 49053 laboratory-confirmed cases globally 2 15 of which are in the united states 3 there is a small but growing body of literature regarding the imaging findings of covid-19 and the purpose of this case report is to describe the imaging and associated clinical features of an asymptomatic covid-19 patient outside wuhan china including an imaging finding previously not reported a 61-year-old asymptomatic man was admitted to our hospital in lanzhou china 1005 miles from wuhan on january 25 2020 for close contact with a novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp patient more than 10 days prior the patient was a retired driver in good health without diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease and had no history of smoking the patients temperature and physical examination were normal laboratory analysis showed reduced levels of c-reactive protein 129 mgl normal range 28 mgl but white blood cells and lymphocytes were within normal range the patients throat swab was positive for ncp nucleic acid on the day of admission high resolution ct hrct showed multiple ground glass opacities ggos in the right lung fig 1
a b two days later ct images revealed an enlarged lesion with small areas of consolidation in the center fig 1c d on the sixth day ct examination showed that the quantity range and density of lesions in the right lung had increased further fig 1e on ct on the 9th day of admission the lesions progressed further and involved both lungs with thickened interlobular septa around the lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung fig 1f g in addition there were small bilateral pleural effusions fig 1h since admission the patient has remained with only mild shortness of breath after activity on the 11th day of admission february 4 2020 he has not had fever cough myalgias fatigue sputum production headache hemoptysis or diarrhea notably he has also remained without complications previously reported in association with covid-19 including acute respiratory distress syndrome rnaaemia acute cardiac injury secondary infection during the hospitalization the main treatment has been oral antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir tablets interferon and methylprednisolone on the 23th day of admission february 16 2020 ct showed that the patients pleural effusions had resolved and bilateral pulmonary lesions improved fig 2
a b however the patient remains hospitalized because his nucleic acid test is still positive the purpose of this case report is to describe the imaging and associated clinical features of an asymptomatic covid-19 patient outside wuhan china the principle findings are that in this patient with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 ct findings preceded symptoms and included bilateral pleural effusions previously not reported in association with covid-19 there is a small but growing body of literature regarding the imaging findings of covid-19 11 articles in the english language literature in pub med on february 15 2020 4 and the patient in this case report demonstrates both similarities and differences compared with the literature most noteworthy is that the covid-19 patient in this case is the first reported to the best of our knowledge with associated bilateral pleural effusions on the other hand consistent with 98 of patients in the initial landmark lancet article with a sample size of 41 5 the imaging findings of this patient with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection ultimately had bilateral pulmonary involvement yet in contrast to patients in the lancet cohort for whom later chest ct images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity whereas the consolidation had been resolved 5 for the patient in this case report earlier chest ct images showed ground glass opacities ggos and later chest ct images showed progressive bilateral consolidation the covid-19 patient in this report was also similar to a study from european radiology with a sample size of 63 which demonstrated multilobar findings ggos and progression in the majority of patients 6 the covid-19 patient in this report showed similarity to a cohort of 21 patients reported in radiology as well in which the lung abnormalities on chest ct in patients with covid-19 showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms 7 in the patient in this case report ct chest changes were greatest at day nine in sum emerging information seems to suggest that typical imaging findings of covid-19 include ggo andor mixed ggo and mixed consolidation 8 this case report contributes to the growing literature on covid-19 by reporting for the first time the associated finding of bilateral pleural effusions limitations of this case report include the sample size n  1 and lack of some desired information including sputum culture or analysis of pleural fluid despite these limitations the goal in writing this case report is hopefully the education of radiologists and other clinicians of the recognition of this new disease 9 which has been declared a global health emergency by the who in conclusion this patient with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection demonstrates that abnormal ct findings can preceed clinical symptoms and that these abnormal ct findings may include bilateral pleural effusions future series and studies should seek to assess if this is the case on a larger scale as well as the association between viral clearance of covid-19 on laboratory analysis and clearance on imaging in patients whose exposure history and epidemiological history can be determined the imaging manifestations high resolution ct may be helpful for the diagnosis and observation in the course of this unfortunately exponentially growing disease this work was supported by the gansu province youth science and technology foundation 18jr3ra364 the gansu provincial health industry research projects foundation gswsky2016-34 and the first hospital of lanzhou university hospital foundation ldyyyn2015-06 the authors wish to thank elizabeth k arleo md for her assistance in writing this article 
clinical imaging extends its best wishes to the radiologists and other health care providers in china as well as to the patients affected with covid-19  our thoughts are with you during this unbelievably difficult time  critical differences between the binding features of the spike proteins of
sars-cov-2 and sars-cov chen bai arieh warshel   the 2019 coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has been spread globally since its first outbreak in wuhan china
in december 201913 common symptoms of
sars-cov-2 infected patients involve fever cough and fatigue with an estimated death rate
of 354 it has already caused more than 7 million confirmed
cases and more than 400000 deaths all over the world at the time this work is written in
addition to health concerns the disease also brought severe economic and social
issues5 while the situation of wuhan has been stepped down europe and
the united states are experiencing a major epidemic thus it is crucial to understand the
infection and spreading process and find measures to mitigate the epidemic situation the sars-cov-2 is a member of the beta-coronavirus genus6 which also
includes the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle-east
respiratory syndrome virus mers the sars-cov-2 virus appears to be optimized for binding
to the human receptor ace27 and the binding patterns between ace2 and
sars-cov-2 or sars-cov at the receptor binding domain rbd are thought to be almost
identical8 more specifically sars-cov-2 shares 7678
sequence identity with sars-cov for the whole protein and 7376 for the rbd9 the trimeric spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 is comprised of three s1s2
units and the rbd locates at s1 one variation the s1s2 cleavage site of sars-cov-2 is a
unique rrar furin recognition site10 while in sars-cov
it is a single arginine11 the three s1s2 units undergo a hingelike
conformational switch between up and down states only at
the up state the rbd is exposed and is able to bind to the receptor while
at the down state the rbd is hidden and is inaccessible by the
receptor12 for sars-cov the spike trimer with two
down and one up is the most populated state13 this could very likely be the case for sars-cov-2 but to our knowledge no
experimental statistical measurement has been reported yet a recent study pointed out the
possibility of two spike proteins binding with the same ace214 after
binding to the receptor the following cascade of events is triggered the spike protein
undergoes a large conformational change the s1 with the receptor is shed s2 is transformed
to a more stable postfusion state and finally the viral membrane is fused with the cell
membrane1516 despite the similarities in structures and binding patterns between the two viruses
sars-cov-2 spreads faster than sars-cov and this might be due to the stronger binding of the
ace2-sars-cov-2 complex12 the range of experimental binding affinities
of the two ace2-virus is wide with reports of 15 nm12 and 150185
nm13 for the ace2-sars-cov-2 and the ace2-sars-cov complexes
respectively and also reports of 47 nm and 31 nm8 and 12 nm and 50
nm17 for both systems respectively in all cases the ace2-sars-cov-2
complex shows a larger binding affinity than ace2-sars-cov on the other hand although the
sequences and epitope have been studied extensively it is still unclear what is the
structuralenergetic basis for the difference between the two complexes moreover the
receptor binding is a crucial step for drug and antibody interference with the infection
process thus this work will focus on understanding the detailed differences between the
binding features of the two coronaviruses and the human receptor ace2 recent works yielded high-resolution structure of sars-cov-2 at its prefusion state14 as well as the complex of its rbd domain and ace28 these
emerging structures provide an opportunity to use computational modeling to investigate the
underlying mechanism behind the differences in binding strengths of the two ace2-virus
complexes however such a task is very challenging for example recent theoretical work18 analyzed the number of contacts interface area and fluctuations and
concluded that different viruses have different strategy for binding however this work
could not obtain the correct order of binding affinity between the ace2-sars-cov-2 and
ace2-sars-cov complexes obviously the main issue is the differences in interaction of free energies between the
two types of viruses and the receptor as this energy is essential for understanding the
binding process evaluating the binding energy of a very large protein complex is an
enormous challenge for fully atomistic models and thus we chose here to use our
coarse-grained cg model1921 to study the energetics of
the complexes our cg model has been consistently developed and systematically calibrated to
account for proper evaluation of electrostatic free energies of proteins and membranes
including of course solvation and hydrophobic effects the model was applied extensively
to many systems calculating protein-folding free energies and related
properties2224 here we use the model to
evaluate the binding of the virus to ace2 our analysis of the binding patterns found that the substitutions of residues near the rbd
of sars-cov in the conversion to sars-cov-2 is not the reason for the increase in binding
energy it is found that the major contribution actually comes from the body of the spike
protein that is away from the rbd it is also found that the antibody of sars-cov that did
not show cross-reactivity might be partially due to the fact that the binding interface is
partially covered compare to the situation in the ace2-sars-cov-2 complex in this work we used modeler25 to perform homology modeling in
constructing the binding complexes of ace2-sars-cov-2 and m396-sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2
structure was taken from the recent cryo-em study pdb id 6vsb12 with an incomplete receptor binding
domain for the binding domain we used the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 rbd that is
bound to ace2 pdb id 6m0j8 the binding between m396 and sars-cov-2 was modeled using the m396-sars-cov
structure as a template pdb id 2dd826 subsequently we utilized our cg model to calculate the free energy of each structure and
the relevant binding energies our cg model is focused on the electrostatic free energy of
the protein that involves the solvation energy and the interactions between charged and
polar residues the full cg treatment includes membrane terms see si which are not included in the present case since the membrane is out of
the system studied the total cg energy is defined as follows20 see also
si the terms on the right are the side chain van der waals energy main chain solvation
energy main chain hydrogen bond energy side chain electrostatic energy side chain polar
energy side chain hydrophobic energy main chainside chain electrostatic energy and main
chainside chain van der waals energy respectively the scaling coefficients
c1 c2 and
c3 are taking values of 010 025 and 015 in this work before the evaluation of the free energy we used a monte carlo proton transfer mcpt
method20 to determine the charge configuration of all ionizable
residues in the system in the mcpt approach the mc procedure controls proton transfer
moves between ionizable residues or between one ionizable residue and the bulk the
acceptance probability of the move is determined by standard metropolis criteria see
si by such calculations we are able to get the cg free energy of each
protein configuration and also the electrostatic contribution of each residue when they are
either in the ace2-virus complex or in the unbound state note that the cg already
represents the free energy of the system and not the potential energy all calculations and
simulations were carried out using the molaris-xg package2728 for more details see si we started by trying to evaluate the binding energy differences between the two complexes
ace2-sars-cov-2 and ace2-sars-cov and to determine where the difference is coming from
this study utilized the recently published cryo-em structure of sars-cov-2 pdb id 6vsb12 and the crystal
structure of its rbd and ace2 pdb id 6m0j8 and performed homology-modeling in order to obtain
the structure of the ace2-sars-cov-2 complex the structure of ace2-sars-cov has been taken
from a previous work pdb id 6cs213 after getting the structures we performed energy
minimization and molecular dynamics for structural relaxation this procedure was followed
by the mcpt algorithm20 that determines the optimal charge distribution
of the ionizable residues and obtained the cg energies of the ace2-sars-cov-2 and
ace2-sars-cov complexes with the same treatment we obtained the cg energies of the ace2
sars-cov and sars-cov-2 monomers at infinite distance separation the ace2-virus binding
free energy was then calculated by gbinding 
gcomplex  gace2 
gvirus even though the binding mode of the two ace2-virus complexes figure 1b were argued to be almost identical8 we still
obtained binding energy of 707 kcalmol for ace2-sars-cov-2 and 664 for
ace2-sars-cov respectively as expected the major difference come from electrostatic
contributions at this point the binding energy difference could either be an effect of the
nonconserved residues or the change in structures of the two complexes near or outside the
rbds to understand this issue in a more quantitative way we evaluated the electrostatic
contributions of each residue to the total binding free energy of the two complexes see
figure 2a it was found that some residues give
positive contributions while others give negative contributions this finding is consistent
with the results that show some interactions at the binding interface strengthen while
others weaken the binding14 to see whether the difference in binding
comes from the rbd we further classified the free energy contributions based on their
distances from the binding site thus we plotted in figure 2b the contributions of the residues within given range to the total
free energy this was done according to the distances to the n501 residue of ace2-sars-cov-2
or to t487 of ace2-sars-cov to our surprise if we consider the residues within 60 
of the binding site it is found that the ace2-sars-cov complex has a stronger binding
affinity its curve is below that of the ace2-sars-cov-2 curve apparently the residues
between 60 and 120  are the residues that switched the trend this result indicates
that the binding to the receptor in a remote position from the binding site possibly leads
to a stronger binding in ace2-sars-cov-2 than in ace2-sars-cov interestingly the three
s1s2 cleavage sites also locate within the 60120  range in view of the above conclusion we tried to examine whether the finding of long-range
interactions is coincidental thus we tested the influence of effective dielectric constant
in the cg model using a constant between 60 and 90 and also use a function of the form
eff  1  1 
exprij where we used
  80 and   08 it was found that the trend stayed similar to the
different dielectric constants it is still possible that including the effect of the ionic
strength would reduce the binding difference at the long distance but the sign is very
unlikely to change it should be noted that the value of the overall calculated binding energy is most probably
an overestimate one missing effect is the entropy contribution of the separate parts of the
complex which is equal for the two systems another missing effect is the above-mentioned
effect of the ionic strength that would reduce the electrostatic interaction to illustrate the contributions of each residue we plot their contributions in figure 2cd the figure assigns each residue one color
by its free energy contribution both complexes have residues with relatively large energy
changes near the binding site red and yellow colors and according to figure 2b these contributions are more negative for
ace2-sars-cov-2 however when we move outside the rbd more residues of this type appear in
the thinner spike protein body of sars-cov2 compared to the fatter spike protein body of
sars-cov it suggests that for both ace2-virus complexes some residues at the rbd region
strengthen the binding while others weaken it figure 2a however the interactions change between 60 to 120  at the binding site
makes the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 stronger figure 2b and may indicate an effective evolution of the spike protein body of the novel
virus this larger binding affinity might explain why sars-cov-2 spreads faster than
sars-cov because of the structural homology and similar binding patterns several rbd-directed
monoclonal antibodies m396 s230 80r of sars-cov have been tested for sars-cov-2 but
none of them could show cross-reactivity812 another antibody cr3022 that was obtained from a
convalescent sars-cov patient could bind to sars-cov-2 but still could not neutralize the
virus even at a concentration as high as 400 gml and its cross-reactivity was
attributed to the high percentage of targeted epitope residues 8629 in this work we tried to understand the absence of cross-reactivity by studying the binding
pattern between sars-cov-2 with one of the sars-cov antibody m396 we used homology
modeling to generate a structure of the m396-sars-cov-2 complex from sars-cov-2 pdb id
6vsb12 and
m396-sars-cov rbd pdb id 2dd826 structures for the antibody-virus complexes we
used gbinding  gcomplex
 gm396  gvirus
figure 3a shows the overlapped structures of the
ace2-sars-cov-2 and m396-sars-cov-2 complexes that are aligned toward the virus body
visually the m396 antibody only covers part of the ace2-sars-cov-2 binding interface as
before we analyzed the distance-dependent electrostatic energy contributions of the
m396-virus complex as seen from figure 3b the
binding of m396 and sars-cov-2 does not result in structuralenergetic differences that can
lead to an increase of interactions in the range between 60 and 120  as was observed
in the ace2-sars-cov-2 complex the energy contribution near the rbd 60  is also
weaker in comparison to the corresponding contribution in the ace2-virus complex overall
m396 shows an ineffective binding pattern that misses part of the epitopes of ace2 that
could trigger the following structural changes and this might also be the case for other
antibodies that did not show cross-reactivity to mimic the ace2-sars-cov-2 binding pattern
zhang et al synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ace2 peptidase domain 1
helix30 however the binding affinity was not strong this might be an
effect of the instability of a small helix fragment structural analysis shows that there are 14 key residues that participate in the binding
between ace2 and sars-cov17 among them eight are conserved in
sars-cov-2 and the other six are mutated the six mutated residues are n439r426
sars-cov-2sars-cov l455y442 f486l472 q493n478 q498y484 and n501t487 figure 4a to understand how the substituted residues
would affect binding energy we performed mutation calculations for the two ace2-virus
complexes the residues of ace2-sars-cov-2 were mutated to the one in the corresponding
position in ace2-sars-cov and vice versa after introducing the mutation we performed
another relaxation run before the cg mcpt free energy evaluation as shown in table 1 all mutated ace2-sars-cov-2 constructs are
less stable compared to the wild-type system while the mutated ace2-sars-cov shows the
opposite results this is consistent with our previous distance-dependent binding energy
contributions near the rbd where we find that the ace2 and sars-cov complex gives a more
favorable binding pattern than in the ace2-sars-cov-2 complex figure 2b the mutation calculation suggests that the effective binding of
the novel virus might happen at the remote part the current work explored the structuralenergetic basis of the difference in binding
energy between the sars-cov-2ace2 and the sars-covace2 complexes it was found that the
binding of sars-cov-2 is more favorable not because its rbd has been optimized but because
the sars-cov-2 glycoprotein trimer body has been evolved to bind stronger at distanced sites
in fact if we just consider the rbd then sars-cov is more favorable it is not very clear
if this stronger binding is converted to conformational changes cleavage and subsequent
fusion events however if this is the case we have an interesting explanation of the reason
why the novel coronavirus spreads faster and easier the results also suggest to use the
novel virus as a template during drugantibody design with the whole spike protein as a
binding template instead of a fraction of the rbd that might neglect the essential changes

of severe respiratory illnesses such as the middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov and sars the world health organization who defines sars-cov-2 as a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans5 the sars-cov-2 was identified through the ongoing surveillance for pneumonia of unknown aetiology which was initiated in 2003-2004 in the aftermath of the sars outbreak6 the first four cases of covid-19 were identified through this routine surveillance programme deployed through the local healthcare facilities and were epidemiologically linked to the huanan southern china seafood wholesale market7 since then there has been a steady increase in the burden of covid-19 with 60347 confirmed cases and 1369 deaths reported globally as of 13th february 2020 with cases emerging from as many as 29 countries and travel-related importations also being reported the global health security implications of covid-19 have come to the fore489 in response susceptible countries have mounted public health measures to mitigate the threat of proliferation of covid-19 in india airport entry screening has been initiated existing visas from china have been cancelled and travellers returning from covid-19-affected areas have been quarantined given the implications of importation of cases and the impact thereof on the local epidemiology of covid-19 in secondary foci it is essential to break ground on preparing health facilities to combat a local cluster of covid-19 cases a well-equipped dedicated hospital facility dhf to deal with these cases with adequate protections for healthcare workers and other patients is the key to the standard of care critical care and humane approach to acutely ill patients are essential ingredients of an epidemic control while the course of the cov in india is uncertain setting up of such units is important for future epidemics due to dangerous pathogens and antimicrobial resistant organisms including drug-resistant tuberculosis during the inter epidemic period such wards can be used for training of physicians during inter epidemic period here we focus on establishing a biosecurity ward de novo or in a makeshift manner in a tertiary healthcare facility to manage patients or suspected cases in an effort to combat the spread of covid-19 a scientific and evidence-based design shall be the key to

lsecpatient or in negative pressure rooms at least 12 air changes per hour ach and controlled direction of air flow when using mechanical ventilation negative pressure rooms negative pressure rooms include mechanical ventilation systems which maintain the pressure of the room at a slightly lower level than the pressure of the entry area so that it allows air to flow into the isolation room but not escape from the room as air naturally flows from areas with higher pressure to areas with lower pressure thereby preventing contaminated air from the isolation room to escape outwards the negative pressure room should have a minimum of 12 ach in a high-risk area for airborne transmission compared to six ach per hour in a low-risk area negative pressure differential between airflow from adjacent spaces to the patient room should be 25 pascal an airflow differential 125 cfm 56 lsec should be maintained between exhaust and supply sealing of the room entry should have provision of allowing approximately 05 square feet 0046 m2 leakage clean air entering the room should flow first to the area of the room where staff or visitors are likely to be present and then flow across the bed area to the exhaust direction of airflow and patient beds should not be in the same direction the air from inside the room should be allowed to flow out via an exhaust fan or a high-efficiency particulate air hepa filter there should be an anteroom outside of the negative pressure room the pressure of which should be negative to the hallway and positive to the patient room so that unidirectional airflow is maintained24 hepa filter should be placed in each room and if not available adequate ventilation should be ensured exhaust fans must be properly installed closely fitting to the window hepa filter is useful in small volume settings such as bronchoscopy suites laboratories or individual tb patient rooms careful attention should be given to the equivalent ach the filter requires as most filters clean very little air per hour maintenance of hepa filters with timely replacement of the membrane is necessary to ensure its functionality the efficiency of filters and sustainability of negative pressure must be validated before dhf is open to patients subsequently validation must be undertaken regularly and at pre-decided intervals through a certified agency renovating or converting a room while establishing an isolation room or a class n room negative pressure room in an existing facility available infrastructure and financial implications for carrying out changes must be considered it is rarely possible to create an ideal room there is an extensive list of requirements given in guidelines for the classification and design of isolation rooms in healthcare facilities which are the basic requirements to be met before any conversion25 some of the salient requirements are the presence of a clinical handwash basin with non-touch fixed tap wall mounted soap dispensers handrub dispensers disposable towel holders glove dispensers clean waste bins in accordance to the bio-medical waste management amendment rules 201826 and provision of two-way intercommunication system between the patients room and the nurses station this document also gives insight into what considerations an institute needs to consider before converting a room into a class n room the recirculating air system needs to be disconnected it would be a preferred option to adjust the building ventilation system to create a permanent negative pressure room or to add a hepa filtration unit as a supplement or install it permanently in the hospital ventilation system one should be able to seal the room adequately dampers should be adjusted since clinical manifestations of sars-cov-2 infection

pinhong wang yaqing chang jinhai yu chunyan li gaorong xu   in early 2004 epidemic mortalities among cultured sea cucumber juveniles from a peristome edema disease with no identified agent were reported from shangdong province china they were followed by reports of sea cucumber adults with peristome edema disease and mortality of 10 in early 2005 the disease broke out again and the epidemic-stricken area spread to liaoning province china the mortalities of sea cucumber adults and juveniles were as high as 40 chang yq 20 march 2005 key lab reports a number of laboratories in china have undertaken the identification of the causative agent and tried to prevent its spread or outbreak in 2006 the diseased sea cucumbers first show edema in their peristomes the tentacles cannot retract completely and adhesion capacities for holding of tube feet on vertical surfaces weaken consequently most of them drop to the bottom of ponds compared to the normal ones the grazing rate and activity of the diseased sea cucumbers decreased obviously and 80 of individuals eviscerate about 23 days later small white lesions usually appear in some of the diseased sea cucumbers and gradually expand with increased mucus secretion over large areas of the body wall about 56 days later the diseased sea cucumber will die and mortality may be more than 90 wang et al 2005 according to the

a the nuclei of infected cells were of amorphous and hyper-stained with no nucleoli observed the endoplasmic reticulum attached to the karyotheca obviously swelled and formed a separation cisternae between the nucleus and the cytoplasm fig 2b except for abnormally high mitochondrial densities the cytoplasm of infected cells was nearly free of cellular structures and composed of large areas of granular material and empty vesicles the empty vesicles in cells differed some were empty with clear membranes some were empty but without clear edges fig 2c and some contained few virions along the encircling membranes many intact virus particles were found both inside and outside the cytopathic cells most of them were enveloped with diameters between 80 and 100 nm lengths of the protrusions in envelope went between 10 and 20 nm fig 2d inset nucleocapsids were always round in shape with diameters between 45 and 70 nm similar to what has been reported previously for coronaviruses in cytopathic cells of aped virus particles always aggregated and formed a virus vesicle with an encircling membrane within such vesicles diameters of virus particles were about 50 nm staining of the virus differed some were electron lucent in the center as if hollow some were electron-dense with petal-like pattern fig 2d in normal intestine epithelium cells of healthy sea cucumbers the nuclear envelope as usual ferreira and manker 1965 is formed by two membranes with pores and the nucleoprotein consists of granular and filamentous components randomly distributed in each nucleus one or two nucleoli are regularly seen in the cytoplasm the golgi complex is generally apparent in a peri-nuclear position mitochondria ribosomes rough membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and occasionally small lipid inclusions are diffusedly scattered through the cytoplasm the morphologic features of the virus particles in sea cucumber were similar to those of the family coronaviridae large ill-defined areas of cytoplasm containing ribosome-like structures and devoid of other organelles were noted in some virus-infected cells fig 3
a on the other hand in some virus-containing vesicles dense granular material was seen interspersed between the virions cytoplasmic inclusions of electron-dense viral nucleocapsids were mostly found in association with virus-containing vesicles or empty vesicles fig 3b tubular structures averaging 25 nm in diameter were seen within some virus-containing vesicles some ends of the tubular structures swell and are similar to the spherical virions fig 3c tubular structures within nonvirus-containing vesicles whose size and morphology are similar to those in virus-containing vesicles are also found fig 3d outside the virus-containing vesicles but always adjacent to the vesicles there occurred another kind of tubular structures averaging 15 nm in diameter some of these linear structures were arrayed at low density fig 4
a and some of them were dense compactly and orderly fig 4b additional cytoplasmic structures associated with virus infections were double-membrane vesicles which have been similarly noted in coronavirus-infected cells dubois et al 1982 gosert et al 2002 in contrast double-membrane vesicles in cytopthic cells of sea cucumber with aped typically were composed of accumulations of multiple single-membrane vesicles enclosed within an outer membrane fig 5
a and virus particles were sometimes located between the two membranes on the other hand vesicles with tight double-membranes were also found in cytopathic cells of sea cucumber with aped and their formation seems probably associated with the varicose rough endoplasmic reticula fig 5b some vesicles with dark blurry margins around clear membrane were also found in the cytopathic cells fig 5c the virions always occurred in the dark blurry margins near membranes if the vesicles were not full of virions virions acquired an envelope by budding into the cisternae and formed mostly spherical sometimes pleomorphic particles fig 5d suggesting that these vesicles may be the site of viral assembly frozen section technology is widely applied in clinical diagnostics of humans and can display the histological changes accurately and rapidly in our study viral inclusion bodies in affected cells and tissues is one of obvious characters compared with the normal ones and they can be found easily in the diseased samples by frozen section and he stain therefore the frozen section technology was used for the fast detection of these viral infections in our epidemiology and diagnostic study as to the apply of tem to discover agents with sars as with previous investigations of outbreaks involving such viruses as ebola hendra nipah and more recently monkey pox tem played an essential role goldsmith et al 2004 the epidemic viral diseases of aquatic organisms especially those whose cells cannot be cultured yet can be studied uniquely with this powerful tool detailed studies described here on the morphogenesis of a sea cucumbers virus by thin-section tem found many characteristics previously described for cornaviruses becker et al 1967 oshiro et al 1971 siddell et al 1983 zhang et al 2003 virions accumulated in dilated cytoplasmic vesicles that appeared to migrate to the cell surface where the virus particles were released virus particles formed upon membranes of an apparent budding compartment a term used to describe the continuous membrane system from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi complex dubois et al 1982 tooze et al 1984 additional cytoplasmic structures associated with coronavirus infections included nucleocapsid inclusions and double-membrane vesicles which have been proposed as the replication complex for coronaviruses and arteriviruses gosert et al 2002 pedersen et al 1999 as has been reported for coronavirus additional cytoplasmic features were associated with virus-infected sea cucumbers cells tubular structures were occasionally seen within virus-containing vesicles some ends of the tubular structures swell and are similar to the spherical virions but the actual relation between the spherical virions and the tubular structures are not certain goldsmith et al 2004 the tubular structures outside vesicles are not the same as the tubulorecticular structures which were reported for coronavirus ferreira and manker 1965 goldsmith et al 2004 their high linearity suggest that they maybe microtubules wu and yuan 2003 and function as a transport or organizer for the migration of all kinds of vesicles for the virus assembly including virus-containing vesicles empty vesicles and nucleocapsid inclusions though all findings proved that the intestine epithelium cells were infected by these virus particles that such viruses had not been detected in normal controls it still cannot be concluded that these viruses are the agent of sea cucumbers aped without infection experiments as has been reported the cells of invertebrates cannot be cultured and the viruses of invertebrates cannot be replicated in vitro deuff and renault 1999 only minimal intestine tissue can be obtained as material when the disease occurs because of the sea cucumbers peculiar evisceration therefore it is difficult to purify viruses from infected tissues we have tried to purify the viral particles by sucrose gradient centrifugation of homogenates from intestine tissues unfortunately to date we have not obtained the viruses pure enough for infection experiments nor for sequencing the viral genome currently primary culture of intestine epithelium are being tried to obtain enough viruses for future research another question is the origin of these viruses in sea cucumbers which have never been reported as hosts for any viral infection or out break of epidemic disease from the severe traumas among virus-infected cells it can be concluded that these sea cucumbers are not the natural hosts but suffer as victims infected from other hosts even worse is that these viruses were also observed in the diseased larvae of sea cucumbers 1 mm which were just 30 days old in june of 2006 epidemic disease broke out during the seed cultivation in north china and caused 80 mortality similar viruses were observed replicated at high numbers in cytopathic cells and causing severe pathological changes that observation suggests that the viruses may now be transmitted vertically from the parents even though the first infection and origin have not been confirmed yet now it seems less important for us to find the origin of these viruses but to select uninfected parent sea cucumbers for brood stock cultivation the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov highlights the importance of virus surveillance in wild animals drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003 susanna et al 2005 now a corona-like virus is reported in diseased sea cucumbers reared in north china during epidemic mortalities would these viruses infect other cultured creatures in same ponds will it be safe for us to eat and touch these aquatics a series of questions emerge but one re-assuring option can be concluded to date all the staff involved with this study remains healthy  health observation app for covid-19 symptom tracking integrated with personal health records proof of concept and

to be a continuous generation of outbreaks which may lead to larger-scale outbreaks 1 in japan between 10 and 20 of all patients who are infected produce secondary infections 2 countermeasures aimed at preventing the spread of infection have centered on accurate detection and appropriate response to these clusters 34 accordingly an effective and straightforward system for observing health status outside traditional health care settings would be useful as a counter-cluster measure for preventing the spread of covid-19 in japan covid-19 is a designated infectious disease as defined by the relevant infectious disease control laws 3 if a patient is suspected to have a covid-19 infection based on clinical characteristics and diagnosis is confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction pcr test the confirmed patient is hospitalized and isolated an active epidemiological investigation is then conducted by public health centers which are public institutions established by local governments based on the japanese community health act 5 at public health centers retrospective contact tracing 6-8 of confirmed patients and prospective symptom tracking 910 of their close contacts people with whom they have been in recent contact are conducted first to identify the source of infection and make lists of close contacts for the 14 days before the onset of symptoms a retrospective behavioral investigation is conducted based on whether the confirmed patient had participated in events characterized by the three cs closed spaces with poor ventilation crowded places with many people nearby or close-contact settings such as close-range conversations 1112 as well as their travel history second to prevent secondary infections close contacts are monitored for fever dyspnea coughing and other symptoms for 14 days from the most recent date of exposure to a confirmed patient to relieve pressure on the medical system further measures have been implemented to care for mild or asymptomatic patients at home or in isolated accommodations 13-15 health observations conducted outside of traditional hospital settings can be difficult in one example patients on a large cruise ship were confirmed to have covid-19 16-19 after quarantine the remainder of the passengers with negative pcr tests disembarked 2021 the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw issued a report on health follow-up and the public health centers in the nearby residential area conducted a health observation 22 such an investigation is time-consuming because it is based on telephone interviews or similar formats 23 in another example a hospital doctor was confirmed to be infected and 13 other individuals were confirmed to have been infected by that doctor within 10 days mainly from close contact 2425 such heavy investigation of close contacts prompted concerns that if the infection spread further the public health center would be overloaded 23 in japan which has become a super-aged society it is critical to fill the gap between average life expectancy and healthy life expectancy 26 personal health records phrs are expected to extend healthy life expectancy 27 based on their personal judgement individuals record their medical nursing caregiving and health-carerelated data ie person-generated data 28 until now this process has been considered suitable for daily management of an individuals physical condition 29-32 the phr allows the user to check their own health status eg to be aware of their physical activity by measuring the daily number of steps or to prevent overeating by monitoring their daily weight measurements importantly for disease control the phr can be used to detect early signs of infection through regular measurements of body temperature management of an individuals physical condition and self-care can theoretically be made easier by recording these data the kyoto university data health study group under the supervision of the kyoto university health service conducts research on shared lifelong phr data based on annual health checkups for students and has created standardized models to promote the use of phrs 33 there are no major differences between the observation items collected by daily health observation for phrs and the disease-specific observation items for covid-19 we hypothesized that by expanding the phr to collect observation items specific to covid-19 it would be possible to efficiently observe the health of individuals outside of hospital settings including the close contacts of confirmed infected people as well as patients who are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic at home or in isolated accommodations k-note kenko-nikki health diary is a phr-related app developed by healthtech laboratory inc a kyoto universityoriginated venture company in the kyoto university incubation program 34 the kyoto university data health study group members and other volunteers including researchers at wakayama medical university gathered data and added health observation functions specific for covid-19 to the phr data the objective of this study is to determine whether phrs could be used for efficient health observation of emerging infectious diseases among individuals outside a traditional hospital setting in addition we sought to demonstrate the practical use of a smartphone and tablet app that supports phr-based health observation by integrating monitoring functions specific to covid-19 we explored the development use and efficiency of this app relative to conventional methods in the setting of an actual active epidemiological investigation of covid-19 the phr smartphone and tablet app k-note was developed to manage various data based on an individuals input as an alternative to conventional paper-based health checkup information it is used to record day-to-day health information such as the number of steps taken body weight and blood pressure as well as medical information such as medications and vaccination history its principal purpose is to improve individual lifestyles and ultimately extend healthy life expectancy since july 2019 k-note has been distributed free of charge to study participants as part of a proof-of-concept study of health promotion using phrs we recently added a covid-19 health observation function to the phr app and made the software available to the public free of charge initially the integration of health observation data specific to covid-19 in the k-note app was intended to streamline health observation within schools and companies of groups suspected of being infected however following an incidence of covid-19 infection at the request of wakayama city public health center the app was applied in the context of an active epidemiological investigation 24 to improve the efficiency of health observation work at the public health center we referred to the survey items of the national institute of infectious diseases 35 and created a microsoft excel microsoft corporation macro for data visualization in general personal information protection and network security in japan is strict and there are often severe restrictions on access to webpages and social networking services as well as personal computer settings because k-note is intended to be used for health observation related to covid-19 it was designed to be usable in various information and communication technology environments including use by local governments the basic concepts underlying development are as follows only the app and the readily available excel software package are required operation can start immediately and due consideration is given to the protection of personal information the benefits of the app include its availability as a free download ie app store google play data specific to covid-19 can be recorded and managed with other health observation data and can be sent by email to the specified destination with one click individuals can easily review their own health observation data and the epidemiological officer can easily visualize the comma-separated values csv data they have received using the excel macro for data visualization data are managed only within the smartphone or tablet and are not made available elsewhere unless the individual who has been in close contact with an infected individual and is to be observed health observer specifically authorizes data sharing k-note uses the health observation form to show the state of the health observer as not infected ordinary health follow-up close contact etc or diagnosed with infection mild or asymptomatic and users can choose from these options here we show an example of not infected ordinary health follow-up a close contact of a known infected individual at the public health center a list of health observers is made a reference number used in management is assigned at this time a special email address is also created that is used when the health observer sends data to the public health center every day by the designated time the health observer uses the integrated email address to send their data related to covid-19 such as body temperature and symptoms which were recorded by the app when the information has been received by the epidemiological officer at the public health center they can visualize the collected csv data using an excel macro and this can be used to monitor the health condition of all health observers if appropriate statistical data can be sent to authorities such as the mhlw and quarantine stations figure 1 health observation at the public health center using k-note is performed in three phases preparation health observation by k-note and data visualization at the public health center as part of an active epidemiological investigation the condition of confirmed patients is investigated at the public health center and a list of health observers who are to be observed for 14 days is made the epidemiological officer at the public health center acquires a reference number for each health observer the roster sheet of the excel macro for data visualization serves as the epidemiological officer managements ledger of health observers because unique email addresses are used to transmit data to the public health center the epidemiological officer can monitor each health observer separately which may facilitate the investigation although this is the system we have used it may be useful to create the email address differently according to the operations of the public health center eg by creating one for each epidemiological officer at the public health center or one for each group of close contacts figure 2 the health observer records their daily health conditions such as body temperature and symptoms for 14 days from the start of the observation figure 3 after data input when the health observer presses the send data page button the send data page appears health observers may input up to three email addresses when the health observer presses the send by email button the observation data is automatically converted into csv format and attached to the email by a designated time every day the app is used to send the health observers recorded observation data to the specified email addresses figures 4 and 5 the epidemiological officer downloads the csv data of all health observers received on that day and stores them in a single folder by launching the excel macro for data aggregation and batch importing the csv data on the execution sheet all health observation data received on that day will be displayed on the data list sheet and the roster sheet is updated in the roster sheet health observers whose health observation data were received that day are displayed in white those whose data was not received on the day are displayed in yellow and those whose data has never been received are automatically displayed in red with this function the epidemiological officer can easily distinguish the reporting status of all health observers it is possible to adapt this system according to the situation eg it may be sufficient to contact only the health observers who are displayed in yellow or red on the data list sheet all the data for all the health observers are displayed excel functions can be used to rearrange the health observers and display only a particular day regarding body temperature yellow is automatically used to distinguish health observers whose reported body temperature was 37c and red is used to distinguish those with temperatures 375c coughs or other symptoms are automatically displayed in red if the epidemiological officer checks the data list sheet and a health observer requires more detailed observation they may click the link in the thermal type table column to display the fever chart sheet here body temperature is displayed graphically over time and 375c is indicated by a red line so that it is possible to see at a glance whether there are days when the temperature exceeded the standard value symptoms are also listed over time and displayed in red figure 6 we started developing the health observation app on february 22 2020 and registered the initial version in the app store on february 27 on march 5 a patient with covid-19 at a workplace in wakayama city was confirmed and the use of the initial version of the app was started at the wakayama city public health center on march 6 we immediately customized the health observation app according to the actual epidemiological investigation and released an updated version on march 15 health observation had been performed for 14 days starting from the day of contact exposure with the confirmed patient in principle the investigation would be tracked daily until all health observers were contacted for those who were exposed before march 5 and were found to be infected by health observation observation will be completed without waiting for the final day during the active epidemiological investigation the wakayama city public health center discovered 72 health observers who had close contact with a confirmed case among them 57 792 adopted the use of the health observation app and 14 used telephone investigations the observation period of the remaining health observers ended on march 5 table 1 during the app-based investigation the 6 health observers who did not send an email on march 19 2020 were contacted by phone by an epidemiological officer to inform them of the end of the observation their health condition was checked at that time in total 57 of 72 health observers 792 chose the app the spontaneous email transmission rate was 867 n632729 before the app was introduced all health observers were interviewed by telephone a process that took four epidemiological officers more than 2 hours this suggested that should the virus spread further it would be difficult to maintain investigations by telephone with limited staff over 14 days additionally the comprehensiveness of the investigation may be compromised because health observers might be absent or epidemiological officers might not be able to make a phone call because of other work furthermore the health observer also had to wait in a place where they could answer the telephone during the survey period placing a heavy burden on both the health observer and the epidemiological officers with the introduction of k-note it became possible to automatically manage information collectively the health observers sent their data at a designated time every day and a single epidemiological officer could carry out health observations alone in addition the arrival status of observation data and the health condition of the health observer were readily visualized which improved the efficiency and comprehensiveness of the investigation to improve efficiency the app was modified 6 times and the excel macro 3 times by mid-may the use of apps started with local governments and gradually spread to schools and companies initially a tool for health observation was required as a covid-19 countermeasure and many facilities decided to introduce our app because of the motivation to respond promptly rather than seeking efficiency and effectiveness many users expressed their gratitude for an excel-based system that could be introduced immediately even if it was a bit inconvenient because they did not know the specific method for health observation and there was no alternative system as social awareness of the need for health observation increased the number of users from large universities and companies increased since mid-may the number of inquiries by health observers has increased due to the state of emergency being lifted in japan and the subsequent movement toward resuming social activities 37 from the viewpoint of effectiveness the ability to record daily health condition was of great significance as a countermeasure against covid-19 because it was possible to look back when some problem occurred the app could be used for health observation not only in active epidemiological investigation at public health centers but also for health observation before and after events such as educational practice face-to-face lectures and physical education classes because of the rapid spread of covid-19 no one was demanding optimal efficiency still we must acknowledge that our method for exchange of csv data by email and manual data visualization by excel macro was not efficient in addition there were many inquiries from local governments and companies indicating that for security reasons it was not possible to use web forms for the online briefing sessions or to download files including the excel macro on the internet in the flood of various information technologies the following two points are presumed to have driven increased demand for our app from the viewpoint of satisfaction the administrator of a facility or organization was able to fulfill their social responsibility by introducing our app as the infection of covid-19 spread health observers also had a sense of security that someone was observing their health condition therefore it could be presumed that satisfaction was high recently health observation became one of the requirements for resuming social activities in japan we extended phrs and developed a phr-based health observation app for counter- cluster measures of covid-19 as a result of applying the new app in an active epidemiological investigation at a public health center we believe that the efficiency and completeness of the investigation have been improved preventing the spread of infection the app is used nationwide in japan mainly by companies schools hospitals and local governments for health observation for the prevention of covid-19 except for active epidemiological investigations at public health centers confirmed patients may not have been identified by self-reporting from schools or companies alone however the app has contributed to the early detection of covid-19 or voluntary self-quarantine at home by individuals with suspected symptoms and the use of the app can facilitate reopening of school and corporate activities our findings suggest that health monitoring of phrs is useful for carrying out efficient health observation of emerging infectious diseases for individuals outside of a traditional hospital setting a factor contributing to the success of our app is that we assumed that it would be used for health observation of small groups accordingly we designed the system configuration so that it could be introduced immediately without a cloud system the user only requires the app itself and excel many local governments in japan have strict control of security and protection of personal information and are often restricted from displaying external webpages and using social networking services from their office local area networks a system for storing health observation data in the cloud and sharing data between the health observer and the public health center would require security-related deliberation and entail large-scale initiatives for entire cities or prefectures on the other hand our method can be implemented immediately and at low cost in a comparatively simple ict environment in which emails can be exchanged between the health observer and the public health center using just the app and excel it is therefore possible for each public health center to make a decision about whether to introduce the system additionally because it was based on the covid-19 health observation items of the national institute of infectious diseases and reflected the opinions of preventive medicine specialists and epidemiological officers at public health centers the app was practical the basis of this study was the idea that phrs which are used to promote health via daily observation can be used as a counter-cluster measure against large-scale infectious diseases in the case of highly infectious diseases infection is often found in people in close contact with a known infected patient but they often do not have symptoms at the start of the observation for this reason it is extremely difficult to undertake comprehensive health observations outside the hospital including of asymptomatic individuals or those with mild symptoms those under isolation those who are suspected to be infected based on airport quarantine and those within active epidemiologic investigations it is obviously too late to start preparations after an infectious disease begins to spread and ideally a system would be established during normal times however it is socially difficult to invest in and maintain costly measures against large-scale infectious diseases that occur once every few years or even several decades although there are observation items specific to infectious disease control they are just an extension of daily health observation we believe that the idea of converting daily health promotion activities by phr into countermeasures against large-scale infectious diseases in emergencies could enable a swift response to these illnesses the popularization of phrs is key to making daily health observations the basis of counter-cluster measures against large-scale infections it is important for promoting the significance of the habit of self-management of health data and as a tool for individuals to maintain their own health throughout society as a countermeasure against covid-19 many people have undertaken health observation using our app in japan we would like to further promote the habit of phr-mediated health observation as a social infrastructure even after the end of covid-19 to do that more people must become aware of the benefits of maintaining phrs taking advantage of the experience of developing a health observation app for covid-19 we would like to develop various additional apps of the same kind not only as a measure against emerging infectious diseases but also for health management for public marathons in club activities in educational institutions and after large-scale disasters for research detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluation items should be determined and data should be collected at the time that the research plan is created however due to the urgency of preventing the spread of covid-19 app development and an introduction to public health centers were given priority in this case we only performed qualitative evaluation of the burden reduction effect by interviewing epidemiological officers and help desk managers another limitation is that some members of society do not have access to smartphones tablets or wi-fi connections although the process is explained well here some people may find the method difficult to use if they are not familiar with information and communications technology we distribute to these health observers an excel survey sheet that can be read into the data visualization excel macro in addition a proxy input function may be necessary the current excel macro for data visualization was developed for the health observation of individuals who have been in close contact with known infected patients at public health centers we believe that this is suitable for surveys of up to 100 close contacts per confirmed patient if the number of people exceeds 100 a more sophisticated data visualization system may be required it would also be possible to develop a retrospective behavioral investigation support app for confirmed patients and close contacts using smartphones and phr behavioral history information but such an app has not been developed due to concerns about protecting personal information 3839 currently contact-tracing apps are being developed all over the world 6-8 in japan as a counter-cluster measure retrospective behavioral investigation of confirmed patients explorations of close contacts and prospective symptom tracking of close contacts are executed as active epidemiological investigations but the amount of work required is enormous if contact-tracing and symptom-tracking apps 91040 can be used in combination in an active epidemiological investigation it may be possible to greatly reduce the workload as a measure against future large-scale infectious diseases after the termination of covid-19 it would be useful to develop an infectious disease control support network based on phrs that could seamlessly respond to signs of infectious disease spread active case findings of behavioral investigation of confirmed patients and close contacts health observation of out-of-hospital close contacts and mild or asymptomatic patients and provide statistics to local governments and national headquarters we developed a health observation app integrated with phrs as a covid-19 counter-cluster measure the app greatly reduced the follow-up burden of individuals who had close contact with known cases of confirmed covid-19 infection the relatively low-tech nature of the app and excel combination meant that it was easily accessible especially in japan the system uses emails rather than the cloud an approach that is arguably more compatible with business and privacy practices specific to japan health observation by phrs for the purpose of improving health management and extending healthy life expectancy by using individuals own health information is also effective as a countermeasure against large-scale infectious diseases we believe that raising the awareness of each person about their own health and the value of using phrs for daily health management is a powerful weapon against the rapidly expanding spread of infectious diseases we hope that our study will help prevent the spread of covid-19 infections and future large-scale infectious diseases around the world  shell disorder analysis predicts greater resilience of the sars-cov-2 covid-19 outside the body and in body fluids the coronavirus cov family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses natural hosts and optimal viral fitness a model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of mers-cov using ai and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins using the percentages of intrinsic disorder pid of the nucleocapsid n and membrane m proteins of cov the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the sars-cov m pid  8 n pid  50 falling into category b in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials later mers-cov m pid  9 n pid  44 was found to be in category c which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution the sars-cov-2 m pid  6 n pid  48 has to be placed in category b our data show however that the sars-cov-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell m pid  6 among coronaviruses this means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body an infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids these particles are also likelier to remain active longer these factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the sars-cov-2 and have implications for

 this video shows the stepbystep procedure for properly dressing and undressing demonstrates how to wear the personal protective equipment ppe and provides some technical notes on the execution of the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab for covid19 all of this serves to avoid the risk of contagion of the health worker the video is based on our experience at the giovanni borea civic hospital in sanremo where in the last month strictly following the cdc and who guidelines4 5 the otolaryngology team has performed about 900 nasopharyngeal 95 and oropharyngeal 5 swabs following these steps none of the operators have been infected as of the present date the dressing phase takes place in a changing room close to the entrance of the covid area but separate from it it requires the execution of the following steps a remove all jewelry and personal items b practice good hand hygiene with soap and water or alcohol solution c put on a first pair of gloves d put on the disposable full body scrubs e put on the cap f wear a filtering facepiece particles mask ffp2 or ffp3 possibly covered with a surgical mask g wear protective goggles andor a protective visor h wear the shoe covers finally i put on the second pair of gloves which must cover the wrist of the full body scrubs figure 1 shows the health care professional at the end of the dressing phase the patient wears a surgical mask she is informed about the procedure that is about to be performed the patient must be seated in a comfortable position with his head resting on the back of the chair the patients head must be placed on a horizontal plane parallel to the floor the patient is asked to lower the mask by uncovering only her nose and keeping the mouth closed after opening the swab in a sterile manner the operator positions the patient laterally in order to avoid direct droplets from sneezing or coughing the swab is inserted gently into the nostril the insertion must be parallel to the floor of the nasal fossa the swab is kept medial and facing the nasal septum do not insert the swab upward as in this case the swab stops at the level of the nasal turbinates and the viral rna sampling may not be significant it is important to use the mark on the swab stick as a depth reference figure 2 however when the operator feels an obstacle to further introduction it means that the swab will have reached the posterior wall of the nasopharynx with clockwise and counterclockwise movement repeatedly rub the swab against the posterior wall of the nasopharynx figure 3 for about 10 to 15 seconds extract the swab from the nostril taking care not to contaminate it upon exit introduce it into the test tube and break it at the mark on the stick in case of difficulty in introducing the swab into a nasal fossa due to deviation of the nasal septum or hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates proceed with the same technique in the contralateral nasal fossa the endoscopic vision shown in the video has a didactic purpose only the nasopharyngeal swab should not be performed with the aid of the endoscope if it is impossible to perform the nasopharyngeal swab for unfavorable anatomical nasal conditions or because it is not tolerated by the patient the oropharyngeal swab can be performed as a second choice the patient is asked to lower the mask by exposing the mouth and to fully open it the swab is inserted into the oral cavity until it reaches the level of the oropharynx the sampling is carried out on the uvula the palatine tonsils andor the posterior wall of the oropharynx the contact with the tongue and other areas of the oral cavity should be carefully avoided we recommend that the undressing phase take place in a dedicated changing room located immediately upon leaving the covid area it involves the following steps a remove the second pair of gloves and replace it with a pair of clean gloves b remove the disposable full body scrubs and dispose it in the appropriate container the front and sleeves of the dress are contaminated so open the zipper or untie the laces move it away from the neck and shoulders touching only inside the garment turn the lab coat upside down fold or roll it up and throw it away c remove the first pair of gloves the outside of the gloves is potentially contaminated therefore first remove one glove by grasping and pulling it from the outside and then remove the other glove by inserting a finger into the cuff of the glove and thus remove it taking care not to touch its external part d remove the glasses andor the protective visor their front is potentially contaminated therefore to remove them grasping the side sections and place them in a bag for disinfection e remove the mask first the surgical mask and then the ffp2 or ffp3 the front of the mask is potentially contaminated therefore after having loosened the rear laces grasp the front of the mask move it away from the face and remove it f remove the cap and shoes covers if not already removed upon removal of the full body scrubs g remove the second pair of gloves finally h practice good hand hygiene with soap and water or alcohol solution for technical reasons the undressing phase in the video takes place in the same area where the dressing took place but we remark the importance of undressing in a separate dedicated area figure 4 shows the path that the operator should follow to avoid contamination of the rooms starting from the dressing phase until returning to the clean common area this report details the indications that should be followed by the health care professional during the execution of the nasopharyngeal andor oropharyngeal swab for covid 19 particular attention must be paid during the undressing phase due to the highrisk of selfcontamination if this phase is not correctly performed we hope that this manuscript and related video can serve as a guide to safely perform high airway sampling for covid 19 the authors declare no potential conflict of interest

 from the current situation of the cases most patients have a good prognosis and a few patients are in a critical condition the prognosis of the elderly and those with chronic basic diseases is poor the symptoms of children are relatively mild mild the clinical symptoms are mild and no pneumonia is found in radiology moderate fever respiratory tract and other symptoms are present and pneumonia is found in radiology severity those complying with any of the following should be considered as having the heavy type 1 when shortness of breath occurs the respiratory rate is 30min 2 under the resting state the oxygen saturation is 93 3 arterial oxygen partial pressure pao2fraction of inspiration o2 fio2 is 300 mm hg 1 mm hg  0133 kpa 4 radiology shows that the lesions progress more than 50 in 2448 hours extreme severity and critical statues those meeting one of the following conditions should be treated as severe 1 respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation 2 shock and 3 other organ failure occurs and requires intervention in intensive care unit who recommended to use u071 code for virus idendtified covid19 and to use u072 code for virus not identified including clinicallyepidemiologically diagnosed covid19 probable covid19 and suspected covid19 cases in icd10 in icd11 the code for the confirmed diagnosis of covid19 is ra010 and the code for the clinical diagnosis suspected or probable of covid19 is ra011 httpswwwwhointclassificationsicdcovid19en the u07100x001 novel coronavirus pneumonia code is only applicable to the confirmed inpatients with new coronavirus pneumonia and must be used as the main diagnostic encode the code is defined as follows 1 it can only be used for confirmed cases of covid19 for suspected cases one of the following examples of etiological evidence is required positive realtime fluorescence rtpcr detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid andor virus gene sequencing highly homologous with the new coronavirus note the novel coronavirus infection diagnosis is not limited to respiratory tract specimens or blood samples urine stool and conjunctiva specimens can be used as diagnostic evidence the specific diagnostic criteria are detailed in the novel coronavirus pneumonia treatment and treatment plan trial version 7 2 it can only be used for a confirmed covid19 case in hospital excluding outpatient observation shelter home quarantine cases etc the u07100x002 novel coronavirus infection code is only applicable to confirmed inpatients excluding new coronavirus pneumonia and is used as the main diagnostic code code definition 1 the novel coronavirus nucleic acid test is positive but did not induce pneumonia in atypical patients for example no novel coronavirus pneumoniarelated clinical manifestations or symptoms of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea nausea vomiting heartrelated symptoms such as palpitations or comprehensive neurological symptoms such as headache are present 2 the case had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus pneumonia and is in hospital excluding outpatient observation shelter and home quarantine cases the u07100x003 suspected case of novel coronavirus pneumonia code is only applicable to suspected cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in hospital code definition 1 the case is a new coronavirus or nucleic acid or gene test negative and conforms to any one of the following epidemiological histories or any two clinical manifestations or no clear epidemiological history accompanied by any of three clinical manifestations 2 the case is a suspect case with novel coronavirus pneumonia for hospitalization excluding outpatient service observation shelter home quarantine cases and so on the z03800x001 observed case of novel coronavirus pneumonia code is only applicable to patients who have been discharged from hospital but had been inpatients because of the new coronavirus pneumonia symptoms or signs before the code should only be used as other diagnostic encode code definition 1 the patient must be considered as having novel coronavirus pneumonia and accompanied by any one of the following epidemiological histories or no significant epidemiological history or any 12 of the clinical manifestations 2 the patient must have been excluded from having novel coronavirus pneumonia during the hospital stay for example two or more nucleic acid tests are negative 3 the patient must be in hospital they do not include outpatient service observation shelter home quarantine cases and so on consensus 5 covid19 cases have secondary functioning and disability using the rapid extended icf core set we can describe evaluate and code the functioning of cases with covid19 this rapid icf core set developed from icf core set for copd see table 2 for description and coding demonstration case we recommend the use of standardized functional assessment tools based on the icf to control quality of rehabilitation medical treatment standardize the reporting of outcome conduct functioningrelated statistical analysis and improve the comparability of evidencebased data there are many functional assessment tools in the

1 vital signs evaluation record the body temperature respiration pulse blood pressure blood oxygen saturation urine volume and other indicators regularly every day and make relevant records before and after the intervention treatment2 imaging evaluation chest xray if necessary ct and color doppler echocardiography may be used to evaluate the morphology of heart and lung and provide an objective basis for making a treatment plan3 assessment of bone joint and muscle bed rest or disease consumption would reduce intake and other reasons may lead to the decreased function of skeletal muscle soft tissue level and joint stiffness it can regularly monitor the limb muscle circumference subcutaneous fat thickness grip strength active or passive range of motion as a simple index grip strength can be closely related to prognosis and can be widely used in patients4 motor function evaluation according to the stability of the patients condition carry out balance function test in the early stage or when necessary such as oneleg closedeyes time 10m walking test 6minute walking test daily walking speed test and other comprehensive evaluation tests of cardiopulmonary function should be implicated when patients are in the recovery period discharged or undergoing followup outside the hospital a 6minute walking test or cardiopulmonary exercise test can also be implicated if necessary strength assistance with walking rise from a chair climb stairs and falls can provide more information such as balance coordination ability and so on but requires a higher functional level of patients5 pulmonary function evaluation patients followed up outside the hospital especially those who experienced pulmonary exudation during the disease should be assessed for their lungfunction test which is helpful to understand the recovery of ventilation function in cases where patients may still have the ability to transmit the virus the examination should be avoided if necessary an individual handheld pulmonary function instrument may be used in addition dynamic lung capacity can also be used for evaluation of the expiratory flow rate per unit time which can better reflect airway resistance
 diaphragm function assessment covid19 may not directly invade the diaphragm however some patients may have insufficient diaphragm function and diaphragm fatigue due to factors such as increased ventilation demand decreased efficiency bed rest consumption of disease and intake reduction therefore inspiratory peak flow rate and ultrasound diaphragm activity and thickness can be used for diagnosis according to patients stability and treatment needs direct or indirect evaluation can provide more reference information for patients with decreased activity tolerance and difficulty in offline the whodas 20 is a standardized activity and participation assessment tool recommended by the who according to the severity of the patients condition adls should be evaluated regularly for mild medium severe and discharged patients including basic adl evaluation and instrumental adl evaluation for cases who return to the community after discharge the improved barthel index or other instrumental adl scales are recommended for severe cases we recommend observational evaluation as there are no assessment scales specific to covid19 we recommend using the medical outcomes study sf36 or the copd assessment test in order to shorten the time of evaluation considering that covid19 cases may have different health conditions and will be at different rehabilitation stages we recommend not only collecting data of vital signs laboratory tests and other information on disease but also evaluating pulmonary function subjective fatigue dyspnea pain joint and muscle function activity level and quality of life tailored to patients health conditions those assessments should be carried out pre and postrehabilitation only comprehensive and systematic rehabilitation data will provide evidence for the effect of rehabilitation in the intervention of infectious diseases such as covid19 within the framework of the whofics rehabilitation service delivery for covid19 cases can be implemented in hospitals rehabilitation institutions and communities such as primarycare and community healthservice institutions rehabilitation measures may include preventive therapeutic healthpromoting and palliative care according to their intervention purposes

 as part of nondrug therapy lung rehabilitation can play an important role in the acute stage novel coronavirus pneumonia is a new disease in the absence of evidence for clinical treatment and rehabilitation of the disease when making treatment targets and measures we should consider the pathological changes of pleural effusion pleural adhesion increased airway secretion and obstructive atelectasis in covid19 we suggest that thorax mobilizing therapy expectoration therapy respiratory training and so forth should be applied rehabilitation interventions should improve patients symptoms and clinical outcomes at present there is no clinical evidence for the optimal time of rehabilitation intervention for the disease the benefits and risks of patients should be balanced and crossinfection should be avoided for patients with severe or critical illness rehabilitation treatment should be carried out when vital signs are stable and the changes of vital signs should be monitored throughout the process rehabilitation doctors and therapists should strengthen interdisciplinary communication and devise and implement intervention treatment together with clinicians during the operation therapists can use the early warning scores or the awakening and breathing coordination delirium monitoringmanagement and early exercisemobility bundle abcde

 scale to evaluate the safety of rehabilitation treatment in real time and avoid increasing iatrogenic damage according to the patients condition the therapist can use bodyposition drainage vibration and clapping active cycle of breathing techniques and other techniques or equipment to clear the airway and should pay attention to the local humidification of the whole body and airway to reduce the viscosity of the sputum for patients with dyspnea cough and other symptoms an upright sitting or standing position can increase diaphragm activity improve the ventilationperfusion in the lung increase tidal volume improve peak flow rate of cough and reduce the sense of breathing difficulty when the secretion of the respiratory tract increases the therapist can adjust the posture according to the change of vital signs and assist in expectoration in the intensive care unit an electric vertical roll bed is recommended to help patients adjust their position for mild medium and heavy patients and patients after discharge reducing the time spent in bed is helpful to reduce the risk of various bed complications promote the improvement of cardiopulmonary function and shorten recovery time the threshold loading inspiratory muscle training device is the most commonly used method of respiratory resistance training at present generally the initial load is 30 of the personal maximum inspiratory pressure according to the training purpose endurance training or strength training a gradual increase in the training load or training times is recommended along with training 12 times a day 1530 rounds each time for endurance training or 812 rounds each time for strength training

 respiratory control can significantly improve the experience of breathing reduce respiratoryrelated oxygen consumption and relieve the tension of patients generally deep and slow breathing is used to increase the compliance of the respiratory system reduce the work of breathing and relieve the dyspnea of patients diaphragmatic breathing or abdominal breathing also have similar effects if possible physical therapy can be used for training such as an electrical stimulation diaphragmatic trainer electronic biofeedback and so forth in aerobic training it is best to monitor blood pressure heart rate and blood oxygen saturation
1 intensity patients in the acute stage mainly take lowintensity exercise without fatigue on the second day in general patients in better condition can try mediumintensity exercise after discharge patients can carry out medium and highintensity exercise training according to further evaluation results to obtain more benefits2 frequency according to the patients tolerance they should carry out active and passive training once or twice a day if the patients condition is serious and the tolerance is poor they should shorten the training duration and increase the frequency accordingly to ensure the training quantity3 time patients with good state and those discharged from hospital can accumulate aerobic exercise time to 60 minutes every day and those in good condition can increase the time moderately for patients with heavy or critical disease exercise should be accumulated to about 30 minutes every day if possible4 activity mode a patient should carry out fast walking slow walking standing sitting upright and other sports modes according to the environmental conditions and their own condition
 
1 intensity patients in the acute stage should take low and medium intensity load training with the goal of maintaining muscle mass or delaying muscle atrophy if possible they can start from 30 to 40 of 1 rm and if not they can use 15 kg according to the patients tolerance degree and the change of the condition the load or bodyweight training should be gradually increased after discharge the patients may use medium and highintensity load training with the goal of recovering or increasing muscle mass the effective prescription for improving muscle strength was 65 1 rm for three groups three times a week load training for patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia should be reduced as appropriate2 frequency low and mediumintensity load trainers can try 12 times a day and medium and highintensity load trainers can try one time every other day3 methods progressive resistance training is a commonly used program resistance load can come from selfweight external resistance such as elastic band sandbag dumbbell etc there are many application videos of elastic band resistance training on the internet which can be used to carry out alternating and repeated training of large muscle groups of limbs
 longterm bed rest can lead to joint stiffness contracture and other changes patients should be guided to actively carry out active and passive motions of the spine and limb joints to maintain their normal range of motion which can be arranged 12 times per day and can be completed by joint and position severe patients may not be able to complete the active whole joint motion effectively at this time they may need other people or special equipment to carry out the passive motion of joints including the limbs head neck and waist to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis 
1 ultrashort wave therapy ultrashort wave therapy can promote the exudation and absorption of the lung and improve ventilation function it can be used for patients with lung exudation and the specific prescription is mainly shortterm with micro or without heat however fever is a contraindication small ultrashort waves can be used for bedside treatment to reduce the impact of highfrequency electromagnetic fields on monitoring equipment but the ultrashort wave machine its electrodes and wires should be disinfected and protected according to the protection level2 ultraviolet therapy wholebody ultraviolet irradiation can increase immunity function which may be applicable to mild and medium patients but severe and critical patients may have immune disorders so it is not recommended3 lowfrequency neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy neuromuscular electrical stimulation can improve the respiratory muscle and peripheral muscle function so it can be used in bed patients for respiratory muscles or limb muscles to delay muscle disuse atrophy and to increase neuromuscular function
 deepbreathing control is a special form of training it can be skillfully mastered by patients in a short period of time through a series of carefully choreographed action routines taking into account a variety of treatment purposes such as emotional regulation lowintensity aerobic training and respiratory muscle group resistance training and with the help of words pictures videos and other communication methods which is very suitable for patients during breathing training it is necessary to pay attention to the coordination of diaphragm movement with trunk and limb movement so that diaphragmfunction training breathingmode training and body and joint training can be carried out at the same time for some covid19 cases there may be some negative stress responses mainly emotional disorders such as panic anxiety and somatization symptoms which affect the mood state sleep and overall mental health level

 nothing to disclose  covid-19 legal implications for critical care n coghlan d archard p sipanoun t hayes b baharlo  the covid-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented challenge for the provision of critical care anticipating an unsustainable burden on the health service the uk government introduced numerous legislative measures culminating in the coronavirus act which interfere with existing legislation and rights however the existing standards and legal frameworks relevant to critical care clinicians are not extinguished but anticipated to adapt to a new context this new context influences the standard of care that can be reasonably provided and yields numerous human rights considerations for example in the use of restraints or the restrictions placed upon patients and visitors under the infection prevention and control guidance the changing landscape has also highlighted previously unrecognised legal dilemmas the perceived difficulties in the provision of ppe for employees pose a legal risk for trusts and a regulatory risk for clinicians the spectre of rationing critical care poses a number of legal issues notably the flux between clinical decisions based on best interests towards decisions explicitly based on resource considerations should be underpinned by an authoritative public policy decision to preserve legitimacy and lawfulness such a policy should be medically coherent legally robust and ethically justified the current crisis yields numerous challenges for clinicians aspiring to remain faithful to medico-legal and human rights principles developed over many decades especially when such considerations could easily be dismissed however it is exactly at such times that these principles are needed the most and clinicians play a disproportionate role in safeguarding such principles for the most vulnerable  on the 31 december 2019 china reported the first cases of a pneumonia of unknown aetiology in wuhan hubei province 1  subsequently identified to be due to a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov 2  renamed as sars-cov-2 due to its potential to cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome 3  the world health organization who declared this virus and the disease covid- this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved 19  a public health emergency of international concern pheic 4  the virus spread globally manifesting a pandemic 5  and outside china outbreaks in iran and italy further illustrated the potential for disease and associated mortality 6 7  though the uk diagnosed its index case at the end of january the events that unfolded in lombardy three weeks later vividly demonstrated the susceptibility of a fully functioning modern health service to this unprecedented challenge 9 10  against this backdrop in anticipation of an impending sudden and unsustainable burden on the health service and wider civic society the uk government stepped up its response 11  culminating in the coronavirus act 2020 12  and other legislative measures including those mandating social distancing commonly referred to as the lockdown these various legislative measures grant wide powers to the executive and enact deep changes in the ordinary functioning of systems across society from health and social care to law and order and the food supply chain in doing this they introduce interferences with a wide range of human rights the act alone comes to 359 pages however two critical points must be made first these measures do not purport to regulate every aspect of the crisis rather they make targeted amendments to and supplement existing law second they do not replace or remove certain fundamental standards relevant to intensive care such as the human rights act hra 1998 or the mental capacity act mca 2005 frontline clinicians should thus not assume that they are acting in a legal vacuum where the new measures do not include specific provision for particular situations rather the pre-existing law rights standards and guidance continue to apply this existing framework will frequently adjust to take account of the present exceptional circumstances but it is not simply extinguished -a point that was reiterated during the parliamentary debates during the expedited passage of the coronavirus act 13 14  this article aims to outline the broad framework within which we can consider the medico-legal and ethical aspects of some of the more readily identified issues experienced during the surge in demand for critical care in particular it analyses legal aspects of patient care standard of care informed consent restraint and isolation family rights personal protective equipment and the legal and ethical aspects of rationing critical care abstract legal analysis is an imprecise art given how much turns on the specific circumstances and so specific or final answers cannot be given this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved negligence and the standard of care covid-19 has imposed on clinicians a need to move in certain cases from delivering the best care they can to a lower standard of acceptable safe care the question thus arises as to the legal position encountered by medical professionals who knowingly though reluctantly find themselves providing a lower standard of care than that which they would have only recently delivered the english law of negligence typically defines the standard of care by reference to a reasonable person where a special skill is involved the standard is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill 15  this is assessed by reference to all of the circumstances in light of the facts known at the time it follows that there is no absolute requirement to deliver the best possible care the bolam test holds that a doctor will not have been negligent where they have acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion even where another body of opinion takes a contrary view the test accepts and accounts for disagreements as well as variations in the exercise of clinical judgement subsequent case-law has nuanced this noting that any responsible body of opinion must be capable of withstanding logical analysis by the judge 16  that professional guidance is important evidence in considering the standard 17 18 and that the standard is set by reference to the doctors post not the particular experience or rank of the individual doctor 19 20  the law thus allows doctors discretion in the manner in which they provide care to patients as well as allowing consideration of the breadth of factors which may influence their decision making over the decades there has arguably been a ratcheting up of the standard required as medical advances and dissemination of knowledge have occurred in the pandemic situation by contrast it would allow for the i degree of uncertainty and ii the particularly pressured circumstances under which doctors are operating to be taken into account as one leading textbook suggests one can hardly expect the same meticulous attention in a hospital that is coping with a rail disaster or an epidemic as at normal times 19 21  in short the test would seem to protect doctors who provide a reasonable standard of care consistent with a logical body of medical opinion and taking into account the new circumstances specific to covid-19 notwithstanding the fact that this may be of a lower standard than that previously provided this is consistent with the approach that the general medical council gmc have outlined in respect of regulatory law 22  however clinicians should keep three points in mind first this leeway is not unlimited in particular clinicians who have been re-deployed to areas outside of their area of expertise will not this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved be granted more leeway they will be held to the same standard of care as others in the same post second clinicians operating under such constraints need to evidence not only the treatment undertaken but also the rationale underpinning their decision making a doctor asserting that they satisfied the requirements of the bolam test may need to evidence the constraints placed upon their ability to deliver care by the circumstances at the time this may require a more extensive explanation of how decisions have been arrived at and a more thorough recording of the circumstances in which such decisions are made than was required before covid-19 third clinicians will need to ensure that their practice is acceptable to a reasonable body of medical opinion ensuring awareness of clinical guidance is likely to be important and doctors retain their general duty to keep up-to-date with developments in medical knowledge 23  nevertheless doctors are not required to read each and every publication and practitioners may be excused ignorance of newly reported advances in practice 24  similarly a clinician will not be negligent solely through a failure to practise in accordance with what is now accepted wisdom abroad 25  these points may be of some reassurance to doctors who find themselves dealing with a rapidly-evolving pandemic with great volumes of new research being published much of it contradictory and of questionable quality less flexibility can be expected of the law around informed consent in the critical care setting this is likely to be particularly important because a feature of covid-19 is that most patients arguably retain capacity until the point where they need sedation contrast in ordinary times the evidence given in ferreira 26  such patients must give informed consent to their treatment clinicians must inform them of the treatments material risks those that a reasonable patient would regard as significant or that the doctor should be reasonably aware that the particular patient would regard as significant and of reasonable alternative treatments 27 28  this standard is stricter than the ordinary bolambolitho one exceptions to this duty apply only where the doctor reasonably considers that disclosing a particular risk would be seriously detrimental to the patients health or in situations of necessity such as urgent treatment where the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to make a decision 29 30  moreover advance care planning should be discussed where feasible 27 31 32  finally though unlikely in the context of critical care before carrying out further interventions it will be necessary to consider whether the patient can reasonably be awoken to consent 33  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved a significant challenge for clinicians is the uncertainty around this new pathogen with limited evidence on which to base decisions that makes it difficult to judge which risks are material and how treatment might evolve doctors are likely to best discharge their duty to patients by being honest about what is and is not known within the limits of the available evidence it will be for the patient and doctor to then decide upon whether to pursue particular treatment or opt for a different approach accepting the limitations of the evidence one particular point that arises is the likely need to inform sars-cov-2 negative patients of the risk of acquiring it through pursuing treatment for example surgery 34  doctors should ensure there is adequate written evidence as to the consent process patients receiving critical care are typically unable to leave they also frequently lack capacity that inability can arise directly from their life-threatening condition but it can also arise from treatment sedation andor restraints applied to them managing these issues and ensuring protection of the patients health life liberty and autonomy give rise to a host of complex legal issues at the intersection of criminal civil regulatory and human rights law a large body of guidance addresses these issues 35 36  we will focus on three important aspects of human rights law first the sedation and restraint of a patient must remain tightly linked to the life-saving treatment be kept to the minimum necessary and not materially differ between those with and without an underlying mental disorder in order not to amount to a deprivation of liberty article 5 european convention on human rights echr 37 38  this is the principle established in ferreira 39  restraints that are stricter than necessary or that continue beyond the life-threatening condition are likely to amount to a deprivation of liberty requiring authorisation by law through the deprivation of liberty safeguards dols process or court order prior consent to the restraints is highly unlikely to provide a sufficient legal basis 40  conversely insufficient or inappropriate restraint may lead to harm to or even death of the patient or others potentially breaching articles 2 right to life or 3 freedom from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment second difficult issues as to the patients autonomy and consent arise under article 8 right to private and family life as addressed in the previous section third particular risks of discrimination notably on grounds of race and disability arise in the application of restraint article 14 echr against that background two particular risks ensue in the covid-19 context  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved extreme possible quadruple capacity situation 41  that contrasts with ordinary guidance requiring one critical care nurse per bed 42  in that context the ordinary practice of monitoring sedation levels to ensure the patient does not awake may not suffice in order to avoid this happening and so protect the patient from foreseeable harm articles 2 and 3 echr care teams may increase sedation levels for all patients use physical restraint with bed buddies restraining any patient who wakes whilst the lead nurse attends or use mechanical restraint mittens moreover the lower nurse-and doctor-to-patient ratios risk patients remaining sedated and restrained longer than strictly medically necessary in the first instance the relevant law is sensitive to context it is likely to tolerate stricter or longer restraint than that which would be applied when resources were optimal so long as such restraints remain the minimum required in that context they are unlikely to cross the line into a deprivation of liberty this leeway will not however be unlimited and inadequate inappropriate or clearly excessive restraint will raise article 2 3 or 5 issues as appropriate careful thought must be given to modifying restraints policies to ensure a fair balance based on evidence meeting the above standards and including regular review notably evidence from the us and continental europe suggest that physical and mechanical restraint are ineffective at preventing forcible extubation and increase the risk of inadequate supervision 43  prior to deploying such restraints clinicians should carefully consider a number of issues fig 1  second critical care patients are subject to the same isolation and quarantine rules as others in hospital under the infection prevention and control guidance 44 45  this guidance which envisages possible and confirmed cases of covid-19 being grouped together where singleisolation rooms are unavailable raises a number of human rights issues notably the risk that someone is infected as the result of this grouping and the lawfulness of any deprivation of liberty to enforce the quarantineisolation 46  both of which are beyond the scope of this article one critical point is however relevant clinicians must be crystal clear as to what restrictions apply to a patients movement and what their legal basis is as outlined above the sedation and restraints that are incidental to life-saving treatment fall outside article 5 once that treatment ends any restrictions on a patients movement must be justified on other grounds that would apply for instance to continuing to isolate a patient post-ventilation under the infection prevention and control guidance 47  any control or restraint of the patient may amount to a deprivation of liberty and thus require a legal basis notably schedule 21 to the coronavirus act 2020 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved most hospitals have severely restricted family visiting rights to inpatients including those in icu 48  public health englands infection control guidance recommends permitting access to essential visitors only such as parents of paediatric patients but goes on to recommend local risk management with the need for proportionality 44 49  the way hospitals implement this raises a number of issues these hospitals restrictions interfere with the family rights of both the patient and the relatives article 81 echr 30 50  moreover visitors play a role in ensuring public scrutiny of standards of care may act as an advocate and defender of an incapacitated patient and their face-to-face presence is likely to facilitate more rigorous consultation where best interest decisions fall to be made than consultation by telephone or electronic mail their presence is likely to be particularly crucial in the case of children and vulnerable adults above all when the visitor has the power to make decisions on their behalf for example someone with parental responsibility or a lasting power of attorney to be justified this interference must pursue a legitimate aim be prescribed by law and be finally still in respect of proportionality blanket bans are typically difficult to defend that is particularly so here where as outlined above the degree of interference is much higher in some cases and the interests of vulnerable groups are in play which in turn raises possible discrimination issues 52  policies granting exceptions for children persons with a learning disability birth partners and persons receiving end-of-life care are significantly more likely to be justified than ones containing no such exceptions 53  hospitals should consider alternative measures to mitigate the restrictions regular contact to update family members on the patients situation unless inconsistent with patient confidentiality is required where reasonably this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved practicable and is in any event important to facilitating any best interest decisions and some version of an advocate and defender role video-calls with the patient raise interesting issues this is best analysed through a general data protection regulation lens 54  it would constitute processing of sensitive personal data relating to health and so require legal bases under both articles 6 and 9 of the regulation regulatory guidance should also be complied with 55 fig 2  hospital trusts as employers are under a range of duties to ensure the health and safety of staff this includes providing safe places and systems of work here we focus on the duty to provide adequate personal protective equipment under regulation 41 of the personal protective equipment at work regulations 1992 58  employers must ensure that suitable ppe is provided to employees who may be exposed to a risk to health or safety at work except where and to the extent that such risk has been adequately controlled by other means which are equally or more second what this guidance does not provide is reassurance that if a bone fide decision was made not to carry out duties due to the inadequate provision of protective equipment the clinician would be protected from regulatory and legal repercussions the employment rights act 1996 62 offers some protection against dismissal on the sole or principal grounds of refusal to work in an area of work reasonably believed to be a serious and imminent risk to health how this would this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved be viewed by professional regulators however is unclear this difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that should clinicians continue working with inadequate protective equipment this could consequently present a risk to patients 63  ultimately such a situation manifests a legal risk for trusts both for breach of the 1992 and other health and safety regulations and potentially in negligence or article 2 echr claims by staff or patients however certain negligence claims may be indemnified by the government under section 11 of the coronavirus act the possibility of having to ration acute life-saving care has perhaps been clinicians greatest concern the legal principles of rationing particularly acute life-saving care are not straightforward drawing upon a complex interaction of several legal regimens this section will highlight four important areas whilst there is no universally accepted definition to rationing scheunemann and white state that a unifying feature of most definitions is that of denying a potentially beneficial treatment to a patient on the grounds of scarcity 64 65  using this definition triaging or prioritising access to potentially life-saving treatment in the face of finite resources is rationing first rationing is an everyday part of healthcare provision including in critical care 66  the nationally agreed transplant benefit score 67 is one example of a rationing tool it aims to be transparent and use patient and clinical indices to maximise benefit an urgent request for a lifesaving donor liver may not fit the system exactly but still has its basis in clinical justification which acts symbiotically with resource considerations 68 69  in critical care judgements as to whether a treatment is either clinically indicated in the best interests of the patient or futile take into account the quality of care that can reasonably be provided given the available resources the courts have repeatedly upheld the lawfulness of resource considerations 70 71  in this sense a degree of rationing has already occurred in this pandemic reduced staff-to-patient ratios use of sub-optimal equipment postponement of nonurgent care re-deployment of non-critical care staff 41 and apportionment of organ support all ration care in the context of bestowing critical care during the covid-19 crisis however these measures remain within a margin of acceptability the focus remaining on the clinical benefit or best interests of the individual patient within the new context 70 71 72  the more difficult issue will come if and when resources are so scarce that critical care has to be refused to some patients this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved against their best interests when the line is crossed from triage by outcome to triage by resource paragraph 21 73  this is a difficult and at times fuzzy line but it should be drawn clearly dressing up a decision that is primarily based on resource limitations as a clinical or best interests decision risks illegitimacy in medicine and vulnerability to legal challenge 74  judicial reviews of clinical commissioning groups rationing decisions on public law grounds have rarely succeeded see fig 3  policy decisions sympathetic to the resources made available under current government policy are a legitimate consideration 79  though the courts deference is not unlimited policies must not be overly rigid in order to permit consideration of individual circumstances 80  the need for robust evidence to support any criteria is heightened beyond the ordinary public law standards in certain cases by the human rights and equality implications of denial basing decisions solely on age or disability including many underlying conditions would amount to unlawful direct discrimination 81  including criteria that have a disproportionate impact on older persons or persons with a disability for instance using age comorbidities or quality adjusted life years as indicators amounts to prima facie indirect discrimination this may be justified if the use is shown to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim in this case appropriately allocating scarce nhs resources but adequate evidence of the appropriateness of these indicators will be necessary as argued by liddell et al this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved unpublished observation small differences between patients may not be meaningful and allocation decisions based on very limited evidence and poor science could be challenged finally in very exceptional circumstances a denial of critical care to particular individuals leading to death may violate the states article 2 echr positive duties 82  fourth perhaps the greatest difficulties arise from the prospect of withdrawing ventilatory support from a patient who is still deriving benefit from that treatment in favour of another who may have greater survival prospects this situation raises extremely difficult issues with three specialist lawyers recently arguing that removal of ventilation from a capacitous patient who does not consent and withdrawal of ventilation from such a patient after he has lost capacity to communicate his decision may be murder or manslaughter 76  we make two observations first in certain cases withdrawal will fit within the existing law where a patient with capacity consents to withdrawal where treatment is futile as in the case of a patient in permanent vegetative state 83  or where the treatment is no longer clinically indicated or in the best interests of the patient 83  withdrawal will be lawful under ordinary principles by contrast withdrawing ventilation from a patient whose best interests require continued treatment in order to allow a different patient with better prognosis to use the ventilator does not fall within that ordinary framework second there is no clear authority on the position outside that framework there is some limited support for the courts being flexible in an exceptional circumstance like this as the specialist lawyers note in re a conjoined twins the court approved the separation of conjoined twins in circumstances which would lead to the death of the weaker twin 84  failure to pursue an elective separation was deemed likely to result in the death of both as they continued to grow the court acknowledged that where the need to act in the best interests of each child produced a conflict it was appropriate to undertake a balancing exercise given the absolute non-viability of the weaker twin the exercise was in many ways simpler in respect of the conjoined twins than it would be for patients competing for ventilators the principles of the case however may still be applicable where one individual has much more to gain from a course of treatment than another where performance or non-performance has consequences for both patients and where the duty towards one patient is irreconcilable with the duty to another this interpretation would almost certainly require prior sanction by the courts second the ordinary case-law requiring that life-prolonging treatment be given is underpinned by the duty to take reasonable steps to protect life rather than an absolute duty and contains some suggestion that a different approach may apply where resources are inadequate 85 -although other case-law appears to contradicts this 86  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved our analysis illustrates the careful diligence clinicians must employ when making decisions relating to resource allocation vis--vis clinical judgement a national emergency may recalibrate what is reasonable or even possible clinicians must consider resources optimally and efficiently and avoid recognising resource considerations inappropriately in delivering life-saving treatment how thinly these resources are spread is a matter for policy makers hospital trusts and the wider nhs ethics and law do not neatly coincide yet as the preceding section on legal aspects of rationing affirms the difficult issue concerns a context in which scarce resources mean that critical care could be refused to some patients against their best interests as previously narrated what is needed is clear guidance from an authoritative public policy and robust evidence supporting its criteria it also needs ethical justification unfortunately rather than a single authoritative policy originating from an appropriate body a  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved circumstance to be equitable or how exactly should one seek to do the least harm and most good this problem is compounded by the pressure of exigency third since guidelines disagree as to which criteria should be adopted or in what order of importance the requirement of authoritative ethical justification may not be met the problem is that there can be reasonable disagreement as to which criterion should be decisive it may be easy to set some aside first come first served and the tossing of a coin or use of a lottery first come first served whilst practical is not a defensible moral principle in as much as the hour of first presentation should not trump considerations such as clinical need however disagreement extends even to principles of prima face plausibility the use of age as a criterion for prioritisation does as previously suggested invite the charge of direct discrimination even the use of age as a marker of what are seen as relevant differences such as clinical frailty and the likelihood of survival or of the prospect of fewer years of life after treatment would be prima facie indirect discrimination yet it is also hard to justify morally age as such is a morally irrelevant difference as a signifier or something that is relevant it is crude unreliable and always defeasible yet the use of age as such has intuitive attractiveness to many one important reason is the fair innings argument 89  this holds that everyone should have an opportunity to lead a life of a certain duration resources should then be distributed and care given selectively to ensure that those who have yet to live that length of life are prioritised over those who have already managed to do so it has an intuitive appeal why shouldnt those who have not had an opportunity to lead a life of decent duration be preferred to those who have already done so nevertheless what exactly counts as a fair innings and even if we can agree it is not clear why we should speak of fairness in this context 90  luck and circumstances play a major role in this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved how long we live and it is not clear that we can speak of the length of a life as a good that can and should be distributed the need for care irrespective of age might arise from bad luck but it might also arise from choices for whose consequences an individual should rightly be held responsible a last moral consideration is this the application of any rationing guidance will cause moral injury in those compelled by circumstances to utilise what they believe bears serious moral costs furthermore rationing human resource clinical expertise and the efforts of the multi-disciplinary team adds to this burden recognition of these harms and support for those who suffer them is paramount support for clinicians in their decision-making by ethics committees is desirable though it should be recognised that the provision of such services is variable it is perhaps with a twisted sense of irony that the echr this year celebrates 70 years since its inception the covid-19 global pandemic will challenge rights and legal considerations in numerous and as yet unrecognised ways these implications will not be unique to healthcare but will be felt throughout society despite these challenges such considerations are inherently malleable to context clinicians employing a commitment to the usual medico-legal and ethical principles even whilst the ability to meet these commitments is being tested more so than ever will make a disproportionately positive contribution in safeguarding such principles in this sense it is not a twisted irony at all now more than ever we must look to the core values encoded in our rights and legal regimes in facing the new challenges raised by the pandemic it remains to be seen exactly what final cost not merely fiscal but also human will be levied by this pandemic especially upon those most vulnerable in society undoubtedly medical professionals especially in critical care will play a disproportionate role in setting this potentially intangible price this

million cases across over 200 countries worldwide pettersson manley  hern 2020 moreover pervasive stay-at-home orders and calls for social distancing as well as the disruptions to every facet of our lives make it difficult to overstate the importance of covid-19 as the beginning of the outbreak has been traced to china and wuhan in particular both in the united states and elsewhere people who are chinese or seen as east asian have become associated with this contagious disease early reports in the united states were often accompanied by stock photos of asians in masks burton 2020 walker 2020

united states fauver et al 2020 some members of the general public regard asian americans with suspicion and as carriers of the disease on april 28th 2020 nbc news reported that 30 of americans have personally witnessed someone blaming asians for the coronavirus ellerbeck 2020 the covid-19 pandemic has revealed the negative perceptions of asian americans that have long been prevalent in american society many individuals in the united states see the virus as foreign and condemn phenotypically asian bodies as the spreaders of the virus ellerbeck 2020 consistent with claire jean kims theory on racial triangulation kim 1999 and the concept of asians as perpetual foreigners ancheta 2006 saito 1997 tuan 1998 e d wu 2015 we posit that during covid-19 the racial positionality of asian americans as foreign and other persists and that this pernicious designation may be a threat to the safety and mental health of asian americans they are not only at risk of exposure to covid-19 but they must contend with the additional risk of victimization which may increase their anxiety historically from the late 19th through the mid twentieth century popular culture and news media portrayed asians in america as the yellow peril which symbolized the western fear of uncivilized nonwhite asian invasion and domination okihiro 2014 saito 1997 it is possible that the perceived threat of the yellow peril has reemerged in the time of covid-19 the spread of the coronavirus and the increased severity of the pandemic has caused fear and panic for most americans as covid-19 has brought about physical restrictions and financial hardships so far forty-two states have issued stay-at-home orders which has resulted in 95 of the american population facing restrictions that impact their daily lives woodward 2020 novel efforts to end the pandemic across the states have led businesses to shut down as a result more than 30 million people in the united states have filed for unemployment since the onset of the coronavirus crisis gura 2020 because this virus has been identified as foreign for some individuals their feelings have been expressed as xenophobia prejudice and violence against asian americans these negative perceptions and actions have gained traction due to the unprecedented impact covid-19 has on peoples lives and institutions such as uc berkeley have even normalized these reactions chiu 2020 however racism and xenophobia are not a natural reaction to the threat of the virus rather we speculate that the historical legacies of whiteness and citizenship have produced these reactions where many individuals may interpret asian americans as foreign and presenting a higher risk of transmission of the disease already the fbi has issued a warning that due to covid-19 there may be increased hate crimes against asian americans because a portion of the us public will associate covid-19 with china and asian american populations margolin 2020 news reports police departments and community organizations have been documenting these incidents evidence suggests that the fbis warning was warranted based on reporting from stop aapi hate in the one-month period from march 19th to april 23rd there were nearly 1500 alleged instances of anti-asian bias jeung  nham 2020 the reported incidents have been concentrated in new york and california with 42 of the reports hailing from california and 17 of reports from new york but asian americans in 45 states across the nation have reported incidents jeung  nham 2020 there have been a large number of physical assaults against asian americans and ethnically asian individuals in the united states directly related to covid-19 while the majority of americans are sheltering-in-place and staying at home 80 of the self-reported anti-asian incidents have taken place outside peoples private residences in grocery stores local businesses and public places jeung  nham 2020 we suggest that these hate crimes and other incidents of bias have historical roots that have placed asians outside the boundaries of whiteness and american citizenship in addition we believe that the current covid-19 crisis draws attention to ongoing racial issues and provides a lens through which to challenge the notion of america as a post-racial society bonilla-silva 2006 one of the incidents under investigation as a hate crime includes the attempted murder of a burmese-american family at a sams club in midland texas yam 2020a the suspect said that he stabbed the father a four-year-old child and a two-year-old child because he thought the family was chinese and infecting people with coronavirus yam 2020a police are investigating numerous other physical incidents including attacks with acid moore  cassady 2020 an umbrella madani 2020 and a log kang 2020 there have been a number of physical altercations at bus stops bensimon 2020 madani 2020 subway stations parnell 2020 convenience stores oliveira 2020 and on the street jeung  nham 2020 sheldon 2020 asian americans are also reporting physical threats being made against them driscoll 2020 parascandola 2020 based on stop aapi hate statistics 127 asian americans filed reports of physical assaults in four weeks jeung  nham 2020 and it is likely that other asians have not reported their experiences out of fear or concern about the legal process in addition to the physical attacks and threats against asian americans individuals have also filed reports of vandalism and property damage targeted at asian businesses one korean restaurant in new york city had the graffiti stop eating dogs written on its window adams 2020 perpetrators have also made explicit references to covid-19 in their vandalism where phrases such as take the corona back you chnk goodell  mann 2020 and watch out for corona wang 2020 have been documented on asian-owned restaurants some of these incidents were not reported to the police and therefore will not be investigated as hate crimes as business owners reasoned that it would be difficult to track the vandals adams 2020 buscher 2020 these incidents of vandalism demonstrate the association some people make between asian american businesses and covid-19 beyond the narrow definition of the incidents that can be classified as punishable hate crimes asian americans have also documented a large number of alleged bias and hate incidents stop aapi hate reports indicate that 70 of coronavirus discrimination against asian americans has involved verbal harassment with over 1000 incidents of verbal harassment reported in just four weeks jeung  nham 2020 in addition there have been over 90 reports of asian americans being coughed or spat on one prevalent theme in the verbal incidents is the linking of asian bodies to covid-19 where the aggressors are purportedly calling asians coronavirus chinese virus or diseased and telling them that they should be quarantined or go back to china adl 2020 in all of these incidents the perpetrators consistently use anti-asian racial slurs buscher 2020 goodell  mann 2020 sheldon 2020 this hateful language that targets all asians and not just chinese americans demonstrates the racialization of asian americans the threat of a global pandemic to peoples everyday lives is something that most americans have not experienced before however the act of interpreting the current national crisis as an external threat and ascribing this danger to chinese bodies and more broadly asian bodies should not surprise scholars of asian americans in fact this deeply-rooted cognitive association of asian americans to asia and to disease has a long history hence we examine the phenomenon of xenophobia against asian americans in the context of historical racial dynamics in the united states race has been posited as a socio-historical concept and while many race scholars in the united states have focused on the blackwhite binary others have documented how asian americans have also been racialized over time omi  winant 2014 these scholars have examined how the racialization of asian americans has developed in relation to african americans and white americans bonilla-silva 2004 kim 1999 one of the dominant stereotypes of asian americans is that they are perpetual foreigners where individuals directly link phenotypical asian ethnic appearance with foreignness regardless of asian immigrant or generational status ancheta 2006 tuan 1998 f h wu 2002 this stereotype is longstanding in american history and has forcefully re-emerged during the covid-19 crisis the perception of an asian-looking person as simultaneously chinese asian and foreign underscores how this racial categorization affects all asian americans thus we suggest that the concept of asian american panethnicity okamoto  mora 2014 may be particularly applicable during the covid-19 pandemic the legacy of white supremacy equates white bodies with purity and innocence while nonwhite bodies are designated as unclean uncivilized and dangerous white supremacy and its tactic of othering asian bodies has been a consistent recurrence over earlier pandemics dating back to the nineteenth century the bubonic plague was framed as a racial disease which only asian bodies could be infected by whereas white bodies were seen as immune randall 2019 in 1899 honolulu officials quarantined and burned chinatown as a precaution against the bubonic plague mohr 2004 in 1900 san francisco authorities quarantined chinatown residents and regulated food and people in and out of chinatown believing that the unclean food and asian people were the cause of the epidemic shah 2001 trauner 1978 the history of the yellow peril has continued throughout the 20th and 21st centuries in the embodied perceptions of asian immigrants as the spreaders of disease molina 2006 more recently during the 2003 sars severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic the discourse in the united states focused on chinatown as the epicenter of the disease eichelberger 2007 studies suggest that 14  of americans reported avoiding asian businesses and asian americans experienced increased threat and anxiety during sars blendon benson desroches raleigh  taylor-clark 2004 we suspect the negative impact of covid-19 on asian americans has been far greater than the impact of sars in new york citys chinatown restaurants suffered immediately after the first reports of covid-19 as some restaurants and businesses experienced up to an 85 drop in profits for the two months prior to march 16th 2020  far before any stay-at-home orders were given roberts 2020 when moral panic arises foreign bodies typically the undesirable and un-american yellow bodies may be seen as a threat that can harm pure white bodies the cycle of elevated risk followed by fearing and blaming what is foreign is not just limited to disease outbreaks but also occurs during economic downturns in 1982 vincent chin was beaten to death by two men who blamed him for the influx of japanese cars into the united states auto market vincent chin was attacked with racial slurs and specifically targeted because of his race although chin was chinese american in the minds of these two men he represented the downturn of the auto industry in detroit and the increased imports of japanese automobiles choy  tajima-pena 1987 similarly after the 911 attacks in the united states retaliatory aggressions were not limited to attacks against arabs or muslims perry 2003 violence and hatred against the perceived enemy resulted in incidents targeting sikhs second and third generation indian americans and even lebanese and greeks perry 2003 more recently the hate crime murder of srinivas kuchibhotla an indian immigrant falsely assumed to be an iranian terrorist and told get out of my country before being shot to death illustrates the association between racialized perceptions of threat and incidents of violence fuchs 2018 with the covid-19 pandemic violent attacks and racial discrimination against asian americans have emerged as non-asian americans look for someone or something asian to blame for their anger and fear about illness economic insecurity and stay-at-home orders the current perceptions of china and more broadly east asia as both economic and public health threats have made chinese and east asians in america fearful for their own safety some asian americans have made efforts to hide their asian identity or assert their status as american in an attempt to prevent hate crime attacks buscher 2020 tang 2020 while this tactic may be effective on the individual level it does not modify the positionality of asian bodies during covid-19 the attempt to distinguish asian americans from asians who are foreign nationals misses the fact that in the united states being asians and being foreign are inextricably bound together after world war ii news media and local organizations encouraged chinese americans to distinguish themselves from the japanese and similarly encouraged japanese americans to show their americanness and patriotism to gain acceptance by the white majority e d wu 2015 muslim and sikh americans displayed american flags after 911 to show that they were not a threat to the united states and more recently there has been a movement to celebrate sikh captain america ishisaka 2018 former presidential candidate andrew yang suggested that asian americans fight against racism by wearing red white and blue and prominently displaying their americanness yang 2020 in many of these situations these strategies did not directly address the problems of racism and xenophobia  they simply shifted the blame towards another group disease does not differentiate among people based on skin color or national origin yet many asian americans have suffered from discrimination and hatred during the covid-19 pandemic although the threat of the virus is real for all americans asian americans bear the additional burden of feeling unsafe and vulnerable to attack by others the link between covid-19 and hate crimes and bias incidents against asian americans is indicative of the widespread racial sentiments which continue to be prominent in american society while some scholars have gone as far as to regard asian americans as honorary whites tuan 1998 the current covid-19 crisis has made markedly clear this is an illusion at best there are a number of reasons why the racial dynamics of anti-asian crimes during covid-19 should be examined more closely first the majority of incidents and attacks have occurred in diverse metropolitan areas such as new york city boston and los angeles these are spaces that most americans have traditionally regarded as more liberal and tolerant of difference than other parts of the united states in new york city alone from the start of the covid-19 outbreak through april 2020 the nypds hate crime task force has investigated fourteen cases where all the victims were asian and targeted due to coronavirus discrimination nypd 2020 the remarks of a kansas governor that said his town was safe because it had only a few chinese residents lefler  heying 2020 offers one explanation for the high concentration of racial incidents in large cities with sizable asian populations but we think that this is not sufficient in explaining the data so far future research should track racial bias and hate crimes more systematically in order to further our understanding of how demography and urbanicity influence these incidents second these hate crimes have increased the anxiety of asian americans during already uncertain times with many fearful for their physical safety when running everyday errands tavernise  oppel jr 2020 asian americans are now self-conscious about coughing while asian aratani 2020 and concerned about being targeted for hate crimes liu 2020 wong 2020 there is evidence to suggest that asian americans under-report crimes allport 1993 and some recent immigrants may lack an understanding of the legal system and process of reporting crimes particularly in the case of hate crimes therefore scholars should take additional care to document and analyze these incidents and their effects on asian american communities across the united states the possible upward trend of anti-asian bias incidents and hate crimes is indicative of the growth of white nationalism and xenophobia the image of a disease carrier with respect to covid-19 is bound in asian bodies and includes assumptions about race ethnicity and citizenship as vincent chin srinivas kuchibhotla the burmese-american family and many others have shown us the level of fungibility in terms of how asian ethnicities are perceived can be deadly it does not matter if the person is from china of chinese origin or simply looks asian  the perpetrators of this violence see all of these bodies as foreign and threatening while there have been numerous instances of anti-asian bias and crime there have not been similarly patterned anti-european tourist incidents or an avoidance of italian restaurants suggesting that covid-19 illuminates the particular racialization of disease that extends beyond this virus and further back in american history already there has been substantial news coverage of these anti-asian crimes which suggests that people are paying attention to this issue and police departments are actively investigating many of these incidents activists and community organizations have started online campaigns such as washthehate and hateisavirus to combat anti-asian racism during this time the bbc has documented 120 distinct news articles covering alleged incidents of discrimination since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic cheung feng  deng 2020 in addition the chinese for affirmative action and asian pacific policy and planning council have created a platform where individuals can record incidents of racism and coronavirus discrimination the reporting of hate crimes during covid-19 is superior to the reports of these types of incidents during the sars outbreak leung coleman 2020 washer 2004 although the federal government response has been limited compared to the hate crime prevention initiatives after 911 and sars in may 2020 the commission on civil rights agreed to take on the demands proposed by a group of democratic senators in a letter requesting a stronger response to the anti-asian hate crimes and discrimination during covid-19 campbell  ellerbeck 2020 yam 2020b similar to the murder of vincent chin which served to ignite an asian american activist movement we hypothesize that the racial incidents against asian americans during the covid-19 pandemic may encourage the political mobilization of a panethnic asian american movement at the same time we believe that the incidents that are classified as hate crimes and bias incidents based on legal definitions do not fully capture the extent or pervasiveness of racist and xenophobic thoughts against asian americans we encourage future scholars to more closely examine the culturally embedded racial logics that lead to these incidents rather than focusing solely on the incidents themselves as the object of analysis the hate crimes against asians in the time of covid-19 highlight the ways that asian americans continue to be viewed as foreign and suspect this may be an additional burden on asian americans beyond the anxiety economic instability and the risk of illness all americans have experienced during covid-19  changes in police calls for service during the early months of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic matthew ashby p   the coronavirus epidemic unfolding in the usa is likely to present several different challenges for law enforcement agencies this article attempts to provide early evidence on how demand for police response to incidents has changed during the early months of the pandemic using calls-for-service data from 10 large us cities  the appearance of the first us case of the covid-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus designated as sars-cov-2 on 20 january 2020 led to changes in society across the usa that are unprecedented in recent decades as well as leading to at least 80554 deaths by 11 may dong et al 2020 the virus resulted in school closures in every state and stay-at-home orders in many mervosh et al 2020 both the virus and federal state and local responses to it may have had an effect on policing in several different ways first the virus may have directly influenced the ability of police agencies to continue to function for example on 3 april 2020 over 1500 new york city police officers about 4 of all officers had been infected and one in six officers was sick or quarantined including the chief of the counterterrorism bureau southall 2020 in detroit the chief of homicide investigation was one of several officers to die of covid-19 eligon and macfarquhar 2020 secondly law enforcement officers were asked to undertake new tasks as part of the government response to coronavirus for example since police typically lead the initial response to a sudden death at home they became first responders to many covid-19 deaths in the community officers were also required to enforce stay-at-home orders that covered at least 90 of americans by mid-april 2020 reuters 2020 in new york city for example over 700 officers were diverted from other duties to respond to calls related to breaches of social distancing regulations sandovai 2020 while enforcing stay-at-home orders may be more familiar for officers in parts of the country more prone to natural disasters for many it will have been entirely new internationally there has been much debate about how police should balance enforcing public health regulations and protecting both civil rights and policecommunity relations cave and dahir 2020 officers may have also had to contend often with little notice with changes to procedures for example to encourage social distancing between officers or between officers and the public thirdly the virus and governmental responses to it may lead to changes in factors that influence the frequency or severity of incidents to which police respond for example initial indications suggest an increase in gun purchases during the early weeks of the epidemic schwartz 2020 a record number of americans also claimed unemployment benefits rushe and holpuch 2020 with previous studies having linked joblessness to for example higher rates of suicide milner et al 2013 it is the changes in demand for policing as measured in the number of calls for service which were the focus of the present study there are at least three reasons why it is useful to make initial estimates of any changes now even if as with all scientific results they are inevitably provisional first gathering initial evidence at this stage is likely to be helpful in shaping future research questions on covid-19 and policing especially since the range of such questions is so large secondly academics are already fielding questions from the media and others as to how police demand is changing during the pandemic most importantly early evidence may be useful in helping practitioners to develop responses to later stages of the pandemic this is especially important because it is likely that there will be multiple waves of infection during the pandemic xu and li 2020 and it is possible that future waves will hit hardest in different places to those most affected by and able to learn most from the first wave answering calls for service from the public and other agencies is a core part of the mission of almost all law enforcement agencies people call the police not only to deal with serious crimes or major threats to public safety but also for a wide range of order maintenance tasks from disputes between neighbours to minor traffic collisions thacher 2014 servicing the demand produced by calls for service consumes a large proportion of available police resources meehan 1992 with other activities such as crime prevention and pro-active law enforcement often relegated to the time available between calls shane 2007 since answering calls takes up so much police time understanding calls for service is essential to understand policing nevertheless understanding trends and patterns in calls has received much less attention from scholars than understanding patterns in crime research on calls has typically focused on designing efficient systems for call handling and response brooks et al 2011 green 1984 larson and rich 1987 mazerolle et al 2002 or has used calls for service as a proxy for crime or disorder in research into other issues unrelated to calls themselves cohn and rotton 2003 decker et al 2007 klinger and bridges 1997 quinet and nunn 1998 most studies of calls for service have used small sample sizes often involving the study of a few hundred calls neusteter et al 2019 a small number of studies have identified temporal patterns in calls associated with patterns of routine activities chen and kurland 2018 chohlas-wood et al 2015 for example cohn 1996 and lebeau and corcoran 1990 both found that the frequency of calls was associated with changes in weather a small number of studies have tested for changes in call frequency associated with major disruptions to activities that were caused by natural disasters lebeau 2002 found that the number of calls for service increased substantially during and for the week after hurricane hugo struck charlotte nc with order-maintenance and service calls becoming a particular focus of police activity buttell and carney 2009 found that in the year after hurricane katrina total calls for service in new orleans increased but domestic-violence calls the focus of that study decreased more recently scholars have begun using models to forecast the future frequency of calls for service holcomb and radke sharpe 2006 compared forecasting methods and found that an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model had the lowest error jasso et al 2007 detected major emergencies by comparing the actual number of 911 calls received per hour to the number of calls expected based on a statistical model for an in-depth review of research into police calls for service see neusteter et al 2019 research on how calls have changed during public health emergencies is extremely limited luna et al 2007 reported on case studies of police department plans for responding to an influenza pandemic with some departments saying they planned to reduce response to some non-urgent calls if necessary richards et al 2006 likewise suggested that it may be necessary to not respond to some calls due to officers being unavailable due to illness while brito et al 2009 pp vivii suggested that calls for service will likely increase dramatically at first possibly leading to the police being overwhelmed however these studies were largely based on contingency planning rather than analysis of calls during an actual public health emergency a recent commentary by reicher and stott 2020 attempted to assess the risk of widespread disorder in response to the covid-19 pandemic but did not discuss the demand for policing similarly stott et al 2020 discussed how police could maintain public legitimacy while enforcing coronavirus lockdown measures but did not mention police responses to calls lum et al 2020 conducted a survey of law enforcement agencies in canada and the usa during march 2020 and found thatcontrary to the expectations of those studies based on contingency planning57 of agencies reported that calls for service had declined however they noted p 1 that this adjustment in calls for service could reflect a reduction in certain types of calls and increases in others much more research is needed to understand the impact of covid-19 on calls for service to the police the present study used calls-for-service data to identify how across multiple cities and for many types of incidents demand for policing changed during the early months of the covid-19 pandemic this study used calls-for-service data from 10 of the 100 largest cities in the usa baltimore md cincinnati oh los angeles ca new orleans la phoenix az san diego ca san jose ca seattle wa sonoma county ca and st petersburg fl1 these cities were chosen because they all release incident-level data in some cases after a few days delay about each call received by the police control room in many cases the data had been released as part of the police data initiative caplan et al 2015 open calls-for-service data have largely not been used in academic research see lersch and christy 2020 for an exception but open crime data from the same sources have been used ashby 2019 data on all calls since 1 january 2016 were included in the analysis or a total of 238 million calls across all 10 cities calls were aggregated into weekly counts both for total calls and for calls of 18 selected types chosen because they are among the most frequent types of call received table 1 using weekly counts reduced noise in the data compared to using daily counts while allowing the analysis to retain sensitivity to short-term changes compared to using monthly counts
 the amount of police activity generated by an individual call for service will vary considerably some calls will require no police response at all perhaps because they will be passed to another agency while others will represent the start of a major investigation lasting many months quantifying the demand caused by each call is difficult and often requires access to multiple sources of data eg covering investigator time forensic resources and court processing that were not available for the present study the frequency of calls in each category was therefore used as the variable of interest this leaves for future research questions such as whether detection rates time-to-detection or other measures of police productivity changed during the coronavirus pandemic to identify changes in calls for service during the pandemic data were split into two data from 1 january 2016 to 19 january 2020 the day before the first us covid-19 case were used to establish the baseline frequency of calls that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic these data were fed into a seasonal arima model for each type of call in each cityusing only data from before 20 january 2020 to train the models ensured that the forecasts were not influenced by any changes in calls during the early weeks of the pandemic each model included a variable for the long-term trend in calls seasonal variables for each week of the year a variable indicating whether a us federal holiday occurred during that week and a variable indicating whether the week corresponded to a small number of weeks for which data were missing see table 1 in supplementary material data for los angeles included certain types of pro-active call such as traffic stops only from 1 january 2018 onwards so models of calls in los angeles also included a variable specifying whether a week was before or after that date arima models require selection of the number of autoregressive and moving average terms to include this study determined these parameters using the algorithm proposed by hyndman and khandakar 2008 and implemented in the fable package ohara-wild et al 2020 in r version 361 r core team 2019 this algorithm runs multiple models with different parameters and selects the model that minimizes the akaike information criterion estimator of prediction error due to the large number of models 177 in totalone for each category of call in each city the chosen parameters for each model are shown in table 1 of supplementary material the resulting arima models were used to forecast the weekly frequency of calls for service of each type in each city from 20 january 2020 onwards these forecasts provided a synthetic comparison group of data representing the expected frequency of calls in the absence of any changes related to the coronavirus pandemic this synthetic comparison was necessary because the global nature of the pandemic meant that comparison data from unaffected cities were not available nevertheless these forecasts rely on the assumption that call frequency will continue to follow the same trend and seasonal patterns as in the past to determine whether the observed frequency of crime during the pandemic was different from what would have been expected otherwise the observed frequency was compared with the confidence intervals around the estimates produced by the arima models this allowed testing of whether the observed frequency is different from what would be expected taking into account any long-term trend in calls any seasonal patterns and short-term noise in the data the benefit of using arima models in this way rather than for example as a part of an interrupted time series design is that an interrupted time series would measure the average difference between the frequency of calls before a set point eg the issuing of a stay-at-home order and afterwards this requires selection of a single change point in what was a fluid situation and potentially obscures short-term changes in the frequency of calls that may be of substantial practical relevance for example an interrupted time-series design using 8 weeks of post-lockdown data might fail to find any effect if calls substantially increased for 2 weeks but then returned to the normal level for the following 6 weeks since the average number of calls would be close to normal nevertheless a 2-week spike in calls might be highly relevant to a police chief attempting to plan for future waves of the pandemic and so it is important to choose a research design that allows identification of such patterns the potential disbenefit of the current approach is that it requires a large number of comparisons between actual call frequency and the respective model confidence intervals raising the probability of false positives given the large number of weekly comparisons presented in the figures below it is likely that actual counts in some weeks will be outside the confidence intervals by chance to avoid falsely identifying an effect actual counts will only be considered as being different from the forecast if the actual counts for two or more consecutive weeks are outside the 99 confidence interval rather than a single week being outside the more conventional 95 interval this study did not attempt to compare changes in call frequency in different cities to the number or rate of infections or deaths in each place this was because reliable data on the number of either cases or fatalities were not available at the time of writing published statistics on confirmed infections are likely to be influenced by variations in testing regimes in different states as more data are released it will be possible to better understand the total deaths resulting from the pandemic in each city potentially by using data on excess mortality from all causes weinberger et al 2020 but this is left for future research the call-count data individual model coefficients and annotated r code for this analysis are available at httpsosfio7v3nu  the individual call-type models included separate forecasts for assault burglary domestic violence including family disputes robbery shootings including reports of shots fired and vehicle theft not all of these calls will be the result of crimes having occurred since callers can be mistaken in what they report so it is important not to assume that crime-related calls for service are a reliable proxy for the frequency of crime kane 1998 crime-related calls are discussed here mainly not as a proxy for crime but as a measure of the demand placed on police who must still respond to apparently crime-related calls even if they later turn out to be unfounded or non-criminal the picture for crime-related calls during the early weeks of lockdown was mixed the frequency of assault calls was significantly below the forecast in three cities baltimore cincinnati and seattle while remaining within the expected range in other cities conversely the frequency of burglary calls was significantly above the forecast in three cities new orleans seattle and st petersburg the frequency of calls to shootings or reports of gunfire remained within the forecast range except in baltimore cincinnati and phoenix vehicle-theft calls remained within the range expected based on the forecast in every city while robbery calls remained within the forecast in all but one baltimore for all these types calls remained within the expected range in at least five cities overall it appears that police should expect crime-related calls at least for those categories studied here to continue at about the expected frequency during any future pandemic lockdowns 
figure 2 shows the frequency of domestic violencefamily dispute calls in each city not all such disputes involve violence but it was not possible to separate domestic violence from family disputes due to limitations in the call categories used by individual cities these calls are of particular interest since policy makers and the media expressed concerns that requiring people to stay at home would expose repeat victims to greater risk taub 2020 however ashby 2020 found no evidence that serious assaults in residences had increased during the covid-19 lockdown in eight large us cities while payne and morgan 2020 found that the number of breaches of domestic violence orders in queensland australia had not changed during the pandemic figure 2 shows that the number of calls to domestic incidents increased after lockdowns began in three cities los angeles new orleans and phoenix while decreasing in cincinnati and remaining within the expected range in baltimore seattle and st petersburg it is notable also that in two of the cities in which calls initially increased they returned to within the expected range after a short period further research will be required to identify the causes of these diverging trends across different cities while being mindful that higher calls may indicate better recording eg through covert reporting schemes rather than necessarily showing a greater problem with domestic violence calls to maintain public order typically make up a large proportion of police work the most frequent of these calls are requests to respond to disturbance of various kinds in the period of the covid-19 lockdown calls to disturbances significantly increased in four cities los angeles new orleans phoenix and san diego although in new orleans calls were outside the confidence interval for only the first 2 weeks of the lockdown and in san diego disturbance calls were already much higher than forecast by the model before the first us covid-19 case in the remaining six cities disturbance calls remained within the model confidence interval calls related to drugs including both reports of drug dealing and of typically public drug use remained as expected everywhere except baltimore and st petersburg in which they were lower than expected the mechanisms underlying any relationship between drug calls and covid-19 are likely to be complex for example stay-at-home orders may move some drug users indoors potentially decreasing calls while making drug use stand out more on quieter streets potentially increasing calls the closure of high schools is also likely to have changed the activities of many young people who are disproportionately likely to be involved in drug activity calls to suspicious people or vehicles appeared to remain largely as in previous years although they were briefly up in new orleans and down in seattle similarly calls to people trespassing remained within the forecast range except in san diego and seattle where they increased figure 3 shows that the frequency of intruder alarms dropped significantly below the forecast frequency in four cities meaning that in the 4 weeks from 16 march there were around 3600 30 fewer alarm calls than would be expected based on the models 860 30 in baltimore 1300 27 in los angeles 1200 35 in phoenix and 270 26 in seattle alarm calls in the other five cities were also below the forecast but remained within the confidence interval with the exception of calls to alarms it appears that police should expect the usual requirement to maintain public order to remain during any future wave of the pandemic although there may be relatively minor fluctuations
 although all cities have emergency medical and rescue services to respond to medical incidents police often co-respond to such cases and these calls form a substantial proportion of police demand for example police in the cities in this study recorded an average of 5400 calls to deaths medical emergencies mental health and other concerns for safety including person down calls each week in 2019 compared to around 3700 weekly calls to assaults and 2400 to burglaries given the number of cases of covid-19 it might be expected that the number of medical calls would have increased substantially this was also the reasoning behind the warnings of dramatic increases in calls for service predicted by the contingency-planning studies mentioned above contrary to these expectations in no city were calls either to medical emergencies or mental healthconcerns for safety significantly above what was expected medical-emergency calls significantly decreased in three cities cincinnati los angeles and new orleans and mental-health calls decreased in cincinnati and new orleans while calls to missing persons decreased in baltimore new orleans and san diego the decrease in medical-related calls in some cities may be a by-product of the decreases in on-street activity resulting from lockdown measures it is also possible that if local policies require police to be notified only of medical emergencies in public places a higher proportion of medical emergencies were not notified to police since more emergencies were happening at home 
figure 4 shows that the number of calls to dead bodies was significantly above the frequency forecast by the models in los angeles and new orleans such that in the five weeks from 16 march the number of such calls was above the forecast by 178 in los angeles and 111 in new orleans the cities with the largest number of covid-19 cases in all the other cities except phoenix the number of dead-body calls was above the forecast but within the confidence interval due to the rarity of such calls relative to other call types the confidence intervals around the forecasts are relatively large further research should look at the role of police in responding to dead bodies during the pandemic including any additional difficulties associated with determining whether deaths were suspicious and the trauma experienced by officers called to dead bodies more often police chiefs should also consider planning for increases in such calls during future similar situations regulating motor-vehicle traffic is another substantial part of police work in a typical week in 2019 police in los angeles responded to around 1200 traffic collisions figure 5 shows that during the early weeks of the pandemic calls to collisions were significantly below that forecast by the models everywhere except san jose and sonoma county with about 10400 fewer calls to collisions than forecast by the model in the 4 weeks beginning 16 march across eight cities a decrease of 37 in the most recent week compared to the forecasts calls to people driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs also fell significantly in los angeles new orleans and san diego these changes are almost certainly driven by large decreases in the number of people travelling valentino-devries et al 2020
 while traffic collisions fell in almost all cities fig 5 shows that in many of them the frequency of collisions began to slowly increase in later weeks this may reflect changes in peoples adherence to stay-at-home orders for example if quarantine fatigue zaveri 2020 means people become restless after several weeks of lockdown likewise in some cities it appears that collisions began to decrease before stay-at-home orders were made potentially as people chose to work from home or otherwise limit their travel in response to increasing concern about coronavirus it suggests that law enforcement agencies should be prepared to be flexible in their planning responding to changes in the frequency of different types of calls over time this requires rapid eg weekly analysis of call volume and illustrates the importance of having analytical support within an agency although most calls for service originate with a member of the public some calls are self-initiated by officers the most common of these is the traffic stop typically recorded as a call for service for officer safety figure 6 shows that the frequency of traffic stops decreased after lockdown in every city except san diego in some cities stops ceased almost completely stops in cincinnati in the week beginning of 23 march were 94 below forecast with only 30 being recorded compared to 512 expected as with traffic collisions it appears that after initially dropping sharply the frequency of traffic stops increased again in the later weeks of the lockdown while in the week beginning of 23 march the number of traffic stops across all cities was 66 below forecast 4 weeks later the number of stops had increased to 57 below forecast
 traffic stops are interesting because unlike most other calls for service the stop is initiated by the officer the factors influencing the frequency of stops are likely to be numerous see ashby and tompson 2018 for a discussion including the availability of vehicles to be stopped the availability of time for pro-active policing between other calls changing departmental guidance and the motivation of officers to carry out stops future research may wish to consider the relative importance of these factors as well as how the dramatic decrease in stops and potentially other pro-active policing during the pandemic may have influenced crime this study analysed how calls for service in 10 large us cities changed during the 16 weeks between the first us case of covid-19 on 20 january 2020 and the end of the most recent complete week of data on 10 may there was no discernible difference between the forecast and actual frequency of calls between the first us case and early march when cities and states began to take action to enforce social distancing to slow the spread of the disease this suggests that police are likely to have some time to refine and implement contingency plans in the early weeks of any future pandemics the slow onset or rising tide nature of pandemic emergencies makes them different from most police major incidents such as mass shootings or rail crashes which require plans to be executed immediately and prioritize speed of action this delay provides additional time to prepare but also requires that managers know when best to execute each element of a pandemic response plan after schools closed and stay-at-home orders were issued the frequency of calls in many cities went down although decreases were not seen everywhere a decrease in calls was contrary to the expectations of previous predictions that calls for service would increase during a pandemic since the widespread lockdowns seen during the covid-19 pandemic are largely unprecedented it may be that contingency planners were not able to predict the effect such measures may have on police demand although luna et al 2007 did discuss the possibility of movement restrictions it is noteworthy that many of the changes discussed here were more complicated than a simple shift from a pre-lockdown call frequency to a post-lockdown frequency this can be seen in the short spikes in calls to dead bodies seen in new orleans and seattle or the sudden drop in traffic collisions followed by a gradual increase for researchers this emphasizes the importance of using research designs that allow the detection of complex patterns over time for practitioners it illustrates the value of agencies having the capability to continually monitor patterns of demand both so that action can be taken promptly and so that previous decisions eg relating to resource allocation can be revisited as circumstances change while the overall frequency of calls decreased this does not necessarily mean that the pandemic reduced pressure on police or created additional capacity that could be used for other tasks as mentioned above police departments themselves have had staff affected by the virus either through being ill staying at home due to particular vulnerability or being away from work caring for relatives in the absence of time-series data on how many officers were unavailable for duty as the pandemic developed it is not possible to know whether overall demand-per-officer increased or decreased or to identify the point of peak demand-per-officer although these would be useful topics for further research the increases seen in some types of calls may have meant increased pressure on some specialist departments within particular agencies for example the increase in calls to domestic incidents in some cities may have increased the workload of specialists trained to assess the risk of further incidents against the same victim conversely demand may have decreased in other departments such as those processing traffic tickets or investigating collisions it may therefore be possible for chiefs to move resources between different activities or to train staff in a team where demand has decreased to be able to provide support to others where demand has decreased this study presents initial evidence on how police calls for service changed during the early months of the covid-19 pandemic the results are inevitably provisional further research including on the research questions raised above will be necessary to understand in more detail what changed what did not and what lessons police should draw one important finding from this study is that there is unlikely to be a single universal experience of coronavirus among police departments different agencies may experience different changes this means that the availability of data from multiple agencies will be crucial in developing our understanding of reactive patrol policing during a major public health emergency   effects of forced air warming systems on the airflow and sanitation quality of operating rooms with non-laminar airflow systems kazuhiro shirozu shinnosuke takamori hidekazu setoguchi ken yamaura   in operating rooms ors laminar airflow laf systems create a homogenous airflow with very little turbulence from the air conditioner outlet to the inlet particularly in ors with a vertical laf system downward airflows from air-conditioner outlets on the ceiling are exhausted via air-conditioner inlets near the floor contrarily non-laminar airflow nlaf systems do not produce homogenous airflows then a mixed or turbulent flow is passed into the or where air aerosols and particles can be homogenized however cost-effectiveness analyses found that laf systems are more expensive compared to nlaf systems cacciari et al reported that laf systems increased building costs by 24 and annual operating costs by 36 compared to the respective nlaf system costs1 in a model calculation study performed by merollini et al laf systems required an additional cost of aud 459 million per 30000 hip arthroplasties2
 to ensure a low infection rate in an ultra-clean air environment the usage of laf as an air conditioning system has been recommended when performing surgery3 4 5 6 the rate of reoperation or wound infection after artificial joint surgery in an laf-equipped or was reported to be smaller than that in an nlaf-equipped or7 contrarily lidwell et al reported that the use of prophylactic antibiotics was a more effective prevention method for development of joint sepsis after surgery than ventilation systems in the or 16 under ultra-clean air without antibiotics versus 08 under a conventional airflow system with antibiotics4 thus perioperative prophylactic antibiotics are thought to be the most potent prevention factor for the development of surgical site infections ssi however in gastrointestinal surgery the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics varies among different types of surgery and some studies reported that antimicrobial prophylaxis was not observed6

8

9 additionally the efficacy of laf for ssi prevention was demonstrated under the gastric or vascular surgeries5

6
 on the other hand laf operating theaters long operating times high hospital care volume antibiotic-laden cement and forced air warming faw systems have been reported as surgical risk factors for ssis10 additionally the global guidelines of the world health organization who for ssi prevention indicate that the use of laf was not necessarily recommended for patients undergoing total arthroplasty surgery these who 2016 guidelines were based on previous reports that showed that surgeries performed in laf-equipped ors resulted in increased ssis and expenditures this led to a reevaluation of the cost-effectiveness of this method and the risks of ssis2

11

12 it is expected that the number of ors employing nlafs will increase in the future however the benefit of using an laf system for preventing ssis remains controversial the safety of faw systems is also controversial although the active warming of patients during surgery is indisputably beneficial13

14 in our previous study under an laf system the upward faw airflow above the head area was completely counteracted by the laf and the faw did not cause a meaningful airflow in the surgical site15 however the effect of the faw airflow in an nlaf-equipped or has not been reported to date therefore we investigated the impact of faw on the airflow and sanitation quality of an nlaf-equipped or the study was performed in an or within the munakata medical association hospital which is equipped with a vertical nlaf system the airflow speed at the diffuser varies between 44 and 83 cms the air is pre-filtered and then guided through ventilation ducts to the individual ors the or used in the present study height of 28 m floor area of 279 m2 receives an airflow supply of 55 m3min resulting in 48 complete air circulation cycles per hour the operating table 500  2080 mm is surrounded by six air conditioner outlets 750  450 mm that contain final point-of-use high-efficiency particulate air filters and two air inlets fig 1
a we examined the airflow caused by faw or nlaf in the presence of a surgical light positioned above the operating table via a three-dimensional measurement of the airflow direction and speed a 3m bair hugger model 750 3m company maplewood mn usa and a lower-body blanket model 585 3m company were used as the faw device with the warming temperature set to 43c the air conditioning temperature in the or was set to 25c an upper-body manikin was placed in the supine position a lower-body warming blanket was placed underneath it and was covered with a surgical drape fig 1d a 3-dimensional ultrasonic anemometer wa-790 sonic corporation tokyo japan was used to measure the direction and speed of the airflow at intervals of 300 mm at 324 points 9  6  6 9 points on the x-axis in the rightleft direction at 300 mm intervals with the cross-sectional point placed at point x4 6 points on the y-axis in the head or foot direction at 300 mm intervals with the head at point y6 and 6 points on the z-axis at 100 300 500 800 operating table height 1100 and 1400 mm from the floor fig 1b c a meaningful airflow is defined as an airflow under 10 cms the sanitation quality was evaluated with a cleanliness recovery test during the use of the lower-body blanket for this test dust was artificially generated in the surgical field with the nlaf turned off then the air conditioning was activated and the dust removal process was assessed16 we performed measurements at the center and lateral edges of the operating table at the y3 level fig 1b three measurements were made at each height 800 mm and 1500 mm for 6 points using a particle counter kc-03a rion co ltd tokyo japan suction sampling was performed at a rate of 1 ft3min to measure the number of dust particles with a grain size of  05 m the air conditioning was turned on with an initial dust particle load of approximately 50000 per cubic foot and transitions in the number of dust particles were measured at 1 min intervals for 10 min a comparison between the faw running group faw  and the faw stop group faw  was performed the presented data are expressed as means and standard deviations an unpaired t-test was conducted to compare the control levels between the faw  and faw  groups a comparison between the two groups was performed via a two-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance fig 4b the statistical analysis was performed using the prism 6 software graphpad software la jolla ca usa where a p-value of p  005 is considered statistically significant examination of the operating table from the right and foot sides showed that the nlaf-induced downward air current moved along the floor toward the operating table causing an upward air current on both sides of the table fig 2
a contrarily the faw caused no meaningful airflow above or around the table fig 2b except for the airflow around the head area at the x5 point an upward air current was detected directly above the manikins head in the area separated by the anesthesia screen 930 cms figs 3
a and b top row regardless of the presence of the nlaf the faw caused no meaningful airflow above or around the operating table figs 3b top and bottom row at the y3 point an air current 16  28 cms was detected moving along the floor from the outside towards the operating table fig 3a bottom row an upward air current 18  34 cms was detected at the edges of both sides of the operating table fig 3a bottom row there was no significant difference in the number of dust particles per cubic foot before activation of the air conditioner regardless of whether or not faw was present faw  52650  1694 vs faw  51289  3667 p  048 the number of particles per cubic foot 10 minutes after air conditioner activation was 172  111 for faw  and 98  45 for faw  there was no significant difference in the cleanliness recovery rate between the faw  and faw  groups fig 4
 this is the first study to investigate the faw airflow under an nlaf system it was found that faw caused no meaningful airflow or disturbance of airborne cleanliness in the surgical field under the nlaf system however the faw caused an upward air current above the head of the operating table and nlaf could not counteract this upward air current our previous study revealed that the upward air current caused by the faw was completely counteracted in the laf-equipped or where the air-conditioner outlets were fully covered by the head area15 in the or used in this study although vertical down airflow from the ceiling above the surgical field was not detected the sanitary standard of the or was adequate this cleanliness in this or could be mainly due to air circulation cycle times per hour the nlaf system used in this study created an upward air current on both sides of the operating table flowing along the floor operating table and surgical drape a downward air current from the air-conditioning inlets generated this upward air current on the ceiling this phenomenon could be owing to the location or number of the air-conditioning inlets fig 1a the or used in this study has only two air-conditioning inlets in the corner of the room thus the airflow from the ceiling creates neither a homogenous flow nor a laminar airflow and becomes stagnant these results indicate the possibility of contamination of the surgical field from surrounding operating beds and the importance of the layout of the air-conditioner outlets many interventions have been suggested to affect the micro-organisms in ors for example infectious micro-organisms attached to microbial-laden dust lint squamous-cell skin or respiratory droplets have been reported to float throughout ors17

18 therefore the removal of airborne particles and the maintenance of air quality in ors is important for the prevention of ssis the use of shoe covers was reported to have no influence on the risk of ssis or bacteria counts on the or floor and environmental surfaces are rarely implicated as sources of pathogens important in the development of ssis17

18 however infectious micro-organisms can be attached to heavy objects lying on the floor recently guo at al reported that coronavirus was more detected in the intensive care units icu than in the general coronavirus disease ward and distributed on the floors 70 in the icu19 thus situations in which the airflow is detected from the floor of the surgical site should be avoided however if the micro-organisms and bacteria are of considerable size the contamination of large surfaces such as floors and the particle transfer throughout the surgical area should be measured and evaluated the 05 micron size is the important standard size for determining if the environment is below or above the accepted level of particles for cleanroom standard additionally most commonly bacteria size is over 05 micron so particle size smaller than 05 is not critical issue then we measured particles over the 05 micron the sanitary standard of the or used in this study was adequate but potential contamination from the floor was expected because an air current from outside the operating table was detected at an airspeed between 16 and 31 cms in almost all existing reports in which the air-conditioning type was found to be a risk factor for ssis the air-conditioning outlet layout or airflow in the or was not discussed if the airflow in the surgical field had been evaluated as a contributing factor instead of the air-conditioning type the conclusions in these reports might have been different a limitation of this study is that we could not evaluate the effect of upward airflows on both sides of the operating table and head area on the number of airborne particles in the surgical field the detection of point-to-point particle movement is practically difficult because artificially generated dust particles are quickly diffused generating a fixed number of particles is also difficult belani et al generated the illuminate neutrally buoyant detergent bubbles into the head area separated by anesthesia drape using by bubble generator and shifting bubbles were counted in the surgical site by photography 20 they reported that the number of shifting bubbles into the surgical field originating from the head area was higher when the faw was operative but did not discuss the ventilation situation however the faw-induced upward airflow detected in this study could possibly transfer the airborne from the head area to the surgical field or spread respiratory droplets to non-intubated patients nevertheless further investigation is needed to address these concerns further neither the operating staff nor the equipment around the operating table were included in this study these factors could play a significant role on the airflow in this study we demonstrated that the faw caused no meaningful airflow  10 cmsec and did not diminish the sanitation quality in the surgical field however above the head area the upward faw-induced airflow was not counteracted by the nlaf system which caused an upward airflow at the edges of the operating table originating from outside of the operating table and along the floor in ventilation systems similar to that of this study particle transferring to the surgical field possibly occurred from the floor via the nlaf ventilation system or from the head area via faw the authors report no conflicts of interest  guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus in korea hyukmin lee chang-seok ki heungsup sung sinyoung kim moon-woo seong dongeun yong jae-seok kim mi-kyung lee mi-na kim jong-rak choi jeong-ho kim      detection of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov rna cases with positive mers-cov on molecular tests irrespective of the presence or absence of clinical signs and symptoms a real time reverse transcriptase pcr rrt-pcr detection of mers-cov rna b serological tests seroconversion of mers-cov antibodies at least 4-fold increase of antibody titers in a 2-week interval cases corresponding to a-b below a cases with pneumonia or acute respiratory syndrome clinical or radiological diagnosis accompanied by fever and at least one of the following

 6 recommendations during laboratory testing 
a use of protective equipment 6
i level d personal protective equipment should be worn disposable gloves and a laboratory gown should be worn at all times when handling specimens and a dental mask and goggles should be worn when there is a risk of splashing from opening the specimen container glasses are insufficient and so goggles or a facial shield should be worn on top of glasses after testing has been completed all protective equipment should be removed and hands should be washed before leaving the testing area when removing the protective equipment equipment care must be taken not to contaminate the hands and body an n95 mask should be worn when there is a high risk of aerosol productionii class ii biosafety cabinet bsc a laboratory gown long sleeves covering the whole body opening at the back and disposable gloves must be worn after completing work at the bsc hands must be washed after removing glovesiii other safety devices - use of safety equipment installed by the manufacturereg centrifuge double coverwhen infectious specimens are centrifuged the specimen should be loaded and unloaded from the bucket and rotor inside the bsc
b when handling specimens outside the bsc minimize unintended contact with the specimenc after work on the specimen has been completed the bsc is sterilized with 70 alcohold any objects that contact the infectious specimen should be disposable if possible and if they become contaminated by the specimen they need to be autoclaved before disposal

  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 a review wei feng wei zong feng wang shaoqing ju   it is known to all that since the twenty-first century there have been three human pathogenic coronavirus outbreaks which have caused global transmission bringing huge challenges to global public health and economic development 1 they are the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 2 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 3 and the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 sars-cov-2 in 2019 4 at present there is no specific treatment plan in early 2020 a case of novel coronavirus was confirmed in wuhan china 4 within a short period of time the number of confirmed cases was increasing and those infected could develop fever cough and even severe respiratory syndrome 5 which quickly drew the attention of the chinese government 6 7 researchers found that 27 of the 41 initially confirmed cases had had direct contact with a local seafood market in wuhan initially assuming that the new coronavirus might have come from wild animals sold in the market 8 gao et al collected alveolar lavage fluid from three infected patients and successfully isolated the new coronavirus 9 electron microscopy has showed that the virus has an envelop the particles are round or oval with the diameter of about 60140 nm 4 whole genome sequencing analysis has showed that the virus belongs to a new type of coronavirus of the  genus 4 in addition shi et al obtained almost identical genome-wide sequences in virus samples from 5 patients the sequence of the new coronavirus was 795 similar to sars-cov and 96 similar to the coronavirus carried by bats which might be the potential source of infection 10 another study found that the receptor binding domain of sars-cov-2 was the closest to the coronavirus carried by pangolins thus the origin of sars-cov-2 remains to be determined 11 the world health organization who officially declared sars-cov-2 to be a public health emergency of international concern on january 31 due to its rapid spread furthermore the who declared sars-cov-2 to be a global pandemic on march 11 2020 12 the last time that the who declared a pandemic was h1n1 in 2009 which affected more than 70 countries and infected more than 60 million people in the united states alone 13 as of may 27 2020 sars-cov-2 had a total of 5715077 confirmed cases worldwide including 352912 deaths therefore it can be seen that it has strong transmission and pathogenicity fig 1
 this review mainly investigates the current status of the epidemic provides information of sars-cov-2 on virology clinical features epidemiology diagnosis treatment prevention and the role of internet new media highlights the major issues that still need to be studied and addressed coronavirus is the longest known rna virus with a length of 2732 kb 14 in 2014 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv divided coronaviruses into four genera     of the four coronavirus genera seven have been found to be pathogenic to humans  hcov-229e hcov-nl63  hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 sars-cov mers-cov the newly discovered sars-cov-2 also belongs to the  genus 9 15 the reason that coronavirus can cause human pandemic is closely related to its special structure 16 17 the sequencing results of sars-cov-2 genome sequence showed that its genome contains about 29 kb bases and 11 protein-coding regions fig 2 including 1ab 1a s 3a 4 m 6 7a 7b 8 n 10 16 the entry of sars-cov-2 into host cells was mediated mainly by the use of spike protein s 18 therefore we performed phylogenetic analysis of s protein of the human pathogenic coronavirus fig 3 s protein is a prominent trimer structure on the surface of the virus containing two functional subunits s1 and s2 where s1 is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptors and s2 is responsible for membrane fusion between the virus and the cell there is a furan cleavage site at the boundary between s1 and s2 subunits which is mutated during virus invasion thus distinguishing sars-cov-2 from sars-cov 16 veesler et al showed that sars-cov-2 entered cells using s protein by utilizing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the surface of host cells which is widely present in human respiratory and intestinal mucosal epithelial cells enabling sars-cov-2 to infect humans and cause transmission in humans which is similar to the transmission mechanism of sars-cov 16 19 in addition studies have shown that the expression level of ace2 gene in the lungs of smokers is significantly higher than that of non-smokers and smokers are more likely to be infected with sars-cov-2 20 these findings provide an important theoretical basis for drug development and epidemic prevention and control in addition an analysis of the sars-cov-2 genomic phylogenetic network revealed three types of variation which the researchers tentatively named abc where a is the ancestor type a and c mainly exist in europe and the united states while b mainly exists in east asia providing a new idea for the origin of sars-cov-2 21
 the incubation period it is to point to from causative agent invader airframe or produce action to airframe commonly arrive airframe begins to appear reaction or clinical symptom when arrive the incubation period of different infectious diseases is different mainly related to the number of pathogens pathogenicity feculence and the autoimmunity of the infected person 22 determining the incubation period of infectious diseases is helpful for researchers to determine the time of infection of an person track the source of infection and determine the route of transmission 23 24 it can also provide an important theoretical basis for the air defense time of prevention and quarantine of infectious diseases on january 31 2020 the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc announced that all residents returning from the outbreak would be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine through investigation and analysis of 88 patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 in the early stage backer et al preliminarily proved that the average incubation period of the disease was 64 days 95 ci 56 to 77 days 25 another study on the incubation period of sars-cov-2 showed that the incubation period of the infectious disease ranged from 2 days to 14 days 26 the latest study analyzed 181 cases of sars-cov-2 infectious using the log-normal model and predicted that the patients would show clinical manifestations within 12 days 23 the above research indicates that the average incubation period of sars-cov-2 is about 14 days but it is possible to extend the isolation observation period appropriately if necessary the clinical symptoms of patients infected with sars-cov-2 are mainly fever fatigue and cough but more than 50 of the infected patients even have no obvious symptoms which is easy to cause missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis 27 28 in addition to respiratory symptoms some people who are infected also experience digestive symptoms such as loss of appetite nausea and vomiting 29 some severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multi-organ failure ecmo plays an important role in the treatment of critically ill patients 30 31 diarrhea a common symptom of sars-cov-2 infection also accounts for a high proportion of sars-cov-2 infections 32 33 in addition the total number of white blood cells in adult infected patients is normal or slightly decreased in general laboratory examination in which the decline of lymphocytes is more obvious c-reactive protein crp can have a slight increase and there is a slight increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr 34 in obese patients aspartate aminotransferase ldl cholesterol and lymphocyte counts decreased significantly 35 meanwhile a retrospective study found statistically significant reductions in eosinophil levels in patients with poor prognosis 36 imaging finding suggested that most of the infected patients had pneumonia chest ct is usually characterized by ground-glass opacity ggo progressive chest ct indicated increased lesions the accumulative range of lesions was expanded and in severe cases diffuse consolidation of both lungs presented as white lung 37 38 so far most of those infected have mild symptoms and a good prognosis but the mortality is as high as 17 for the elderly or those with chronic disease 39 according to the statistical analysis of the current infected data the infected age is mainly between 40 and 60 years old among which the male patients are slightly more than the female patients the infected children are rare and most of the families of infected children have other family members infected 40 in addition to the typical clinical manifestations of the respiratory and digestive systems many patients were treated for obvious skin manifestations mainly red rash on the back of trunk urticaria etc therefore it is necessary for our clinicians to find such patients in time to avoid misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis 41 42 although the current statistical analysis shows that the infection rate of children is low it does not mean that children are not susceptible to disease perhaps because children have less contact with the outside environment and most families pay more attention to the health protection of children which need to be taken into account some studies have found that the average incubation period of children is longer than that of adults the clinical manifestations of infected children are relatively mild cough and fever are also common manifestations symptoms tend to subside slightly infected people or even no symptoms just positive nucleic acid test 43 more than 80 of infected children have detectable viral nucleic acids in their faeces 44 one study found that of the 10 children infected outside the wuhan 8 had direct contact with adults with a history of travel to the city the symptoms of infection in children are relatively mild and not easy to be found but the imaging examination often shows patchy infiltration if not timely treatment childrens growth and development is seriously affected 27 45 therefore children who may contact with high-risk groups should be closely monitored and isolated for early detection and intervention 45 46 since the symptoms of infected children are mild treatment with large doses of antiviral drugs or empirical antibiotics is not necessary unless the condition is severe and no other specific treatment options are available 47 studies have shown that coronavirus  and  originated in bats and the other two viruses originated in birds 1 a comparative analysis of genome sequences showed that sars-cov-2 was 96 similar to coronavirus from bats and bats were likely the natural host of sars-cov-2 10 48 however there may be one or more unkonwn intemediate hosts between bats and humans just as the intermediate host of sars-cov is civet cat and the intermediate host of mers is dromedary camel 49 50 most of the original sars-cov-2 infections came from a local seafood market in wuhan 51 the internal environment of the market was similar to the place where sars-cov was discovered in 2003 52 the wet and dirty environment provides favorable conditions for the virus to survive and reproduce in addition a variety of seafood was sold in the market and there was also illegal trafficking of wild animals the pathogen was likely to be one of the intermediate hosts or some wild animals 53 according to the latest research the virus strain isolated in pangolins is 99 similar to sars-cov-2 in sequence 54 it is suspected that pangolins may be the potential intermediate host of the virus pangolins were also sold in the market 55 it was likely that the first infected people ate the infected pangolins causing human-to-human transmission after the outbreak the local government moved quickly to close the market and conducted a thorough disinfection of course pangolins may not be the only intermediate host as coronaviruses have been found in many animals such as camels pigs goats and pangolins with further research it is believed that more potential intermediate hosts will be found 56 in addition to wild animals the researchers found that chickens ducks pigs and dogs were less susceptible to sars-cov-2 while cats were more susceptible to sars-cov-2 providing important information for future animal management 57 after the outbreak many regions in china have introduced relevant laws and regulations and some animals have been put on the fasting list at present the pathogenic mechanism of sars-cov-2 is still little studied and its transmission route and transmission mode are also greatly uncertain due to virus mutation and other factors epidemiological data show that sars-cov-2 has a strong infectious capacity and is highly infectious the known transmission route is mainly based on the history of the infected person and the sample of sars-cov-2 can be detected to make a guess the presence of sars-cov-2 was found in nasopharyngeal swab specimens of the infected person and the cases of cluster infection all suggested that airborne droplet transmission was the possible main transmission route 5860 confined space poor ventilation and so on are important causes of cluster infection 61 to this end on january 23 2020 the chinese government imposed a city closure on wuhan and travel restrictions on other cities to minimize unnecessary crowds currently disseminated by respiratory droplets and direct contact is clear a study collected in different regions of the hospital air sars-cov-2 testing found in the region of the medical staff and room toilet space existing in the small area is relatively high concentrations of the virus nucleic acid but whether these aerosol form of the virus has spread ability is not yet clear these need to pay attention to the prevention and control of hospital 62 63 sars-cov-2 rna was also detected in blood samples from infected patients 5 64 65 the real-time fluoresence quantitative pcr showed that the pcr cycle threshold was 351 indicating that there was a low concentration of viral nucleic acid in the blood samples and blood transmission might also be a potential transmission route of sars-cov-2 66 it also increases the difficulty of blood donation in blood centers and blood banks the high expression of ace2 receptor in the gastrointestinal tract indicates that sars-cov-2 can use ace2 receptor in the gastrointestinal tract to enter the human body so the fecal-oral pathway may be a potential transmission route of sars-cov-2 67 it is reported that the chinese center for disease control and prevention isolated the sars-cov-2 strain from stool samples from a confirmed patient in heilongjiang province indicating that sars-cov-2 could survive in feces a similar study found low levels of sars-cov-2 in the feces of some infected children 44 in addition the government of paris detected a novel coronavirus in a non-potable water system and an active novel coronavirus in sewage in massachusetts usa these studies have shown that a novel coronavirus can survive in water and be transmitted using water therefore if the water is infected by the virus even with the current stringent control measures there is still a high risk of human infection a newborn born during the outbreak at a local childrens hospital in wuhan was reported to have been diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection 30 h after birth and it was considered that sars-cov-2 might also cause an epidemic through vertical transmission 68 however another study did not find the presence of sars-cov-2 in the samples of amniotic fluid breast milk and other body fluids of 9 pregnant women infected with sars-cov-2 69 the newborns were not infected and no evidence of vertical transmission of pregnancy was found possibly due to the small sample size for health workers the possibility of vertical transmission still exists and needs to be taken seriously in the process of disease control 70 in addition there have been reports of infection in laboratory specimens and human conjunctival epithelium is susceptible to infection by infectious aerosols 71 an important indicator to measure the ability of the disease to spread basic reproduction number r0 refers to the average number of infectious diseases that can be transmitted to others without the need for external intervention 72 the critical value is 1 the greater the r0 value the more difficult to control the epidemic with the participation of all countries in the world the r0 value is also changing initially zhao et al estimated that the initial r0 value of sars-cov-2 was between 35 and 55 slightly higher than sars-cov the latest study shows that r0 is around 268 roughly the same as the r0 reported by the who and the chinese cdc 73 74 at present sars-cov-2 is spreading rapidly all over the world with the cumulative number of infected people excedding 160000 if no corresponding measures are taken the epidemic situation will worsen as a global village such a big family the global countries should unite and work together to control the r0 value below 1 75 a retrospective study of patients infected with novel coronavirus in a local hospital in wuhan found that elderly men patients with hypertension and heart disease were more likely to suffer from serious complications with a poor survival prognosis and a high mortality rate which were required close attention 76 the quality of samples determines the sensitivity and specificity of viral nucleic acid detection the virus detection rate of bronchusalveolar lavage fluid is relatively high due to the relatively high viral load in the respiratory tract specimens of infected persons but sampling is difficult to get routine clinical collection of nasopharyngeal swabs blood stool and other samples but the collection of these samples is susceptible to sampling materials sampling sites sampling time and sampling personnels operation therefore it is recommended to test negative specimens for patients with suspicious clinical symptoms multiple times take samples from multiple sites and conduct standard sampling by skilled personnel due to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic there are not enough clinical samples of the detection kits developed by various companies or scientific research insitutions for complete performance confirmation therefore the stability and reliability of various nucleic acid detection kits need to be further verified here it is recommended to use the detection kit containing the control and it should match with the laboratory equipment and extract virus samples in strict accordance with the standard operating procedures of the kit and set up detection procedures the detection personnel should also analyze the situation of the whole amplification curve and the individual amplification curve after amplification and the amplification curve is required to present a single peak specific smooth curve followed by adjusting the detection procedure according to the dissolution curve in addition a reasonable indoor quality control scheme is of vital importance we suggest that one weak positive quality control and three negative quality controls should be set up for each batch of test all three negative quality controls should be negative and weak positive quality control should be positive which is considered as the control of this batch of test otherwise it is out of control and cannot issue a test report if necessary it should be retested for positive results we should ensure that the fluorescence quantitative pcr results of at least two targets 1bane in the test are positive when only one target is positive rechecking and even resampling should be requested as much as possible for the negative results the infection cannot be completely excluded and comprehensive analysis of the patients symptoms medical history and imaging findings is also needed 83 84 standard and reasonable test report is very important for clinicians to make correct judgment with the spread of sars-cov-2 countries all over the world need rapid and effective methods to detect their own people a rapid detection method of crispr-cas12 was found which was mainly used to detected sars-cov-2 in respiratory throat swab with a sensitivity of up to 95 and specificity of 100 31 there are similar colloidal gold immunochromatography side flow immunoassay which can quickly and sensitively detect specific antibodies in the serum 85 in addition to laboratory tests imaging findings are critical for disease diagnosis routine x-ray examination is convenient and quick however because the overlapping images will affect the observation of doctors on the lesions and the sensitivity and specificity are low it is easy to miss diagnosis which has not played an obvious role in this outbreak ct examination is another important imaging examination for respiratory diseases and plays an important role in the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 pneumonia 86 patients infected with sars-cov-2 can be divided into three stages according to their condition the early ct manifestations of the lesion were mainly local lesions patchy segmental distribution and the lesions were mostly seen in the outer 13 lung field and subpleural in the progressive stage ct mainly presents increased lesions with expanded scope involving multiple pulmonary lobes with most of the lower lobes in the critical stage ct mainly presents diffuse lesions lung consolidation distorted structure and white lung in severe cases 37 38 imaging findings of diseases also played a crucial role in early diagnosis which should be paid more attention in the case of epidemic 87 88 in addition to early detection and early diagnosis of the disease early treatment is crucial to the prognosis of the disease since the outbreak many research institutions around the world have been conducting clinical trials using existing potential drugs for in vivo and in vitro research at present there are mainly antiviral drugs anti-inflammatory drugs and some drugs have achieved significant effects but it is still some time before the treatment of covid-19 patients 89 90 studies have shown that ace2 is the receptor for sars-cov-2 to enter cells and ace2 is present in large quantities in human lung and small intestinal epithelial cells which is essential for the spread of the epidemic similarly ace2 is a potential therapeutic target 91 92 it has been found that recombinant human soluble ace2 can inhibit the growth of sars-cov-2 and significantly block the early stage infection of novel coronavirus which is an important discovery for the treatment of patients with new crown disease 93 in addition the use of ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs can provide protection to the cardiovascular and renal systems of covid-19 patients 94 there are many similar therapies that inhibit the action mechanism of s protein and ace2 95 a combination of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir has been recommended for clinical trial in the latest guidelines 96 in addition remdesivir also a broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drug has been shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 cell infection in vitro 89 the first sars-cov-2 patient in the united states showed a marked improvement in symptoms after being treated with rdv which opened the possibility for further clinical application 97 clinical trials of the drug have also been carried out in china which has a large number of infected people favipiravir was approved for the treatment of influenza virus infection in 2014 through the clinical comparison of 200 covid-19 patients it was found that the pneumonia symptoms of the patients receiving favipiravir were significantly improved with no obvious side effects 98 with the increasing number of studies on confirmed cases some drugs with immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects have also been used in the treatment of covid-19 patients studies have found that the hypercoagulable state of blood is related to the severity of the disease an anticoagulant drug dipyridamole dip can inhibit the replication of novel coronavirus significantly improve the condition of severe patients and play a positive role in the treatment of patients 63 chloroquine originally used to treat malaria was found to inhibit the activity of the sars virus in vitro during the sars epidemic mainly by altering the glycosylation of the viral receptor ace2 thereby affecting the virus to invade cells recent studies have shown that the combined application of ridsivir and chloroquine can effectively inhibit the in vitro activity of sars-cov-2 99 in addition chloroquine also has immunomodulatory effects can inhibit the emergence and progression of viral diseases 100 abidol has a broad spectrum antiviral effect on respiratory virus and can also inhibit the activity of sars-cov-2 in vitro 101 currently the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia by abidol has entered into phase 4 clinical trials and is likely to be applied in treatment in the future many studies have shown that steroids can effectively suppress lung inflammation but they can also inhibit the bodys immune response and pathogen clearance 102 steroids were widely used during the sars and mers outbreaks but their side effects also had a huge impact on patients health in the current outbreak of sars-cov-2 the who on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection recommend against the use of steroids unless specifically requested if steroids are used it is necessary to pay attention to monitor blood sugar electrolytes during use and may even appear symptoms of central excitation such as insomnia etc can be symptomatic treatment in general steroid therapy is not recommended in the clinical treatment of sars-cov-2 103 fibrinolytic enzyme levels and increased activity were found in blood tests of confirmed patients in vitro experiments it was found that the serine protease inhibitor tmprss2 could prevent novel coronavirus from entering cells significantly improving the clinical prognosis of patients 104 vaccines are essential for preventing and treating infectious diseases in addition to protecting healthy people from infection in an outbreak vaccines can also help those infected rebuild their immune systems to control or cure the disease currently many research teams are developing new coronavirus vaccines the university of pittsburgh study found a vaccine against sars-cov-2 which in animal studies has shown to make mice produce antibodies against sars-cov-2 and neutralize the virus 105 in addition some medical teams in china are using plasma from infected patients and traditional chinese medicine treatment regimens a study using convalescent plasma therapy found that in four of five infected patients body temperature returned to normal after the infusion of convalescent plasma and in three patients mechanical ventilation was not required after 2 weeks although the number of cases in the study is small and the effect of convalescent plasma therapy still needs to be further verified the effect is quite significant 57 at present there are successful cases of patients with new crowns all over the world but it is difficult to carry out these protocols on a large scale due to the lack of systematic control analysis therefore we look forward to the early development of effective treatments 106 107 in the current situation of rapid spread of the epidemic and there is no special treatment effective epidemic prevention measures to contain the spread of the epidemic is crucial at present chinas sealed measures restrictions on residents travel and traffic control have played a significant role in controlling the spread of the epidemic retrospective studies have found that traffic restrictions have significantly reduced the number of cases outside hubei 108 for china which is celebrating the traditional spring festival the traditional way of commemorating has been changed all live parties have been cancelled all scenic spots have been closed to tourists and crowds have been avoided by all means meanwhile in an effort to prevent further spread of the virus the chinese government paid for the construction of two new hospitals in wuhan in 10 days to treat the infected and sent medical teams across the country to provide support for countries outside china the monitoring of passing tourists has been increased at airports ports and other transportation arteries mainly including temperature detection and symptom screening to avoid the occurrence of imported cases at present chinas epidemic control is relatively stable and its various measures have been copied by other countries 109 although the source and transmission route of sars-cov-2 are not clear enough the main method is still to control the population flow the early detection of cases isolation of cases and isolation of susceptible groups do a good job of disinfection measures to prevent the further spread of the disease in addition to significantly limiting the spread of the disease the closure has also resulted in significant improvements in the citys air quality 110 in the event of a global pandemic unnecessary travel should be avoided in addition to limiting the movement of people and cutting off potential transmission it is also important to protect individual residents from travel in the early stage of the outbreak due to the shutdown of various enterprises insufficient production capacity of medical protective equipment such as masks and protective clothing residents could not buy enough protective equipment or even buy fake protective equipment which could not play a protective role a study of both surgical and cotton masks found that the virus appeared on the outside of the masks and did not completely prevent the virus from spreading so hands must be disinfected when came into contact with the surface of the masks 36 to prevent outbreaks during epidemics it is usually necessary to isolate high-risk groups and areas restrict travel and movement of people and try to avoid transmission between people since the outbreak some measures have been taken all over the world especially in china where there has been a massive quarantine for those who have experienced isolation it is often an unpleasant experience for uninfected people during the period of isolation they lose their freedom lose their security and tend to be impulsive and angry during the period of isolation in various areas there will often be conflicts between residents and epidemic prevention personnel for those who are infected or may be infected they will lose their freedom during the period of isolation be separated from their families and have insufficient understanding of their own illness as a result they are more likely to have psychological problems in severe cases they even give up their lives and commit suicide therefore for large-scale isolation it must be implemented on the basis of adequate measurement in response to the outbreak tens of thousands of infected people in china where quarantine measures were first introduced did not experience mass unrest instead everyone was very cooperative with medical workers people living in isolated homes and interacting with each other have been reported in the global media good mental attitude is also crucial for the recovery of the disease as front-line medical workers during the epidemic period their workload significantly increased and their work risk also significantly increased therefore their mental health needs more attention high intensity medical work lack of rest but also need to undertake some patients do not understand the negative emotions easy to focus on the work poor emotional control and other uncomfortable performance in order to timely understand the psychological health of medical staff the anonymous psychological questionnaire can better help medical staff to solve psychological problems help psychological counseling staff to better reduce pressure enhance the information of medical staff help them relieve psychological pressure and better engage in medical work in a word in order to minimize and avoid psychological and social problems caused by isolation the most important thing is to shorten the isolation time as far as possible the longer the isolation the greater the impact scientific and reasonable isolation period may be able to make people more understanding understanding willing to accept cooperate in addition the quarantined should actively provide more information to the quarantined during the quarantine period and fully understand themselves health conditions and the status of the epidemic control so that the quarantined can reduce fear in addition the quarantined personnel during the period of isolation the loss of economic resources the loss of basic security of life therefore adequate material support is necessary for the quarantined people to meet their basic living needs and provide them with psychological comfort making them more willing to believe that the national community can help them survive the epidemic 111114 the emergence of new infectious diseases is a great challenge to global human health public health and social development in todays society with developed network technology the sharing of epidemic information plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases 115 under the strict epidemic prevention measures the network and new media play an irreplaceable role of traditional media but because cyberspace is a virtual world there are real messages but also false messages some malicious organizations or individuals use false information to cause social panic and hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic at this point the mainstream media needs to clarify in a timely and accurate manner to prevent the situation from getting worse the internet and new media have played a crucial role in the outbreak 1be the first to disclose the epidemic situation and play an early warning role network media workers as social current affairs scouts with keen eyes flexible ears and wise mind constantly monitor the situation around and can be the fastest speed to convey all kinds of news to the public 2assisted traditional media to transmit epidemic information after the outbreak of the epidemic the public has an urgent need for information new online media can disclose information timely accurately and comprehensively and some mainstream media can even invite the authorities to give professional explanations on the epidemic situation to meet the publics information needs 3actively guide public opinion set up a correct value orientation in a sudden outbreak the general public will experience panic and negative behavior to some extent in addition to timely transmission of information mainstream network media can also carry out public opinion guidance help the public correctly understand and analyze events and cultivate the publics psychological bearing capacity sars-cov-2 is a highly transmissible virus that has caused a worldwide epidemic at present there is no specific treatment plan which can only reduce the incidence of new cases by reducing the crowd gathering virus elimination personal protection and other work in the nearly 4 months since the outbreak was discovered more than a million people have been infected worldwide most countries around the world are testing their populations for potential cases isolating them as nearly as possible and preventing the spread of the disease 116 at first it was thought that the virus would disappear in nature as temperatures rose but the current global outbreak appears to be under control with thousands of cases still being diagnosed in many countries every day some scholars predict that sars-cov-2 may persist in nature and may erupt repeatedly each winter 117 in this outbreak china performed very well and actively supported other countries to fight the epidemic after its own outbreak was under control facts have proved that chinas action to close down the city is correct the rapid control of the epidemic cannot be achieved without the joint efforts of the government and the public the whole country and all walks of life have paid a huge price most chinese companies have gradually resumed production and most schools have opened wuhan which had been sealed has reopened to prevent a repeat of the outbreak the chinese government has mandated that all returning workers and students be quarantined for 14 days and that everyone in high-risk areas and occupations be tested for antibodies besides have obvious symptoms of infection the crowd there are a large number of asymptomatic infection although these people themselves in good health but will be coronavirus is positive for nucleic acid detection and these asymptomatic infections can still will infect the others around you the prevention and control of epidemic diseases bring huge challenges only symptomatic infection control is not enough 118121 there are still many difficulties in preventing and controlling the epidemic thousands of people are diagnosed every day in the united states italy russia and other countries as the currently has the largest number of the united states confirmed its domestic unemployment increased many small and medium-sized enterprise bankruptcy the stock market turmoil several historic fusing part of the supply of medical resources cost huge financial resources and forced the united states to increase the printing of dollars this has also had a major impact on countries with dollar reserves with some governments declaring bankruptcy 122 one breath one destiny for all countries in the world only by working together to fight the sars-cov-2 and help each other can we overcome the difficulties and restore prosperity as soon as possible  prediction and evolution of b cell epitopes of surface protein in sars-cov-2 jerome lon r yunmeng bai bingxu zhong fuqaing cai hongli du  the discovery of epitopes is helpful to the development of sars-cov-2 vaccine the sequences of the surface protein of sars-cov-2 and its proximal sequences were obtained by blast the sequences of the whole genome of sars-cov-2 were obtained from the genbank based on the ncbi reference sequence nc0455122 the conformational and linear b cell epitopes of the surface protein were predicted separately by various prediction methods furthermore the conservation of the epitopes the adaptability and other evolutionary characteristics were also analyzed 7 epitopes were predicted including 5 linear epitopes and 2 conformational epitopes one of the linear and one of the conformational were coincide the epitope d mutated easily but the other epitopes were very conservative and the epitope c was the most conservative it is worth mentioning that all of the 6 dominated epitopes were absolutely conservative in nearly 1000 sars-cov-2 genomes and they deserved further study the findings would facilitate the vaccine development had the potential to be directly applied on the treatment in this disease but also have the potential to prevent the possible threats caused by other types of coronavirus  in late december 2019 a novel coronavirus was officially named as sars-cov-2 by world health organizationwho and identified as the pathogen causing outbreaks of sars-like and mers-like illness in chinese city of wuhan which was a zoonotic disease as of march 13 2020  the outbreak of sars-cov-2 has been reported in many areas of the world with more than 130000 people infected 1  with an alarmingly human-to-human transmissibility the reproductive number of sars-cov-2 has been computed to around 328 2  according to the data in ngdcnational genomics data center at 1500gmt8 on march 13 2020 482 genomic variations of sars-cov-2 has been reported which has aroused widespread concern the b cell epitope of viral surface protein can specifically bind to the hosts b cell antigen receptor and induce the body to produce protective antibody and humoral immune response the discovery of epitopes is helpful to the development of sars-cov-2 vaccine and the understanding of sars-cov-2s pathogenesis 3  3 proteins embedded in the virus envelope of sars-cov-2 have been identified spikes protein envelopee protein membranem protein at present due to the lack of study of the crystal structure of surface protein of sars-cov-2 the study of epitopes is timeconsuming power-consuming cost and difficult 4  in this work we analyzed the surface protein of sars-cov-2 predicted the structures with bioinformatics methods on the basis we predicted the linear and conformational b cell epitopes analyzed the conservation of the epitopes the adaptability and other evolutionary characteristics of the surface protein which provided a theoretical basis for the vaccine development and prevention of sars-cov-2 the primary structure and physicochemical properties of the sem protein were analyzed the results revealed that the s protein has an average hydrophilic index of -0079 figure s1a  on the basis of hydrophilicity it also showed amphoteric properties there was an outside-in transmembrane helix in 23 residues from position 1214 th to position 1236 th at the n-terminal figure s2a  the protein instability index was 3301 which revealed the s protein was stable the e protein has an average hydrophilic index of 1128 figure s1b  it was hydrophobic an inside-out transmembrane helix in 23 residues from position 12 th to position 34 th at the n-terminal was predicted figure s2b  the protein instability index was 3868 which revealed the e protein was stable the m protein has an average hydrophilic index of 0446 figure   s1c  on the basis of hydrophobicity it also showed amphoteric properties there were two outside-in transmembrane helices one was in 20 residues from position 20 th to position 39 th  the another one was in 23 residues from position 78 th to position 100 th  and an inside-out transmembrane helix in 20 residues from position 51 st to position 73 rd  at the n-terminal figure s2c  the protein instability index was 3914 which revealed the m protein was stable the optimal template for homology modeling of the s protein of sars-cov-2 was the s protein of sarspdb id 6acc1 with the sequence identity of 7647 and the gmqe score of 073 according to the evaluation of the structure by ramachandran plot figure 1a  993 of the residues were located in the most favoured regions and the allowed regions 07 of the residues were located in the disallowed regions the high-energy regions table 1  which was possibly due to some energy was spent in the protein processing to make these residues enter the high-energy regions 5  the result generally showed that the structure was reliable the structure of s protein figure 1b of sars-cov-2 is a trimer which can be divided into a tightly curled tail and a distributed head the head is mainly composed of -sheet irregular curl and turn which is exposed to the envelope of the virus contributes to the formation of epitopes the tail is mainly composed of several -helices part of which is embedded in the envelope hinders the formation of epitopes the optimal template for homology modeling of the e protein of sars-cov-2 was the e protein of sarspdb id 5x291 with the sequence identity of 9138 and the gmqe score of 073 according to the evaluation of the structure by ramachandran plot figure 1c  100 of the residues were located in the most favoured regions table   1  indicating that the structure was reliable the e protein of sars-cov-2 is a pentamer figure 1d  which can be divided into the concentrated transmembrane part and the head located outside the envelope the head is mainly composed of -helix irregular curl and turn which is exposed to the envelope contributes to the formation of epitopes the tail is mainly composed of long -helix most of which are embedded in the envelope hinders the formation of epitopes the optimal template for homology modeling of the m protein of sars-cov-2 was the effector protein zt-kp6-1pdb id 6qpk 1 a with the sequence identity of 2000 and the gmqe score of 006 the sequence identity between the optimal template and the m protein of sars-cov-2 and the gmqe score are too low so that the template is not suitable for homology modeling all linear b cell epitopes of the surface protein were filtered according to the table s1  and abcpredcut off to 051 table s2  based on the results obtained with these methods and artificial optimization 4 potential linear b cell epitopes of the s protein were predictedtable 2 figure 3a  including 601-605 aa 656-660 aa 676-682 aa 808-813 aa and they were named as the epitope a b c d respectively 1 epitope of the e protein was selected60-65 aa and named as the epitope ftable 2 figure 3c  1 epitope of the m protein was selected 211-215 aa and named as the epitope h table 2  the conformational b cell epitopes of surface protein were predicted with ellipro table s3  and seppa 30 table s4 table 2  it is obvious that the region located on the head of the s protein figure 3b  which is the outside of sars-cov-2 making it easy to form an epitope we selected it as a dominant conformational epitope and named it as the epitope e additionally one conformational b-cell epitope60-65 aa of e protein was predicted table 2  which is consistent with the epitope f of the e protein similarly this region located on the outside figure 3c  we selected it as a dominant conformational epitope and named g however the conformational epitope of the m protein could not be predicted due to the failure of credible homology modeling the consurf server was used to predict epitope conservative sites with the structure of surface proteins and the alignment results in different datasets table s5  all the epitopes of the s e m protein were absolute conservative among all sars-cov-2 sequences table 3a  figure s3a -g to further calculate the conservation of the epitopes in different coronavirus datasets the representative sequences from sars-cov-2 were selected to participate in the human coronavirus dataset and the coronavirus dataset due to amino acid sequences of some s or e or m protein were absolute conservative in sars-cov-2 the conservation was a little lower in human coronavirus than those of in sars-cov-2 table 3b  figure s4a -g and the epitope d was easy to mutate the other epitopes were conservative and the epitope fg was the most conservative one as for the coronavirus table 3c  figure s5a -g in the 5 epitopes of s protein 4 of which obtained the conservative score less than 1 ranging from -0854 to 0256 it showed that the epitope c with the minimum score is the most stable and not easy to mutate besides the score of the epitope d was 1247 showing the relatively high possibility to mutate the epitopes of the e protein were stable with the conservative score less than 1 the site conservation of the m protein could not be predicted due to the failure of credible homology modeling sars-cov-2 caused huge impact to human production living and even life has become a major challenge confronting the whole world development of vaccine is one of the effective means of prevention and treatment of the virus long-term epitope vaccine is the trend of development of vaccine due to the advantages of strong pertinence less toxic and side effects and easy to transportation and storage 6  the determination of epitopes is the basis of the development and application of vaccine and the clinical diagnosis and treatment currently the methods which were mainly used are x-crystal diffraction method immune experiment method and bioinformatics method the first two are time-consuming and laborious the bioinformatics method is gaining more and more credibility among researchers 3 6 7  there are many factors to be considered in the prediction of epitopes by bioinformatics method such as the surface probablity and flexibility of the epitopes at the same time it is necessary to exclude the structurally stable and non-deformable -helix -sheet glycosylation sites which may obscure the epitopes or alter the antigenicity etc 8  even so the predicted epitopes are still inaccurate 4  compared with the current study on sars-cov-2 this work adopted various prediction methods and 3d structure databases developed in recent years which were based on artificial neural network hidden markov modelhmm support vector machinesvm etc such as abcpred bepipred20 seppa 30 iedb etc compared with prediction by a single method 9 or on the basis of epitopes of sars 10  these methods and databases greatly improved the accuracy of prediction and had more bioinformatic meaning we comprehensively analyzed the prediction results from the tools which were widely used set up screening criteria on the basis of primary structure secondary structure and tertiary structure so that the prediction results would more accurate and reliable the s protein the e protein and the m protein are surface proteins of sars-cov-2 which have the potential as antigenic molecules however the current study on the epitopes prediction of sars-cov-2 11  due to the s protein has been reported to be the directly binding molecule of sars-cov-2 to ace2 12  the prediction of epitopes is mainly focusing on the s protein with few studies on the e protein and the m protein in this work we analyzed the s protein the e protein and the m protein predicted their epitopes on the basis 7 b cell epitopes were predicted including 2 conformational and 6 linear b cell epitopes one of the conformational and one of the linear are coincide all of the epitope a b c d located on the surface of the tail of the s protein which is relatively easy to bind the epitope e is located on the head of the s protein which is the key area where the s protein recognizes and binds to ace2 12 13  has the potential to block the infection process the epitope f and the epitope g located on the end of the head of the e protein the two epitopes coincide this may due to they are all consecutive and the secondary structure avoided the -helix and the -sheet the epitope h is derived from the m protein the structure and conservation could not be determined due to the inability to predict reliable structure however it could be known from the surface probablity scores that the epitope h is more likely to be located on the surface of the m protein the higher the conservation score calculated by the consurf server is the more likely the site is to be mutated in the evolutionary process when the score1 the site is likely to be a conservative site when the score is between 1 and 2 the site is a site which is likely to be a relatively easy mutation when the score2 the site is likely to be an easy mutation site 14  in the 7 epitopes obtained all the epitopes of the s e m protein were absolute conservative among all sars-cov-2 sequences for the human coronavirus dataset and the coronavirus dataset only the average conservative score of the epitope d is higher than 1 which is prone to mutation the epitope d should not be used as an epitope of the s protein the conservation of the epitope h could not be calculated by the pdb file the application value of the epitope h needed further experimental verification although the epitopes could be integrally considered to be conservative the independent residues of these epitopes could still easy to mutate except the epitope e all of 6 dominate epitopes contain 1-2 residues which has a conservative score higher than 1 table 3c  indicating that these residues were likely to be easy mutation sites these residues mostly located at the head or the tail of the epitopes therefore the mutation of these residues should be paid attention to and the length of the epitopes should be adjusted according to the actual effect in application the scores of epitopes in different datasets were different which could due to the quantity of sequences in the datasets and the structures were analyzed in different situations in this work we predicted 6 reliable epitopes a b c e fg and h the reliability of the epitopes of the s protein was relatively better than that of the epitopes of the e protein and the m protein indicating that the s protein is still the optimal choice for the prediction of epitopes and the development of vaccine all of the 6 epitopes were able to achieve absolute conservation in sars-cov-2 and to achieve relative conservation in the data set including sars etc therefore the epitopes not only have the potential to be directly applied on the treatment in this disease but also have the potential to prevent the possible threats caused by other types of coronavirus in addition although various factors of prediction were integrated in this work more experimental data are needed to further verify whether all the 6 epitopes can induce the body to produce corresponding antibodies and generate specific humoral immunity due to the limited data set and other factors all of the analysis was based on the ncbi reference sequence nc0455122 we obtained the sequence of s e and m protein and its proximal sequences by blast which got 420 334 and 329 sequences in total from ncbi database respectively we obtained the whole genome sequence of sars-cov-2 from genbank and gisaid959 in total which were used to be a dataset after genome annotation the genome sequences which performed mistakes of translation were deleted the physical and chemical properties of target protein were analyzed by the port-param tool in expasy 15  including the primary structure of the target protein molecular formula theoretical isoelectric point the protein instability indexthe index40 means the protein was stable etc online software protscale was used to deeply analyze the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of target protein and the distribution of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of polypeptide chains 15  sars-cov-2 carried the sem protein through the virus envelope the transmembrane region of the protein was predicted online by tmhmm 20 16  with the amino acid sequences of the surface protein of sars-cov-2 of nc0455122 as templates based on homology modeling method we predicted the 3d structure through the online server swiss-model 17  selected and optimized the optimal structure based on the template identity and gmqe value 17  the rationality of the structure was evaluated by ramachandran plot 18 with pdbsum server the structures were displayed and analyzed by swiss-pdb viewer v410 19  based on the structures the conformational b cell epitopes were predicted by seppa 30 20 and ellipro 21 respectively and the common predicted conformational b cell epitopes from two methods were selected for the further analysis the protean module of dnastar was used to predict the flexibility 21  surface probablity 22 and antigenic index 23 of the target protein of sars-cov-2 the linear b cell epitope was predicted by abcpred 24 and bepipred 20 25 respectively and the common predicted linear b cell epitopes from two methods were selected for the further analysis coupled with the secondary structure the tertiary structure and the glycosylation sites 26 etc the linear b cell epitopes were finally determined based on the pdb model and the multiple alignment result we used the consurf server to analyze the conservation of amino acid sites of the epitopes online 27  the conservation of epitopes on the surface protein of sars-cov-2 was analyzed by multiple alignment with mafft and logo was drawn with weblogo 28 29  24  the tail contains the basic elements required for the membrane fusion the end of the tail is a

what have we learned william wei ignace wai ho kuen   an outbreak of atypical pneumonia was noted in the guangdong province of southern china in the fall of 2002 the pneumonia was highly contagious and affected those who had been in close contact with the patients such as health care workers and family members of the patients the etiologic agent of this atypical pneumonia was not identified initially and in many patients their chest condition rapidly deteriorated and resulted in death1 in late february 2003 the centers for disease control and prevention termed this condition severe acute respiratory syndrome sars1
 in hong kong sars was first seen in a tourist from southern china he was a medical doctor who had been taking care of patients with atypical pneumonia in guangzhou and had had symptoms of a respiratory tract infection for 1 week before checking into a hotel in hong kong this 64-year-old physician died from his chest infection 2 weeks later those other hotel guests staying on the same floor as this medical doctor as well as their visitors contracted the disease through social contacts when the visitors returned to their residences in hong kong they brought with them the disease which led to its dissemination other guests staying at the hotel in hong kongan american-chinese businessman who flew to hanoi vietnam 3 singaporeans and 2 canadiansreturned home which then led to the outbreaks of sars in vietnam singapore and canada2
 the 2 canadians who returned to toronto infected another 6 individuals four of the infected individuals were from the same household and the other 2 were infected while seeking medical treatment at the hospital where other patients were treated 1 at an outpatient clinic and 1 at the emergency department3 contact tracing of 21 germans who had stayed in this hotel during this period was carried out and 1 of them showed laboratory evidence of sars thus environmental contamination should be considered as a possible source of infection4 by early june 2003 the total number of patients affected globally was 8384 and of these 770 had died5
 for a patient who has contracted sars the incubation period ranges from 2 to 16 days the median incubation period is 6 days more than 99 of patients presented with a persistent fever of 38c or higher and approximately 70 had associated chills and rigor a nonproductive cough was noted in 70 of patients and approximately 50 of patients complained of myalgia and dyspnea6 less common symptoms included headaches sputum production sore throats nausea and vomiting and diarrhea7 physical examination of the chest shows inspiratory crepitus and percussion dullness most of which is located in the base of the lungs1 as in all types of atypical pneumonia the respiratory symptoms and clinical features of sars are disproportionately mild compared with the findings of imaging studies indeed less than 25 of patients with atypical pneumonia had upper respiratory tract symptoms gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea were present in 10 of patients8
 common laboratory features included elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels in about 70 of patients lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and hypocalcemia were found in approximately 50 of the patients6 7
 the identification of the etiologic organism among the conventional pathogens from patients with sars was not successful initially eventually a virus belonging to the family coronaviridae was isolated from a lung biopsy specimen and from a nasopharyngeal aspirate subsequent investigations found that patients with sars showed a serologic response to this virus8 the family coronaviridae includes the genus coronavirus and torovirus both of these are rna viruses that are known to cause a variety of diseases in human beings and animals a major cause of the common cold is related to the coronavirus types 229e and oc439 these viruses occasionally are responsible for causing pneumonia in neonates or in elderly debilitated or immunocompromised patients some animal coronaviruses such as the avian infectious bronchitis virus might cause respiratory gastrointestinal or neurologic diseases10 using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique rt-pcr investigators first identified the sequence of a polymerase gene from a coronavirus in the nasopharyngeal aspirate of 1 patient8 with the use of similar techniques the isolation and identification of segments of this viral rna were also confirmed from the throat swabs of patients with sars11 the genome of the sars-associated coronavirus has now been sequenced and this might be useful in the development of an antiviral agent or vaccine12
 imaging studies for patients with sars complements the clinical diagnosis chest radiographs show a ground-glass appearance in the early phase of the infection which rapidly progresses to focal or diffuse patchy involvement of the lung field fig 1
 unilateral pulmonary consolidation is common in the early phase although many of them extend bilaterally when the infection becomes more advanced the radiographic opacities were most evident at 8 to 10 days after the onset of clinical symptoms13 high-resolution computed tomography may show focal or patchy consolidation before the abnormalities are seen on chest radiographs fig 2
 the definition developed by the world health organization for the diagnosis of sars was broadly inclusive and nonspecific table 1
14 with the identification of the new coronavirus15 16 and the rapid sequencing of its genome12 17 new molecular assays were developed for diagnosis these included rt-pcr tests targeting the polymerase gene of the virus and serologic tests using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescent assay to detect the sars-associated coronavirus antibodies the rt-pcr test is sensitive when specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract or stool are used serologic tests are reliable when patients show a rising titer although the seroconversion time lag may be long in some patients18 future research along this line should be directed at the development of a more sensitive test that would detect alternate target genes such as the nucleocapsid gene which is more abundant than the replicase gene of the virus19
 studies have identified coronaviruses genetically similar to those responsible for the sars infection in a number of animal species indigenous to the southern part of china and parts of southeast asia these are the masked palm civet and the raccoon dog another animal the chinese ferret badger also has antibodies against the sars coronavirus these animals are traditionally considered to be delicacies for human consumption in markets throughout southern china20 the infection initially affected those individuals handling slaughtering and selling these animals as food or those individuals preparing the animals and serving them as food the transmission of the viral particles leading to sars infection in patients occurred first through aerosols and droplets from respiratory secretions21 and second through contamination of inanimate materials or objects by infectious respiratory secretions or body fluids such as feces urine saliva and tears22
 the coronavirus survives for 4 days in diarrheal stool and at least for 2 days on plastic surfaces at room temperature it survives for less than 30 minutes in a cultural medium at 56c and for less than 5 minutes in formaldehyde and 75 ethanol23
 as a newly emerging infectious disease sars is highly contagious and on infection of an individual leads to significant morbidity and mortality the route of infection is through the mucosal membranes or conjunctiva the mode of spreading is through direct contact of the virus which is believed to be transported via aerosol and fine droplets this has posed a significant threat to medical and nursing staff caring for these patients especially when the patients are receiving ventilatory support in which frequent suctioning to remove bronchial secretions is mandatory the first index patient in hong kong was admitted on february 22 2003 by april 18 2003 the total number of clinically confirmed patients with sars in hong kong was 1523 of whom 316 207 were health care workers including medical doctors nurses and hospital ward attendants the overall mortality rate was about 15 and it was 3 times higher among patients who had an associated chronic illness postmortem examination of patients who died of sars showed that most had diffuse alveolar damage affecting the lungs the morphological changes identified included bronchial epithelial denudation loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia the increased presence of macrophages and hemaphagocytosis suggests that cytokine dysregulation was responsible for the clinical picture24 the therapeutic regimens developed included the combined use of an antiviral agent ribavirin and pulsed methylprednisolone more than 50 of patients showed a rapid and sustained response and 45 showed steady improvement with these management strategies25 with this treatment regimen the associated morbidity was acceptable and the patient mortality rate was markedly reduced it has been reported that viral dna is present in the aerosol generated by co2 lasers used to treat papillomavirus-infected verrucae26 recent studies27 have shown that these viral particles are infective and may be responsible for the transmission of disease thus generation of aerosol should be reduced to a minimum during the care of patients with sars so that transmission of the coronavirus can be prevented the size of aerosols considered to carry particles in a hospital environment is 03 to 05 m28 and filters used to trap particles in the plume generated by laser therapy are 022 m29 for health care workers taking care of patients with sars one piece of personal protective equipment is the n95 mask which will filter 95 of particles 01 to 03 m30
 the effort to reduce the spread of disease through direct contact or droplet contact in hospitals managing these patients involved generating implementing and enforcing a series of guidelines31 these included the identification and reporting of affected patients dissemination of information to the public enforcement of infection control measures development of diagnostic tests evaluation of therapeutic regimens and the coordination of clinical services these measures are primarily directed at tracing and isolating the contact of patients as soon as possible before they spread the virus further32
 the various measures used to prevent transmission of infection by direct contact include the use of gloves surgical masks gowns goggles n95 masks face shields and total body coverings such as barrier man suits the choice of personal protective equipment has to balance the need for adequate protection with the need to easily move and carry out various procedures during patient care wearing masks gowns and gloves and frequent washing of hands were adequate in significantly reducing the risk of cross-infection during the care of patients with sars33
 overall about 20 of patients infected with sars require endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support during the course of the disease the risk of disease transmission at the time of intubation is quite significant34 necessary precautions must be taken when caring for these patients who require the use of a ventilator the risk of being infected with sars when carrying out surgical procedures such as tracheostomies or other emergency operations for infected patients is high measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission during surgery in the wards and intensive care units icus designated for the management of patients with sars or suspected sars space must be adequate between beds to reduce the chance of direct or indirect contact if possible a screen should be placed between the beds this will reduce the transmission of the coronavirus and the spread of disease airflow in these wards and icus should have a negative pressure gradient that is the current of air flow should be directed from the outside to the interior of the rooms thus reducing the transmission of droplets to other areas in the hospital a designated air outlet should be constructed to release air from the ward or icu to an uninhabited space within the hospital compound nursing staff should wear water impermeable caps gowns and goggles and should wash hands frequently gloves should be worn only when carrying out an assigned procedure and should be removed when the procedure is completed all personal protective equipment should be disposed of properly after it has been used when a patient needs ventilatory support in the icu suction of the tracheobronchial tree should be carried out with a closed suction system viral filters should be placed at the exhaust end of the ventilator system to prevent the dissemination of infected material to the rest of the system a separate operating suite should be designated for patients with sars or suspected sars so that transmission of the infection to other patients who need an operative procedure can be avoided the ventilation system of the operating room should also have a negative pressure gradient so that a controlled flow of air is allowed into the operating room from outside and is then directed to a designated exhaust which will reduce the transmission of droplets to health care workers in the operating room surgeons carrying out an operation on a patient with sars are advised to wear caps n95 masks goggles gowns gloves and face shields at the completion of the surgical procedure this protective equipment should be removed gently and smoothly in the reverse order of how it was put on careful removal of personal protective equipment is essential otherwise surgeons might contaminate themselves with the virus found on the outside of this protective equipment during the removal process the use of equipment that produces aerosols or droplets should be limited as it might contribute to the spread of the virus this kind of equipment includes nebulizers suction devices and flexible endoscopes used for the examination of the upper aerodigestive tract nebulizers should not be used at all and the use of suction devices should be limited if necessary a closed suction system device should be used viral filters should be used whenever applicable so that the chance of spreading droplets and viral particles is reduced endoscopic examinations in particular nasopharyngoscopy and bronchoscopy should be performed only when absolutely necessary because the instruments used in these procedures have suction systems that produce aerosols that could contribute to the spread of the virus endotracheal intubation of a patient with sars is risky for health care workers21 the physician and nursing staff should wear full protective equipment caps n95 masks goggles gowns gloves and face shields patients should receive adequate oxygen before being completely paralyzed and immobilized at the time of endotracheal intubation the use of suction devices should be minimized and viral filters should be used whenever applicable flexible bronchoscope-assisted intubation is not advisable the surgeon contributes to airway management in the following 3 circumstances
1perform a tracheostomy for patients with sars in need of a ventilator2when on standby for an expectedly difficult intubation in a patient with sars3when attending a failed emergency intubation in a patient with sars
 when indicated in a patient who is receiving mechanical ventilation a surgical airway should ideally be done as an elective tracheostomy for an expectedly difficult intubation a surgeon should be on standby in readiness for immediate intervention if needed in the case of failed attempts at emergency intubation the surgeon is called on for urgent surgical airway insertion35
 the staff of the tracheostomy team should include 1 surgeon 1 intensivist or anesthetist and 1 standby staff member either a physician or a nurse every member of the team should wear full personal protective equipment including a cap an n95 mask goggles a gown gloves and a face shield surgeons should wear an additional pair of gloves and surgical boots they should also wear 1 disposable water-impermeable surgical gown next to the body and a second water-impermeable gown externally the patient should receive adequate oxygenation before the procedure and then should be completely paralyzed to abolish any movement especially reflex coughing during the incision on the trachea and during the insertion of the tracheotomy tube all forms of assisted ventilation must be stopped before the tracheotomy open suction for tracheal secretions should not be used and diathermy should be used sparingly jet ventilation is prohibited under these circumstances in case of a failed endotracheal intubation either electively or under emergency conditions manual ventilation with a tight mask is given until the patient has attained adequate oxygenation the surgeon can then decide on either a cricothyroidotomy or a tracheostomy caused by the coronavirus sars was a new disease in early 2003 initially there was much controversy concerning the diagnosis patient management and isolation strategies in hong kong the total number of patients who were admitted to hospitals because of sars was 1755 and 299 of them died of the disease among those who died 8 were health care workers these included 4 physicians 1 nurse and 3 other hospital support staff after the epidemic 3 official inquiries were carried out by the government and related authorities these have led to the resignations of the secretary for health welfare and food and the chairman of the hospital authority who are responsible for the management of public hospitals in hong kong during the epidemic the people of hong kong became acutely aware of public heath the hygienic status of their living environment and the importance of the nature and devastation of this infectious disease this alertness has continued to the present and has helped to make hong kong a much healthier city  anthropocenic war coronavirus and total demobilization william merrin   on 23 august 1793 facing possible defeat in its revolutionary wars with austria prussia spain britain and the united provinces as well as internal insurrections the french national convention issued a leve en masse its opening point declaredfrom this moment until that in which the enemy shall have been driven from the soil of the republic all frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the service of the armies the young men shall go to battle the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions the women shall make tents and clothing and shall serve in the hospitals the children shall turn old linen into lint the aged shall betake themselves to the public places in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach the hatred of kings and the unity of the republichalsall 2020
this call for mass conscription literally a mass uprising would transform the french military replacing the professional army within the year with a vast national army of 800000 trained soldiers made up of citizens but the leve meant more than the creation of a mass army being built on two key ideas the first was a new relationship to the state with an implicit post-revolutionary compact whereby all those united and protected as citizens owed a similar duty of protection to the state from now on the body of the citizen was intimately tied to the survival of the body politic the second following from this was that the entire society would be mobilized to support the military as ernst junger notes here the image of war as armed combat merges into the more extended image of a gigantic labour process now the military army is joined byand tothe modern armies of commerce transport foodstuff and munitions until there is no longer any movement whatsoeverbe it that of the homeworker at her sewing machinewithout at least indirect use for the battlefield junger 1991 126 the leve-en-masse transformed warfare with conscription and mass armies becoming common and during conflict states increasingly transforming themselves into war-time economies diverting huge resources to military service wwi saw the fruition of these processes with the mass mobilization of populations for mass warfare supported by the mass mobilization of home industries for some this mobilization was insufficient in his 1930 essay total mobilization ernst junger complained of germanys only partial mobilization 1991 125 for revolutionary conservatives like junger true greatness required a total mobilization with its unlimited marshalling of potential energies a mobilization that requires extension to the deepest marrow 1991 126 this mobilization was itself a reflection of the kinetic rhythms of the machine ageit suffices simply to consider our daily life with its inexorability and merciless discipline its smoking glowing districts the physics and metaphysics of its commerce its motors airplanes and burgeoning cities with a pleasure-tinged horror we sense that here not a single atom is not in motionthat we are profoundly inscribed in this raging process total mobilization is far less consummated than it consummates itself in war and peace it expresses the secret and inexorable claim to which our life in the age of masses and machines subjects us1991 128
the totally mobilized peace of modernity therefore prefigured and produced the total mobilization of modern war jungers hopes for a new german youth who would throw themselves into this project of renewal-through-mobilization soon found its expression in nazisms blitzkrieg and the total mobilization of wwii that definitively erased the difference between civilian life and military action though conscription continued in the west in the post-war period gradually the experience of war changed for its populations becoming more remote from everyday life by the time of the 1991 gulf war smaller professional armies dominated again defined now by their total mobilization not of men but of technologies by then war itself was in crisis in the west with questions being asked as to whether western societies could sustain casualties and still support military action the solution was a new phase in the history of mobilization with the military and media collaborating in the gulf to produce and disseminate the global spectacle domestic populations would now be mobilized as its audience in this new leve-en-masse-medias the publics role was to watch television to consume the war to follow the press briefings marvel at the smart-bomb footage and clean war and applaud the military operation in this new imploded home front war now meant enjoying the scopic pleasures of a video-game war taylor 1998 75 knightley 2000 483 with little risk for western combatants and none at all for its viewers a steve bell cartoon of the time showed a penguin grandfather replying to his grandchilds question of what he did in the war with me i watched television and im proud of it merrin 2019 24 it was a model of war and mass-media mobilization that would dominate in the west in the following decades through kosovo in 1999 afghanistan in 2001 and iraq in 2003 albeit one increasingly left behind as the war on terror developed with the move to unseen drone strikes and special-forces operations it was better if no-one knew what was happening hence the public were effectively stood down that demobilization would last until the 2020 covid-19 lockdown which inaugurated a new era of totaldemobilization when the 2020 coronavirus pandemic broke political leaders immediately reached for military metaphors xi jinping vowed to wage a peoples war on the virus in a speech on 16 march emmanuel macron repeatedly declared france was at war on 17 march italys special commissioner for the coronavirus emergency called for a war-time economy on 18 march donald trump presented himself as a war-time president in his 23 march address to the nation uk pm boris johnson told the public this was a fight in which every one of us is directly enlisted whilst on 6 april the us surgeon general warned of the pearl harbour moment coming for this generation see serhan 2020 momtaz 2020 woodward 2020 of course as many equally quickly pointed out war metaphors were neither accurate or helpful as war is a purely human phenomenon representing a clash of wills to which a human solution is always possible whilst the victims deaths did not represent a personal failure to fight serhan 2020 freedman notes all this but nevertheless suggests there are similarities between pandemics and war especially if a realistic view of modern war is adopted in terms of effects and governmental responses freedman 2020 but perhaps we can go even further perhaps our concept of war itself needs redefining perhaps biologically this is a war in 2000 the atmospheric chemist paul crutzen declared we are in the anthropocene ellis 2018 1a proposed new era marking the impact of humanity on the world distinguished from the holocene by the record of human activity in the geological strata we have long known that humans have transformed the world and have done so since hunter-gathering times but recent decades have seen a growing awareness that the scale and speed of human transformation has exponentially increased though the concept of the anthropocene remains controversial with disagreements as to what geological records to accept and when the anthropocene began with the mid-twentieth century being seen by many as a key moment the broader trends it identifies in climate change systemic pollution the transformation of habitats and ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity are beyond dispute there is of course a long history of pandemics and plagues stretching from the earliest time through outbreaks like leprosy in eleventh-century europe the black death in mid-fourteenth-century europe the first of seven cholera pandemics in 1817 the chinese plague from 1855 the 1875 fiji measles pandemic the 1889 russian flu the 1918 spanish flu the 1957 asian flu aidshiv after 1981 through to contemporary outbreaks such as sars many were spread by human activity and can thus be seen to have an anthropogenic element perhaps the most famous example here is the fifteenthsixteenth-century columbian exchange which included the transferral of small pox and other diseases to the americas killing up to 56 m people and eradicating entire civilizations ellis 2018 9596 the global risk of a new pandemic had been known for decades even appearing in popular culture the first episode of the bbcs 1975 show survivors opened with a flu virus escaping an asian laboratory globally spreading via air travel and ending 50 minutes later with 99 of the worlds population dead health organization warnings of a global influenza pandemic became common over the following decades being reinforced by the outbreak of sars november 2002may 2004 and mers from april 2012 and again in 2015 and 2018 in september 2019 the global preparedness monitoring board gpmb report a world at risk claimedthere is a very real threat of a rapidly moving highly lethal pandemic of a respiratory pathogen killing 5080 million people and wiping out nearly 5 of the worlds economy a global pandemic on that scale would be catastrophic creating widespread havoc instability and insecurity the world is not prepared  mongin 2020
meanwhile every year the world health organization who has released its threats to global health report with the threat of a global influenza pandemic appearing in its top-ten list in 2019 who 2019 covid-19 proved to be an equivalent threat launching its own microbiological assault on the human system like many pandemics its scale impact and potential long-term effects eclipsed that of many wars on 5 april the total uk hospital deaths reached 5373 itv 2020 a figure exceeding in just over a month the death toll of british military servicemen across all conflicts since 1945 with the 9 april hospital toll of 980 deaths tidman 2020 the uk lost more lives in 1 day than servicemen killed in the near-38-year northern ireland deployment or than were lost in the falklands war gulf war kosovo war afghanistan war and iraq war put together in the usa on 29 april the death toll of 58964 exceeded within months the us death toll in the decades-long vietnam war the deadliest day of that war 31 january 1968 saw only 246 servicemen killed compared to days such as 8 may when the usa reported 2746 dead mulraney 2020 by 14 may more americans had died from covid-19 over 75000 than in the vietnam afghanistan and iraq wars put together 65096 bbc 2020i where baudrillard in 1991 explained how the war in the gulf was really a nonwar baudrillard 1995 here the nonwar of covid-19 had all the appearance of a war in its casualties impact and long-term implications as a global biological attack on the entire species the covid-19 pandemic is essentially anthropogenic as a zoonotic disease most likely arising out of changes in habitat and interaction with humans whilst the wuhan wet market is not the proven source of the outbreak these markets are an important example of humanly created transmissible environments though the dating of the anthropocene is still open and though earlier anthropogenic pandemics have existed we can see that covid-19 is the first global pandemic requiring a truly global response since our recognition of the anthropocene it is the first anthropocenic world war covid-19 was intimately linked with globalization and the hyperconnected economy wuhan a city of 11 million is a major transportation hub a centre of manufacturing and as part of the post-2004 rise of central china plan a hub of hi-tech production and research benefitting from the movement of rural workers to urban centres the growth of cheap industrial labour and developments in it communications transport and shipping it is closely tied to the global economy and globalization liu 2020 even the wet market was linked to globalization in serving both the growing working population and in its trade in exotic animals for the wealthy despite this global character few in the west understood the risks western exceptionalism the belief that the virus would be contained in asia and the unthinkability of similar restrictions meant the threat was ignored those hit first were the countries most connected to china and the most globally connected with its spread the global system itself went into lockdown global travel stopped travel restrictions and quarantine were imposed and each nation forced its populations indoors with it came a lockdown on international relations the usiran hostility that only weeks earlier many feared would escalate into world war iii bogart 2020 was now forgotten with trump warning against any resumption barnes 2020 conflict shifted instead into posturing and soft power from trumps insistence on calling it the chinese virus and attacks on the who as pro-chinese al jazeera 2020 shear 2020 to chinas post-lockdown reframing of themselves as benevolent global providers of ppe the economist 2020 the lockdown of the international order was also a lockdown of events at least as far as national audiences were concerned as covid-19 crowded out all other news the only international news of note was how other nations were coping with their own lockdowns the global system of communications was ruptured by the virus a system defined by motionby the hypercirculation of goods commodities people money data and communicationswas fundamentally interrupted slowed down and even paused forced in its extremes into idleness into furlough even hyperredundancy the whole remained in motion but with its systems disruptedwith employment and consumption locked-downit lacked both its meaning and the means to complete its circuits the greatest symbol of this pause of the global was the fate of oil the source of fuel for all global transport and motion demand crashed in the global lockdown and on 20 april for the first time ever the price of us oil went negative falling from 18 a barrel to 38 ambrose 2020a crucially the cause of that crash was not simply the lack of demand but the immobility of the oil itself as places to store the oversupply ran out now tankers that a few weeks earlier were crossing the world laden with up to 2 m barrels sat motionless around the coasts of the world full of the very means of movement itself ambrose 2020b war at its heart is motion paul virilio the theorist of dromocracy is fond of quoting sun tzus claim speed is the essence of war as well as frederick the greats dictum to win is to advance virilio 1986 13355 indeed wars violence is first of all the violence of movement itselfthe speed of assaultrecall again sun tzu the onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course sun tzu 2020 ch5 part 12 war therefore is the rapid transferral of bodies and energies from one point in space and time to another point already occupied by other bodies with the aim of displacing or destroying them it is a kinetic phenomenon with the destructive force and character of a projectile one that begins and ends with movement with mobilization and demobilization in the covid-19 world war however the entire war was demobilization within each nation the mass of the population was immediately demobilized being asked to do nothing to not leave the house to not move and to remain essentially inactive in a reversal of the leve-en-masse and of jungers call for total mobilization this global species-wide world war produced instead the total demobilization of the population the essence of war reverses here from speed into immobility and inertia whereas in modern societies junger suggests not a single atom is not in motion ours immediately dedicated itself to eradicating it if for virilio the speed of contemporary weapons technologies brings an advantage over the enemy in allowing us to gain fractions of seconds 1986 137 this was a war that worked in the opposite direction with demobilization hoping to gain weeks even months worth of advantage whereas marinetti proclaimed that the futurists would glorify war describing it as the worlds only hygiene marinetti 2009 22 here the proto-fascists desire to destroy human life reversed into a new defence of the human against covid-19 for today for the period of viral infection hygiene became the worlds only war if this was the potential end of the species it was a curious apocalypse lacking in the west at least the pain violence and collapse of civilization we had expected here for many the end was merely an entropic sloth anaesthetized with alcohol and marked by longer hair weight gain and binge watching this was the apocalypse as a dull sunday afternoonas alan partridges famous appeal to the heavens sunday bloody sunday brand 2014 for virilio when wwi ended as a war of spaceas a war of movementbogged down in the stalemate of the trenches it became instead a war of attrition a war of time where duration was survival 1986 525356 this was our fate too with the lockdown closing down space and movement this world war was turned into a war of time with duration again representing survival to live meant to bunker-down to cut oneself off from space and survive time life was reduced to endurance and especially to the endurance of oneself with the national invasion of the virus and the lockdown of events there emerged instead a global civilwar each infected nation withdrew closed itself off and declared their own war on the virus to win it each nation had first of all to wage war on human life itselfon our very being-in-the-world this global legal lockdown was historically unprecedented whole nations immediately transformed themselves into carceral societiesor rather in our compliance into self-incarcerated societies this was a self-imposed house-arrest a concept to be understood only secondarily in its legal sense for the word arrest means first of all to cause to stop from the late fourteenth-century-old french arester to stay stop with its roots in the latin arrestare meaning to stop restrain and this was our primary experience this stopping is traditionally a punishment as the arrested person is imprisoned and refused space to move whilst motionlessness has also been used as torturecentral to the enhanced interrogation techniques used against iraqi prisoners at abu ghraib for example were stress positions handcuffing people into painful prolonged immobility here therefore we put ourselves under house arrest we stopped ourselves locked ourselves in and placed ourselves into stress positions torturing the public body for weeks with enforced immobility or perhaps this was more medieval in toneresponding to the plague-like miasmic threat with a self-siege warfare with each individual retreating behind their walls to hold out with their stores this atmospheric element is important sloterdijks 2002 book terror from the air explores the movement in the twentieth century from targeting the body to targeting the environment and the new military climatology that resulted sloterdijk 2009 19 following heidegger he emphasizes how our being-in-the-world was always a being-in-the-air or more exactly a being-in-the-breathable 2009 48 tracing how chemical warfare nazi gas chambers and nuclear weapons created an unliveable milieu 2009 16 devastating the life world 2009 55 for virilio similarly the new climactic reality of environmental warfare and bombardment in wwii led in response to the discovery of the bunker formour new survival machines virilio 1994 39 just as there are two times the time of peace and the time of declared war virilio argues there are two atmospheres and not just one those we can breathe in and those which kill us 1994 42 hence bunkers became a shelter for man in this critical period the place where he buries himself to subsist 1994 46 so in this lockdown the terror from the air became a terror of the air and military bunker architecture was democratized and generalized to all as we locked ourselves in our casement literally a strong-house 1994 46 being-in-the-world became being-in-the-bunker with sloterdijks claim that we are condemned to being-in  describing now not only the fatality of phenomenological reality but the fate of the body within an unbreathable world there was something dystopian about the resulting exodus from public space echoing science-fiction warnings of abandoned landscapes from the domed bunker cities of logans run and blakes 7 set on a ruined earth to the environmental catastrophes of ballards the drowned world and the drought to the emptied urban landscapes of the twilight zones where is everybody wyndhams the day of the triffids i am legend and the walking dead but this was a dream our military had long planned for us during the cold war samuel cohen helped invent the neutron bomb an enhanced radiation weapon erw which he claimed was more humane in killing fewer humans and leaving buildings intact strauss 2014 covid-19 had a curiously similar effect the explosion of this enhanced biological weapon and our desperate bunkerization showing us a world without us in it stories spread of the environments recoverythe reduction in

survival machines it was a self-burial anticipated in em forsters 1909 novella the machine stops which tells the dystopian tale of a future humanity locked into vast underground honeycomb tiers of individual hexagonal cells cut off from the real world with fully automated services and tubes and screens bringing everything to the immobilized individual under the aegis of a single networked

friends 2013 50 it is a world that is instantly recognizable this is the world too of virilios terminal citizen virilio 1997 21 we pass virilio says from a society of speed to a society of immobility and inertia 1997 20 moving with the transmission revolution to the final human vehicle the static audio-visual vehicle the body terminal of that interactive being who is both transmitter and receiver 1997 21 11 for virilio this immobilized generalized interactivity 1997 21 is a threat to our experiencepaul klee hit the nail on the head to define the present in isolation is to kill it this is what the teletechnologies of real-time are doing they are killing present time by isolating it from its here and now in favour of a commutative elsewhere that no longer has anything to do with our concrete presence in the world but is the elsewhere of a discreet telepresence that remains a complete mystery1997 1011
it is hard to read this without thinking of our lockdown in an isolated hyperextended present disconnected from the real experience of time and space and engaging through real-time interfaces for virilio this loss of the terrestrial body has another theological meaning as the loss of motion animathe root of animation is also the loss of our soul latin anima 1997 25 hence the body terminal in only being mobile on the spot 1997 20 is fundamentally a terminal body in committing us to this condition therefore the lockdown saved lives by killing life our survival machines became our sarcophagi ultimately threatening to be more dangerous than going out as virilio says stasis is death 1986 67 the key battleground in this war against covid-19 was the reversed home front of everyday life where previously the front line was the battlefield supported by logistics and medical aid with the home front far removed now the home-front was the battlefield with the front line even reversing behind this to encompass the medical and logistical workers the health and care staff and gig-economy workers who risked their lives to keep the home front alive in recognition of this service uk tabloid the sun began a campaign to award the george cross media for gallantry to the nhs itself fairbairn 2020 everyday life had long been theorized by post-war western marxists as a key site of ideological contestation and a space requiring liberation lefebvre 2014 2016 vaneigem 1994 marx in the german ideology famously ruminated on the future eradication of the division of labour for a life allowing one to hunt fish rear-cattle and criticize as one wished without ever becoming hunter fisherman herdsman or critic marx 2020 whilst the situationists dreamed of a liberation from drudgery and the opportunity for self-realization as raoul vaneigem convincingly explainsin an industrial society which confuses work and productivity the necessity of producing has always been an enemy of the desire to create what spark of humanity of possible creativity can remain alive in a being dragged out of sleep at six every morning jolted about in suburban trains deafened by the racket of machinery bleached and steamed by meaningless sounds and gestures spun dry by statistical controls and tossed out at the end of the day into the entrance halls of railway stations those cathedrals of departure for the hell of weekdays and the nugatory paradise of weekends where the crowd communes in a brutish weariness from adolescence to retirement each twenty-four hour cycle repeats the same shattering bombardment vaneigem 1994 52
against this bombardment vaneigem hymned the rage to live but covid-19 perhaps exposed these dreams though some spent their time refining their craft skills for most the experience of liberation from

self-isolation sartres hell is  other people reversed itself upon ourselves sartre 2000 223 what saved us from the entropic death of bunkerized terminalboredom was our activity our participation in this civil war this was a complex intra-state conflict defined not only by the fight of the human body and the body politic with the virus but also by the division within the population between those promoting demobilization and those resisting it unlike in 1991 where the gulf war leve-en-masse-medias mobilized the far-removed western public as audiences in this imploded home-front-line the web 20 revolution transformed us into active participants in the war into vital keyboard warriors whose primary targets were not the virus but each other in the uk this meant the devotion of the public to the creation of both feel-good and disciplinary propaganda here the uk public joined the government and media in producing and sharing heart-warming humorous and human-interest stories as well as memes gifs inspirational quotes and videos to raise war-time morale hence the endless media and social media paid attention to pensioners walking up stairs to raise money captain tom walking round his garden care-home residents singing and public applause for health workers young 2020 bbc 2020a kiddey 2020 robertson 2020 in this war-time lockdown a simulacral blitz-spirit dominated uk sentiment

broadcasting company afraid of losing its licence in 1926 took the opportunity of the general strike to secure its future by turning itself into a compliant government mouthpiece williams 1998 98101 so too in 2020 did a bbc that only weeks earlier was facing an existential threat to its service and funding barker and di stefano 2020 take the opportunity of covid-19 to demonstrate its value as a

hypermobilized telepresent producer of our own informational civil war deploying our personal arms of communication against the covidiot enemy this informational civil war included the online battle

had an important on-the-ground reality virilios theory of dromocracy of governments of speed suggests different speed classesdifferent orders of speed 1986 119exist hence the lockdown class division between those who did not have to move and those who did the health and care workers delivery drivers and warehouse and retail workers who faced the risk of exposure and death and hence the division too between those for whom money continued to move into their accounts and those for whom it stopped then there were the other inequalities in the civil war with higher death rates for those in poorer

30 april beckett 2020 liptak 2020 ongoing anti-lockdown protests encouraged by trump were increasingly dominated by far-right militia groups and conspiracists prompting fears of serious political violence perkins 2020 whilst trumps critics saw his handling of the crisis as a disaster in fact he was playing to his strengths what trump achieved was to transform the covid-19 civil war into an extension of his already successful political and cultural civil war against the american people and its democratic institutions this was politics as a continuation of civil war by identical means in his 1990 essay postscript on the societies of control gilles deleuze argues we have left behind the nineteenth-century foucauldian disciplinary societies and moved to new societies of control deleuze 1992 34 we have passed from societies defined by concentration enclosure and the disciplinary power of incarcerationto new computer 1992 6 and code-based 1992 5 technologies and systems whose modulation 1992 4 allows continuous forms of control 1992 7 his example of this in practice is guattaris suggestion of a control mechanism able to track an individual around a city in real time with electronic systems modulating behaviour by giving or withdrawing access 1992 7 in the space of months we repeated this historical trajectory turning first back into societies of incarceration before our gradual remobilizationpassing back out into the world through the continuous controls of digital surveillance this was not easy recent years had seen the systematic pathologization of the internet as the optimism of web 20s participative society gave way to an antipathy to public over-participation and fear of manipulation by the time covid-19 hit the internet was seen as an out-of-control toxic realm of trolling abuse death threats hate speech political extremism populism russian hacking information warfare and disinformation fake news electoral manipulation by paid targeted advertising cybercrime government surveillance and mass-harvested personal data with few privacy protections almost overnight this reversed again with the real world and human relations becoming toxic and the internet being transformed into our saviour allowing safe work education entertainment and communication within weeks we became like the cell-bound inhabitants of forsters tale afraid of human contact the outside world was no longer a site of possible risk but instead was absolutely impure the sacred caillois writes is always more or less what one cannot approach without dying 2001 21 and this was how we now treated life the arbitrary 2 m distancing was treated as a meeting point between the safe profane and the sacred world of contagion impurity and death to get close to another was not simply a risk it was a passage between orders of being hence remobilization was more difficult and anxious than demobilization in the uk the relaxation of restrictions was confusing and the suggestion that some could return to work emphasized the reality of speed classes with middle classes more able to remain at home teleworking whilst the working classes had to take their chances with public transport and work jones 2020 despite the most effective model of remobilization being the labour-intensive process of mass testing contact tracing and isolation many nations preferred technological solutionism embracing the continuous controls of digital surveillance with electronic tagging replacing house arrest china pioneered this approach as a logical extension of their massive near-ubiquitous surveillance system deployed against the uighurs in xinjiang wall street journal 2017 byler 2019 and the social credit systems and facial-recognition cameras used against their domestic populations mistreanu 2018 dudley 2020 here cctv facial recognition drones qr codes location tracking by telecoms and technology companies and voluntary or mandatory apps formed a network of sensors enmeshing individuals in exactly that city-wide control-mechanism guattari foresaw the same systems were widely adopted beyond china highlighting an underlying trend within global political systems the movement of all governments towards informational totalitarianism we are still too bewitched by twentieth-century totalitarianismdistracted by the spectacle uniforms speeches and rallies the symbolism and the public terror nazi germany stalinist ussr maoist china were all hypervisible aesthetically organized states aiming to abolish the separation of public and private life to lay everything open to its eyeespecially by forceand fulfil mussolinis dreams of totalitario all within the state nothing outside the state none against the state now at a historical distance from its political theatrics the essence of totalitarianism is finally revealed it is about the right of the state to penetrateto overseethe totality of life within it this is clearly an informational project stripped of its politico-aesthetics and aided by the rise of digital technology it reverses now from spectacle to secrecy and from public to private to silently access monitor and evaluate every aspect of personal interiority and singularity hence totalitarianism quietly fulfils itself today as an ideology of transparency of absolute recording access and exposure it is freed here not only from the burden of terror the manpower of policing and the cost of costumery but most importantly from ties to any political system or ideology existing simply as the technocratic aim and result of digital systems today therefore even western liberal democracies are informationally totalitarian in their mass surveillance their treatment of personal data and their systems of monitoring and control in their desireno different to that of authoritarian regimesto access everything and their absolute conviction that they have the right to do so once again this is for our benefitwhat was once for our security is now for public healthbut it nevertheless remains an internal attack on the data integrity of the states own citizens the us and uk governments had joked about this archly naming two of their spy programmes bullrun and edgehill after civil war battles ball et al 2013 that data civil war against private data has continued without a pause since snowdens revelations and it is likely that the advances allowed by the covid-19 crisis will never be rolled back the heart of the post-covid-19 new normal therefore will not be the physical regimes of cleanliness and distancing but the new data regime we thought this had already been accomplished in the existing system of surveillance capitalism zuboff 2019 but covid-19 will supercharge this process representing the moment when our public and private spaces and lives imploded opening up previously limited areas for total data colonization as naomi klein argues the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives but as a living laboratory for a permanentand highly profitableno-touch future it is a future in which our homes are never again exclusively personal spaces but are also via high-speed digital connectivity our schools our doctors offices our gyms and if determined by the state our jails klein 2020 it is the future of the bunkerized terminal citizen with an increasing reliance on internet and phone infrastructures and remotely delivered services and systems delivering ever-greater quantities of personal data to private companies and states the work of remobilization will be one of the great state projects of our lifetime the movement of bodies out of homes of labour into the work place of the market back to life and the recirculation of capital will require great effort the cardiac-arrest of capitalismsaved in the uk only through the effective nationalization of the economy and a simulacral-communist state responsibility for the economic and physical welfare of the populationwill require a massive defibrillation of the economy to shock it back to life but there are doubts as to how fast this can be achieved the imf has warned that the world faces the worst recession since the great depression bbc 2020j or for the uk for 300 years morris 2020 whilst the who warns that covid-19 may never go away bbc 2020k with this economic slowdown the covid-19 civil wars will continue to be fought within each nation for years to come the remobilization of the world order will also be difficult on 7 may trump commented that impact of the coronavirus on the usa was worse than pearl harbor  worse than the world trade center bbc 2020l judged by casualties this is certainly true the 73573 coronavirus deaths by 7 may far eclipsed the 2403 deaths at pearl harbor or 2977 killed in 911 but the meaning of those events really lay in their political significance and impact on the world order if we consider the global scale of this pandemic the global lockdown of populations the global death toll the halt to economic and international relations and the differential and ongoing impact of the virus we can see that covid-19 may prove an event of equally or potentially greater historical significance there was pre-covid-19 and there was the time after its first great wave the hyperconnected world of global travel and contact will take a long time to recover and as with domestic life much that can be transferred online will be international conflict will not end but one possibility is nations will be more inward looking and less interested in others on 12 may it was revealed for example that the uks national security council had not met since january with the government focused on covid-19 sabbagh 2020 military action may be more difficult with the expected slashing of military budgets and a possible mindset that might resent spending on international action or aid when the domestic economy remains to be fixed warrell 2020 the emphasis may shift therefore to strengthening the national and civilian infrastructure in anticipation of future human or human-created threats military action is also physically difficult right now with the need for social distancing impacting on military bases ships and submarines on training and exercises and parades and future operations but that is why we can expect an acceleration of one particular trend in warfare since the 1991 gulf war with the allied air supremacy that allowed them to bomb with utter impunity through the zero-casualty aerial 1999 nato kosovo war to the development of drones the usa has led the way in socially-distanced warfare we can expect to see the post-covid-19 explosion therefore of drones surrogate robotics and autonomous systems all controlled from remote shipping containers or box-room bunkers this will be a new phase of clean war defined now not by the absence of civilian casualties but by the hand sanitizer available for the next shift of pilots and the plastic screen between them and the camera and weapons operators here the act of washing ones hands before taking over the controls will take on a macabre moral dimension there are other reasons why conflict may have an expanded future in a world where international powers are more reluctant to intervene regional powers will have far more leeway to pursue their aims chinas ongoing actions in the south china sea nicol 2020 and imposition of new security laws in hong kong kuo and davidson 2020 are one example of this but others have seen the opportunity data analytics company babel street recorded an apparent increase in military activity in may by iran despite being badly hit by covid-19 irans support for offensive cyber-operations and for proxy forces in yemen and iraq rose in the previous 2 weeks tucker 2020a international conflict has continued online during the pandemic already poor uschinese relations have worsened as trump tries to direct domestic anger towards china and as china tries to divert international attention from the viruss origins and their poor handling of medical reports this has all the making of a new viral respiratory cold war as the us cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency noted china and other authoritarian governments have promoted false claims about the origins of the virus in an attempt to shift blame overseas and divide free societies against themselves using tactics such as censoring news injecting false narratives onto social media platforms and promoting slick government-produced videos baksh 2020 on 29 april for example chinas state-run news agency xinhua posted an animated video titled once upon a virus showing lego-like figures representing china and the us trading barbs at each other with the us statue of liberty getting progressively sicker whilst claiming the virus is not dangerous but millions of chinese are dead even though the virus is not dangerous we are correct even though we contradict ourselves timsit 2020 this was not traditional state propaganda designed as viral sharable social media content this was troll-warfare instead of a hot war china had launched a burn war against the usa it did not matter that its own claims were false here you win with the lulz beyond china russia and iran were also using the opportunity to extend their online disinformation campaigns against the west beaumont et al 2020 tucker 2020b even cyberwar was changing with espionage now targeting not military political or economic secrets but research into the coronavirus and vaccines as reports emerged of china russia and iran hacking western laboratories cole 2020a b davidson 2020 overall we can expect computer network exploitation cne disinformation propaganda and trolling to continue with perhaps greater impact the post-covid-19 era has the potential for considerable national economic political and social instability including backlashes against governments and their responses the scapegoating of particular groups unrest at the economic impact so soon after the 2008 crash and its enforced austerity and a more nationalist isolationist anti-globalitarian mood the uk lockdown for example prompted a surge in hate crimes against asian communities grierson 2020 and continuing anger hostility and fear seem likely to be one inheritance of this crisis the entire post-covid-19 world will be more unpredictable and more volatile the virus did not affect each nation the same and within each country the responses of governments and populations will be different globally an already fragile world orderstill recovering from the 2008 crash suffering the after-effects of the war on terror facing the reassertion of russian power and the rise of china and india hit by the retreat of liberal democracy the success of populist strongmen leaders and ethno-nationalist movements and struggling with long-term civil wars refugees and immigration flows climate change and a us president pursuing an unpredictable random and often-dangerous foreign policywill only become more unstable if the seismic political shift of the fall of communism in 1991 led many to speculate about a possible new world order the seismic political shift of covid-19 brings the possibility of an epoch-defining new world disorder h g wells 1897 novel the war of the worlds told the story of the martian invasion of earth and the aliens eventual defeat not by human hands but by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared wells 2019 the book was an attack on hubris using invasion literature to question both evolutionary theory and imperialism and the idea that humanity in general and victorian colonial britain in particular were superior to all others for how superior were we if we had to be saved by the humblest things that god in his wisdom has put upon this earth actually bacteria were not the smallest thingsit would take years before the much smaller viruses were discoveredbut wells was correct about our hubris although in his scientific romance these bacteria were our microscopic allies we failed in the subsequent years to take seriously the threat of these microbial forces covid-19 was a reminder of the power of the world and our place within it with this anthropogenic pandemic the war of the worlds gave way to its inevitable sequel the war of the world why the battle against covid-19 and the concept of anthropocenic war are important is because they help us recognize that from now on human conflict will be increasingly accompanied by exacerbated or even sparked by anthropogenic environmental factors environmental change or phenomena will increasingly impact upon human societies destabilizing them creating poverty and increasing political violence and competition hence the anthropocene has definitively announced itself as the final global superpower replacing the limited realms of human state power with its own singular environmental force the aftershocks of covid-19 will be serious as it spreads through the global south as it pits nations into competition as it introduces new pressures into areas already riven by natural disasters civil war or political extremism as it impacts domestically on each nations economy politics and world view and as it destabilizes the international order given the likelihood of more pandemics to come and the growing impact of anthropogenic environmental problems the first anthropocenic war will not be the last the war of the world will continue  some one health based control strategies for the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus maged hemida gomaa abdelmohsen alnaeem   mers-cov is an emerging viral pathogen of humans discovered in saudi arabia in late 2012 1 there are 2449 laboratory-confirmed cases from 27 countries reported to the world health organization who as of aug 2nd 2019 of these a total of 845 people passed away with a case fatality rate of almost 345 2 dromedary camels are the main reservoir of the virus the infected camels shed the virus in large quantities into through their body secretions particularly the nasal secretions 3 humans that come into close contact with dromedary camels or consume their products are at potential risk of infection 4 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov emerged in southern china at guangdong in 2012 5 mers-cov and sars-cov are members of the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales asian palm civet paradoxurus hermaphroditus was the main reservoir of sars-cov 6 eradication and culling of the palm civet in china contributed substantially to the eradication- of sars-cov 7 another example of the use of one health approach to control zoonotic viral diseases was practiced in case of the hendra virus in australia this virus causes serious problems for in close contact with hendra virus infected or dead horses the main reservoir of hendra virus are the flying foxes fruit bats adoption of some one health control strategies helped in the minimizing human exposure of this virus in australia 8 9 10 these strategies included the culling trials of bats as well as vaccination of horses all these measures reduced the potential risk of human infection with hendra virus 911 adoption of similar strategy for mers-cov in the light of the one health approach could be a promising control trend most animal markets are usually designed to display maintain and trade various species of animals especially sheep goats and camel in many cases the markets are located in close proximity to some regional slaughterhouses the markets mainly consist of several pens each pen is assigned to hold and maintain one species of animals the majority of the pens are assigned to dromedary camels which are grouped according to the purpose of their admission to the market some are used for meat and are then slaughtered a short time after their admission some animals are displayed for the purpose of camel shows fig 1 some animals are sold for breeding purposes this is in addition to the pens assigned for the imported camel breeds from somalia and sudan all these pens are separated by metal fences and connected to each other fig 1 pens assigned for sheep and goats are co-located with the dromedary camel pens animals can be moved from one place to another across the market freely camel herders may visit several pens of different animals each day freely every afternoon markets hold large-scale animal sales haraj in the central square of the market animals are brought from different animal pens and even from outside the market from the neighboring regions as well as remote cities in the square thus a large number of animals are mixed for at least 4 hours per day they are sold for different purposes including slaughtering breeding and camel show these animals are mixed together with animals from the market as well as from outside in one large square at the end of the haraj some animals are returned to their pens in the market some are sold and transferred to the regional or neighboring abattoirs to be slaughtered and some are transferred to other regions for a variety purposes most of the abattoirs are designed to have several slaughtering halls fig 1 each hall is used for slaughtering and processing of one species of animals fig 1 in many cases however the slaughtering halls are physically connected animals are usually admitted to the entrance region where they subjected to physical examination sick animals or those for which they have concerns are kept in a quarantine area for further testing and action the customer hall is connected with the main slaughtering and processing halls but separated by glass partitions the veterinarians staff and employees in the abattoirs usually move freely between slaughtering halls and come in close contact with live animals and their body fluids and tissues before and after slaughtering live dromedary camels are usually transported from one place to another for different purposes including sale treatment in regional veterinary clinics etc the imported animals are transferred from the ports to their destinations in various regions animals may be moved from one place to another animals are usually packed together and transported in open vehicles sometimes large trucks are used to transfer a large number of animals in one shipment camel transportation by truck is not common in most of the cases especially during grazing time usually camels are driven by camel herders parallel to national highways over large distances and passing sometime in close proximity to many cities on their way camel shows are one of the traditions in the arabian peninsula mazaeen involves a mass gathering of dromedary camels from across the arabian peninsula and is held annually at different places in this gathered animals are used in several multistage competitions animals are kept in only large place for almost two months mazaeen attracts a large number of people to attend for entertainment in addition to the camel owners staff and employees camels are outdoor animals they graze in deserts for most of their time in the arabian peninsula animals are moved for grazing after the rainy seasons in search of pasture animals usually move across the borders of different countries in the arabian gulf breeding in dromedary camels is mainly practiced through natural insemination usually a common high pedigree male camel is used to inseminate several female animals within the herd and from other herds in most of the cases some camel owners may transfer their female camels for long distance in the sake of high pedigree male camel on the other hands a high pedigree male camel may be transferred over a long distance to another in a far distance to inseminate large number of female animals this procedure usually occur during the ratting season from november to april each year during the process of mating both male and female animals come in close contact each mating time between the male and female camels is about 20 minutes it is usually accompanied by gurgling and frothing which may exaggerate virus shedding 12 this may pose a risk of transmission of mers-cov from infected to the non-infected animal this may contribute to the amplification of mers-cov in certain region several studies showed a high prevalence of the mers-cov in dromedary camels in camel markets and animals admitted to the abattoirs in the arabian peninsula north and central africa and pakistan 13 14 15 16 camel market thus enable amplification and recombination of the mers-cov 17 18 19 there are several potential ways to reduce the animal-to-animal transmission in the markets thus reducing the potential human risk the animal markets should be relocated to a far distance from major cities and villages the ideal location of the market should be downstream of the prevailing wind the market should be re-organized into separate isolated pens per each group of animals special consideration should be paid to ensure enough space for each animal and between adjacent animal pens overcrowdings of animals may facilitate the virus transmission between animals particular among the active viral shedders thus reducing the number of animals per each pen will minimize the risk of transmission of the virus between animals in the same pen and to neighboring pens it is recommended to separate the pens of dromedary camels from other species as sheep and goat restriction of animal movement between markets should be encouraged imported breed of camels should be placed in separate pens apart from the local breeds one study showed an absence of specific antibodies in sera of some camel herders veterinarians and abattoir staff 20 however several studies showed the detection of mers-cov antibodies in sera of people camel particular camel workers veterinarians and abattoir employees 151621 22 23 24 one recent study reported a high prevalence of mers-cov antibodies among camel workers in saudi arabia 25 regardless of the discrepancy between the research group and the sensitivity of the techniques to detect the virus-specific antibodies as well as antigen in the at-risk people special precautions should be taken by these groups of people who get in close contact with dromedary camels people in the abattoirs should wear special ppe particularly n95 mask gowns and goggles during their active contact with camels during the whole process of slaughtering including inspection slaughtering evisceration etc a separate hall should be assigned for slaughtering each species of animal customers should not be allowed in close contact with slaughtered animals until they receive the final meat the carcasses should be transported from the abattoir in well-equipped leak-proof vehicles which do not allow any leakage of the body fluids of the slaughtered animals the liquid wastes from the abattoirs should not be allowed to be merged with the common municipal sewage system special decontamination processes should be practiced to get rid of the animal waste after slaughtering animal skins should be chemically treated before leaving the abattoir to avoid harboring any contamination from the body fluids of the animals more recently most animals in shows are microchipped with such information as birth date sex breed and owner information recorded this is a very useful tool in careful monitoring all animals through the duration of the camel show which may extend to more than two months special attention should be paid to test the animals prior to the introduction to the camel shows active mers-cov shedding animals should be placed in a remote quarantine area they should be sampled regularly at weekly interval until they show no virus shedding in their body secretions random sampling of animals participating in the shows and exhibition during the period of the show should be conducted to ensure the absence of active shedders in a certain group of animals people who come in close contact with animals should wear ppe people attending the show are advised not to come in close contact with camels camel movement could be from one region to another within the same country or between different countries there is an active international trade marketing between countries from the arabian peninsula and countries from north and central africa particularly sudan somalia kenya mali ethiopia burkina faso nigeria morocco etc saudi arabia is the largest camel importer from these countries especially during the pilgrimage season every year dromedary camels from these countries show high mers-cov seroprevalence and virus shedding 3131526 27 28 29 30 31 a recent study showed the circulating strains of mers-cov in africa are somewhat different in the genomic level from the currently circulating strains in the arabian peninsula 32 the african strains lack the orf-4 of the mers-cov thus this may explain the possibility of recombination and mutations between different strains of mers-cov special attention should be paid to the importation and movement of dromedary camels between different countries imported camels should be sampled and tested for the presence of mers-cov antibodies and antigens at the country of origin they must be quarantined upon arrival sampled and tested by serology and for the presence of virus in nasal secretions in their nasal secretions sero-positive or virus-shedding camels should be quarantined before being allowed into the country special attention should be given to camels imported for other purposes such as breeding and shows these animals will eventually be mixed with local breeds and therefore poses greater risk of mers-cov to the local camel breeds internal transport of animals should be done in well-equipped vehicles which should be ventilated and closed overcrowding of animals in one vehicle should be prohibited shipping act as one of the stress factors posed on the animals and the very close contact between animals favor the transmission not only of mers-cov but also other pathogens they may harbor dromedary camels usually spend most of their times on pasture for grazing they are moved from one place to another in a search of pasture several herds of animals may get into close proximity and share the same land for grazing at the same time some countries have banned grazing in their lands or in certain regions camels move across the border of the countries and are mixed with the animals from the neighboring countries theoretically there should be rules governing the grazing and crossing of borders animals should be monitored not only for mers-cov but also for other pathogens before being allowed contact with other animals regular monitoring of animals on the open grazing regions is highly recommended to follow up on the health status of animals this will help in the identification of active shedders of the virus which may contaminate the pasture and act as a source of infection of any subsequent grazing by other herds one study showed the stability of mers-cov experimentally introduced into camel milk 33 another study showed the detection of some mers-cov neutralizing antibodies and rnas in camel milk collected by the traditional methods used in qatar 34 an expert opinion study was recently conducted to assess the hazard posed by the consumption of raw camel milk and raw or undercooked camel meat 35 thorough boiling or pasteurization of camel milk before consumption should be practiced to avoid any potential risk of transmission of mers-cov through the ingestion of contaminated milk similarly thorough cooking of camel meat and meat products before consumption is highly recommended several studies reported the molecular and serological surveillance of mers-cov among dromedary camels in many countries in asia and africa 13151626273637 however these studies have been conducted on a random basis some of them included only a partial population of a camel at a certain region in a country moreover there is a lack of information from some african countries that have large camel population such as sudan mauritania and somalia there is an urgent need for a more systematic and well-designed surveillance system where intensive dromedary camels are raised and exist these surveillance systems will help in mapping the camel population that shed or seroconvert to mers-cov in various regions careful monitoring of the genetic changes of mers-cov in both camel and human population should be done at a regular intervals who established a standard operating protocol sop for the handling of the active human mers-cov cases 3839 however there are no established strategies for dealing with active shedder animals as is the in case for other viral pathogens such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses although some countries have started to develop their own protocols they are not applicable on a large scale across the world one major burden is that mers-cov does not produce obvious clinical signs in camels despite mild nasal discharge and lacrimation 340 this makes it very difficult to identify mers-cov infected camels or to assess their health conditions based on the clinical signs the gold standard for the identification of the active infected animal is laboratory testing who established another sop for laboratory examination processing and testing of suspected human cases with mers-cov 35 animal to animal transmission is reported during the course of mers-cov infection in a certain animal population v 41 animal to animal transmission is reported during the course of mers-cov infection in certain animal populations 32742 ideally regular monitoring of the dromedary camel population should be scheduled special precautions should be adopted for dealing with the positive active shedder animals either within a herd or in camel markets when positive animals are detected in camel markets application of quarantine measures should be applied in that market none of the animals should get in or out of the market during the course of the viral infection periodic testing of a statistically significant number of animals from all corners as well as the center of the market should be also conducted special precautions should be paid from handlers and camel attendants as well as veterinarians the workers must wear the appropriate ppe all the time when dealing with animals testing and data analysis of animals on a weekly basis should be performed thorough cleaning and disinfection of the market should be practiced regularly the market should not be opened again to the public until all animals are tested free from shedding the virus for at least two consecutive time interval with two weeks apart a similar approach could be adopted in case of detection of positive mers-cov animal in a particular herd additionally the positive camel herd should not be moved during the active course of virus shedding they should not allowed to graze in an open pasture to avoid spreading of the virus through their secretions there is a controversial discussion about the idea of using vaccines against mers-cov in camels and humans some studies showed a high seroprevalence of mers-cov among dromedary camels in asia and africa 13151626363743 44 45 other research showed the possibility of reinfection of dromedary camels with mers-cov in the presence of neutralizing antibodies in sera of the infected animals 42 however several experimental approaches were adopted to prepare and test the efficacy of some vaccine candidates for mers-cov in experimental animals dromedary camels and alpaca 46 47 48 49 50 a recent study showed that application of an adjuvant-mers-cov-s1 vaccine in dromedary camels and alpaca resulted in the production of robust neutralizing antibodies 46 this study supported the notion that vaccinating young camels under two years will reduce the virus shedding from these nave animals thus the risk of human infection could be minimized by vaccination who issued some standard operating protocols for dealing with positive mers-cov human and dromedary camels 51 the elder and immunocompromised people suffering from some chronic diseases such as diabetes high blood pressure cancer should practice extreme precautions if they visit camel barns or market especially in the middle east people come in close contact with dromedary camels on daily basis such as camel owners veterinarians slaughterhouse employees should protect themselves by adopting standard personal hygiene this include wearing the proper ppe taking showers after finishing their work leaving their clothes and gowns in special laundry where they can be thoroughly decontaminated 51 they should not accompany these clothes to their homes or outside the camel market or slaughterhouse although mers-cov had emerged almost seven years ago there are many aspects of the virushumananimal that interactions are not well identified furthermore there is no effective medication or vaccine to treat or prevent viral infection in both human and animals the one health approach has many applications which can be of great help in the control of the pathogens of animal origin adoption of the above-mentioned strategies will have a great impact on the reduction of the virus shedding from the dromedary camels to the environment and subsequently to the human thus the risk of human infection with mers-cov could be minimized mgh and aaa conceived the idea did data analysis and drafted the manuscript authors declared there is no conflict of interest  aircraft cabin environment michael

individuals however can ascend to around 800010 000 ft 25003000 m above sea level before hypoxia begins to have ill effects and reduces performance with increasing altitude there is a fall in the atmospheric pressure together with a decrease in density and temperature the pressure at sea level in the standard atmosphere is 760 mmhg and this falls to half at 18 000 ft 5500 m where the ambient temperature is about 20c the composition of the atmosphere remains constant up to the tropopause 36 000 ft or 11 000 m the most abundant gases being nitrogen 78 and oxygen 21 with the remaining 1 being argon carbon dioxide neon hydrogen and ozone the relationship between the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and oxygen tension minimizes the effect on the human of the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen ascent to an altitude of 10 000 ft 3000 m produces a fall in the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli but only a slight fall in the percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen once altitude exceeds 10 000 ft 3000 m however the percentage saturation of hemoglobin falls quickly resulting in hypoxia indeed above 8000 ft 2500 m the effects of lack of oxygen will begin to appear and a decrease in an individuals ability to perform complex tasks and a reduction in night vision can be measured1

shows how the air circulates in the cabin in the case of a single aisle while figure 464
shows the airflow patterns in a twin aisle cabin as a result of the required cabin pressure change during climb and descent it is possible for individuals to suffer discomfort as a result of expansion of gas trapped within the body in particular gas can be trapped within the gut and within the middle ear and sinuses normally this trapped gas is able to escape without any problem but there may be occasions when this is not so such as when the individual is suffering from upper respiratory tract congestion due to infection or allergy in particular the human ear is very sensitive to rates of pressure change the threshold for detection being 0132 psi 0910 kpa this is equivalent to a change in cabin altitude of 250 ft 76 m at sea level in the human ear the cavity of the middle ear is separated from the outer ear by the tympanic membrane it communicates with the nasopharynx and in turn the atmosphere by way of the eustachian tube the proximal two-thirds of which has soft walls that are normally collapsed during ascent to altitude the gas in the middle ear cavity expands and escapes along the eustachian tube into the nasopharynx equalizing the pressure across the tympanic membrane the pharyngeal portion of the eustachian tube acts as a one-way valve thus allowing expanding air to escape easily to the atmosphere this can be sometimes felt as a popping sensation as air escapes from the tube during ascent during descent air from the nasopharynx must enter the middle ear to maintain equilibrium in some individuals the one-way valve mechanism of the eustachian tube can prevent passive flow of air back into the middle ear cavity this causes a relative increase of pressure on the outside of the tympanic membrane pushing it into the middle ear cavity and causing a sensation of fullness a decrease in hearing acuity and eventually pain it is possible to perform active maneuvers to open the eustachian tube such as swallowing yawning and jaw movements in some people these simple maneuvers are not effective and it may be necessary to occlude the nostrils and raise the pressure in the mouth and nose to force air into the middle ear cavities this increase in pressure can usually simply be achieved by raising the floor of the mouth with the glottis shut while other individuals raise the pressure in the lungs and the respiratory tract by contracting the expiratory muscles while forcibly exhaling valsalvas maneuver in addition to regulating the airflow rate required to pressurize the aircraft the environmental control system controls the flow rate of outside air required to remove contaminants and controls the temperature in the cabin this requirement is facilitated by the practice of recirculation of approximately 50 of the cabin air this is achieved by extracting air from the cabin and mixing it with conditioned outside air recirculation provides two benefits one it allows the total airflow rate to be higher than the flow rate of the outside air so good circulation in the cabin can be maintained independently of the outside airflow and two the conditioned air is mixed with comparatively warm recirculated air before being introduced into the cabin as a result the conditioned air is supplied at a much lower temperature without causing discomfort from cold drafts the recirculated air will also have picked up moisture from the cabin occupants and the cabin activities improving the humidity level in older generation jet aircraft all the air supplied to the cabin came from outside air without the benefits of recirculation improved humidity reduction in perceived drafts this practice was inefficient with a substantial energy and hence environmental cost in pressurized jet aircraft manufactured since the beginning of the 1980s the recirculated air is passed through filters these are high efficiency particulate hepa filters which have an efficiency of 9997 for 03 m particles they are effective in removing bacteria and viruses from the recirculated air so preventing their spread through the cabin by this route air filters are changed during routine aircraft maintenance as specified by the manufacturer in the servicing schedule recirculated air is obtained from the area above the cabin or under the floor air from the cargo bay lavatories and galleys is not recirculated the flow rate of outside air per seat ranges from 36 to 74 ls 76156 cubic ftmin with the percentage of recirculated air distributed to the passenger cabin being of the order 3055 of the total air supply3 the result of filtering the recirculated air is a significant improvement in cabin air quality by the removal of particles and biological microorganisms it is not necessary to pass the compressed air from outside through hepa filters because the ambient air at high altitude is free of microorganisms and particulates the use of recirculation has been common in the design of building environmental control systems for many years building environmental systems are commonly designed and operated with up to 90 of recirculated air which compares with the maximum recirculated air flow in aircraft of 55 the air supply to the flight deck or cockpit is derived from the same source but is delivered at a slightly higher pressure than the air supplied to the cabin this ensures a positive pressure differential to prevent the ingress of smoke or fumes to the flight deck in the event of a fire or similar in-flight emergency the flow rate of the flight deck air supply is also slightly higher than that to the cabin because this supply is used for cooling the avionics and other electronic equipment humidity is the concentration of water vapor in the air relative humidity is the ratio of the actual amount of vapor in the air to the amount that would be present if the air was saturated at the same temperature expressed as a percentage saturated air at high temperatures holds more water vapor than at low temperatures and if unsaturated air is cooled it becomes saturated high humidity can lead to passenger and crew discomfort when it is accompanied by high temperature high humidity can cause condensation dripping and freezing of moisture on the inside of the aircraft shell which may lead to safety problems such as corrosion condensation can also give rise to biological growth thus causing adverse effects on cabin air quality at a typical aircraft cruising altitude of 30 000 ft 9150 m the outside air temperature is in the region of 40c and is extremely dry typically containing about 015 gkg of moisture for pressurized aircraft flying at these levels the conditioned air entering the cabin has a relative humidity of 1 exhaled moisture from passengers and crew together with moisture from galleys and toilet areas increases the humidity to an average level of 610 which is below the 20 normally accepted as comfort level4
 research has shown that the maximum additional water lost from an individual during an 8-h period in 0 humidity compared with normal day-to-day loss is around 100 ml the sensation of thirst experienced by healthy individuals in the low humidity environment is due to local drying of the pharyngeal membranes and this itself may lead to the spurious sensation of thirst there is no evidence that exposure to a low-humidity environment itself leads to dehydration although local humidity can cause mild subjective symptoms such as dryness of the eyes and mucous membranes5 6
 no significant effect has been shown on reaction time or other measures of psychomotor performance although there can be some changes in the fluid regulatory hormones5 6 it is unlikely that low humidity has any long- or short-term ill-effects provided overall hydration is maintained by drinking adequate amounts of fluid7 the bodys homeostatic mechanisms ensure that central hydration is maintained although the peripheral physical effects can lead to discomfort dry skin can be alleviated by using moisturizing aqueous creams particularly just before flight and dry eye irritation can be alleviated by the use of moisturizing eye drops individuals prone to develop dry eyes are advised not to wear contact lenses during long flights in pressurized aircraft8 a national academy of sciences report identified humidity as one of the areas deserving more attention in future research concerning aircraft cabin environment9
 the aircraft cabin is similar to many other indoor environments such as homes and offices in that people are exposed to a mixture of external and recirculated air the cabin environment is different in many respects eg the high occupant density the inability of the occupants to leave at will and the need for pressurization in flight there is a combination of environmental factors including low air pressure and low humidity as well as low frequency vibration and constant background noise although the noise and vibration can contribute to fatigue the levels are all below those which are accepted as potentially harmful to hearing9 10
 ozone is a highly reactive form of oxygen found naturally in the upper atmosphere it is formed primarily above the tropopause as a result of the action of uv light on oxygen molecules the amount and distribution of natural ozone in the atmosphere varies with latitude altitude season and weather conditions the highest concentrations in the northern hemisphere are generally found at high altitude over high latitude locations during the winter and spring the effects of high ozone concentration on human beings can include eye irritation coughing due to irritation of the upper respiratory system nose irritation and chest pains as a result of this the airworthiness regulatory authorities eg us federal aviation authority european joint aviation authorities require that transport category aircraft operating above 18 000 ft 5500 m must show that the concentration of ozone inside the cabin will not exceed 025 partsmillion by volume sea level equivalent at any time and a time weighted value of 01 partsmillion by volume sea level for scheduled segments of 4 h11
 for this reason long haul transport jet aircraft are now equipped with ozone catalytic converters that break down or crack the ozone before it enters the cabin air circulation natural radiation consists of cosmic rays from outer space galactic radiation and the gamma rays from rocks earth and building materials cosmic radiation is produced when primary photons and alpha particles from outside the solar system galactic cosmic radiation interact with components of the earths atmosphere a second source of cosmic radiation is the release of charged particles from the sun which becomes significant during periods of solar flare sun storm cosmic radiation is an ionizing radiation ionizing radiation also includes x-rays and that from radioactive materials ionizing radiation is a natural part of the environment in which we live and is present in the earth buildings food we eat and even in the bones of our bodies the other type of radiation is known as non-ionizing radiation and this includes uv light radio waves and microwaves humans animals and plants have all evolved in an environment with a background of natural radiation and with few exceptions it is not a significant risk to health the amount of cosmic radiation that reaches the earth from the sun and outer space varies and depends on the latitude and height above sea level the amount of cosmic radiation entering the atmosphere follows an 11-year cycle with the intensity of galactic radiation being lowest when solar activity is at its highest this is because during high levels of solar activity the resulting magnetic flux between the sun and the earth deflects much of the galactic cosmic radiation cosmic radiation is effectively absorbed by the atmosphere and is also affected by the earths magnetic field the effect on the body will depend on the latitude and altitude at which the individual is flying and also on the length of time in the air cosmic radiation may be measured directly using sophisticated instruments as was done in the concorde supersonic transport and subsonic long range aircraft or can be estimated using a computer software program these programs look at the route time at each altitude and the phase of the solar cycle and calculate the radiation dose received by the aircraft occupant for a particular flight a number of airlines and research organizations have compared actual measurements taken on board an aircraft with the computer estimations and the two are very similar12
 the effect of ionizing radiation depends not only on the dose absorbed but also on the type and energy of the radiation and the tissues involved these factors are taken into account in arriving at the dose equivalent measured in sieverts sv however doses of cosmic radiation are so low that figures are usually quoted in microsieverts sv millionths of a sievert or millisieverts msv thousandths of a sievert when ionizing radiation passes through the body energy is transmitted to the tissues which affects the atoms within the individual cells very high levels of radiation such as that from a nuclear explosion will cause severe cell damage in a human being particularly to the bone marrow cells and the reproductive cells which cannot be repaired by the body low-level doses of radiation such as cosmic radiation or medical x-rays do not cause such severe damage to the cells and in most cases any such damage is repaired satisfactorily by the bodys own mechanism it is not possible to predict a maximum safe threshold of exposure to low levels of radiation because individuals vary in their biological response8 12
 the international commission for radiological protection icrp recommends maximum mean body effective dose limits of 20 msvyear averaged over 5 years for workers exposed to radiation as part of their occupation including flight crew and 1 msvyear for the general population with an additional recommendation that the equivalent dose to the fetus should not exceed 1 msv during the declared term of pregnancy when the concorde supersonic transport aircraft was flying the effective dose rate for the occupants at cruising altitude was measured to be in the range of 1215 svh on ultra long-haul flights at high latitudes such as a boeing 747-400 flying between london and tokyo the effective dose rate at cruising altitude is around 5 svh on short-haul commercial operations the effective dose rate in europe is in the region of 13 svh for typical annual flight schedules crew members accumulate around 4 or 5 msvyear operations and between 1 and 2 msvyear on european short-haul operations from cosmic radiation for airline passengers the icrp recommended limit for the general public of 1 msvyear equates to about 200 flying hoursyear on the trans-equatorial routes there are essentially two types of airline passenger the occasional social traveler and the frequent business traveler the public limit 1 msvyear will be of no consequence to the social traveler but could be of significance to the frequent business traveler the 1 msv annual limit would be exceeded if the business traveler were flying more than eight transatlantic or five antipodean return journeys per year business travelers are exposed as an essential part of the occupation and it is entirely logical to apply the occupational limit of 20 msvyear to this group cosmic radiation is of no significance at altitudes below about 25 000 ft 7600 m because of the attenuating properties of the earths atmosphere there is no evidence from epidemiological studies of flight crew of any increase in incidence of cancers linked to ionizing radiation exposure such as leukemia in general terms as far as the risk of developing cancer induced by radiation exposure is concerned it has been calculated that an accumulated dose of 5 msvyear for 20 years increases the risk of developing cancer in the general population from 23234 ie an increase of risk of 04 over 20 years compared with all the other risks encountered during a working life this is very low cosmic radiation is both a complex and emotive subject it cannot be seen touched smelled or tasted and yet it is present all around us while it is known that there is no level of radiation exposure below which effects do not occur all the evidence indicates that there is an extremely low probability of airline passengers or crew suffering any abnormality or disease as a result of exposure to cosmic radiation the world health organization and the international civil aviation organization recommend that aircraft arriving through countries reporting certain indigenous infectious diseases be treated with pesticides13 this remains a controversial issue while it is understandable that countries such as new zealand would not want to risk the entry of certain vector-borne diseases transmitted by mosquitoes there remains concern about the safety and efficacy of various pesticides used particularly while passengers are in the cabin top of descent spraying there appears to be less concern about using residual pesticides during routine aircraft maintenance at this time however the us environmental protection agency has not promoted the registry of any pesticides in the usa for use in aircraft disinsection on american carriers as vector-borne diseases re-emerge however these policies may need re-evaluation in order to prevent the transmission of disease further education of air crew and passengers will be needed and these issues are being reviewed the transmission of mycobacterium tuberculosis tb during air travel has been most extensively studied tb is transmitted by the inhalation of droplet nuclei air-borne transmission two of six investigations conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc between 1992 and 1995 have indicated that the transmission of tb from a symptomatic person to other passengers or crew members does occur during air travel21 22 in one investigation a flight attendant was diagnosed with cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis in november 1992 of the 212 flight crew who worked with this flight attendant between august and october 1992 256 had a positive tuberculin skin test tst result two of these contacts had documented conversion of tst status tst positivity and conversion was associated with a cumulative flight-time exposure of 12 h or more in the second investigation a foreign-born passenger developed symptomatic pulmonary tuberculosis while visiting friends in the usa she traveled from baltimore maryland to chicago illinois 2 h flight and then from chicago to honolulu hawaii 8 h and 38 min flight three of the 113 passengers on the baltimore to chicago flight had a positive tst two were foreign-born fifteen of the 257 passengers on the flight from chicago to honolulu had a positive tst four of these passengers converted their tst in both investigations all of the new infections were latent tb infection none developed active tuberculosis the hepa filters used in newer commercial aircraft are able to filter out tb bacteria from the recycled air and are also used in hospital respiratory isolation rooms to prevent the spread of tb within the hospital setting the number of air exchanges per hour in aircraft exceeds the number recommended for hospital isolation rooms furthermore the prevalence of transmissible tuberculosis among air travelers is estimated to be 5100100 000 passengers depending on the route of the plane23 the risk of tb transmission on a commercial aircraft therefore remains low mathematical models estimate that the chance of acquiring tb during air travel while sitting near a highly infectious source is approximately 1 in 100024
 human influenza virus is spread by droplet and air-borne transmission25 one of the first well-documented outbreaks of influenza on a commercial airline was published by moser and colleagues in 197717 thirty-eight of 54 passengers and crew members became ill after exposure to a passenger with symptomatic influenza infection another two passengers showed serological evidence of infection without becoming ill the outbreak was attributed to an engine malfunction which required the aircraft to remain on the runway for approximately 45 h without adequate ventilation most of the passengers remained on the plane during the delay and the clinical attack rate varied with the amount of time spent aboard the aircraft another outbreak of presumed influenza that was associated with air travel occurred among workers traveling from a remote mine in northwestern australia26 one worker became symptomatic with an influenza-like illness prior to the flight which lasted 3 h and 20 min over the 34 days that followed the flight 15 workers presented with similar complaints and were unable to work an additional five workers reported upper respiratory tract symptoms when questioned but were able to continue working there was no ventilation system malfunction reported for the aircraft associated with this outbreak a significant limitation of this report is the lack of etiologic confirmation since 1997 a new strain of avian influenza virus h5n1 has been responsible for a number of outbreaks involving a large number of birds and rarely humans from december 2003february 2007 237 laboratory-confirmed human infections were identified in asia and se asia and have primarily been due to direct contact with poultry25 27 limited non-sustained person-to-person spread has also been described in a few cases as with sars the airline industry will look to public health authorities for guidance in the event that an avian influenza pandemic should occur the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was first identified in southern china in november 2002 and recognized as a global threat by march 200328 it was caused by a novel coronavirus the sars-associated coronavirus and was spread primarily via droplet transmission although spread by air-borne and contact transmission could not be ruled out despite the clear role of international travel in the spread of sars during the 2003 outbreak28 29 there had been only one case of likely in-flight transmission30 limited transmission probably occurred aboard aircraft but the risk was felt to be low fortunately no suspected cases of sars have been reported since may 200431
 
neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of meningitis and sepsis in children and young adults and is spread by droplet transmission meningococcal disease has been documented in travelers particularly those traveling for the hajj however transmission due to exposure while aboard an aircraft has not been definitively documented20 guidelines for the management of airline passengers who have been exposed to meningococcal disease are based on information available from investigations of tb transmission aboard aircraft us guidelines are online and available at httpwwwcdcgovtravelmenin-guidelineshtm
 measles is a highly contagious viral disease that is spread by air-borne transmission a person infected with measles is contagious from the first onset of vague symptoms up to 4 days before rash appears to approximately 4 days after the development of rash therefore the potential for disease transmission during air travel exists from 1996 to 2000 63 of the 207 cases of imported measles into the usa developed a rash directly before or on the day of air travel from these imported cases only one documented case of in-flight transmission was reported32 despite the risk few cases of measles occur as a direct result of in-flight exposure32 33 amornkul and colleagues investigated the extent of measles transmission aboard an international commercial flight after exposure to an infected passenger32 of the 276 potentially exposed passengers 82 completed a follow-up questionnaire including 29 passengers who reported close contact with the ill passenger before during or after the flight none of the contacted passengers reported symptoms consistent with measles available data indicate that infectious agents can be transmitted from person-to-person aboard an aircraft on the ground and during flight just as they can in any other situation where people find themselves in close proximity from investigations of disease outbreaks associated with air travel two main risk factors for the spread of communicable diseases have been identified flight duration 8 h including ground time and seating proximity to the source there is no evidence that the pressurized cabin itself makes transmission of disease any more likely once the aircraft doors are closed air-conditioning is provided from the auxiliary power unit until it can be supplied from the aircraft engines thus ensuring the filtration benefits of air recirculation there does appear to be increased risk of disease spread when the aircraft ventilation system is inoperable guidelines are in place to assist flight crew in the management of ill passengers and can be accessed from wwwwhoorg wwwcdcgov or wwwiataorg in general good respiratory and hand hygiene practices should always be encouraged and people with febrile illnesses should postpone air travel whenever possible aircrews particularly of international fights are at risk for the same illnesses to which other travelers are exposed because of their very short-term stays and stays that are generally in major cities they may not be as intensely exposed to some illnesses as others however their lifestyle may predispose them to other risks because of their frequent international travel flight crews should receive health recommendations that are specifically geared to their travel patterns itineraries and lifestyles for example an international pilot flying frequently to sub-saharan africa would do well not to take routine anti-malarial medication but should take precautions to avoid insect bites may carry a self-treatment regimen if desired and if the layovers are extended and should be instructed to seek medical attention immediately if a fever occurs the medical department of international carriers should either be able to provide good information and appropriate immunizations to aircrew or should have an arrangement with a travel clinic for appropriate education of flight crews other than transmission of infectious agents flight crews have other health concerns that though briefly mentioned here are best reviewed in an occupational health setting issues that have surfaced with regard to pilot health have included the safety of refractive surgery the use of serotonin re-uptake inhibitors safety of pilots to fly with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or even with the human immunodeficiency virus as well as issues related to pilot fatigue flight attendants concerns have ranged from reproductive health problems menstrual disorders chronic back pain to fears of an increased risk of breast cancer epidemiological studies have shown an increased prevalence of malignant melanoma among flight crew members this is thought to be a result of a lifestyle allowing exposure to sunlight that is perhaps increased during layover periods34
 flying as a passenger should be no problem for the fit healthy and mobile individual but for the passenger with certain pre-existing conditions the cabin environment may exacerbate their underlying problems although many problems relate to the physiological effects of hypoxia and expansion of trapped gases it should be remembered that the complex airport environment can be stressful and challenging to the passenger leading to problems before even becoming air-borne although passengers with medical needs require medical clearance from the airline passengers with disabilities do not disabled passengers do need to notify the requirement for special needs such as wheelchair assistance or assignment of seats with lifting armrests and this should be done at the time of booking an area of little exploration has been air travel stress and anxiety35 whereas typical issues such as fear of flying have been addressed by the airlines in the past problems that have surfaced related to terrorism and airline security have increased passenger lines terminal crowding lesser personal services due to cost-cutting etc have taken a toll on the ease in which air travel is currently perceived addressing these potential problems with the air traveler particularly with those who have any underlying illness or general anxiety is helpful the objectives of medical clearance are to provide advice to passengers and their medical attendants on fitness to fly and to prevent delays and diversions of the flight as a result of deterioration in the passengers well-being it depends upon self-declaration by the passenger and upon the attending physician having an awareness of the flight environment and how this may affect the patients condition most major airlines provide services for those passengers who require extra help and most have a medical advisor to assess the fitness for travel of those with medical needs individual airlines work with their own guidelines but these are generally based on those published by the aerospace medical association on fitness for travel36 copies of the asma guidelines may be obtained from the association online at wwwasmaorg or tel 703 739 2240 the international air transport association iata publishes a recommended medical information form medif for use by member airlines fig 465
 the medif should be completed by the passengers medical attendant and passed to the airline or travel agent at the time of booking to ensure timely medical clearance medical clearance is required whenfitness to travel is in doubt as a result of recent illness hospitalization injury surgery or instability of an acute or chronic medical conditionspecial services are required eg oxygen stretcher or authority to carry or use accompanying medical equipment such as a ventilator or a nebulizer
 medical clearance is not required for carriage of an invalid passenger outside these categories although special needs such as a wheelchair must be reported to the airline at the time of booking cabin crew members are unable to provide individual special assistance to invalid passengers beyond the provision of normal in-flight service passengers who are unable to look after their own personal needs during flight such as toileting or feeding will be asked to travel with an accompanying adult who can assist with these needs it is vital that passengers remember to carry with them any essential medication and not pack it in their checked baggage deterioration on holiday or on a business trip of a previously stable condition  such as asthma diabetes or seizure disorder  can often give rise to the need for medical clearance for the return journey a stretcher may be required together with medical support and this can incur considerable cost it is important for all travelers to consider supplemental travel insurance which includes provision for the use of a specialist repatriation company to provide the necessary medical support
 in determining the passengers fitness to fly a basic knowledge of aviation physiology and physics can be applied any trapped gas will expand in volume by up to 30 during flight and consideration must be given to the effects of the relative hypoxia encountered at a cabin altitude of up to 8000 ft above mean sea level the altitude of the destination airport may also need to be taken into account in deciding the fitness of an individual to undertake a particular journey the passengers exercise tolerance can provide a useful guide on fitness to fly if unable to walk a distance 50 m without developing dyspnea there is a risk that the passenger will be unable to tolerate the relative hypoxia of the pressurized cabin more specific guidance can be gained from knowledge of the passengers baseline sea level blood gas levels and hemoglobin value a good source of guidance is provided by the british thoracic society website37
 
table 461
shows the guidelines recommended by one international carrier this list is not exhaustive and it should be remembered that individual cases might require individual assessment by the attending physician the prolonged period of immobility associated with long-haul flying can be a risk for those individuals predisposed to develop deep venous thrombosis dvt pre-existing risk factors includeblood disorders and clotting factor abnormalitiescardiovascular diseasemalignancymajor surgerylower limbabdominal traumadvt historypregnancyestrogen therapy including oral contraception and hormone replacement therapy40 years of ageimmobilizationpathological body fluid depletionsmokingobesityvaricose veins
 although many airlines promote lower limb exercise via the in-flight magazine or videos and encourage mobility within the cabin those passengers known to be vulnerable to dvt should seek guidance from their attending physician on the use of compression stockings andor anti-coagulants there is currently no evidence that flying per se is a risk factor for the development of dvt but those at high risk should avoid any form of prolonged immobilization such as is associated with travel38
 in addition to the reduction in ambient pressure and the relative hypoxia it is important to consider the physical constraints of the passenger cabin a passenger with a disability must not impede the free egress of the cabin occupants in case of emergency evacuation there is limited leg space in an economy class seat and a passenger with an above-knee leg plaster or an ankylosed knee or hip may simply not fit in the available space the long period of immobility in an uncomfortable position must be taken into account and it is imperative to ensure adequate pain control for the duration of the journey particularly following surgery or trauma even in the premier class cabins with more available legroom there are limits to space to avoid impeding emergency egress immobilized or disabled passengers cannot be seated adjacent to emergency exits despite the availability of increased leg room at many of these positions similarly a plastered leg cannot be stretched into the aisle because of the conflict with safety regulations there is limited space in aircraft toilet compartments and if assistance is necessary a traveling companion is required the complexities of the airport environment should not be underestimated and must be considered during the assessment of fitness to fly the formalities of check-in and departure procedures are demanding and can be stressful and this can be compounded by illness and disability as well as by language difficulties or jet lag the operational effect of the use of equipment such as wheelchairs ambulances and stretchers must be taken into account and the possibility of aircraft delays or diversion to another airport must be considered it may be necessary to change aircraft and transit between terminals during the course of a long journey and landside medical facilities will not be available to a transiting passenger there is often a long distance between the check-in desk and the boarding gate not all flights depart from or arrive to jetties and it may be necessary to climb up or down stairs and board transfer coaches passengers should specify the level of assistance required when booking facilities such as wheelchairs in addition to the main gaseous system all commercial aircraft carry an emergency oxygen supply for use in the event of failure of the pressurization system or during emergencies such as fire or smoke in the cabin the passenger supply is delivered through drop-down masks from chemical generators or an emergency reservoir and the crew supply is from oxygen bottles strategically located within the cabin the drop-down masks are automatically released en masse the so-called rubber jungle in the event of the cabin altitude exceeding a pre-determined level of between 10 000 and 14 000 ft this passenger emergency supply has a limited duration if provided by chemical generators usually in the region of 10 min the flow rate is between 4 and 8 l ntpmin and is continuous once the supply is triggered by the passenger pulling on the connecting tube oxygen supplied from an emergency reservoir is delivered to the cabin via a ring main and in some aircraft it is possible to plug a mask into this ring main to provide supplementary oxygen for a passenger sufficient first-aid oxygen bottles are carried to allow the delivery of oxygen to a passenger in case of a medical emergency in-flight at a rate of 2 or 4 l ntpmin this cannot be used to provide a pre-meditated supply for a passenger requiring it continuously throughout a journey however since it would then not be available for emergency use if a passenger has a condition requiring continuous scheduled oxygen for a journey this needs pre-notification to the airline at the time of booking the ticket most airlines charge a fee one major british international airline charges gb100 us170 euro146 per sector whether the supply is derived from gaseous bottles or via a mask plugged into the ring main for us carriers a fee of approximately us100 85 is charged for providing oxygen during flight some airlines also allow passengers to use their own portable oxygen concentrators provided the unit meets certain specifications an additional fee may be charged for medical clearance by an airline representative passengers who require continuous oxygen during travel should be made aware that airlines provide oxygen service only during the flight and not during the time spent in the airport terminal passengers need to make arrangements for oxygen to be supplied at their destination upon arrival oxygen bottles regulators and masks must meet minimum safety standards set by the regulatory authorities and the oxygen must be of aviation quality which is a higher specification than medical quality regulations regarding in-flight oxygen use are in flux for further information regarding therapeutic oxygen for airline passengers see websites wwwmedairecom

 an in-flight medical emergency is defined as a medical occurrence requiring the assistance of the cabin crew it may or may not involve the use of medical equipment or drugs and may or may not involve a request for assistance from a medical professional traveling as a passenger on the flight it can be something as simple as a headache or a vaso-vagal episode or something major such as a myocardial infarction or impending childbirth the incidence is comparatively low although the media impact of an event can be significant one major international airline recently reported 3022 incidents occurring in something over 34 million passengers carried in 1 year the breakdown of these incidents into generalized causes is shown in table 462
39 40
 the top six in-flight emergency medical conditions reported by the same airline are shown in table 463
39 40 any acute medical condition occurring during the course of a flight can be alarming for the passenger and crew because of the remoteness of the environment cabin crew members receive training in advanced first aid and basic life support and the use of the emergency medical equipment carried on board the aircraft many airlines give training in excess of the regulatory requirement particularly when an extended range of medical equipment is carried although the crew are trained to handle common medical emergencies in serious cases they may request assistance from a medical professional traveling as a passenger such assisting professionals are referred to as good samaritans cabin crew members attempt to establish the bona fide of medical professionals offering to assist but much has to be taken on trust the international nature of air travel can lead to complications in terms of professional qualification and certification specialist knowledge and professional liability an aircraft in flight is subject to the laws of the state in which it is registered although when not moving under its own power ie stationary at the airport it is subject to the local law in some countries it is a statutory requirement for a medical professional to offer assistance to a sick or injured person eg france whereas in other states no such law exists eg uk or usa some countries eg usa have enacted a good samaritan law whereby an assisting professional delivering emergency medical care within the bounds of his or her competence is not liable for prosecution for negligence in the uk the major medical defense insurance companies provide indemnity for their members acting as good samaritans some airlines provide full indemnity for medical professionals assisting in response to a request from the crew whereas other airlines take the view that a professional relationship is established between the sick passenger and the good samaritan and any liability lies within that relationship at the time of writing there has been no case of successful action against a good samaritan providing assistance on board an aircraft recognition by the airline of the assistance given by the good samaritan is complicated by the special nature of the relationship between the professional the patient and the airline indemnity whether provided by the airline or the professionals defense organization depends upon the fact that a good samaritan act is performed if a professional fee is claimed or offered the relationship moves away from being that of a good samaritan act to one of a professional interaction with an acceptance of clinical responsibility this implies that the professional is suitably trained qualified and experienced to diagnose treat and follow-up the particular case and the good samaritan indemnity provision no longer applies follow-up of the outcome for the passenger after disembarkation is frequently difficult because the sick passenger is no longer in the care of the airline and becomes the responsibility of the receiving hospital or medical practitioner responsibility for the conduct of the flight rests with the aircraft captain who makes the final decision as to whether or not an immediate unscheduled landing or diversion is required for the well-being of a sick passenger the captain has to take into account operational factors as well as the medical condition of the sick passenger in practice it is rarely possible to land immediately even if a suitable airport is in the immediate vicinity the aircraft has to descend from cruising altitude possibly jettison fuel to reduce to landing weight and then fly the approach procedure to land consideration has to be given to the availability of appropriate medical facilities and in many cases it is of greater benefit for the sick passenger to continue to the scheduled destination where the advantage of appropriate facilities will outweigh the risks of continuing the flight operational factors to be considered include the suitability of an airport to receive the particular aircraft type the runway must be of sufficient length and load-bearing capacity the terminal must be able to accommodate the number of passengers on the flight and if the crew go out of duty time there must be sufficient hotel accommodation to allow an overnight stay of crew and passengers the cost to the airline may be substantial including the effects of aircraft and crew unavailability for the next scheduled sector as well as the direct airport and fuel costs of the diversion in making the decision whether or not to divert the captain will take advice from all sources if a good samaritan is assisting he or she has an important role to play perhaps in radio consultation with the airline medical advisor many airlines use an air-to-ground link which allows the captain andor the good samaritan to confer with the airline medical adviser regarding the diagnosis treatment and prognosis of the sick passenger the airline operations department is also involved in the decision-making process some airlines maintain a worldwide database of medical facilities available at or near the major airports others subscribe to a third party provider giving access to immediate medical advice and assistance with arranging emergency medical care for the sick passenger at the diversion airport the link from the aircraft is made using either radio-telephone voice or datalink vhf or acars high-frequency radio communication hf or a satellite communication system satcom satcom is installed in newer long-range aircraft and is gradually replacing hf as the industry norm for long-range communication the advantage is that satcom is unaffected by terrain topography or atmospheric conditions and allows good transmission of voice and data from over any point on the globe digitization and telephone transmission of physiological parameters is a well established practice particularly in remote areas of the world an aircraft cabin at 37 000 ft 11 500 m can be considered a remote location in terms of availability of medical support and the digital technology used in satcom is similar to that used in modern ground-to-ground communication the advent of satcom has enabled the development of air-to-ground transmission to assist in diagnosis pulse oximetry and ecg are examples of data that can assist the medical advisor to give appropriate advice to the aircraft captain although the costbenefit analysis has to be weighed very carefully40
 national regulatory authorities stipulate the minimum scale and standard of all equipment to be carried on aircraft operating under their jurisdiction which includes emergency medical equipment these standards stipulate the minimum requirement although in practice many airlines carry considerably more equipment 
tables 464
and 465
give the minimum standard of equipment mandated by the federal aviation administration faa to be carried by aircraft registered in the usa while table 466
gives the standard determined by the joint aviation authorities jaa for aircraft registered in european states in determining the type and quantity of equipment and drugs to include in the medical kits the airline must fulfill the statutory requirements laid down by the regulatory authority other factors to be considered arethe route structure and stage lengths flown different countries of the world vary in their regulations on what might be imported and exported particularly in terms of drugs for example it is illegal to import morphine derivatives into the usa even if securely locked in a medical kit
passenger expectations premier class business passengers from the developed world expect a higher standard of care and medical provision than passengers traveling on a relatively inexpensive package holiday flighttraining of cabin crew the crew must have a knowledge and understanding of the kit contents for use by themselves or in assisting a good samaritan they must be proficient in first aid resuscitation and basic life supportdifferences in medical cultures ideally the kit contents should be familiar to any good samaritan irrespective of nationality or training some authorities require information and drug names to be given in more than one languageequipment and drugs appropriate for likely medical emergencies it is important to audit the incidence and outcome of in-flight medical emergencies and maintain a review of the kit content this review should also take into account changes in medical practicespace and weight the medical equipment must be accessible but securely stowed some airlines divide the equipment and drugs between basic first-aid kits which are readily accessible on the catering trolleys and a more comprehensive emergency medical kit that is sealed and stowed with other emergency equipment space and weight are always at a premium within the cabin and the medical kits must be as light and compact as possibleshelf life and replenishment a tracking system for each kit must be in place to ensure that contents have not exceeded their designated shelf life similarly after use of a kit there has to be a procedure for replenishment in practice the aircraft can depart if the kit contents meet the statutory minimum even though drugs or equipment have been used from the non-statutory part of the kit many airlines subcontract the tracking and replenishment to a specialist medical supply company
 although basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr techniques are an essential part of cabin crew training the outcome of an in-flight cardiac event may be improved if appropriate resuscitation equipment is available this can range from a simple mouth-to-mouth faceguard to a resuscitation bag and mask and airway to an endotracheal tube and laryngoscope to an automatic external defibrillator aed the decision on the scale of equipment to be carried has to take account of the same parameters used in determining the content of the emergency medical kits table 465 in addition a costbenefit analysis has to balance the cost of acquisition maintenance and training against the probability of need and the expectation of the traveling public the european resuscitation committee and the american heart association endorse the concept of early defibrillation as the standard of care for a cardiac event both in and out of the hospital setting however the protocol includes early transfer to an intensive care facility for continuing monitoring and treatment which is not always possible in the flight environment despite this inability to complete the resuscitation chain it is becoming increasingly common for commercial aircraft to be equipped with aeds and for the cabin crew to be trained in their use this has been mandated in the usa by the faa table 465 experience of those airlines which carry aeds indicates that there may be benefits to the airline operation as well as to the passenger some types of aed have a cardiac monitoring facility and this can be of benefit in reaching the decision on whether or not to divert for example there is no point in initiating a diversion if the monitor shows asystole or if it suggests that the chest pain is unlikely to be cardiac in origin lives have been saved by the use of aeds on aircraft and diversions have been avoided so it could be argued that the costbenefit analysis is weighted in favor of carrying aeds as part of the aircraft medical equipment nonetheless it is important that unrealistic expectations are not raised an aircraft cabin is not an intensive care unit and the aed forms only a part of the first aid and resuscitation equipment many airlines have in place a procedure for the follow-up of crew members involved in a distressing event such as a serious medical emergency this can be valuable in avoiding long-term post-traumatic stress disorder and also in reinforcing the training that the crew member has already undergone the pressurized aircraft cabin provides protection against the hostile environment encountered at cruising altitudesalthough the partial pressure of oxygen is less than at sea level it is more than adequate in a pressurized aircraft cabin for normal healthy individualsthe cabin air although dry does not cause systemic dehydration and harm to health dry skin and eyes can lead to discomfort which can be alleviated by the use of moisturizing creams and eye dropsalthough up to half of the air in modern pressurized aircraft is recirculated the amount of fresh air available to each occupant exceeds that available in air-conditioned buildings recirculating the air has the advantage of reducing cold draughts and increasing the humidityin modern aircraft all the recirculated air is passed through high-efficiency particulate filters which remove 99 of particles including bacteria and virusesthere is an extremely low probability of airline passengers or crew suffering any abnormality or disease as a result of exposure to cosmic radiation
 the passenger cabin of a commercial airliner is designed to carry the maximum number of passengers in safety and comfort within the constraints of cost-effectiveness it is incompatible with providing the facilities of an ambulance an emergency room an intensive care unit a delivery suite or a mortuary the ease and accessibility of air travel to a population of changing demographics inevitably means that there are those who wish to fly who may not cope with the hostile physical environment of the airport or the hostile physiological environment of the pressurized passenger cabin it is important for medical professionals to be aware of the relevant factors and for unrealistic public expectations to be avoided transmission aboard aircraft of illnesses such as tuberculosis sars and other respiratory diseases has been reported but is infrequently documented and probably rare there is no evidence that a properly functioning environmental control system contributes to increased disease transmission aboard an aircraft most airlines have a medical advisor who may be consulted before flight to discuss the implications for a particular passenger such pre-flight notification can prevent the development of an in-flight medical emergency that is hazardous to the passenger concerned inconvenient to fellow passengers and expensive for the airline for those with disability but not an acute medical problem pre-flight notification of special needs and assistance will reduce the stress of the journey and enhance the standard of service delivered by the airline the importance of adequate medical insurance coverage for all travelers cannot be over-emphasized finally as is the case in commercial aviation there is a continuing audit of activity and an ongoing riskbenefit analysis the industry is under constant evolution and is now truly global in its activity application of basic physics and physiology and an understanding of how this may affect underlying pathology will minimize the medical risks to the traveling public18
  trace quarantine test isolate and treat a kerala model of covid-19 response  kerala reported the first three cases of coronavirus in india in late january kerala one of the indias most densely populated states which makes its success in fighting the covid-19 all the more commendable moreover an estimated 17 of its 35 million population employed or lives elsewhere more than 1 million tourists visit each year and hundreds of students study abroad including in china all of this mobility makes the state more vulnerable to contagious outbreaks what is the strategy behind the success story this paper compares the situation of covid-19 pandemic in major states and kerala by the different phase of lockdown and also highlights keralas fight against the pandemic we used publicly available data from httpswwwcovid19indiaorg and covid-19 daily bulletin jan 31-may 31 directorate of health services kerala httpsdashboardkeralagovin we calculate the phase-wise period prevalence rate ppr and the case fatality rate cfr of the last phase compared to other major states kerala showed better response in preventing pandemic the equation for the keralas success has been simple prioritized testing widespread contact tracing and promoting social distance they also imposed uncompromising controls were supported by an excellent healthcare system government accountability transparency public trust civil rights and importantly the decentralized governance and strong grass-root level institutions the proactive measures taken by kerala such as early detection of cases and extensive social support measures can be a model for india and the world  since the first case of covid-19 reported at the end of january india has reported more than 250000 covid-19 infections more than 7000 people have died due to the virus as of 31 may the testing positivity rate in the country was near 4 the death rate from the pandemic was around 3 and the doubling rate of disease -or the amount of time it takes to double the covid-19 infections was 12 days 40 recovery rate of infected patients was reported in this period 1 same as other countries there are hotspots and clusters of infection in india nearly 80 of the active cases are in five major states -maharashtra tamil nadu delhi gujarat and madhya pradesh and importantly more than 60 of the cases in five cities including mumbai delhi chennai and ahmedabad according to government reports 2  india with a draconian nature of nationwide lockdown appears to be done relatively worse in preventing the number of confirmed cases compared to other countries with less restrictive regimes 3 nearly more than half of patients who have died of the infection have been aged 60 and above and many have underlying conditions hewing to the international data about older people being more vulnerable to the disease 4 at the same time nearly 13 percent of the kerala population are aged over 60 5 as per economic review by state planning board around 27 percent men and 19 percent women are diabetic 41 percent men and 39 percent women are hypertensive more than one lakh people are being treated for cancer 53 lakh people have chronic pulmonary disease and 48 lakh have asthma 6 this paper compares the situation of covid-19 pandemic in above mentioned major states and kerala by the different phase of lockdown and also highlights keralas fight against the pandemic kerala a small state in india the land that proclaims itself as gods own country is a heaven for tourists who make a beeline to the backwaters palm-fringed sunset beaches lush hills of the western ghats and the spice plantations on the mountain slopes kerala has been known around the globe as a model for preventing the spread of covid-19 global media have been pouring praise on the states success 7 8  kerala reported the first three cases of coronavirus in india in late january all three victims being indians who had studied in wuhan later own kerala received people from italy too with positive cases including a whole family tested positive the state soon began implementing mandatory quarantines for visitors arriving from abroad and from outside of the state weeks before the centre instituted similar measures across the country a detailed guideline to deal with a new coronavirus was issued by the department of health and family welfare of kerala on 5th january 2020 much earlier than the first case detection in india importation and transmission-based approach for testing strategy on january 26th 2020 even before the first case of covid-19 was reported in the state 9 the critical situation is that kerala is a small state 38863 sqkm but it homes for 35 million people makes it 819 people per square kilometer eight most densely state in india other than people living in closely kerala has 25 lakh migrants who frequently travel to their native land in addition to that international travelling is a part of kerala culture which is connected to the rest of the world through four airports serve around 17 million passengers annually finally kerala has 25 million migrant laborers from other states simply population density affluent non-resident keralites and thriving tourism all raise the risk for an outbreak in kerala however the containment strategies adopted by kerala have helped in slowing the spread of infection into the community by the end of may 10 study also suggests that the head start that kerala had in preventing the spread of the disease in the initial phase may help the state in dealing with the next wave of the disease 11 kerala opted for a combination of massive testing quarantine and support of the poor with positive short-term effects 12 by january itself the government started promoting using the face masks on february 3 the state government declared covid-19 as state calamity and drafted measures to be followed by the beginning of march government introduced more precautionary measures by shutting down the schools and colleges and asking all religious and other groups cancel all gatherings including marriages to encourage social distancing 13 on the nutritional point of view free meals delivered for school children at their home the government also instructed internet service providers to improve the bandwidth to encourage work from home 14 the

community spread then it reduced to fewer numbers in first two phases of lockdown due to the uncompromising regulations to prevent the social contact while in third phase isolation per active case got

period was the security of the migrant workers from other states just after the announcement of the national lockdown the state set up nearly 20000 camps for migrant laborers by calling them guest workers 3 lakh workers were hosted in these places and urged to wait in place till the special trains will be arranged to take them home the second challenge was the returning migration from abroad they were tested before taking the flight and rechecked after landing in kerala once they reach kerala they will be taken to government facility for quarantine in respected districts and requested to stay there until the time of quarantine is over same time government set up isolation wards in all medical colleges district and general hospitals besides around 650 corona care centers were created

past years ordinarily making good use of the active and voluntary engagement of the public while the rest of india worries about the rate at which new cases are doubling that question has become almost irrelevant in kerala the curve has been flattened for now and transmission limited currently how it manages to ease the lockdown safely will depend on a large number of factors the summer

in wuhan city in the late december 20191 the pneumonia infection has rapidly spread from wuhan to most other provinces and other 24 countries23 world health organization declared a public health emergency of international concern over this global pneumonia outbreak on 30th january 2020 the typical clinical symptoms of the patients who suffered from the novel viral pneumonia were fever cough and myalgia or fatigue with abnormal chest ct and the less common symptoms were sputum production headache hemoptysis and diarrhea46 this new infectious agent is more likely to affect older males to cause severe respiratory diseases78 some of the clinical symptoms were different from the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by sars coronavirus sars-cov that happened in 20022003 indicating that a new person-to-person transmission infectious agent has caused this emergent viral pneumonia outbreak89 chinese researchers have quickly isolated a new virus from the patient and sequenced its genome 29903 nucleotides10 the infectious agent of this viral pneumonia happenening in wuhan was finally identified as a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans11 on 11th february 2020 who named the novel viral pneumonia as corona virus disease covid19 while the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv suggested this novel coronavirus name as sars-cov-2 due to the phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis of this novel coronavirus12 coronaviruses belong to the family of coronaviridae of the order nidovirales comprising large single plus-stranded rna as their genome1314 currently there are four genera of coronaviruses -cov -cov -cov and -cov1516 most of the coronavirus can cause the infectious diseases in human and vertebrates the -cov and -cov mainly infect the respiratory gastrointestinal and central nervous system of humans and mammals while -cov and -cov mainly infect the birds131719 usually several members of the coronavirus cause mild respiratory disease in humans however sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov explored in 20022003 and in 2012 respectively caused fatal severe respiratory diseases2022 the sars-cov and mers-cov belong to the -cov2324 2019-ncov explored in wuhan also belongs to the -cov according to the phylogenetic analysis based on the viral genome1011 although the nucleotide sequence similarity is less than 80 between 2019-ncov and sars-cov about 79 or mers-cov about 50 2019-ncov can also cause the fetal infection and spread more faster than the two other coronaviruses79112527 the genome nucleotide sequence identity between a coronavirus batcov ratg13 detected in the bat rhinolophus affinis from yunnan province china and 2019-ncov was 962 indicating that the natural host of 2019-ncov may also be the rhinolophus affinis bat11 however the differences may also suggest that there is an or more intermediate hosts between the bat and human a research team from the south china agricultural university has invested more than 1 000 metagenomic samples from pangolins and found that 70 pangolins contained -cov28 one of the coronaviruses they isolated from the pangolins comprised a genome that was very similar with that from 2019-ncov and the genome sequence similarity was 99 indicating that the pangolin may be the intermediate host of 2019-ncov29 2019-ncov possessed the typical coronavirus structure with the spike protein in the membrane envelope30 and also expressed other polyproteins nucleoproteins and membrane proteins such as rna polymerase 3-chymotrypsin-like protease papain-like protease helicase glycoprotein and accessory proteins101130 the s protein from coronavirus can bind to the receptors of the host to facilitate viral entry into target cells3132 although there are four amino acid variations of s protein between 2019-ncov and sars-cov 2019-ncov can also bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the same host receptor for sars-cov as 2019-ncov can bind to the ace2 receptor from the cells from human bat civet cat and pig but it cannot bind to the cells without ace2113335 a recombinant ace2-ig antibody a sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibody and the serum from a convalescent sars-cov-infected patient which can neutralize 2019-ncov confirmed ace2 as the host receptor for 2019-ncov3639 the high affinity between ace2 and 2019-ncov s protein also suggested that the population with higher expression of ace2 might be more susceptible to 2019-ncov4041 the cellular serine protease tmprss2 also contributed to the s-protein priming of 2019-ncov indicating that the tmprss2 inhibitor might constitute a treatment option36 the common transmission routes of novel coronavirus include direct transmission cough sneeze and droplet inhalation transmission and contact transmission contact with oral nasal and eye mucous membranes42 although common clinical manifestations of novel coronavirus infection do not include eye symptoms the analysis of conjunctival samples from confirmed and suspected cases of 2019-ncov suggests that the transmission of 2019-ncov is not limited to the respiratory tract4 and that eye exposure may provide an effective way for the virus to enter the body43 in addition studies have shown that respiratory viruses can be transmitted from person to person through direct or indirect contact or through coarse or small droplets and 2019-ncov can also be transmitted directly or indirectly through saliva44 notably a report of one case of 2019-ncov infection in germany indicates that transmission of the virus may also occur through contact with asymptomatic patients45 studies have suggested that 2019-ncov may be airborne through aerosols formed during medical procedures46 it is notable that 2019-ncov rna could also be detected by rrt-pcr testing in a stool specimen collected on day 7 of the patients illness47 however the aerosol transmission route and the fecaloral transmission route concerned by the public still need to be further studied and confirmed the airborne spread of sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is well-reported in many literatures the dental papers show that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with virus55 thus droplet and aerosol transmission of 2019-ncov are the most important concerns in dental clinics and hospitals because it is hard to avoid the generation of large amounts of aerosol and droplet mixed with patients saliva and even blood during dental practice53 in addition to the infected patients cough and breathing dental devices such as high-speed dental handpiece uses high-speed gas to drive the turbine to rotate at high speed and work with running water when dental devices work in the patients oral cavity a large amount of aerosol and droplets mixed with the patients saliva or even blood will be generated particles of droplets and aerosols are small enough to stay airborne for an extended period before they settle on environmental surfaces or enter the respiratory tract thus the 2019-ncov has the potential to spread through droplets and aerosols from infected individuals in dental clinics and hospitals a dental professionals frequent direct or indirect contact with human fluids patient materials and contaminated dental instruments or environmental surfaces makes a possible route to the spread of viruses53 in addition dental professionals and other patients have likely contact of conjunctival nasal or oral mucosa with droplets and aerosols containing microorganisms generated from an infected individual and propelled a short distance by coughing and talking without a mask effective infection control strategies are needed to prevent the spread of 2019-ncov through these contact routines human coronaviruses such as sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov or endemic human coronaviruses hcov can persist on surfaces like metal glass or plastic for up to a couple of days5156 therefore contaminated surfaces that are frequently contacted in healthcare settings are a potential source of coronavirus transmission dental practices derived droplets and aerosols from infected patients which likely contaminate the whole surface in dental offices in addition it was shown at room temperature that hcov remains infectious from 2 h up to 9 days and persists better at 50 compared with 30 relative humidity thus keeping a clean and dry environment in the dental office would help decrease the persistence of 2019-ncov first of all dental professionals should be able to identify a suspected case of covid-19 to date that this paper was drafted the national health commission of the peoples republic of china has released the 5th edition of the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia in general a patient with covid-19 who is in the acute febrile phase of the disease is not recommended to visit the dental clinic if this does occur the dental professional should be able to identify the patient with suspected 2019-ncov infection and should not treat the patient in the dental clinic but immediately quarantine the patient and report to the infection control department as soon as possible particularly in the epidemic period of 2019-ncov the body temperature of the patient should be measured in the first place a contact-free forehead thermometer is strongly recommended for the screening a questionnaire should be used to screen patients with potential infection of 2019-ncov before they could be led to the dental chair-side these questions should include the following 1 do you have fever or experience fever within the past 14 days 2 have you experienced a recent onset of respiratory problems such as a cough or difficulty in breathing within the past 14 days 3 have you within the past 14 days traveled to wuhan city and its surrounding areas or visited the neighborhood with documented 2019-ncov transmission 4 have you come into contact with a patient with confirmed 2019-ncov infection within the past 14 days 5 have you come into contact with people who come from wuhan city and its surrounding areas or people from the neighborhood with recent documented fever or respiratory problems within the past 14 days 6 are there at least two people with documented experience of fever or respiratory problems within the last 14 days having close contact with you 7 have you recently participated in any gathering meetings or had close contact with many unacquainted people if a patient replies yes to any of the screening questions and hisher body temperature is below 373 c the dentist can defer the treatment until 14 days after the exposure event the patient should be instructed to self-quarantine at home and report any fever experience or flu-like syndrome to the local health department if a patient replies yes to any of the screening questions and hisher body temperature is no less than 373 c the patient should be immediately quarantined and the dental professionals should report to the infection control department of the hospital or the local health department if a patient replies no to all the screening questions and hisher body temperature is below 373 c the dentist can treat the patient with extra- protection measures and avoids spatter or aerosol-generating procedures to the best if a patient replies no to all the screening questions but hisher body temperature is no less than 373 c the patient should be instructed to the fever clinics or special clinics for covid-19 for further medical care fecaloral transmission has been reported for 2019-ncov which underlines the importance of hand hygiene for dental practice although appropriate hand hygiene is the routine prerequisite for dental practice hand-washing compliance is relatively low which imposes a great challenge to the infection control during the epidemic period of 2019-ncov transmission reinforcement for good hand hygiene is of the utmost importance a two-before-and-three-after hand hygiene guideline is proposed by the infection control department of the west china hospital of stomatology sichuan university to reinforce the compliance of hand washing specifically the oral professionals should wash their hands before patient examination before dental procedures after touching the patient after touching the surroundings and equipment without disinfection and after touching the oral mucosa damaged skin or wound blood body fluid secretion and excreta more caution should be taken for the dental professionals to avoid touching their own eyes mouth and nose at present there is no specific guideline for the protection of dental professionals from 2019-ncov infection in the dental clinics and hospitals although no dental professional has been reported to acquire 2019-ncov infection to the date the paper was drafted the last experience with the sars coronavirus has shown vast numbers of acquired infection of medical professionals in hospital settings57 since airborne droplet transmission of infection is considered as the main route of spread particularly in dental clinics and hospitals barrier-protection equipment including protective eyewear masks gloves caps face shields and protective outwear is strongly recommended for all healthcare givers in the clinichospital settings during the epidemic period of 2019-ncov based on the possibility of the spread of 2019-ncov infection three-level protective measures of the dental professionals are recommended for specific situations 1 primary protection standard protection for staff in clinical settings wearing disposable working cap disposable surgical mask and working clothes white coat using protective goggles or face shield and disposable latex gloves or nitrile gloves if necessary 2 secondary protection advanced protection for dental professionals wearing disposable doctor cap disposable surgical mask protective goggles face shield and working clothes white coat with disposable isolation clothing or surgical clothes outside and disposable latex gloves 3 tertiary protection strengthened protection when contact patient with suspected or confirmed 2019-ncov infection although a patient with 2019-ncov infection is not expected to be treated in the dental clinic in the unlikely event that this does occur and the dental professional cannot avoid close contact special protective outwear is needed if protective outwear is not available working clothes white coat with extra disposable protective clothing outside should be worn in addition disposable doctor cap protective goggles face shield disposable surgical mask disposable latex gloves and impermeable shoe cover should be worn a preoperational antimicrobial mouthrinse is generally believed to reduce the number of oral microbes however as instructed by the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia the 5th edition released by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china chlorhexidine which is commonly used as mouthrinse in dental practice may not be effective to kill 2019-ncov since 2019-ncov is vulnerable to oxidation preprocedural mouthrinse containing oxidative agents such as 1 hydrogen peroxide or 02 povidone is recommended for the purpose of reducing the salivary load of oral microbes including potential 2019-ncov carriage a preprocedural mouthrinse would be most useful in cases when rubber dam cannot be used the use of rubber dams can significantly minimize the production of saliva- and blood-contaminated aerosol or spatter particularly in cases when high-speed handpieces and dental ultrasonic devices are used it has been reported that the use of rubber dam could significantly reduce airborne particles in 3-foot diameter of the operational field by 7058 when rubber dam is applied extra high-volume suction for aerosol and spatter should be used during the procedures along with regular suction59 in this case the implementation of a complete four-hand operation is also necessary if rubber dam isolation is not possible in some cases manual devices such as carisolv and hand scaler are recommended for caries removal and periodontal scaling in order to minimize the generation of aerosol as much as possible the high-speed dental handpiece without anti-retraction valves may aspirate and expel the debris and fluids during the dental procedures more importantly the microbes including bacteria and virus may further contaminate the air and water tubes within the dental unit and thus can potentially cause cross-infection our study has shown that the anti-retraction high-speed dental handpiece can significantly reduce the backflow of oral bacteria and hbv into the tubes of the handpiece and dental unit as compared with the handpiece without anti-retraction function60 therefore the use of dental handpieces without anti-retraction function should be prohibited during the epidemic period of covid-19 anti-retraction dental handpiece with specially designed anti-retractive valves or other anti-reflux designs are strongly recommended as an extra preventive measure for cross-infection59 therefore the use of dental handpieces without anti-retraction function should be prohibited during the epidemic period of covid-19 anti-retraction dental handpiece with specially designed anti-retractive valves or other anti-reflux designs are strongly recommended as an extra preventive measure for cross-infection medical institutions should take effective and strict disinfection measures in both clinic settings and public area the clinic settings should be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with the protocol for the management of surface cleaning and disinfection of medical environment wst 512-2016 released by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china public areas and appliances should also be frequently cleaned and disinfected including door handles chairs and desks the elevator should be disinfected regularly people taking elevators should wear masks correctly and avoid direct contact with buttons and other objects the medical waste including disposable protective equipment after use should be transported to the temporary storage area of the medical institute timely the reusable instrument and items should be pretreated cleaned sterilized and properly stored in accordance with the protocol for the disinfection and sterilization of dental instrument ws 506-2016 released by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china the medical and domestic waste generated by the treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-ncov infection are regarded as infectious medical waste double-layer yellow color medical waste package bags and gooseneck ligation should be used the surface of the package bags should be marked and disposed according to the requirement for the management of medical waste since december 2019 the newly discovered coronavirus 2019-ncov has caused the outbreak of pneumonia in wuhan and throughout china 2019-ncov enters host cells through human cell receptor ace2 the same with sars-cov but with higher binding affinity61 the rapidly increasing number of cases and evidence of human-to-human transmission suggested that the virus was more contagious than sars-cov and mers-cov9252761 by mid-february 2020 a large number of infections of medical staff have been reported62 and the specific reasons for the failure of protection need to be further investigated although clinics such as stomatology have been closed during the epidemic a large number of emergency patients still go to the dental clinics and hospitals for treatment we have summarized the possible transmission routes of 2019-ncov in stomatology such as the airborne spread contact spread and contaminated surface spread we also reviewed several detailed practical strategies to block virus transmission to provide a reference for preventing the transmission of 2019-ncov during dental diagnosis and treatment including patient evaluation hand hygiene personal protective measures for the dental professionals

participation on suicidal ideation and stress in high school adolescents from south korea saengryeol park so-youn park su jang yeon gapjin oh in-hwan oh   mental health problems constitute a high proportion 16 of global disease and injury burden among adolescents 1 in south korea such problems are projected to become the third leading disease group of disability-adjusted life years among adolescents by 2030 2 psychological problems in this country tend to begin during adolescence 14 years 1 and are diagnosed at a young age 25 years 3 in 2016 424 of adolescents experienced high stress with suicide being the greatest cause of mortality 4 given that suicidal ideation could be an early contributing factor of suicide attempts 5 an urgent investigation is needed to cope with the spread of suicidal ideation and stress factors linked to suicidal ideation and stress in adolescents are well established at the intrapersonal interpersonal and community levels for example being male having good physical health 6 social support 7 low body mass index 8 and living in rural areas 9 are associated with decreased suicidal ideation social support from family and high academic achievement are associated with less stress 10 while subjective health 11 and high body weight 12 are linked to high stress importantly increased physical activity is correlated with low suicidal ideation 13 and stress 1415 despite the possible benefits many high school students are less likely to participate in physical activity outside of school vigorous physical activity  2726 minweek moderate physical activity  3699 minweek 16 however when adolescents participated in high levels of physical education at school they also exhibited elevated physical activity outside of school 17 this link implies the need to verify the potential role of physical education on adolescent mental health  a number of beneficial associations between physical education and mental health have been reported 18 for example students who engaged in frequent physical education also had high academic achievement 19 in addition increased participation in physical education is associated with a lower likelihood of obesity and cardiovascular risk among adolescents 20 likewise when adolescents have good experiences with their physical education they may accumulate a positive attitude towards physical activity generally 21 positive interactions with teachers could also affect health-related quality of life 22 therefore these classes are potentially an important setting to promote values eg active lifestyles that discourage suicidal ideation and stress however as far as we are aware little is known regarding the role of physical education in influencing suicidal ideation and stress among adolescents available research on physical education has largely focused on improvements to leisure-time physical activity and physical health 232425 although a study found no associations between physical education and suicidal behaviors in middle school students 26 high educational pressure forces adolescents to spend about 15 h a day on studying including school homework and private tutoring cram schools 27 this heavy workload may lead to elevated stress levels despite the compulsory nature of physical education in south korea 28 approximately 75 of high schools failed to implement national curriculum guidelines for physical education 150 minweek 29 instead replacing that time with self-guided study to prepare for university admission exams 28 promoting awareness of physical activitys potential ameliorating effects is one strategy to proactively cope with mental health problems in adolescents the aim of this research was to verify whether participating in physical education influences suicidal ideation and stress in high school students from south korea because physical activity participation has a clear gender difference 16 we examined male and female students separately in total 65528 participants were included in the twelfth korea youth risk behaviour web-based survey 2016 kyrbs figure 1 only high school students were included in the current analysis participants with missing data on body mass index bmi academic achievement and school type were excluded to yield a final sample size of 28451  the current cross-sectional study was conducted from october 2019 to february 2020 using the secondary data obtained from kyrbs 30 after ethics approval by the universitys institutional review board irb no khsirb-19-354 ea kyrbs which is an internet-based and self-administered national survey was set up to monitor school health and has been managed by south koreas centers for disease and prevention cdc since 2005 kyrbs uses a multi-stage cluster sampling design to collect data on health-risk behaviors in south korean adolescents including smoking status alcohol obesity diet and physical activity 31 during the data collection of kyrbs students did not provide any personal identifiers such as names phone numbers or living address participating students were all volunteers across 400 middle and high schools representing 17 administrative areas students took the survey in their schools computer room under teacher supervision and their anonymity was ensured they provided consent before the survey was initiated 32 detailed procedures are published elsewhere 31 subjective health is an individuals own perception of overall or physical health status 33 subjective health was assessed with a one-item scale how would you rate your health in general on a five-point likert scale very unhealthy  1 to very healthy  5 34 high scores indicate high subjective health social support is the emotional or tangible support from interpersonal relationships evidence suggests it modulates physical and mental health 35 social support was assessed with a one-item scale can you talk about your concerns with people ie father mother brothers sisters friends teachers and others answers were dichotomized no  0 and yes  1 36 to calculate bmi kgm2 weight kg is divided by the square of height m this index is a rough measure of body fat and is widely used to categorize individuals as normal weight overweight or obese 37 bmi was estimated via self-reported height and weight academic achievement or how well a student performs in school affects socio-economic status accessibility of medical care and occupational choices 38 as students are aware of these long-term outcomes scholastic performance may influence their mental health academic achievement was assessed with one item how was your grade point average in the last 12 months and recorded on a five-point likert scale low  1 mid-low  2 mid  3 mid-high  4 high  5 39 the scale was converted into a three-level variable lowmid-low  1 mid  2 mid-high high  3 40 high scores indicate high academic achievement physical education is the planned instruction of exercises and other physical activity during school hours 41 physical education participation was measured using one item in an average week when you are in school on how many days do you exercise in physical education classes on a four-point likert scale 0 1 2 3 timesweek 23 the scale was converted into a three-level variable 0 1 2 timesweek participant living environment was categorized into rural  0 and urban  1 rural areas included countries and urban areas included metropolitan cities suicidal ideation is thinking about considering or planning suicide 42 and was assessed using one item during the past 12 months did you ever seriously think about committing suicide 27 the answer was recorded as no  0 or yes  1 stress is the anxiety discomfort and emotional tension that occurs after perceiving a threat or other difficult situation 43 stress was measured with one item how often do you feel stress in your typical daily life on a five-point likert scale not at all  1 not so much  2 a little bit  3 frequently  4 very frequently  5 39 the answer was categorized as not stressed  0 1 2 3 or stressed  1 4 5 43 a range of demographic information was collected including age and perceived household economic status the latter was assessed using one item how do you perceive your household economic status on a five-point likert scale low  1 to high  5 43 the answer was transformed into three categories low  1 medium  2 high  3 higher scores indicate better economic status in kyrbs high schools were categorized into academic and vocational 44 this was coded in the current analysis as general high school  0 vs vocational high school  1 the formers primary purpose is to improve academic performance these include general autonomous science foreign language art sport and international high schools the latter aims to provide field experience and includes agriculturelife industry engineering commercial information fishery and business high schools school year years 1 2 and 3 were also measured descriptive statistics were performed to examine participant characteristics multiple logistic regressions were performed to investigate the associations of predictors with suicidal ideation happiness and stress regression models were conducted in two steps 1 with no adjustment and 2 adjusting for school type and school year analyses were conducted in spss version 23 spss inc armonk ny usa and statistical significance was set at p  005 the final analysis included 28451 students male  14263 mean age  1641 female  14188 mean age  1642 table 1 on average male students had slightly higher subjective health and bmi than female students female students reported a higher proportion of social support than male students overall more students had social support than not most students resided in urban settings and attended general high schools instead of vocational high schools most also perceived their household economic status to be in the middle logistic regression model 1 table 2 indicated that subjective health academic achievement and perceived household economic status were significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of suicidal ideation in both genders social support was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation for all students among girls bmi was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of suicidal ideation these associations persisted even after adjusting for school type and school year model 2 physical education at least twice a week was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation but only among boys when examining covariates school type was associated with suicidal ideation also only in boys in logistic regression model 1 table 3 subjective health academic achievement perceived household economic status and bmi were significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of stress in both genders similarly social support and physical education for more than twice a week were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of stress for all students these associations except bmi persisted even after adjusting for school type and school year school type was associated with a greater likelihood of stress for male students while school year and increased stress were linked for both genders we aimed to investigate intrapersonal interpersonal school and community-level factors that predict suicidal ideation and stress using nationally representative data from south korean adolescents physical education was associated with a decreased likelihood of suicidal ideation and stress although this effect was dependent on gender and participation frequency  previous studies have identified effects of intrapersonal interpersonal and environmental factors on suicidal ideation 6789 here we add to that existing body of knowledge by demonstrating that physical education 2 timesweekly may reduce suicidal ideation in male high school students our findings partially corroborate earlier research showing that physical activity outside of school is linked to lower suicidal ideation 13 however our data contradicted a previous study showing that physical education was not associated with suicidal ideation among middle school students 26 interestingly that same study showed that sports team engagement inside or outside school is linked to a decreased likelihood of suicidal ideation 26 the apparent benefit of sports teams may be due to increased freedom choice to attend given that these sports are outside regular school curricula another possible reason for the difference between that study and ours is the participant pool middle school students may experience less academic pressure than high school students finally the previous study did not investigate gender differences and so the lack of an effect among girls may have obscured an effect among boys following the national curriculum on physical education and providing suitable prevention programs therein could alleviate suicidal ideation and potentially reduce suicide attempts among male students 5 the lack of association between physical education and suicidal ideation in female students may be partly attributable to lower interest among girls in physical education due to self-consciousness low motivation 45 and competence 4647 however suicidal ideation rates are higher in female than in male adolescents 48 so further research is urgently warranted to determine how educators can encourage more participation in physical education among young women our results suggest that physical education is potentially an effective method to alleviate stress among high school students in line with previous qualitative research conducted in the united states 49 stress levels among south korean high school students are very high because of increased academic pressure 50 and greater emphasis on education 39 compared with other cultures indeed two thirds of adolescents suffer from stress in south korea 4 therefore when attempting to implement curriculum guidelines for physical education schools should exercise caution to avoid performance stress in the event of that students do poorly in physical education classes 51 importantly physical education should not be added on top of existing academic classes instead high schools could instead reallocate self-guided study time to physical education 28 developing the interpersonal skills of physical education teachers may be necessary to incorporate a variety of programs that could encourage participation from male students 52 for example programs could provide a wider range of physical activities that interest students and increase their sense of accomplishment in addition to lowering stress physical education can also increase peer inclusion 51 other barriers to physical education that should be addressed include insufficient quantity and quality of facilities 28 and the recent coronavirus disease-19 pandemic adolescents may be reluctant to participate because of outbreak-induced anxiety and perceived difficulties in social distancing during physical activity 53 thus educational professionals are encouraged to expand infrastructure related to physical activity eg gymnasiums as well as to develop teaching programs that stimulate participation while attending to student mental health the cross-sectional nature of our study means we could not infer any causation for suicidal ideation and stress a limitation that future longitudinal or experimental designs should address second although physical education predicted suicidal ideation in boys only and stress both genders there is no data on whether the association extends to suicidal attempts 5 further studies could address this question via mediation or structural analyses finally the results of the current study are not fully generalizable because we used self-reports to measure participation in physical education to lessen measurement bias accelerometers are recommended as an objective method to assess the duration and intensity of physical activity 54 we do note the value of using a database such as kyrbs for a nationally representative assessment moreover the results of the current study can be easily compared with previous adolescent research that also employed kyrbs data 16 this study used nationally representative data on south korean high school students to demonstrate that physical education predicts lower suicidal ideation and stress even after accounting for well-known covariates currently only a quarter of high schools successfully implement national curriculum guidelines for physical education 29 which is approximately 170 hyear 55 we therefore conclude that there is a clear need to increase participation in physical education in addition we recommend more research on interventions to promote such participation in south korean high school students to improve their overall psychological health  comparison of sars-cov-2 exit strategies building blocks elad barkan smadar shilo yeela talmor-barkan  we consider and compare various exit strategy building blocks and key measures to mitigate the current sars-cov-2 pandemic some already proposed as well as improvements we suggest our comparison is based on a computerized simulation integrating accumulated sars-cov-2 epidemiological knowledge our results stress the importance of immediate on-symptom isolation of suspected cases and household members and the beneficial effects of prompt testing capacity our findings expose significant epidemic-suppression differences among strategies with seemingly similar economic cost stressing the importance of not just the portion of population and business that is released but also the pattern the most effective building blocks are the ones that integrate several base strategies -they allow to release large portions of the population while still achieving diminishing viral spread however it may come with a price on somewhat more complex schemes for example our simulations indicate that dividing the population into two groups completely released except for taking turns on a long weekend fri-tue self-isolation once every two weeks while protecting the 5 most sensitive population would reduce r below 1 even if ten percent of the population does not follow it we further simulate the contrasting approach of a stratified population release in a hope to achieve herd immunity which for the time being seems inferior to other suggested building blocks knowing the tradeoff between building blocks could help optimize exit strategies to be more effective and suitable for a particular area or country while maximizing human life as well as economic value given our results we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable socio-economic burden  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was declared as a pandemic by the world health organization 1  unfortunately no vaccine is available at this time therefore mitigation actions are being taken to minimize both the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy and the spread of the virus currently taken measures are mostly social distancing isolation of cases and suspected cases contact tracing higher levels of hygiene facial masks wearing and mass population quarantines which cause vast socio-economical damage 2-6  going forward theres a need to easen some of the measures to allow economic activity while minimizing viral health damage one extreme approach is a stratified release of population lower risk first the idea is that lower risk individuals would contract the virus recover and gain immunity thus slowing the epidemic rate for future uninfected individuals the hope is that by the time higher risk individuals are released the infection probability is greatly reduced and thus infection of the higher risk group is largely reduced hence the term  herd immunity  care is taken to release at a rate that would not overload the healthcare system in the other extreme there are mitigation building blocks based on social distancing these are deliberate measures taken to restrict slow and limit the spread of the virus such that only a very small number of individuals will end up infected until the disease is eradicated or a vaccination is available social distancing measures could reduce the probability of contracting the virus given a contact for example using facial masks or reducing the rate of contacts of infected and susceptible individuals -thus reducing the spread of the virus 4 5 6 7  these measures typically include keeping a large portion of the population at home either constantly or intermittently the challenge is how to reduce the economic and social cost of such measures to an acceptable level while controlling for viral spread the mid-term goal is keeping r t 1 through social distancing measures where r t indicates at every time t how many secondary infections are caused on average by a single infected case r t 1 means the disease is spreading at an exponential growth rate as each case causes more than a new single case and r t 1 means the disease is diminishing as each case causes less than a new single case the special case of r t 1 or very close to one is not so theoretic and suggests the disease continues at a fixed rate of new daily cases in such a case a short intervention can reduce the number of daily cases and then we can continue with the same measures but in a lower rate of new daily cases reduction of new daily cases could also assist in contact tracing if done manually -which further slows the epidemic r t at time zero is called the basic reproduction number r 0  for sars-cov-2 the exact number is under active research and it could change from one country to another or given different environmental conditions 8-10  with many estimated values in the range of 22-32 which means each case causes 22-32 new cases unless people have already been infected and cannot get infected twice when social distancing measures are taken the reproduction rate changes and it is then denoted by r instead of r 0  social distancing measures have a potentially high price tag attached to them both economically and socially therefore once the rate of new infections is low enough we want to keep r t 1 but close to 1 with measures that cost the least the situation is constantly changing and keeping r t 1 but close to 1 is a moving target -for example there are constant changes in human behaviour public attention and public resilience weather 1112 changes local outbreaks and so on and all could affect r t  we need to dynamically try different measures so we keep r t 1 but close to 1 while probing and estimating the current situation therefore we could occasionally cross the line to r t 1 which means growing infection rates until we take actions to reduce r t  the price paid for social distancing interventions is also in the difficulty of implementing them complex measures could mean less compliance and less success in implementation and eventual effectiveness as the current goal is to keep r t around 1 and the situation is constantly changing information and response speed are the key the consequences of quick feedback are priceless compared with alternatives if the feedback loop for an action taken is 14-21 days and during this time the virus could be back propagating at doubling the number of cases every 3-4 days we could be expecting 3-7 sequential multiplications ie 8-128 fold increase 2 3 to 2 7  in the number of new infections and following a similar increase in icu beds therefore lack of prompt feedback typically through mass-testing leads to a need to maintain a large spare capacity maintaining spare capacity has a large cost associated with it both monetary and possibly in human life we propose how to promptly estimate the number of new infections and thus gain a short response time to actions taken in the first part of the paper key mitigation measures are suggested the second part of the paper focuses on comparison between building blocks in terms of their effectiveness in controlling r t 1 and effectiveness in terms of percent of population business-day that is released surprisingly there is a large difference in epidemic-control effectiveness of strategies while having similar economic costs by releasing the population to a similar extent the key is not just the portion of the population that is released but also the release pattern this finding suggests that exit strategies could be optimized for both viral spread and economic value the more successful strategies were the more complex ones integrating several ideas gaining understanding of the tradeoff is important as it could assist in building an exit strategy suited for a specific area in a way that is cost effective and communicable to the public so compliance would be high for each building block we give the resulting reduction in r as indicated by our simulation for example dividing the population into two groups which take turns on a long weekend fri-tue self-isolation once every two weeks while protecting the 5 most sensitive population would reduce r below 1 even if ten percent of the population does not follow it the division to groups can be made on a personal rather than on a household basis we give special consideration to the herd immunity approach given the knowledge that has already accumulated our results indicate that for now social distancing is expected to be a significantly more effective approach than herd immunity with significantly less casualties across all age groups a word of caution our results are based on a seir agent-based simulator which we built based on israeli population structure of nine million people and based on existing knowledge on sars-cov-2 epidemiological behavior the simulations are performed in a 1-day iteration cycle simulating a period of one year we distinguish between infection within a household and outside as existing literature shows the virus spreads significantly in familial infection clusters 13  various exit-strategy building blocks are fed into the simulator so their outcome can be assessed given the existing knowledge the simulation is executed 10 times over each set of parameters but with different random choices standard deviation of the results in these runs are given in time-based figures when a point value is given it corresponds to the mean result the exact structure and full list of assumptions is given in the supplementary at the end of this paper we propose that the single most cost-effective epidemic control is immediate self-isolation of the entire household upon the first symptom 14 suspected as related to coronavirus of someone in the household release from isolation is only after a negative laboratory result of the first person in the household to have shown a symptom and provided that the other members of the household do not show any symptoms related to coronavirus in our simulations after this measure is taken r dropped from r 0 303 to r154 this is a dramatic drop by a factor of 154303  0508 this drop is compared to the second-best epidemic control measure immediate self-isolation on the first symptom of a person without other household members which results in r22 a 223030726 factor drop if the symptomatic person self-isolates on symptoms but we wait with household isolation until the virus test for the symptomatic person returns positive and assuming a 5-day delay we get a much inferior situation with r165 the effect size in this case between an immediate household isolation to a delayed one 154165  093 is comparable to the effect of facial masks with protection factor of 10 283303093 see figure 2  these few days post symptoms and before diagnosis could be critical for reducing further infections directly or through other household members 15  see figure  1  if vast and prompt tests are in place the difference between household isolation and personal isolation upon symptoms diminishes as household members are assumed to enter isolation upon a positive test for one household member and get checked themselves immediate self-isolation of the entire household achieves an immediate stop to further spreading of the virus of both possibly affected but asymptomatic members and possibly other affected but presymptomatic household members without fast and prompt testing it would probably not be enough to isolate just the symptomatic person as research based on experience in china shows that a large proportion of the infections occur within households 13 16  see particular example 17  patients are pre-symptomatic in the first few days after infection while still being possibly infecting furthermore its estimated that a vast portion of the infections are made by pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic 18-23  social distancing measures taken outside the household reduces non-household infections the declining infection rate between households means that relatively more infection occurs within a household it is also interesting to notice that areas with larger households are likely to suffer from a higher r even if all other parameters are the same our simulations show that a self household isolation even on the basis of fever alone of one of the members has a dramatic effect in preventing the spread of the epidemic and should be used together with any other measures taken 24  four options no isolation self-isolation of a person upon the first symptom self isolation of a person upon the first symptom together -household members join after a test returns positive 5 days later self-isolation of the entire household upon the first symptom self-isolation upon symptoms dramatically shortens the spreading period a study on chinese experience in shenzhen shows it took an average of 46 days after symptoms onset to isolate an infected person which was reduced to 27 days if the person was isolated due to contact tracing and not symptoms 13  one implementation option is that every person of a household shall self-test for fever every day with possible daily online compulsory reporting of body temperature as well as onset of other symptoms body temperature could also be checked in key public locations or entry points we estimate the daily number of new people with fever by assuming 03 percent of the adult population shows fever signs of above 38 celsius at any given day 25  and dividing by an average conservative duration of a non-covid-19 fever disease of 1-4 days 26-28  therefore an order of 7500 to 30000 isolations shall occur daily and thus this number of daily tests for this purpose would be needed for a country the size of israel about 9 million people only if the first symptomatic household member is found to be infected a test would be carried out to the other family members -so the extra tests due to infected household members is expected to be insignificant compared to the background symptomatic non-sars-cov-2 cases an improvement to reduce the amount of tests would be using machine learning algorithms utilizing additional external data to release a household from self-isolation without the need for a laboratory test for the virus such external data can include the prevalence of coronavirus in the surrounding area prevalence of other infectious diseases in the area workplace or by information on personal location voluntarily collected and stored on household members mobile phones 29 etc proposal 2 focus testing capacity on self-isolated households focus testing capacity on quickly testing self-isolated households this approach simultaneously serves three important purposes in parallel 1 quick and accurate measure of actual coronavirus spread -as on average symptoms onset about 52 days after infection 30  and households enter immediate self-isolation immediate testing gives an accurate and near real-time measure of virus spread in the community and could prevent the need for population survey-testing for the virus 2 effective contact tracing -given self-isolated households contain the population with the highest risk of being infected that could have already continued unidentified infection chains theres importance in locating those that are really infected and trace their contacts to isolate them when testing is done quickly enough we have better chances of isolating the non-household individuals that got infected by the detected cases before they infect others we note that we did not include contact tracing effects in our simulations so the total combined effect of isolation and quick testing could be even stronger than we report 3 public compliance and fast reporting -when the logic behind self-household isolation is shared with the public and the public knows that they would be released in a short time from self-isolation if they didnt contract coronavirus the public is more likely to comply with the instructions and with compliance the virus spread would reduce as symptoms might be mild to begin with people might delay the request for a test in the simulations we assume this delay would be half a day on average as we conservatively assumed people would only comply when having fever symptoms and fever can be tested when entering the workplace schools and in a variety of other public places if testing is fast enough it suffices to isolate only the symptomatic person until results arrive in the unfortunate scenario that there is not enough testing capacity to cover all the new symptomatic candidates the importance of the proposed self-household isolation is even greater as effective contact tracing would not be possible and infection has a significant familial base 13  in such a case sample testing of the isolated households might still provide a good proxy for the spread of the infection it should be noted that not testing all the isolated population could lead to increasing public in-acceptance perhaps when the number of new infections is high and its likely the symptoms are due to sars-cov-2 infection people would accept a delay in testing probably less when the number of new infections shall drop to a few a day and the chances of justified isolation shall be minimal yet crucial in preventing relapse many countries regularly recommend the entire population unless contraindicated to vaccinate against seasonal influenza towards the winter 31  we suggest strengthening this recommendation towards the winter this year seasonal influenza could cause coronavirus-like initial symptoms 32  and vaccination shall reduce the background noise of seasonal influenza symptoms which could reduce the number of needed tests in addition reduction in influenza reduces pressure on the healthcare system and keeps the population in a healthier starting point in short reduction in influenza allows to focus scarce resources on the coronavirus front likewise the standard vaccination schedule should be kept and its importance communicated to the public as the cost of facial masks is low and absent information counties are tempted to instruct the population to wear facial masks in addition to increased hygiene 4-6  the hope is that these measures could reduce random infection by sars-cov-2 23  whether these alone could stop the epidemic and what their contribution would be if any is unknown at this time nevertheless in figure 2  we provide three simulations assuming facial masks and hygiene measures reduce infection outside home by 10 30 and 50 respectively note we assume the measures are taken only while outside home so household infection remains the same see further analysis in the supplementary  we compare the efficiency of several key exit strategies building blocks comparing how much they are efficient in stopping the epidemic in terms of r while in relation to how effective they are the amount of average released business days they allow for the population we summarize results of the partial release options in figure 3  exit strategies building blocks we considered  discussed above 1 do nothing -let the virus swipe the population dn 2 immediate self-isolation upon symptoms isi 3

two-group intermittent release suggested below 10 improved two-group intermittent with fixed 10 release suggested below a special category of its own of deliberate exposure while controlling exposure order 11 herd immunity -described below in all strategies except dn isi and herd immunity we isolated households upon the first symptom for all simulations we assumed leakage of infection from the released population to the quarantined population such that being quarantined reduces the probability of infection from outside sources by a factor of 100 compared to the released population while we cannot justify the exact factor the need to model leakage is undoubted as theres always some level of incompliance special needs that require going outside need to buy supplies human mistakes etc personal risk prediction was based on a mocked personal coronavirus mortality prediction -see supplementary and for a household as the average risk for the household members alternatively risk can be evaluated by age based on sars-cov-2 estimated infection fatality rate in all simulations except dn isi ishidnmasks and ishimasks we kept the top 5 highest-risk household in isolation to protect them in practice other protection measures for sensitive populations are required together with sensitive locations -these are outside the scope of the current paper 10 all rights reserved no reuse allowed

version posted april 28 2020   in this family of strategies we greatly improve an earlier proposed family of strategy 33  in these strategies we release the population based on 14-day cycles for a varying number of consecutive days depending on the particular variant in the remainder of the days in the cycle the previously released population is set on quarantine which we refer to as washout period  during the washout period some of those who contracted the virus in the preceding release days would become symptomatic hence they will be washed out from further infecting others before the next cycle begins another advantage of this family of strategies is that during the washout days r t is smaller due to the reduction in interactions we suggest three improvements that together with ishi make a big difference 1 dynamic and gradual number of release days  vs quarantine days the object is to add as many release days while keeping r t below 1 based on measured near real-time r t discussed above if r t is below 1 and the load on the healthcare system is reasonable and the number of new true-positive daily household isolations is below desired threshold we add a release day on expense of a quarantine day in a cycle if r is growing above 1 we deduct a release day on the expense of a quarantine day in each 14-days cycle we manage to significantly increase the number of release days in a cycle from 4 suggested in the original idea 33 to 9 thanks to our ishi isolation procedure and despite that we assumed r 0 303 additional measures could further increase the number of release days while keeping r t  1 we suggest to divide the population into two groups a and b whose quarantine days are disjoint but their release days can be joined the population can be divided household-wise the strength of this improvement is that while it keeps the washout periods in place it further reduces infection on days that only one group is released on each day that only one group is released the number of interactions decrease and limit further infection in the group thus r is effectively reduced of the possible day-divisions between the groups we suggest divisions which maximizes the number of business days in an equal manner between the groups we give several examples in the tables below and note that with this adaptation we can improve to 10 workdays out of a 14 days cycle while keeping r below 1 12 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display

model assumptions one of the possible difficulties in implementing a two-group approach is dividing into two groups based on households rather than on a person by person basis surprisingly our simulations show that the difference in the basis of division is not significant in respect to r while it could make a big difference in the ease of implementation therefore we suggest this improvement of dividing to groups based on a personal basis this basis can also be set by the workplace as long as it makes sure the division is such that it lowers in-workplace physical interaction although effective a two-group approach can be difficult to implement mainly as some employees are essential and are needed at their workplace more than their group designates them or the group division is violated due to poor compliance therefore we present an option allowing a fixed release rate in parallel to the two groups for example a fixed 10 of the population could be released all the time regardless of the group division this improvement makes the scheme more real at the cost of somewhat elevated r -see figure 4 for 80 business days as we see while the cost in terms of r is significant rising from r098 for two groups 10-4 days division on personal based group-division to r103 with additional 10 fixed population release -its still very close to 1 even with just the addition of facial masks or hygiene at 10 protection it would bring us to r093 this improvement allows for a long weekend fri-mon once every two weeks with division on a personal basis with 10 of the people in complete noncompliance -a dramatic improvement in implementability while still keeping r below 1 13 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer

this version posted april 28 2020  httpsdoiorg1011012020042320072850 doi medrxiv preprint we discuss herd immunity separately from other strategy building blocks as it is the only strategy that aims at increasing infection rates -even if only in certain age groups in an attempt to protect the rest and perhaps the economy all other strategies are focused on preventing further infection as such herd immunity has one big advantage over all other strategies -immunity from relapse under the assumption that a person cannot get infected twice this advantage is believed to be only a temporary one as the general belief is that if we wait long enough -there will be a vaccine that will provide immunity without the need to get large portions of the population sick or that global efforts of social distancing and testing will eventually eradicate the disease the logic behind the herd immunity approach is that the lowest risk households are released first and as they are low-risk they shall have a reduced demand rate of healthcare resources and reduced casualties rate the low-risk groups shall then be first to contract the virus recover and gain immunity thus the virus transmission is reduced as those that recover do not infect others and cannot get sick again further groups of increasing risk are then released too in a measured rate as not to exceed healthcare capacity the extremely high-risk groups shall be released last once the epidemic is over therefore we release the lowest-risk 25 immediately and release further 5 of the population every two weeks until icu is at 1 capacity as a result icu utilization peaks and slightly overshoots and we continue releasing higher risk groups every two weeks once icu capacity is back to at least 50 capacity again the herd immunity approach tries to infect as many of the released population as fast as possible in the beginning so we did not isolate symptomatic households at start we employ the ishi procedure to slow virus transmission only after 60 of the population has been released we depict simulation results for herd immunity in figure 5 vs a two group 10-4 strategy with division into two groups on personal basis allowing up to 10 complete noncompliance and using facial masks outside hume assuming 10 protection the later strategy allows more release business days on average in a 1-year period -778 vs 71 for herd immunity 1 too many need to get infected herd immunity is by far an outlier strategy with the largest amount of infections from what we currently know we dont expect herd immunity to appear before over 60 of the population contracts the virus while its reasonable to assume that a person shall not contract the virus twice in a short period its still an unknown risk even for a small country the size of israel of about 9 million people it means about 5400000 million people need to get infected -and just for israel infecting that many people could result in mistakes being multiplied in very large numbers and almost definite leakage of infection to more sensitive populations that cannot be really protected in 100 of total isolation for months -resulting in many casualties 2 closes the door to potential luck we might get lucky and have the summer eliminate the epidemic as happened with some other viral infections -or other measure being successful we might have an effective medicine that will allow people to get infected without serious consequences with herd immunity at this point -we wont enjoy this luck or enjoy it in a limited way 3 inefficient costly for the economy and inhumane as it will take too long to implement we take for example israel which has a relatively young and healthy population structure it is expected to take many months of quarantine given the limited capacity of the healthcare system keeping a large portion of the population under quarantine for a prolonged period of time -which can be considered inhumane we simulate a year ahead and give the herd immunity approach the advantage that we ignore death after a 1-year period as can be seen in figure 3 and figure 5  we have other strategies that can at least potentially hold the situation with minimal number of infections and casualties for for a relatively low cost until we have a vaccine for example 4 too many will die and die young while mortality rate is becoming clearer and much lower than initial estimates its still relatively high 34  herd immunity approach could lead not only to higher mortality than alternatives but out of the casualties a high proportion would be young at this time we dont have medical knowledge that hints that the young people who get to critical condition have some a priori hidden condition that is expected to shorten their life anyhow so we have to assume at this point that we would be losing many life-years under this strategy see figure 5 for distribution of mortality across age groups 5 healthcare system strain will kill even more a herd immunity approach will strain the healthcare systems to its limits for many months healthcare personnel and resources will find themself recruited to care for the critical coronavirus patients inevitably neglecting regular care many health situations that would normally end in recovery will end in otherwise avoidable death due to lack of care 6 long term health damage it could well be that some portion of surviving patients would suffer long-term or permanent health consequences post recovery with mid-term damage almost certain for those mechanically ventilated waiting for a vaccine could prevent it in light of the above and given there appear to be other effective and relatively low-economical-damage containment strategies it appears that sticking to containment strategies is more efficient at this stage our results show that seemingly similar strategies in terms of the amount of population-business-days they allow can have a very different epidemic supression outcome based on the pattern the population is released the more effective building blocks are a combination of both partial planned intermittent quaranties and partial population release such as a two-group intermittent release as such two-group intermittent approaches are better performing and are reasonable to implement given they can be relaxed to allow some fixed population noncompliance -10 percent in our example -in parallel to the two groups and division into groups can be made on a personal rather than on a household basis it should be noted however that partial release schemes are sensitive to a special division into two groups that does not reduce interaction for example the resulting r of dividing the population into two groups on a city basis would resemble the resulting r of a single-group and less the r of two groups in other words if the division is not made in a way that shall reduce interaction we will get an r closer to that of a single group intermittent schemes without partial release of population seem less effective at reducing r compared to mixed schemes though they are probably somewhat easier to enforce constant release of a fixed certain percent of population while keeping the rest quarantined also seems less effective too compared to mixed schemes where the population that is being released changes releasing the population and then quarantining as the epidemic relapses seems less effective compared to planned intermittent release schemes that achieve better results the decision on using one building-block or the other is not just a numerical one but should take into consideration other measures and factors including population compliance effectiveness of economy etc the factors and their weight could change by population and region actual decisions are outside the scope of this paper 20 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the

schools unfortunately there is just no data available 35 to make a truly informed decision mostly because schools closed up very quickly globally with the appearance of the pandemic with the exception of sweden for the lower age-groups 36  children are less symptomatic than adults 37  furthermore there is conflicting information on whether asymptomatic are less infectious 38 than symptomatic based on experience in china korea and israel it seems children contracted the virus less 39  according to israeli ministry of health data 40  the percent of positive tests for children aged 0-9 years old is lower compared to adults and in the range of adults for ages 10-19 suggesting this phenomena of lower contraction in children is not merely an ascertainment bias due to milder symptoms it could be argued the latter phenomena can be attributed to the fact the main importers of the virus were travelling adults and schools closed up relatively fast in sweden the infection rates of children are also very low 41 -though testing was limited in household secondary infection in china children were less likely to get infected 16 39  in the municipality of vo italy almost the entire municipality was tested twice as part of a survey in the early outbreak in italy 42  while the infection prevalence was about 26 none of the 234 children aged 0-10 were infected despite some of them sharing a household with a case according to israeli ministry of health information the education system accounted for only 3-11 percent of virus contraction on top of things and perhaps the bottom line -there is no real and reasonable solution for parents to go to work if their children cannot go to their school -so opening of schools seems unavoidable limited mitigation can be partially achieved by noticing symptoms at school and bi-daily measurements of body temperature for early detection of symptoms as children tend to be less symptomatic we assume the epidemic shall last many months and that schools will reopen before its eradicated therefore we will have to accomodate for the school effect anyhow whatever it is so that r1 despite schools being open however it could be that r would be very close to 1 after schools reopen and so there could be benefits from reducing the number of new daily infections to a smaller level which would stay there after schools are reopened as r would be close to 1  we compare key mitigation measures of sars-cov-2 spread and compare various exit strategies building blocks our results stress the importance of not just the amount of population that is released but also the pattern our findings demonstrate the importance of mixed strategies as each strategy is effective through somewhat other means some of our mixed schemes can allow relatively convenient life while controlling for the epidemic spread therefore and given our results we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable

detailed assumptions we did not take into account actual icu resources in the simulation but counted the needed resources and assumed they are available it is up to the strategy to avoid a situation of exhausting resources at initialization each subject receives concrete values of their personal disease course relative to infection if they get infected to that end we draw random variables of the relevant distribution detailed above for each person we also hold a boolean flag indicating if they are infected and a counter to count the relative number of days since each persons infection we also keep a flag to note if a person is in quarantine isolation or released we assumed isolation is at home and with household members people in icu are considered removed and stop infecting others there are three types of infections modelled infection of family members infection of released population and leakage infection to those in quarantine the infection of each group is performed in complete mix ie the probabilities to get infected by an infector are identical within a group and the population within a group is uniformly infected based on that probability daily infection of the released

infection period for this person ie cdfdcdf 921dl where l is the personal length of infectiousness the various strategies that are evaluated were fed separately into the simulator a strategy can set for each person if they are quarantined or released based on all prior information age sex probabilities -but not actual random choices and can measure actual icu usage and perform viral tests require to put masks when out of home etc the strategy is invoked each day and has a chance to intervene prior to the infections taking course for that day if two people are wearing masks it reduces droplets and aerosol that contain the virus averaging the numbers in 7  we assume it reduces droplets and aerosol by about 291 to 182 without change in the viral load ie a mask on an affected individual reduces spread by a factor of 0625 in a period of 30 minutes 7  numbers are small so we assume about 30 spread both aerosols and droplets we cannot make an accurate assumption on how much surgical masks shall reduce infection to a wearer of the mask though based on 49 it would be about a six-fold protection factor if we follow these numbers we expect infection to drop by a factor of 06256 to 0625 ie from 01 to 0625 another cause of inclarity is the possibility that droplets or aerosol are infecting through unprotected eyes or other transmission from hands to the eyes 5051  which are not protected by a surgical mask and later accidental transfer from hands to mouth or eyes the inclarity is further extended as good mask usage requires careful fitting of the masks replacing them frequently enough smart disposal together with additional protective measures 52  its difficult to model long-exposure of several 30 minutes units as we cannot tell if the percent of droplets are per-person due to mask-face fitting for example although participants were corrected if they mis-wore the mask or due to properties of the mask itself if its mask properties then an hour worth exposure would still be infecting eg even if we assume the extreme value for mask protection factor of 01 then for 5 hours the protection is only 1-1-01 2x5 0651 ie the protection is just 30 reduction in possibility of infection so if surgical masks are useful its probably protective for short and random exposure patterns to provide a conservative yet useful estimate we gace simulation results for

follow the standards of category a infectious disease on 30 january 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern with high infectivity the incubation period of covid-19 is approximately 14 days and lasts for 24 days or more in some patients 13 one report 4 showed possible transmission between asymptomatic patients or between patients during the incubation period a large amount of viruses may remain in deceased people infected with sars-cov-2 and the survival time of the viruses may be prolonged in refrigerated cadavers during epidemic prevention and control forensic pathologists may examine the body and tissues of the deceased infected with sars-cov-2 including asymptomatic or suspicious infection according to the law of the peoples republic of china on prevention and control of infectious diseases 5 regulations on biosafety management of pathogenic microorganism laboratories 6 regulations on autopsy of patients with infectious diseases or suspected infectious diseases 7 notice of guidelines for disposal of the remains of patients with pneumonia infected by novel coronavirus trial version 8 and diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version sixth 2 the guidelines in this article provide recommendations for biosafety and infection control practices during specimen collection and handling as well as autopsy procedures forensic institutions should follow the regulations of their national and local health departments when formulating work procedures and emergency plans for epidemic prevention and controlto effectively confirm a sars-cov-2 infection or a suspected case investigating the death process and medical history and a case review are the first and most pivotal work in forensic autopsy regarding epidemic preventionknowledge of covid-19 should be updated timely and the recommended practices and principles should be followed to avoid infection autopsy sites should have safety and protection protocols in place to guarantee personal and public safety fourteen days prior to symptom onset 1 travel history or residence history in wuhan or surrounding cities or communities reporting confirmed cases 2 close contacts of persons with covid-19 with positive results after nucleic acid testing 3 exposure history to patients with fever or respiratory symptoms who came from wuhan surrounding cities or communities with confirmed cases and 4 evidence of clustering 1 fever andor respiratory symptoms 2 in early onset the total number of white blood cells wbc was normal or decreased or the lymphocyte count was decreased and 3 imaging characteristics of covid-19 as small patchy shadows and interstitial changes appeared early especially in the lateral lung ground-glass opacities and infiltrates were seen subsequently in bilateral lungs lung consolidation might occur in severe cases a suspected covid-19 patient must have one of the epidemiological history features and meet any two of the clinical features or meet three clinical features and none of the epidemiological features a confirmed case must have one of the following two etiological evidences 2 1 nucleic acid-positive by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing or 2 a high homology to sars-cov-2 as indicated by viral gene sequencing asymptomatic infection and patients in the incubation period may become sources of infection therefore identifying latent cases is the most critical task for forensic pathologists people who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for suspected cases but possess any of the following features are recommended to undergo screening as possible latent cases 1 meet some of the items listed for suspected covid-19 but have not reach the diagnostic thresholds for suspected cases yet 2 have the following epidemiological history travel history or residence history in wuhan or surrounding cities or communities reporting confirmed cases close contacts of persons with covid-19 with positive nucleic acid test results andor exposure history to patients coming from wuhan or surrounding cities or communities with confirmed cases 3 have the following clinical features fever andor respiratory symptoms abnormal peripheral blood wbc count with normal or reduced total wbc count or reduced lymphocyte count and 4 imaging characteristics of sars-cov-2 infection biosafety level 3 bsl-3 protection should be provided during the scene investigation the body with clothes carefully removed is gently moved to avoid blood andor excrement contamination disinfectant containing 1 000 mgl of chlorine should be used for on-site disinfection cadaver examination should be performed in the autopsy room with bsl-3 protection the autopsy personnels clothing should meet the bsl-3 protection standards strengthening the anti-splash protection for the face 61011 the site should be ventilated for at least 10 min before the crime scene investigation examiners should with clothing following bsl-3 or bsl-2 protection standards stand on the windward side and maintain a distance from the mouth and nose of the cadaver and not press hard on the cadavers chest and abdomen cadavers can be examined in a conventional autopsy room and examiners can dress according to bsl-3 protection standards the disinfection is the same as that for confirmed cases on-site and postmortem examination shall be performed under routine standards during epidemic prevention unknown corpses may be encountered in forensic examination with no access to the deceaseds medical history or epidemiological history with care crime scene investigation and cadaver examination should be performed with protection levels as for suspected or latent cases if necessary a senior forensic pathologist must perform the examination for safety reasons at least two staff members should be present in the autopsy room at the same time if possible examiners should receive immunisation cadaver examination should be performed in an autopsy room with bsl-3 protection or equivalent conditions with sufficient and sustained negative pressure air and sewage discharge equipped with filtration or disinfection devices and plane layout and ventilation according to general laboratory biosafety standards 10 if an autopsy room with bsl-3 conditions is not available cadavers can be examined in a disposable safety bag specially designed for postmortem examination of infectious diseases which can completely isolate the infected body from examiners and surroundings the examiner from outside performs the autopsy on the body in the transparent bag using safety sleeves and gloves in special circumstances autopsy can be performed in an operating room with adequate negative pressure and air and sewage discharge equipped with filtration or disinfection devices the examination area isolated from the surroundings should be divided into three parts clean area semi-contaminated area and contaminated area using a single-channel closed-loop approach examiners should move from the clean area to the semi-contaminated area and then to the contaminated area and leave the contaminated area from another channel for the semi-contaminated area and then for the clean area the semi-contaminated area as a transition space is the place for cleaning and disinfecting examiners packaged materials and specimens 1 workplace contaminated and semi-contaminated areas should be isolated before examination during the examination a 500 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant can be sprayed on the floors walls and frequently contacted objects after the examination the autopsy room should be thoroughly sprayed and disinfected with a 1 000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant if the environmental surface is contaminated by secretions and excreta from the cadaver the surface should be covered with hygroscopic materials and then disinfected with a 2 000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant 2 apparatus and instrument before the examination a 500 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant should be used to wipe tools and instruments for disinfection after the examination a 1 000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant is used for wiping and soaking for 30 min or boiling in water for 30 min and then clean water is used to rinse three times followed by wiping clean for later use telephones computer mouse and keyboards cameras and other objects can be wiped with 75 ethanol solution disinfectants 3 air ultraviolet ray disinfection lamps can be used for air irradiation disinfection for 1 h alternatively ultra-low capacity sprays can be used namely 3 hydrogen peroxide 5 000 mgl peroxyacetic acid and 500 mgl chlorine dioxide disinfectant 2030 mlm3 for 2 h the doors and windows are closed during disinfecting followed by full ventilation after disinfection postmortem examination operators including forensic pathologists anatomical technicians photographers recording personnel and others should follow bsl-3 protection requirements that is wear a one-piece protective suit grade  n95 protective mask goggles or protective eye mask protective shoe covers and latex gloves at least two layers if liquid splash is possible a respirator should be worn and replaced immediately once contaminated before the examination examiners should wear protective devices in the clean area organise instruments used for autopsy in the semi-contaminated area and then perform the autopsy in the contaminated area after the examination protective clothing and gloves must be sterilised for the first time in the autopsy room contaminated area and the surfaces of the protective clothing mask shoe covers and gloves should be thoroughly sterilised in the semi-contaminated area for objects including cadavers formalin-fixed specimens and frozen specimens that are taken from the autopsy room contaminated area the surfaces of the objects packaging containers should be thoroughly disinfected followed by packaging and sterilising the object again in the semi-contaminated area spray disinfection can be performed with 1 000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectants the deceaseds clothing and items such as gauze and towels used for the autopsy examination should be disinfected and incinerated together with the cadaver examiners should perform careful and gentle operations with clear specialisation and close cooperation anatomical instruments should be used and placed properly to avoid puncturing gloves or skin with knives scissors sewing needles puncture needles syringes or the ends of fractured bones as well as to avoid spattering blood urine gastrointestinal contents and bone powder if gloves are torn they should be disinfected and replaced immediately if blood body fluids urine andor faeces are splashed onto the examiners clothing or outside the autopsy table strict disinfection should be performed if the examiners skin is contaminated by cadaver pollutants the pollutants should be removed immediately and then disposable absorbent material with 05 iodine used to wipe the examiners skin for more than 3 min contaminated mucous membranes should be rinsed with large amounts of normal saline or 005 iodine to disinfect 12 prior to anatomical examination a sample extraction plan can be made by consulting clinical pathologists laboratory staff physicians and virologists to reduce the infection risks samples should be taken directly after the body cavity is opened and organ and tissue cuttings should be minimised 13 samples for etiological and electron microscopy testing and cryopreservation should be extracted first second samples secretions and tissue blocks for etiological gene testing should be stored in hanks solution third tissues requiring freezing can be cut into blocks 15 cm in length width and height and put into a plastic bottle with a screw top before freezing fourth tissues for electron microscopy examination can be cut into blocks 03 cm in length width and height and fixed in 3 glutaraldehyde finally for specimens used for conventional paraffin embedding entire diseased organs tissues or tissue blocks with a length width and height of 35 cm can be fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde solution for 4872 h and can then be examined dehydrated embedded and sectioned fixed specimens can be retrieved in a well-ventilated laboratory in which surfaces and floors are sterilised with 2 000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant and air is disinfected by ultraviolet radiation after sampling specimens are returned to the specimen bag with fixing solution and sealed the material table is rinsed and then disinfected with 1 000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant once dehydrated tissues are removed from the area disinfect the surface of the dehydrator and surroundings with 1 000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant for 30 min and then wipe with clean water as for tissue dehydration the embedding machine surroundings and air are disinfected in two steps paraffin blocks are sterilised by immersion in 75 ethanol solution and dried before slicing 12 and then sealed immediately and sterilised using 75 ethanol solution after slicing the slicer is sprayed with 75 ethanol solution as well other tools such as forceps and scalpel and knife blades can be disinfected in an oven at 80 c for 30 min tissue staining instruments should be sprayed for disinfection with 75 ethanol solution or a 500 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant both before and after use generation of effluent and waste should be avoided as much as possible infectious effluent the waste water produced during examination should be treated by chemical or physical disinfection and discharged after complete inactivation 12 solid wastes including consumables personal protective equipment and any remaining fixed specimens should be collected separately for processing consumable and personal protective equipment should be sterilised using high-pressure steam or fumigated using ethylene oxide in a timely manner in addition to pathomorphological observation of routine paraffin sections hematoxylin-eosin staining special staining immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence staining virus isolation and gene sequencing of secretions and tissue blocks in situ detection of viral rna or viral protein antigens in tissue sections ultrastructural examination of tissue sections and detection of virus particles can be performed if necessary forensic autopsy is currently the main way to identify and accumulate systematic pathological information for death cases examination agencies should fully record and maintain the basic information for covid-19 patients name age sex place of origin place of residence place of onset and travel history information from the anatomical examination and epidemiological and clinical data feedback on pathology examination reports or the identification opinion of the cause of death should be timely sent to related medical institutes disease prevention control agencies and health administration departments 711 during the epidemic outbreak all operators should undergo medical observation after autopsy and those with fever and respiratory symptoms should be isolated for observation or medical assistance operators involved in the autopsy of confirmed or suspected cases should receive temperature monitoring and medical observation in isolation for 14 days viruses have certain survivability in cadavers and in vitro appendix a it is not uncommon for examiners to be infected secondary to inadequate protection careless operation or unknown causes appendix b therefore during the epidemic prevention and control period personal protection of examiners and disinfection of dissecting rooms surroundings and instruments should be taken seriously if a glove is torn and skin is damaged during autopsy the operator should stop dissecting immediately rinse the wound with large volumes of saline or a 005 iodophor for disinfection and be isolated for treatment and observation if new confirmed or suspected cases of covid-19 are found during examination operators should report to the local disease prevention and control agencies or medical institutes in a timely manner  transmission and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in 104 outside-wuhan patients china cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emigrating from wuhan escalated the risk of spreading the disease in other cities this report focused on outside-wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness contact investigation was conducted on each patient who was admitted to the assigned hospitals in hunan province geographically adjacent to wuhan from 22 january to 23 february 2020 cases were confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction test demographic clinical and outcomes were collected and analyzed of the 104 patients 48 4615 were cases who immigrated from wuhan 93 8942 had a definite contact history with infection family clusters were the major body of patients transmission along the chain of three generations was observed five asymptomatic infected cases were found and two of them infected their relatives mean age was 43 range 8-84 years and 49 4712 were male the median incubation period was 6 range 1-32 days which of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days 96 9231 were discharged and 1 096 died the average hospital stay was 10 range 8-14 days family but not community transmission became the main body of infections in the two centers suggesting the timely control measures after the wuhan shutdown worked well asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may lead to the widespread of covid-19 a 14-day quarantine may need to be prolonged qiu chengfeng  deng ziwei  xiao qian  shu yuanlu  deng ye  wang hongqiang  liao

online survey with spanish consumers l laguna s fiszman p puerta c chaya a trrega   in december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases emerged in china later identified as the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 also known as the disease name covid-19 tan et al 2020 since december 2019 the virus has spread worldwide and on march 11th 2020 the world health organisation declared a state of a pandemic as the pandemic spread the research world was set in motion producing a substantial number of studies according to the web of knowledge at the beginning of april 2020 there were 7496 publications when searching for covidcoronavirus in 2020 with all of them related to health infectious diseases respiratory system public health internal medicine research medicine health care microbiology virology and molecular biology when adding the term food to the search 4382 studies appeared related to the possible sources of the virus its genotype and molecular characterisation to date only two studies were not concerning virology one proposed supplementation of vitamin d for covid-19 prevention grant et al 2020 and the other dealt with the loss of smell as a biomarker for covid-19 infection moein et al 2020 the main research response for covid-19 has been related to the understanding of the virus its spread and health consequences however not only health is being affected consumers concerns regarding governmental mandated lockdowns social distancing displacement restrictions and their uncertainty about this pandemics extent are changing along with their lifestyles previous studies outside pandemic times have postulated that searches on google reflect the interest and concerns of populations towards different diets kamiski skonieczna-ydecka nowak  stachowska 2020 likewise youtube videos are widely used for seeking advice and tips regarding different diets and health issues aydin  aydin 2020 basch hillyer garcia  basch 2019 besides internet searches people use social media ie facebook instagram and twitter to freely express and share the content of their lives appel et al 2020 further when aiming to answer specific questions about consumers motivation and perception in exceptional circumstances specific surveys are needed this exploratory study focuses on the first impact of a health crisis on consumers behaviour regarding food and shopping worldwide information was gathered from different sources such as internet searches most watched videos and social media during the virus outbreak affecting european countries turkey russia and north-america from mid-march to mid-april 2020 additionally an online questionnaire was made spanish population to study consumers motivations for changing or not their shopping habits and their perceived reliability of the information sources in relation to covid-19 under a strict lockdown period 30th march-14th april this part of the study was conducted only in spain where on march 14th the state of emergency was declared from march 30th to april 14th the spanish government increased the severity of the state of alarm during this period the circulation of people was limited and citizens could only leave the house if they were working in essential services health security social and economic wellbeing of citizens or if they needed to buy necessary products groceries and medicines within their town the relative popularity data of searches on the internet from january 1st to april 15th were obtained through the google trends tool this tool provides for a term and day the number of searches expressed as percentage in relation to the maximum number of searches of the term in each period it allows a comparison of searches and in this case the values of the number of searches of each term expressed as percentage in relation to the maximum number of searches of any terms in the selected period two sets of 25 terms one set in spanish other in english related to food virus or lifestyle food food shopping shopping covid food covid on-line shop recipes cereals flour meals covid stock up shopping hoarding shopping yeast vegetables toilet paper fruit virus flu virus covid flu symptoms coronavirus symptoms coronavirus transmission lifestyle sport videos sport videos covid fitness covid yoga and covid leaving home covid were preliminary proposed to study the change in food habits but also the concerns and activities that population was worldwide searching during this special period of time from these initial searches the most searched terms were further analysed a first comparative analysis of searches for the term food and searches of terms related to the coronavirus symptoms spread and lockdown was obtained a second comparative analysis of searches for the term food and other specific terms related to food restaurant recipe and delivery was also completed finally the popularity of searches of different individual food products was obtained and those with relevant changes over the analysed period were retained searches were conducted in english and spanish using the youtube platform the 100 most watched videos when searching for coronavirusfood and coronavirusshopping in english and spanish n  400 were obtained between the 30th march and 13th april 2020 title number of views the upload date and number of likes and dislikes were recorded for the 400 videos the videos were watched independently by three researchers who decided by consensus to classify the information into three content categories health advice recommendations for prevention or treatment of covid-19 news novel or actual information and documentary non-fiction film that captured in images or interviews of different facts of covid-19 following the same protocol the informants were also classified into three categories journalist people working for newspapers news websites or information news youtubers people who provided videos but not under news or tv channels health science experts main or invited speakers who claimed to have health studies backgrounds such as physicians virologists and nutritionists there were few mixed spontaneous videos not classified under any category additionally the frequency of the most mentioned words in the 400 video titles was obtained tweets the individual message posted on the twitter platform containing the terms food and coronavirus sent between march 19th and april 13th 2020 were retrieved in english 37200 tweets and spanish 14537 tweets with the rtweet package kearney 2018 from r software r core team 2017 via twitters application programming interface api re-tweets and repeated tweets were not considered the text was cleaned and the document-term matrix was obtained using the package tm in r feinerer 2013 the frequency of terms was calculated for the total time and dividing the total time in three periods t1 19032020 to 26032020 t2 27032020 to 03042020 and t3 04042020 to 13042020 which encompassed 8 8 and 10 days respectively to analyse the evolution of the frequency of mention with time an online questionnaire was sent to 800 consumers from a database that included spain main areas madrid catalonia and valencia at the end of the strict spanish lockdown april 7th-13th it was completed by 362 consumers 30 men 70 women from 20 to 76 years old average age 388 this questionnaire was approved by csic ethics committee 0462020 consumers were asked to indicate the food items from a list they perceived to buy more during the lockdown than in normal times the product list was based on a spanish food frequency questionnaire martin-moreno et al 1993 consumers were asked to do the same with the food they perceived to be purchasing less than in normal times when a participant indicated purchasing a product more or less amount heshe was asked to choose their reasons from a list of 17 motivations table 1
 the two lists motivations for purchasing more and less were based on the eating motivation survey by phan and chambers iv 2016 adapted to the spanish language laguna fiszman  tarrega 2020 few motivations from a previous study on food insecurity puddephatt et al 2020 were also included the motivations encompass several dimensions limitations acceptability mood price healthweight control information received and shelf-life consumers also had the opportunity to provide other motivations not listed consumers were asked where their usual place of purchase was smalllocal shop supermarket online or other and shopping frequency before and during the lockdown every day twothree times per week once a week and once a month consumers indicated how reliable they considered 10 statements about measures against covid-19 provided by the who 2020 and non-scientific sources obtained from youtube videos analysis on a five-point reliability scale from not reliable to very reliable statements provided by who were wash your hands with soap and water do not go out except exceptions avoid touching your eyes nose and mouth to use a face mask and disinfect all products from outside the statements obtained from youtube videos were take vitamin d supplements eat more citric fruit drink plenty of hot drinks consume more garlic and ginger gargling with warm water and lemon and eat more bananas consumers also indicated the reliability of different individualsprofessionals giving messages of protective measures health staff researchers family politicians friends work colleague and journalists consumers were also asked for their source of information using a multiple-choice question including terms tv whatsapp radio journals social media telephone lines for covid-19 and employeesunions two correspondence analyses ca one for purchasing more food products and another for purchasing less were performed using the food product purchasing data and its corresponding motivations chi-squared test was used to analyse the influence of covid-19 lockdown in the shopping place and frequency before and after the lockdown at the alpha level of p  005 all the statistical analyses were performed with xlstat version 201913 the searches of health-related terms like symptoms and spread figure 1
a and 1b showed a similar timeline trend to the searches of coronavirus data not shown a first small peak of popularity in the last week of january appeared and on february 20th the popularity values started increasing to reach the maximum values on march 12th and 21st for english and spanish searches respectively lockdown was not a trending search until march 13th it increased in popularity showing oscillations with peaks of interest approximately every two weeks the popularity trend for lockdown reached its maximum in english on march 25th while for spanish searches was still growing on april 15th figure 1 searches on food were popular perhaps as they always are over all the period studied values remained almost constant in the english searches for searches in spanish the values were fluctuant more and showed an increase in popularity from march 24th to april 5th searches on specific terms related to food showed relevant variations in this period figure 1c and 1d terms restaurant and recipe were relatively popular in january and february after march 13th the popularity of searches for restaurant decreased and after march 24th remained three times lower than at the beginning of the year in contrast the popularity of searches for recipe continuously increased with fluctuations coinciding with weekends the last weekend of the period april 11-12th was three-four times higher than at the beginning of the year the searches for delivery also increased starting on march 13th and from march 24th to april 10th the popularity was three-four times higher than at the beginning of the year temporal-changes of popularity were investigated independently for several food items figure 2
shows those more representative searches for foods like bread chicken milk flour fruit and banana increased starting around march 13th in english and spanish the popularity of searches of recipe was four times greater and twice for banana popularity of searches for bread increased three times in english and one third in spanish searches of fruit milk and chicken in english showed only a slight increase but doubled their popularity in spanish eggs showed an important increase in popularity occurred slightly later than march 13th with a narrower well-defined peak between april 7-14th that would be probably related to regional traditional easter egg 
wine and beer showed fluctuations in popularity since the beginning of year depending on weekdays and weekends and the trend did not change however for wine both languages and beer spanish between march 13-25th popularity remained with minimum values recorded slightly lower than the peak values the searches for diet decreased continuously since the beginning of the year with a minimum seen on march 20th but slightly increase after the 400 videos analysed in english and spanish showed that the most watched videos were news 3814 followed by advice 3383 and documentary 2803 table 2
 all videos had been uploaded between january 20-26th 2020 for the search coronavirusfood in english most of the videos were of terms news or documentary and the informants were youtubers the most frequent words in the video titles were related with terms for the virus acknowledgement virus outbreak china panic and news quarantine fight people prepare quarantine and street and supermarketstocking-up food costco empty fear foods home lockdown shelves and trade for the search coronarivusfood in spanish the videos were mainly advice 50 of videos with a higher number of claimed health science expert informants than with videos in english 36 vs 4 the most mentioned words in the video titles was panic followed by china and peru and then the words supermarket pandemic toilet paper and fear when searching coronavirusshopping in english the most viewed video was documentary with a journalist informant the most watched video titles contained the words purchasing panic for the outbreak fear of running out of primary goods in the shops and toilet paper rise in demand which was one of the most watched videos in the search of coronavirusshopping in spanish advice videos were the most widely viewed having a journalist and youtubers as informants the contents were related to the defence mechanism fight quarantine immunity china disinfection supermarket and virus the most frequent words  35 used when tweeting about coronavirus and food are shown in table 3
 all words appeared along the whole analysis period with the maximum appearing at different periods in english the frequency of terms indicate three main aspects concerned people getting and stocking-up food delivery get and shop health aspects medical and recommendation for staying at home home stay social distance and work the impact of covid-19 on the economy donation and bank showed maximum relevance in t2 and continued in t3 t2 crisis govern and distribution with a feeling of insecurity t2 need support and secure and the incoming consequences t3 lockdown and crisis likewise when tweeting about coronavirusfood in spanish table 3 concern about health people quarantine pandemic and die and a way to get food buy delivery and going out were mentioned more at the beginning t1 social issues and polices followed hunger and government showing maximum number of mentions in t2 and finally in t3 the economic consequences money and crisis before the lockdown consumers mainly purchased their food in supermarkets  966 small shop  3921 and online 756 after the lockdown no significant changes p  0095 of location were seen the consumers frequency of shopping was twice per week 50 or weekly 35 before the lockdown after the lockdown was announced a significant change in the frequency of shopping p  0001 took place weekly 765 was the main frequency whereas twice per week 1365 reduced and daily 112 almost disappeared the analysis of the amount of food people purchased showed over 20 of participants perceived to change their shopping amount figure 3
 of the 36 products presented 27 were perceived to be purchased more figure 3a eggs milk fresh vegetable meat pulses pasta fruit house-cleaning products yogurts citric fruit cheese water preserves flour nuts wine and beer coffee and tea oil snacks biscuits cold meat toilet paper frozen vegetables chocolate and personal care products fourteen products were perceived to be purchased less by 20 the participants figure 3b alcoholic drinks ready meals desserts bakery goods instant soups fish and seafood soft drinks snacks beer wine chocolate cold meat pickles and cereals few products appeared on both lists chocolate wine and beer which meant that some participants increased their purchase and others decreased it this particular point is interesting because the amount of these food items were reduced to improve physical health weight controlbody shape during lockdown by some consumers whereas were increased to improve mental health mood cheers me up by others the motivations linked to the products purchased more and less than in normal times were studied using correspondence analysis figure 4
a and 4b respectively on the left part of the map food products like pulses pasta vegetables and citric fruit were associated with motivations of healthweight control it is healthy it helps me to keep in shape moreover pulses pasta and oil were related to shelf-life long-lasting and price it is cheap on the right side of the map food products like chocolate nuts and cheese were related to emotional motivations and mood it helps me to combat stress it cheers me up it helps me to feel better if i am frustrated close to these food products also appeared the term feel for eating where the participants associated snacks and coffee and tea few food items like flour bread and cold meat were related to changes in habit to be eating it more although it was not considered in the questionnaire 35 participants spontaneously claimed they were purchasing more flour because they were cooking more to pass free time or keep their children entertained the main motivations for purchasing less food products figure 4b like bakery goods was healthweight control and reasons related to mood for products like desserts alcohol or snacks was not improving the mood on the extreme right side of the map fish and seafood were purchased less as they had a short shelf-life and high price perishable expensive and not available over 80 of the participants found advice from the who more reliable however non-scientific proven statements also reached quiet high reliability levels for some statements the whos more reliable statements were wash hands do not go out avoid touching face and disinfect all products from outside like parcels or shopping whereas non-scientific advice like to have more vitamin d drink plenty of water consume water with ginger gargling hot water or eat more bananas were shown variably reliable 254-533 the reliable sources for most participants 95 were researchers and scientists sources of information showed tv was the most frequently used 72 followed by journals 48 and social media 37 other sources like employersunions and whatsapp were used around 27 and the least used source for gaining information was the information telephone lines for covid-19 this paper gave the first preliminary insight into the effect of the covid-19 pandemic alert on consumers in relation to food priorities changes in popularity of searches related to food were observed during the lockdown period peoples interest in restaurants decreased and interest increased on recipes and delivery reaching huge popularity comparable or higher than searches related to health symptoms and spread peoples concerns about diet decreased but the interest in food products like flour bread fruits milk and chicken related to cooking baking and storage conditions increased youtubes most watched videos showed the concern of the population was to understand the origin of the pandemic and how it could be fought with home or food remedies this result would indicate that people watched videos with motivations that were a little different from those of google searches while videos pretended to satisfy the need for tutorial didactic information google searches offered more spontaneous and immediate information unfortunately most videos were shared and the beginning of the pandemic without update information and not made by experts and could put viewers at risk if they followed the inefficient advice as the pandemic evolves quickly over time more updated educational materials shall be promoted on youtube in a review made madathil rivera-rodriguez greenstein  gramopadhye 2014 on healthcare information in you tube the authors found that some videos contained misleading information primarily anecdotal that contradicts the reference standards but also it was found videos from government organizations and professional associations containing trustworthy and high-quality information the data retrieved from twitter confirmed the concerns that people had regarding food shopping health care and economics specifically the temporal analysis of these results captured the evolution of population concerns from shopping and carefulness for most vulnerable people to the uncertainty of what will happen at the end and how the derived health and economic crisis will be solved this constant evolution of the situation might be reflected in further changes in the consumers behaviour and rationality as there is a constant change in what governs their context and practices de krom 2009 from the spanish consumers responses at the time of the online questionnaire a change in shopping habits during the lockdown was observed notably these participants were already two weeks into a strict lockdown and the initial stock-up and fear period had already passed although spanish consumers have confronted food-related crises as with the h5n1 avian influenza de krom  mol 2010 rapeseed oil in spain daz-mndez  gmez-benito 2010 and more recently the shredded meat listeriosis spanish consumers of the 21st century have never confronted a pandemic crisis and lockdown as presented by the coronavirus the food-related changes observed in relation to the mandatory change of their lifestyles staying at home or not allowed to exercise outside have arisen concerns regarding their mood and body weight in addition lowering the frequency of shopping has decreased consumption of the most perishable food products like fish and seafood heavily consumed in normal times however shopping for non-perishable ready meals decreased likely because of unhealthy related opinions and more time for cooking and preparing in fact fresh vegetables were purchased more for that reason and probably they have the perception of being healthier these results are in line with the increase in popularity of google searches related to recipes and the decrease of those related to wine and beer no relation was found between some hoaxes certainly with relatively low reliability related to food consumption such as eat more citric fruit eat more bananas and take vitamin d and the perceived changes in quantity of shopping of some food items regarding the perceived reliability of the sources the statements made by experts or scientists were considered by consumers to be the most reliable however this is in contrast with the most watched youtube videos that were mostly from non-scientific sources 
contribution of the present preliminary study provides initial insights into the behavioural changes in a pandemic situation an event that has not occurred before in social media times for the scientific community it is beneficial to know that although people declare scientists and experts as one of the most reliable sources of information however when searching and watching videos scientists are not the most popular source and efforts should be made to design more effective information communication channels avoiding that the population follow non-scientific hoaxfake-news advice
 because of the mandatory change of lifestyle consumers have changed their habits and the motivations behind them further studies are needed to investigate the long-lasting effects and adaptation of food consumption behaviour to the new normality

china during the covid-19 pandemic yuan zhang luo zhang   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which was provisionally named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses1 is a newly identified member of human coronavirus species that has emerged recently and caused a highly infectious disease covid-19 has spread aggressively across the globe since it was first reported in december 20192 and declared as a pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 up to april 7 2020 133 million and 83071 cases of covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide and in china respectively presently management of allergic rhinitis ar is a growing concern throughout the world as over 500 million people including 25 million in china have ar and in the event of a global infectious pandemic access to allergy services is likely to be drastically limited or adjusted the concern arises particularly due to an overlap of certain upper respiratory symptoms due to ar influenza as well as viral infection of the upper respiratory tract during the early stages in this sense rhinologists and allergists are responsible for timely diagnosis and treatment of suspected or diagnosed ar patients in order to reduce the patients anxiety of suffering from covid-19 infection and unnecessary medical burden moreover patients receiving allergen immunotherapy ait currently the only curative intervention for ar particularly subcutaneous immunotherapy scit need to attend their local allergy centres to complete their treatments successfully in this regard 13800 patients in china are currently receiving scit and among these patients 87 have reached their maintenance period but not completed their treatment if such patients were unable to continue the ongoing therapy because of the infectious pandemic this would undoubtedly result in great disease-related health and financial loss for the patients as well as financial loss for the local healthcare system thus implementing effective strategies for maximized effective management of ar patients coupled with prevention of the covid-19 cross-infection among health care workers hcws as well as patients within allergy centres during the present covid-19 pandemic is of vital importance for the medical community beijing which is outside the center of the epidemic in china has a total of 588 confirmed covid-19 cases to date three designated hospitals have been opened for the treatment of patients with covid-19 in beijing whereas tasks of the other non-designated comprehensive medical centers such as beijing tongren hospital for example mainly involve screening for covid-19 cases and sustaining emergency and necessary outpatient medical services a fever clinic which was originated from the battle against sars in 2003 in china is specifically set up in our hospital to identify the cause of the fever and distinguish the actual covid-19 cases from patients with fever andor respiratory symptoms similar to those found in covid-19 cases during the covid-19 epidemic the number of outpatient visits to allergy clinic of beijing tongren hospital decreased by 90 compared with the same period in the previous year however this has now gradually recovered to 50 ie 100 patients per day all 423 local ar outpatients are receiving immunotherapy continuously and account for 75 of the total patients undergoing scit the management of ar includes allergen avoidance pharmacotherapy ait and patient education3 a panel of allergyimmunology specialists from the us and canada has recently published an expert panel consensus document which provides a prioritization rational to help guide decision-making for allergistimmunologist when they need to limit services to their patients during the covid-19 pandemic4 based on the experience of allergy clinic of beijing tongren hospital one of the largest and best-known allergy clinics in china we have developed an algorithm specifically for management of ar figure during the covid-19 pandemic in china this involves a strict screening protocol to ensure that the patients who are coming to the allergy clinic are not infected by covid-19 as initially indicated by a body temperature lower than 373c5 and a negative epidemiological history which indicates that the patients had remained in beijing for over 14 days prior to the hospital visit thus for screening purpose the entrance to the hospital has been arranged with infrared human body temperature screening door that a patients temperature is measured and a history of their movement over the last 14 days are recorded before the patient can enter the hospital the epidemiological history is an important part of screening and a record of the patients movement within 2 weeks can be obtained by scanning a smartphone at the entrance of the hospital only patients with both a normal temperature and a negative epidemiological history are allowed to proceed to the outpatient departments and a second body temperature measurement with contactless forehead temperature grab will be performed before entering each targeted department whereas patients with a body temperature higher than 373c are guided to the fever clinic to have additional screening examinations including routine blood tests and chest computed tomography scanning throat swabs are also taken for sars-cov-2 rna testing if necessary to separate patients with fever andor respiratory symptoms including cough runny nose sore throat along with nasal congestion and sneezing similar to those found in covid-19 when a patients viral nucleic acid test result is found to be positive the patient is transferred to one of the covid-19 designated hospitals for further treatment there is presently inconclusive evidence on the safe use of corticosteroids in asthmatic patients affected by covid-19 however in the case of ar patients infected with covid-19 the aria-mask study group and the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology have recently developed an expert consensus statement which recommends that use of intranasal corticosteroids ins in ar should be continued at the recommended dose as stopping the ins would increase sneezing and lead to more spreading of the virus6 in regard to the influence of continuous use of ins in ar patients infected with covid-19 on the disease of covid-19 as well as immune defenses and health outcomes of affected patients there is a paucity of real-world experience and thus the recommendation for ins should be adjusted accordingly based on the new data confirmed in view of the fact that droplets caused by respiratory symptoms such as sneezing and coughing and tears caused by conjunctivitis7 may be an important source of viral transmission the protection of hcws is particularly important when close inspection or contact with allergic patients is necessary for example when administering ait injections besides taking the standardized basic precautions including wearing work clothes disposable surgical masks and waterproof medical caps all hcws in allergy clinics take extra precautions by wearing anti-fog protective goggles and protective face shields during an outpatient visit the patient is admitted to a single consulting room with good ventilation and at most one doctor and one nurse in attendance in the room at the same time patients are required to observe social distancing regulations with other patients when waiting for their consultation with the doctor or when under observation following the immunotherapy injection during this consultation all specialized examinations such as anterior rhinoscopy endoscopy rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry pulmonary function and serum allergen tests are suspended apart from the outpatient visit the patient can obtain knowledge of prevention and control of ar via the general public media platform currently 564 patients are receiving scit in our clinic before covid-19 epidemic of whom 75 of these patients are long-term residents in beijing and undergoing continuous scit following the screening process during the covid-19 epidemic the remaining 25 of the patients who live outside beijing have each been contacted by telephone and been advised that in order to reduce the risk of infection in the process of transportation their treatment should be suspended until the end of the epidemic fortunately to date all the local patients have successfully been treated by ait with no case of infection with covid-19 being recorded among these patients based on this experience it is clear that there needs to be a high level of cooperation between doctors nurses technicians and the patients for a successful outcome at present as beijing enters the peak of the spring pollen season beijing tongren hospital is cooperating with the china meteorological administration httpwwwweathercomcnforecasthfindexshtmlid101010100fromsinglemessageisappinstalled0 and beijing meteorological bureau httpbjweatheriyuebocomweatherphpachart2 to establish a pollen monitoring network for to predict pollen counts providing useful information towards the patients with pollen allergy this service is being popularized via the internet and mobile app technology wechat and also provides medical services such as online consultations and delivery of medications to patients moreover the specialists will also increase tv media publicity httpsitembtimecomf2ig2sk409q9m5pasnv85tns89e and provide more online lectures on diseases using zoom or tencent real time conferencing software during the outbreak the doctors will also recommend to the patients the over-the-counter drugs which can be bought from their local pharmacies to control their allergic symptoms we suggest that the experience and lessons learned from allergy clinics in various countries during the current covid-19 pandemic need to be summarized and shared in time in the hope that this will help in the provision of better services and management of patients suffering from allergic diseases during this pandemic  personal protective equipment doffing practices of healthcare workers linh phan t dayana maita donna mortiz c rachel weber charissa fritzen-pedicini susan bleasdale c rachael jones m   although personal protective equipment ppe falls at the lowest level of the hierarchy of controls due to the dependence of ppe effectiveness on individual behavior it is a primary strategy to prevent disease transmission in healthcare settings specifically the healthcare infection control practices advisory committee hicpac who provide advice and guidance regarding the practice of control of healthcare-associated infections to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the secretary of the department of health and human services recommends the use of ppe in standard and transmission-based infection control precautions1 standard precautions require the hcw to anticipate exposures and select appropriate ppe while transmission-based precautions include a specific ppe ensemble for use by hcws providing care to patients with an infectious disease or disease syndrome classified as being transmitted through the airborne contact or droplet route to prevent disease transmission in healthcare settings ppe must be used consistently and correctly by hcws to prevent exposure and the transport of pathogens to their bodies the infection of two nurses with ebola virus disease evd in dallas texas has been attributed to ppe failure or incorrect ppe use2 simulation studies in which the ppe of hcws are contaminated with pathogen surrogates have shown that improper ppe doffing practices may result in contamination of hcws skin and clothing34 in this study we characterized the ppe use and ppe doffing practices of hcws providing care for patients with viral respiratory infections in an acute care hospital our approach was direct observation performed inside of patient rooms previous work has documented that hcws compliance with ppe use is relatively low and that doffing practices are inconsistent but much of that work involved observations outside of patient rooms or in the context of simulation57 the contribution of this work is the description of doffing practices following routine patient care among diverse worker types inside the rooms of patients with viral respiratory infections and labeled for transmission-based precautions ppe doffing practices of hcws who cared for patients with viral respiratory infections were observed at a 465-bed acute care hospital from march 2017 to june 2017 and september 2017 to april 2018 hcw and patient participants provided written informed consent hcws were eligible to participate if they were adults able to communicate in english and provided care to a patient with a viral infection that had consented to participate in the study eligible hcw participants were recruited at staff meetings and at patient rooms before hcws entered the room hcw participants could participate more than one time because hcws performed different types of care activities andor on different patients during each observation the doffing practice results were not reviewed with hcws following the observations this study was approved by the university of illinois at chicago institutional review board protocol number 2015-0990 patients having respiratory infections were identified through the hospital medmined surveillance system patients were eligible to be recruited if they were adults fluent in english or spanish and had a positive respiratory pathogen panel test within three days prior to the day of observation the patients had a variety of acute viral respiratory infections including influenza a n  23 influenza b n  8 and rhinovirus n  15 and respiratory syncytial virus n  3 coronavirus n  1 parainfluenza n  1 and adenovirus n  1 the study occurred in nine units in the hospital which were classified into three groups 1 intensive care units icus which included the neurological icu the medical icu and the step down unit 2 non-icus which included the rehabilitationorthopedics unit the clinical decisionobservation unit the general medical surgical unit and the livergastroenterology unit and 3 specialty units which included the bone marrow transplant and hematology-oncology units the unit groupings were based on unit workflow and patient medical conditions researchers waited outside patient rooms and performed observations during a 3-hr period typically from 8 am to 12 pm one trained observer recorded the ppe use and doffing practices of hcws inside patient rooms using a pre-defined checklist based on the cdc guideline that included ppe worn sequence of doffing carefulness of doffing disposal location doffing ppe inside out removing ppe from the front and performance of hand hygiene8 the check list is available in the supplementary materials the correct ppe to be worn by hcws was based on the isolation signs mounted outside the patient room door for patients on contact isolation hcws were to wear gloves and a reusable isolation gown for patients on droplet isolation hcws were to wear a surgical mask with eye shield for patients on droplet and contact isolation hcws were to wear gloves a reusable isolation gown and a surgical mask with eye shield visor according to the cdc recommendations the correct doffing sequence includes removing gloves first followed by the gown the mask and then hand hygiene in our study hand hygiene was not included in the correct doffing sequence evaluation but reported separately gloves should be removed by holding the outside palm area of one glove pulling it off and then holding it in the other gloved hand the second glove should be peeled off inside-out using fingers of the ungloved hand a washable reusable fabric gown with ties at the neck should be taken off by unfastening gown ties pulling away from the shoulder inside-out and folding into a bundle a surgical mask should be removed by taking off elastic ear bands of the mask without touching the front of the mask all ppe must be removed before leaving the patient room at the doorway or in anteroom8 in addition we evaluated the doffing carefulness defined as a removal process not involving strong or vigorous movements which may generate infectious aerosols from contaminated ppe data were recorded on paper forms and entered into a database using double data entry access 2016 microsoft redmond wa all data analysis was performed with the r project for statistical computing the r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria differences in proportions among hcw job role groups hospital unit groups and patient isolation categories were tested with the 2 test where expected values were determined using the overall mean proportion statistical significance was set at   005 for all tests although hcws could participate more than one time observations were treated as independent in the statistical analyses because hcws performed different type of care activities andor on different patients during each observation in total we observed the ppe doffing practices of 107 hcws with 23 hcws participating more than once for a total of 166 observations during care of 52 patients four observations were excluded from the analysis because the observer was not able to record the doffing activities of hcws giving a final sample size of 162 observations sample sizes vary slightly for some variables because not all variables were recorded in all observations observations involved nurses n  63 nurse technicians n  37 attending physicians n  18 resident physicians n  15 respiratory therapist n  9 nurse practitioners n  7 environmental service workers esws n  4 nursing students n  3 physical therapists n  3 medical students n  2 and a dietician n  1 we grouped observations of attending physicians resident physicians nurse practitioners and medical students into the provider group nurses and nursing students into the nurse group and physical therapists esws and dieticians into the others group the provider and nurse groupings were based on the observation that these hcws performed similar care activities of the 52 patient participants 30 were in droplet and contact isolation 21 were in droplet isolation and 1 was in contact isolation hcws chose the correct pieces of ppe in 39 of 61 64 observations of care for patients in droplet isolation and in 55 of 97 57 observations of care for patients in for droplet and contact isolation the overall adherence to wearing the ppe specified for each isolation categories was 60 98 of 162 the droplet isolation signs showed that surgical mask with eye shield should be used but in 36 of observations when this piece of equipment was used the hcws took the eye shield off the mask table
1 table
2 summarizes observed doffing errors in 32 of 153 21 of observations in which gloves were worn hcws removed their gloves incorrectly the most frequent glove doffing mistake occurring in 98 of observations was not removing gloves inside-out in 79 of 122 65 of observations in which gowns were worn hcws failed to remove their gowns correctly the most common gown doffing errors were removing gown from the front 58 followed by not pulling away from shoulder inside-out 24 in 35 of 136 26 of observations when masks were worn hcws touched the front of the mask while removing the mask in approximately half of the observations 78 of 160 hcws touched potentially contaminated surfaces or ppe with a bare hand during doffing hand hygiene was not performed after leaving the patient room in 9 of 137 observations 66 among these 9 observations hcws touched potentially contaminated surfaces in 6 of them 67 the overall incorrect doffing percentage was 90 table
3 based on the doffing sequence doffing technique and use of correct ppe the percentage of observations in which hcws did not remove their ppe in the correct sequence was 52 while 40 of observations involved hcws not wearing all the required ppe the percentage of doffing errors did not differ significantly among hcws groups 2  166 p  079 table 3 nor among the groups of hospital units 2  110 p  057 table 3 when evaluated by patient isolation category the percentage of observations involving incorrect doffing sequence and overall incorrect doffing differed 2  128 p  0002 errors were less common among hcws providing care to patients in droplet isolation compared to when providing care to patients in droplet and contact isolation table
4 shows the types of ppe errors made by patient isolation the most common errors involved gown removal to evaluate the assumption that observations could be treated independently despite the repeated participation of 23 hcws we repeated the analyses using only a single observation for each participating hcw and found the same results proper use and doffing of ppe protects hcws and patients from infectious diseases previous studies have evaluated doffing practices of hcws in hospital and laboratory settings using both direct observations and video recording methods and our results are relatively consistent with that of others given differences in study designs katanami et al5 assessed ppe use by hcws using cameras outside of patient rooms identified for contact precautions and reported that adherence to wearing all required ppe was only 34 we observed much higher compliance of ppe use during care for patients in contact isolation 100 table 1 but the comparison is limited by our small numbers of observations n  4 beam et al6 found that 91 of hcws in a simulated care study made contact between unprotected body areas and potentially contaminated surfaces while our study found hcws touched potentially contaminated surfaces with bare hands in 50 of observations part of the difference in these results may be due to the fact that we counted contact made by a bare hand only while beam et al considered contact made by any unprotected body part we found that hcws removed ppe in the wrong sequence in 52 of observations which was similar to percentage of hcws observed by zellmer et al9 zellmer et al however made direct observations outside the patient rooms so several components of the doffing protocol including removing glove inside-out and removing gown from the front were not captured in that study we found that gown doffing was the most common doffing problem among hcws as hcws removed the gown by grasping the front of the gown in 58 of observations this finding was consistent with the beam et al6 study which found that 75 of hcws did not remove the gown as recommended reusable fabric gowns tie in the back and the cdc recommends that these gowns be removed from the backtaken off by unfastening gown ties pulling away from the shoulder inside-out and folding into a bundle however there are different recommendations for gown removal for different types of gowns in particular the cdc recommends removing disposable gowns by pulling the gown in the front away from the body until the ties break and then rolling the gown inside out and removing the gloves with the gown8 this approach is not feasible with reusable fabric gowns that have woven textile ties such as were worn by hcws observed in this study as these ties are difficult to break a possible reason that hcws may frequently doff gowns incorrectly is that they have been trained in both doffing approaches but over time have forgotten that the best doffing strategy depends upon the type of gown the impact of gown doffing method on self-contamination however is uncertain osei-bonsu et al10 in a doffing simulation study involving disposable gowns found that use of the cdc-recommended doffing sequence that includes removing the gown by pulling from the front was associated with fewer participants with any contamination by the surrogate microorganism staphylococcus dermidis than use of the doffing sequence that includes removing the gown from the back 2 of 15 13 vs 8 of 12 70 but no difference was observed in the number of participants with any contamination by the fluorescent tracer 12 of 15 80 vs 11 of 12 92 there is an uncertainty in the cdc recommendations regarding whether hcws should wear a mask with eye shield or simply a mask when in close contact with a patient in droplet isolation11 in our study the hospital required hcws to wear a surgical mask with eye shield in patient rooms identified for droplet isolation and this was indicated on the isolation sign mounted on the room door however we found that in more than one-third of observations when the mask was used hcws took off the eye shield while providing care for patients it may be that hcws remove the eye shield when wearing prescription eye glasses but this aspect of the ppe use was not specifically recorded removal of the eye shield can increase the risk of exposure to splashes of infectious material to the facial mucous membranes of hcws but the eye shield offers much less protection than indirectly vented goggles with anti-fog coating or chin-length face shield in conjunction with a mask as recommended by the national institute for occupational safety and health to protect the conjunctiva from infectious aerosols12 in our study we had a very high incorrect overall doffing rate 90 because we evaluated the doffing technique doffing sequence and the use of correct ppe however all doffing errors are not likely to contribute equally to the risk of disease transmission to hcws or patients it is plausible that touching contaminated surfaces with bare hand and not performing hand hygiene are the highest risk doffing errors because they increase the likelihood that a hcws leaves the patient room with pathogens on his or her hands this issue will be explored in future work that integrates measures of virus presence and concentration on environmental surfaces ppe and hcws many factors may contribute to lack of compliance with ppe use during care for patients in contact andor droplet isolation and with incorrect doffing including incorrect interpretation of the isolation signs workload under valuing the importance of ppe under estimation of risk or lack of knowledge of the correct ppe and correct doffing protocol13 although more complex than the ppe ensembles used in transmission-based precautions human factors analyses of the doffing process for enhanced ppe ensembles used to care for patients with evd have highlighted numerous opportunities for ppe failure and self-contamination3 gurses et al14 concluded that safe doffing of ppe requires knowledge skills and attitudes not just instructions for the sequence and technique for how to remove pieces of ppe our observations suggest that hcws are not familiar with the sequence and technique for how to remove pieces of ppe but training that builds knowledge and skills and changes attitudes may motivate hcws to utilize the correct sequence and technique this requires a more comprehensive approach to training than is commonly employed today one that includes knowledge and practical hands-on experience hands-on training in ppe was commonly used with enhanced ppe ensembles during the ebola virus disease outbreak of 20142015 and trainees identified hands-on training as has having the greatest influence on their confidence to care for ebola virus disease patients15 such training could be integrated into hcws clinical competency skills tests clearly the evidence in this and other work demonstrate that the current approaches are inadequate to obtaining the desired ppe doffing behaviors from hcws our study had more observations of nurses and nurse technicians than hcws with other roles table 3 which is consistent with the relative number of room entries that other studies have reported for hcws of different job titles16 although the ppe use and doffing practices of nurses and nurse technicians were not different from hcws with other job roles table 3 nurses and nurse technicians have frequent intimate contacts with patients that may increase their exposure to pathogens putting them at increased risk for occupationally acquired infectious disease and transferring pathogens outside of the patient room our study is subject to several limitations first our study only observed hcws who provided care for patients with viral respiratory diseases and it is possible that hcws behave differently when patients have different diseases including those that result in contact andor droplet isolation due to the perception of risk second there is a concern that hcws may change their behaviors when being directly observed in this study however the poor compliance with the recommended ppe doffing protocol suggests that hcws were unable to implement the correct practices even when observed finally our study was conducted at a single acute care hospital which may affect the generalizability of our findings to other healthcare settings as work practices may vary between hospitals we found that deviations from the recommended ppe doffing protocol by cdc were common which could increase the risk of self-contamination on hcws clothing and skin after providing care for patients having acute respiratory virus infections in more than 90 of the observations doffing practices involved errors with respect to the doffing sequence doffing technique andor use of appropriate ppe common errors were doffing gown from the front removing the eye shield of the mask and touching potentially contaminated surfaces and ppe during doffing given the complexity of ppe doffing and deficiencies in hcws doffing practices a new approach to education and training is needed  epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients in hengyang hunan province china zhe-feng zhong jia huang xia yang jin-ling peng xiao-yan zhang

december 31 2019 an unexplained pneumonia was reported in wuhan china1 it was found that this pneumonia was caused by a 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov2 which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses the disease caused by sars-cov-2 was called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-193 some previous articles reported the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 in wuhan and even throughout mainland china however from the geographical perspective the data were mainly from the epidemic centers of hubei province especially wuhan45 however the characteristics of patients treated in local hospitals in wuhan are not fully representative of patients outside wuhan therefore it is highly essential to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 in areas outside wuhan or hubei province at the same time there have been limited reports about the differences in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with different genders clinical classification and with or without basic diseases since the first covid-19 patient was discovered on january 16 2020 a total of 48 confirmed cases of covid-19 have been reported in hengyang hunan province a close neighbor city of hubei until 1800 on march 2 2020 all the 48 confirmed cases were cured and discharged at present covid-19 is affecting many countries and territories worldwide6 the present study aimed to summarize the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients in hengyang china and provide a reliable reference for the prevention and control of covid-19 according to the arrangements by the hengyang municipal peoples government all the covid-19 patients were admitted centrally to the affiliated nanhua hospital of the university of south china and the first affiliated hospital of the university of south china without selectivity from january 16 to march 2

period was defined as the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms which was estimated among patients who could provide the exact date of close contact with individuals from wuhan and other epidemic areas with confirmed or suspected sars-cov-2 infection the longest latent period was 15 days and the shortest was 1 day the mean latent period was 686  357 d and the median was 7 iqr 425-900 d the mean time from onset of symptoms to the first physician visit was 338  298 95ci 258-918 d with a median of 2 iqr 1-5 d and the mean time from hospital admission to confirmed diagnosis was 229  211 95ci 118-642 d with a median of 2 iqr 1-3 d it was uncovered that 292 14 of 48 of patients had basic diseases also known as co-morbidities including 2 cases of coronary disease 1 case of hypertension 1 case of coronary disease with hypertension diabetes and cerebral infarction 2 cases of diabetes with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 1 case of diabetes with hypertension and gout and 7 cases of chronic hepatitis b in the 7 cases of chronic hepatitis b the serum markers of hepatitis b were positive for hepatitis b surface antigen hepatitis b e antibody and hepatitis b c antibody 6 cases had hbv-dna titers  500 iuml and 1 case had an hbv-dna titer  500 iuml except for 1 case with elevated alanine aminotransferase alt and 1 case with elevated aspartate aminotransferase ast the remaining 5 patients had normal liver function and 7 patients did not take antiviral drugs the most common symptoms at the time of admission were fever 43 896 of 48 cough and expectoration 41 854 chills 22 458 and fatigue 22 458 other symptoms included poor appetite 13 271 sore throat 9 188 dyspnea 9 188 diarrhea 7 146 dizziness 5 104 headache 5 104 muscle pain 5 104 nausea and vomiting 4 83 hemoptysis 4 83 and runny nose 1 21 at the time of admission the mean body temperature was 383  08 c and respiratory frequency was 2117  178 timesmin the clinical symptoms are summarized in table 2 in the first blood routine examination the majority 29 604 of 48 of patients were in normal range and the levels of leucocytes were reduced in about one third of patients 18 375 neutrophil count was in normal range in the majority of patients 38 792 and it was decreased in some 7 146 and increased in a limited number of patients 3 62 the lymphocyte count was reduced in the majority of patients 34 708 of 48 was in normal range in about one third of patients 13 271 and was elevated in a small number of cases 1 21 the eosinophil count was significantly reduced 48 1000 the liver function tests showed that serum levels of alt ast -gt and alkaline phosphatase were increased in 229 11 of 48 208 10 of 48 216 8 of 37 and 54 2 of 37 of patients respectively the abnormal incidence of alt elevation in male patients was significantly higher than that in female patients p  001 while the abnormal incidence of ast elevation in severe patients was significantly increased compared with moderate patients p  005 after patients with liver disease were excluded there were 1707 7 of 41 of patients with elevated levels of alt and ast and 2424 8 of 33 with elevated level of -gt the serum myocardial enzyme test revealed that the levels of lactate dehydrogenase ld-l myoglobin mb and creatine kinase ck were increased in 370 17 of 46 136 6 of 44 and 128 6 of 47 of patients respectively the incidence of abnormal ck elevation in severe patients was significantly higher than that in moderate patients p  005 for renal function test some patients 10 209 of 48 were found to have increased levels of uric acid in terms of fibrinolysis detection the levels of fibrinogen and d-dimer were increased in 447 21 of 47 and 295 13 of 44 of patients respectively additionally elevated serum levels of c-reactive protein and blood glucose were noted in 646 31 of 48 and 432 19 of 48 of patients respectively compared with moderate patients the incidence of abnormal levels of blood glucose was remarkably increased in the severe patients p  005 the results of laboratory examination are shown in table 3 except for 1 mild case other patients 47 9792 of 48 had pulmonary lesions of which 833 4 of 48 were single lung lesions and 8958 43 of 48 were double lung lesions pleural effusion appeared in 2 2 417 cases as well average time from onset to the first appearance of lung lesions in chest computed tomography ct was 318  271 95ci 3031-463 d multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes in the early stage of lung lesions were evident in the extra-pulmonary zone as the disease progresses multiple ground glass shadows and invasive lesions may appear in the lungs and in severe cases pulmonary consolidation may occur figure 2 illustrates dynamic changes of chest ct in 1 case of severe covid-19 all the patients received antiviral drugs including alpha-interferon 5 million units atomization average 112 d lopinavirritonavir 500 mg bid average 99 d arbidol 200 mg tid average 78 d and chloroquine phosphate 500 mg bid average 70 d moreover 38 792 patients were given tcm based on the treatment protocol7 furthermore 2 42 patients received treatment of human umbilical-cord mesenchymal stem cells a number of patients mainly those with co-infection were treated with antibiotics including moxifloxacin cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium severe patients were given methylprednisolone 1-2 mgkg per day and immunoglobulin for 3-5 d on march 2 2020 all the 48 patients with confirmed covid-19 were cured and discharged the outbreak of covid-19 in china is roughly divided into three phases910 the first phase occurred before the end of december 2019 covid-19 mainly caused a local outbreak among people who had contact with seafood markets in early january 2020 the second phase commenced with clusters of disease in multiple communities or families in wuhan and human-to-human transmission among close contacts1011 in mid-to-late january 2020 with the approach of the spring festival personnel mobility increased and the third phase of outbreak appeared at this time the epidemic spread from hubei province to other provinces in mainland china10 hengyang hunan province a close neighbor of hubei province began to have an outbreak in mid-january 2020 just before commencing the traditional chinese new year the first case of covid-19 onset was found on january 16 2020 and the onset occurred 2 d after he contacted with people from wuhan the distribution of confirmed cases of covid-19 by date of onset in hengyang was mainly concentrated from mid-january to late-january no new cases were found in hengyang after february 14 due to non-pharmacological interventions adopted in china including wearing masks and home isolation which effectively cut off the transmission route of the virus none of the patients in hengyang had a history of wild animal contact within 14 d excluding the possibility of animal infection approximately 583 of the patients had a history of travel or residency in the epidemic areas of wuhan 14 d before onset indicating that the early cases of hengyang were introduced from wuhan 313 had no contact with the epidemic areas within 14 d while there was a clear history of contact with the patients infected with sars-cov-2 besides 229 had clustered onset of which 10 were in family and 1 in community the characteristics of the clustered onset are similar to those of other regions in china910 among the 48 covid-19 patients the mean time from onset of symptoms to the first physician visit was 378  298 d and the mean time from hospital admission to confirmed diagnosis was 229  211 d which was shorter than the time reported in the literature910 these are closely related to the government and residents attaching great importance to the prevention and treatment of covid-19 and technological advancements in health care totally 48 patients with covid-19 were enrolled of which 1 was mild 38 were moderate and 9 were severe compared with patients who were initially infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan11 the severity of illness of patients in hengyang was relatively mild the common symptoms of patients with covid-19 in hengyang were fever cough fatigue and chills approximately 104 of patients did not have fever and were easily ignored in the daily temperature screening symptoms of the upper respiratory tract were rare with only 1 case of runny nose which was favorable for distinguishing the disease from the upper respiratory tract one patient had no symptoms positive signs or changes in chest ct before and after hospitalization and only sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test was positive which was called asymptomatic novel coronavirus infection the literature has reported that asymptomatic patients with novel coronavirus infection are also highly infectious6 wong et al12 found that sars-cov-2 can be prevented through basic infection control measures including wearing of masks washing hands and environmental hygiene the laboratory tests showed the following findings first the numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes lymphocytes and eosinophils were significantly reduced especially the number of eosinophils which was remarkably decreased in all the patients second it was revealed that the levels of alt ast and -gt were increased in 229 208 and 216 of patients respectively at present it is believed that covid-19 patients suffer from dysfunction or injury in multiple organs of the body due to the following three reasons first the novel coronavirus directly damages the targeted organ13-15 second the novel coronavirus induces systemic inflammatory immune response in the human body5 third toxic and side effects of some drugs are important during the course of covid-19 treatment16 however further research should be conducted to confirm the above-mentioned findings except for one mild patient the other 47 patients had morphological characteristic of pulmonary lesions on chest ct which plays a pivotal role in diagnosing covid-1917  the pandemic of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment18 the patients in the present study were treated with a combination of western medicine and tcm none of the 38 ordinary patients got worse and became severe and all 48 patients were cured and discharged in the absence of effective drugs for covid-1918 tcm is a helpful treatment option the current study was limited by a number of factors that require further attention first a small number of covid-19 cases were involved in this study second laboratory examination results of a number of patients were missed resulting in incomplete data in conclusion compared with patients initially infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan the symptoms of patients with covid-19 in hengyang are relatively mild and the mean time from onset of symptoms to the first physician visit and the mean time from hospital admission to confirmed diagnosis are shorter covid-19 patients in the present research have the following characteristics first in addition to fever and respiratory symptoms there are other systemic symptoms second the numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes lymphocytes and eosinophils are significantly reduced especially the number of eosinophils which is reduced in all the patients third some morphological characteristics of pulmonary lesions appeared in the chest ct scan fourth laboratory tests revealed multiple organ abnormality or damage our outcomes may assist clinicians in diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 at present coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is influencing 210 countries and territories worldwide which is becoming a severe public health concern there have been rare reports about the differences in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with different genders clinical classification and with or without basic diseases to study the differences in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with different genders clinical classification and with or without basic diseases and provide a reliable reference for the prevention and control of covid-19 from january 16 to march 2 2020 a total of 48 confirmed cases of covid-19 have been reported in hengyang and were included in this study all the data were imported into the excel worksheet and statistically analyzed by using spss250 software the main symptoms of covid-19 patients in hengyang were fever cough and expectoration fatigue and chills and there were multiple organ dysfunction or damage such as reduced peripheral blood leukocytes lymphocytes and eosinophils and increased c-reactive protein fibrinogen blood glucose ld-l d-dimer alt ast -gt mb and ck except for the mild patients chest ct showed pulmonary lesions on march 2 2020 48 patients with covid-19 were all cured and discharged the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with different genders clinical classification and with or without basic diseases are not very different in most cases and slightly different in individual cases clinical manifestations and laboratory tests reveal that patients with covid-19 have multiple organ dysfunction or damage the mechanism of covid-19 combining multiple organ dysfunction or damage is worth

giuliano grazzini nadia lopez ilaria pati giuseppe marano simonetta pupella giancarlo liumbruno maria   coronaviruses are enveloped singlestranded rna viruses belonging to the family of coronaviridae while initial research focused on their ability to cause enzootic infections infections that have emerged in the past two decades demonstrate their ability to cross the species barrier and infect humans 1 2 the ensuing epidemics have included severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and the more recent middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 and have resulted in severe disease burden mortality and economic disruption 3 a novel flulike coronavirus emerging towards the end of 2019 and subsequently named sarscov2 has been associated with an epidemic initially focused in wuhan china sarscov2 belongs to the same group coronavirus of coronaviruses responsible of sars and mers 2 over december 2019 and february sarscov2 spread rapidly throughout china infecting many thousands of people and causing more than 3000 deaths 4 5 as a consequence on 30 january the world health organization who announced that the outbreak of sarscov2 in china was a public health emergency of international concern pheic 6 the influence of globalization particularly on travel rapidly caused the infection to spread to countries outside china initially to neighbouring asian countries and then to more than 120 countries around the world as of the time of writing this commentary more than 200 000 individuals have contracted sarscov2 data updated on 20 march 2020 7 on 11 march the who declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic 6 currently italy is the country with the highest number of cases of sarscov2 infection after china a situation which has precipitated a health and social emergency focusing on our role within the italian blood system we note that there has been no scientifically documented evidence of the transmission of coronavirus infection through the transfusion of blood components during previous epidemics the current sarscov2 outbreak has stimulated further discussion on this issue particularly on the safety of blood donations in endemic countries 8 in italy the transfusion network is overseen through regional blood coordinating centres rbccs by the italian national blood centre cns which is the health ministrys technical and scientific advisory body on matters related to blood and blood products the cns acts also as the national competent authority as established by the european commission on blood and related issues on behalf of the same ministry to guarantee high standards of blood safety and sufficiency blood donation is sourced both from public hospitalbased blood establishments bes and licensed and accredited blood donor associations and federations blood collection sites in a 21 split and is restricted to voluntary unpaid donors the first sarscov2 local transmitted cases in italy were observed on 18 february 2020 and were initially clustered in a few cities in northern italy the italian government starting on 23 february and up to the date of writing this manuscript has released eight decrees aimed at limiting the spread of sarscov2 the cns has already released since 22 january 2020 a recommendation outlining preventative measures for the transmission of sarscov2 by transfusion of labile blood components related to travels from the peoples republic of china on 24 february 2020 a new document was released with reference also to italian territories this document included the following recommendations
strengthen surveillance measures on possible imported cases by questioning blood donors for travel to the peoples republic of chinastrengthen surveillance measures on possible cases with contacts with documented sarscov2 infectiondefer from donating for 28 days
donors who have been in the peoples republic of chinadonors who have possibly been exposed to the risk of infection by contact with subjects with sarscov2 documented infectiondonors at risk because they have transited and stopped since 1 february 2020 in the municipalities of lombardy and veneto regions designated as the zona rossa red zone identified as the initial foci of the infection in italydonors with a history of sarscov2 infection documented infection or onset of symptoms compatible with sarscov2 infection who are convalescentrequire donors to inform their bes in the case of symptoms compatible with sarscov2 infection or in the case of diagnosis of sarscov2 infection within 14 days after donation postdonation informationpromote the implementation at bes and associated collection sites of simple triage processes during the reception of donors in order to avoid the possible spread of the virus in the waiting rooms these included the measurement of body temperature outside the collection area a body temperature value of 375c was defined as a criterion for the temporary deferral of the donorrequest all the personnel working at bes and collection sites to comply scrupulously with behavioural protocols designed to prevent the spread of respiratory infections including sarscov2 infection
 in addition the cns advised the associations and federations of voluntary blood donors to inform adequately all their staff and donors about the epidemiology symptoms and preventative measures of sarscov2 infection the cns recommended that the rbccs further implement regional patient blood management programmes in order to conserve the blood supply and enhance and monitor closely strategic regional blood component stocks using information systems in order to ensure balance and adjustment thus minimizing any intra or interregional blood component shortages several updates of this document were released by the cns as the epidemiology of sarscov2 infection rapidly evolved on 2 march 2020 following the recommendations of the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 9 and reflecting the decrees of the italian government the cns updated the prevention measures reducing the period of temporary deferral of donors from the previous 28 to 14 days along with appeals to donate in order to avoid shortages in the blood supply the same document also included additional recommendations for the associations and federations of voluntary blood donors these included the maintenance of safe interindividual distance a minimum of 1 m in waiting rooms a careful planning of the schedule for calling up donors in order to regulate the volume of human traffic within centres a meticulous disinfection of hands of the be and collection sites personnel and similarly rigorous protocols for the sanitation and disinfection of the collection rooms the use of masks for both be personnel and donors was not required following the recommendations of the who and national health authorities these measures were progressively extended to most of the cities of northern italy 9 march 2020 following the declaration of the government of the widespread dissemination of the sarscov2 infection in italy the last update of the cns on 10 march 2020 extended these measures to the whole national territory of italy on 18 march the cns defined specific criteria for collection of plasma from convalescent subjects the cns continues to reinforce its appeal to donate blood components in both public hospital bes and associated collection sites given the limitations on movement imposed by the government the cns has been pivotal in communicating and managing the necessary deviations from these measures of donors and the healthcare personnel involved in blood donation in order to maintain the smooth collection of blood in the first week of march a reduction of 10 whole blood donations per week was experienced by the italian blood system from 48 000  as a standard number of blood donations per week in this period  to 43 000 nationwide but the inventory was maintained by a contemporary reduction of elective surgery using mediumhigh amounts of blood the strategic reserve of blood kept for emergencies was not accessed during the second week of march after the campaign of the cns and italian government encouraging blood donation we observed a 12 increase in the collection of whole blood from 48 000 to 53 600 nationwide in fig 1 the trend of positive cases for sarscov2 infection in italy updated on 20 march 2020 is reported with a concise chronology of the main documents released and the trend of blood donations in the same period these measures have been able to guarantee blood safety and supply in italy we hope that our ongoing experience as briefly reported in this commentary will help transfusion medicine specialists from other countries who are facing the effect of this epidemic on the blood supply we propose that it is possible to manage a transfusion system during this critical period using pragmatic prudent and evidencebased measures in our country so far blood donation after an initial fall 10 has been maintained during sarscov2 emergency having been recognized by the government as a priority in order to maintain basic healthcare services with the sarscov2 outbreak spreading in all european countries we recommend defining common european guidelines that establish screening criteria for blood donors such criteria need to take into account the different epidemiological situations in different countries while establishing common principles ensuring blood safety throughout europe    p pu ur rp po os se e  to describe the outbreak of

intubation outside the or c cl li in ni ic ca al l f fe ea at tu ur re es s  the sars outbreak in toronto was the result of a single index patient the causative virus sars-cov is moderately contagious and is spread by droplets and contact the virus gains access to host through the mucosa of the respiratory tract and the eyes it can affect both healthy and compromised patients the use of several precautionary measures such as goggles gloves gowns and facemasks and the application of various infection control strategies designed to minimize the spread of the virus are discussed c co on nc cl

practice  s of july 10 2003 438 cases 250 probable 188 suspect of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars were reported in canada 375 853 of which occurred in ontario 1 the majority of cases in ontario occurred in the greater toronto area gta sars has resulted in unprecedented apprehension in the local community and severe economic harm to local business and tourism more importantly it has challenged health care workers to use effective infection control measures in the present article we will discuss the infection control guidelines for the anesthesiologist that were adopted by our institution the rationale behind them and the impact of the sars outbreak on anesthesiologists in toronto illness was called severe acute respiratory syndrome sars with a case definition table i from the world health organization who 3 on march 12 2003  who issued a global alert in relation to clusters of sars 4 in toronto the first documented case was a 78-yr-old woman who had travelled to hong kong on february 13 with her husband 5 in hong kong she and her husband stayed at a hotel at the same time and on the same floor as the guangdong physician from whom the outbreak in hong kong originated on returning to toronto on february 23 she stayed in her apartment which she shared with family members two days later she became ill and died at home on march 5 2003  several of the family subsequently developed respiratory symptoms the 43-yr-old son was admitted to the emergency department of a community hospital in scarborough that became the epicentre of the toronto outbreak by the end of april 262 sars cases 143 probable 119 suspected and 21 deaths had been reported in ontario the majority in the gta 6 all these cases could be traced back to the original index patient on april 23 who issued a travel advisory warning for toronto which was removed one week later on may 14 toronto was removed from the list of areas affected by sars as no new probable case had been reported since april 19 however another cluster of sars patients was discovered on may 23 2003 7 the second cluster was traced to a 96-yr-old man who underwent surgery for a fractured pelvis in a hospital in north york on april 19 while in hospital he developed sars but it was managed as postoperative pneumonia he infected several other patients in his ward including a woman who was later transferred to a rehabilitation hospital this resulted in a further 118 cases in the gta as of july 10 2003 1 eventually on july 2 who removed toronto from the list of areas with recent local transmissions r re e--e ex xa am mi in na at ti io on n o of f i in nf fe ec ct ti io on n c co on nt tr ro ol l m me ea as su ur re es s the sars outbreak is unique in recent history of public health because of its rapidity of transmission its concentration in health care settings and the large number of health care workers who were infected in an analysis of a cohort of 144 patients with sars in the gta 73 51 were health care workers 8 including 14 19 physicians and 29 40 nurses anesthesiologists as specialists in airway management are at high risk because of frequent exposure to patients respiratory secretions three anesthesiologists in our area were infected 9 they contracted the disease after tracheal intubation of patients with respi- -high fever  38c and -cough or breathing difficulty and one or more of the following exposures during the ten days prior to onset of symptoms -close contact b with a person who is a suspect or probable case of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars -history of travel to an area with recent local transmission of sars -residing in an area with recent local transmission of sars 2 a person with an unexplained acute respiratory illness resulting in death after 1 november 2002 a but on whom no autopsy has been performed and one or more of the following exposures during to ten days prior to onset of symptoms -close contact b with a person who is a suspect or probable case of sars -history of travel to an area with recent local transmission of sars -residing in an area with recent local transmission of sars probable case 1 a suspect case with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome rds on chest x-ray cxr 2 a suspect case of sars that is positive for sars coronavirus by one or more assays 3 a suspect case with autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of rds without an identifiable cause ratory failure of unknown cause these cases occurred in the early stage of the outbreak before sars was suspected the anesthesiologists wore surgical facemasks gowns and gloves but no gogglesvisors international investigations have revealed important information that prompted health care workers to reexamine the precautionary measures for infection control the agent that causes sars is a new coronavirus sars-cov unlike any other human or animal virus in the coronavirus family 10 11 the virus can survive for up to 48 hr after drying on plastic surfaces 12 in hong kong the virus survived in urine and feces for at least 24 and 48 hr respectively in patients with diarrhea the virus can survive up to four days in the stool sample which has a lower acidity than normal stools 12 thus once the body is exposed to this viral agent the body surface can be contaminated for an extended time similarly exposed inanimate objects may act as carriers for up to 48 hr the virus is spread predominately by infectious droplets and contact because of early reports of clusters of cases in community settings such as apartment buildings and the high infection rates among health care workers in hong kong taiwan hanoi and toronto the etiological agent of sars was thought to be highly contagious 13 14 however with the exception of superspreaders there is growing evidence that sars-cov is only moderately transmissible 15 16 the average number of secondary infections generated per case at the start of the epidemic was estimated as 27 which is much lower than that for influenza 17 in some instances however a single individual superspreader has directly infected a large number of other people this is exemplified by the singapore outbreak in which half of the first reported 201 probable cases were infected by five source cases 18 despite the discovery of the virus and its genome it is still uncertain when patients are most infectious and how to identify superspreaders 19  in hong kong and toronto most of the patients infected with sars had no co-morbid illnesses and half of them 44-51 were fit health care workers 8 20 approximately one in five 20-23 patients with sars required admission to intensive care units icu with or without ventilatory support in a detailed analysis of cases identified in the initial outbreak associated with the nosocomial transmission of sars in the index hospital in toronto the case fatality rates were 29 and 538 for those aged less than or over 60 yr respectively 1 the case-fatality rate was calculated by dividing the cumulative number of deaths within 60 days after symptom onset by the total number of probable and suspect cases data from the who 21 revealed that the overall case fatality ratio was 14 to 15 and was influenced by age table ii  this ratio was estimated by survival analysis based on the individual data from the onset of the illness until death or full recovery early in the toronto sars outbreak full protective gear goggles gowns n95 masks and gloves was considered to be sufficient to protect health care workers from sars in april a number of health care workers contracted the infection during their care of sars patients despite increased protective precautions 22 23 experience from hong kong suggested that the infection among protected health care worker was related to how well the precautionary measures were used in a case-control survey 24 they found no infection in staff using complete precautionary measures whereas infected staff had omitted at least one of the precautionary measures this demonstrates how difficult it is to practice and perfect full infection control in view of the long survival ability of the virus outside the body additional measures have been suggested however most important of all is the hypervigilance of health care workers in practicing infection control measure i in nf fe ec ct ti io on n c co on nt tr ro ol l g gu ui id de el li in ne es s f fo or r a an ne es st th he es si ia a exposure to oral and respiratory secretions at the time of tracheal intubation subjects the anesthesiologist to a serious risk of acquiring the infection health organizations and agencies such as who 25 this guideline applies to all surgical patients and is based on long-standing recommendations by health canada that masks and eye protection or face shields should be worn where appropriate to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes nose and mouth during procedures and patient care activities likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood body fluids secretions or excretions 29 for practical purposes the anesthetic machine is considered dirty and the anesthetic drug cart as clean the machine is usually the first area anesthesiologists touch after contact with the patient a large container is positioned on the anesthesia machine in which all airway equipment laryngoscope blade and handle mask suction catheter etc is placed after use the container and its contents are removed from the or as soon as possible following intubation the contents are separated for cleaning sterilization or disposal before they are returned to the or a second set of equipment including clean masks laryngoscope handles and blades is immediately available all steps are taken to keep the anesthesia drug cart clean the cart is used only after hand-washing or removal of the outer pair of gloves thus the infection control team should be informed about the transfer route the spread of respiratory droplets from the infected patient should be minimized by the patient wearing a n95 mask without an expiratory valve staff involved in the transfer and the care of patients in the or should take full dropletcontact precautions clean surgical scrub suits laundered by the hospital should be worn and personalized hats or hair covers are avoided the rationale for using alcohol-based hand rub n95 masks gowns gloves and powered respirators in the or has been reviewed recently 9 because the sars-cov virus is spread by droplets and can survive on inanimate objects for 48 hr extra precautions and vigilance are important to avoid contaminating anesthesia equipment or surfaces such as the telephone in the or double gloves are recommended when handling sars patients the outer pair is removed after direct patient contact and before touching equipment or furniture in other areas of the room of the precautions recommended above the use of personal protection systems pps may be the most unfamiliar for anesthesiologists although it is not currently recommended by health canada 27 hospitals in ontario are using pps according to the directive from the ministry of health and long-term care of ontario to all ontario acute care hospitals for high-risk procedures 28 the pps adopted in our institution is the powered air-purifying respirator papr 3m berkshire uk system while other hospitals have purchased the stryker t4 stryker kalamazoo mi usa pps no consensus has been reached regarding which has the better air filtration system nonetheless these systems are considered to be important barriers to protect health care workers during high-risk procedures such as intubation and extubation the papr consists of a beltmounted powered air purifier with a high efficiency particulate air hepa filter connected via a tube to a lightweight headpiece figures 1 and 2  the hepa filter removes particles of 03 to 15  with an efficiency of 98 to 100 30 the lightweight hood or headpiece provides excellent coverage of the head face and neck we have several years experience in using the papr system in the bronchoscopy suite without disease transmission to health-care workers there are several important clinical points to remember first it takes time training and assistance to put on the personal protective equipment and the papr system properly advance warning of a patient in need of tracheal intubation is required in order to prepare properly second the personal protective equipment must be removed in proper sequence to avoid contamination of the users third it is difficult to communicate with each other due to the noise generat-ed by the high flow through the papr system this noisy environment may cause errors due to its potential for miscommunication contaminated protective gear must be removed before transferring the patient to the recovery room time should be allowed for the anesthesiologist and assistant to remove contaminated gloves gowns face shields or masks and head cover and renew protective precautions at the end of the case the anesthesia machine is protected with high efficiency low volume filters

hygroscopic filter based on hydrostatic charge may become overwhelmed when wet and will allow passage of virus with the filter placed in both limbs of the circuit the soda lime does not need to be changed but the end-tidal co 2 sample line and trap must be changed after the case most ors currently use positive pressure with up to 20 room air exchanges per hour because of the high air exchanges in the or aerosolized infectious particles will be cleared rapidly however those in close contact during a high-risk procedure such as tracheal intubationextubation may still have a high exposure and those outside the room may be exposed to infectious aerosols if the door to the or is left open therefore movement in and out of the or must be kept to a minimum during the procedure local experience from personnel who contracted sars during airway instrumentation suggested that patient coughing should be kept at a minimum before during and after intubation andor induction of anesthesia instrumentation of the airway with either a cuffed endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway is acceptable and should be performed by the most experienced staff available despite the long list of precautions suggested by our institutional guidelines it is difficult to list details of all the modifications to practice that have occurred questions concerning best practice remain for example should the pager be clipped on the or uniform inside the or should we use tape from the roll to secure the endotracheal tube or should the tape be precut anesthesiologists are familiar with the importance of vigilance in maintaining patient safety a similar high level of vigilance is necessary to prevent the spread of this serious infection in the second month of the outbreak a cluster of six health care workers contracted sars after participating in a difficult and prolonged tracheal intubation 23 since then most hospitals have included anesthesiologists the specialists in airway management to assist in the tracheal intubation of sars patients to minimize aerosol spread by coughing intubation is performed in sedated and paralyzed patients personnel performing intubation anesthesiologists and respiratory technicians must take full precautions including the papr figure 2 the powered air-purifying respirator papr system consists of a belt-mounted powered air purifier with a high efficiency particulate air hepa filter figure 1 a lightweight headpiece is connected to the powered air purifying respirator papr system via a tube hood gown gloves etc as outlined in the previous section there must be a well-rehearsed plan and protective clothing intubating equipment and essential drugs must be provided particular care is necessary for the removal of potentially contaminated clothing in summary it is extraordinary that the spread of the infection in the gta outbreak can be traced to one person with unrecognized sars the outbreak disrupted the health care and living in a city the size of toronto one hopes for greater vigilance in the future anesthesiologists are unique in their frequent exposure to respiratory secretions and blood we must pay greater heed

december 2019 the coronavirus disease has massively spread with overwhelming of health care systems and numerous deaths worldwide to remedy this several countries including france have taken strict lockdown measures requiring the closure of all but essential places this unprecedented disruption of daily routines has a strong potential for disrupting nutritional behaviours nutrition being one of the main modifiable risk factors for chronic disease risk this may have further consequences for public health our objective was therefore to describe nutritional behaviours during the lockdown period and to put them in light of individual characteristics methods 37252 french adults from the web-based nutrinet-sant cohort filled lockdown-specific questionnaires in april-may 2020 nutritional behaviours body weight physical activity 24h-dietary records nutritional behaviours were compared before and during lockdown using student paired t-tests and associated to individual characteristics using multivariable logistic or linear regression models clusters of nutritional behaviours were derived from multiple correspondence analysis and ascending hierarchical classification results during the lockdown trends for unfavourable nutritional behaviours were observed weight gain for 35 18kg on average decreased physical activity 53 increased sedentary time 63 increased snacking decreased consumption of fresh food products especially fruit and fish increased consumption of sweets biscuits and cakes yet opposite trends were also observed weight loss for 23 -2kg on average increased home-made cooking 40 increased physical activity 19 these behavioural trends related to sociodemographic and economic position professional situation during the lockdown teleworking or not initial weight status having children at home anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as diet quality before the lockdown modifications of nutritional practices mainly related to routine change food supply emotional reasons but also to voluntary changes to adjust to the current situation these results suggest that the lockdown led in a substantial part of the population to unhealthy nutritional behaviours that if maintained in the long term may increase the nutrition-related burden of disease and also impact immunity yet the lockdown situation also created an opportunity for some people to improve their nutritional behaviours with high stakes to understand the leverages to put these on a longterm footing  the world is currently facing a major pandemic of the coronavirus disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov-2 first reported in wuhan china in december 2019 the outbreak of covid-19 has since massively spread all over the globe counting as of june 3 2020 more than 6348900 confirmed cases and 380800 deaths 1 2  considering the numerous unknowns surrounding the sars cov-2 the absence of treatment and in order to stop a fast-growing transmission of the disease and the subsequent overwhelming of hospitals and health care systems several countries have opted for strict lockdown measures in france with over 151600 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 29000 deaths reported as of june 3 2020 such lockdown measures were declared by the government on march 17 th  requiring the closure of all but essential public places businesses and services including schools and universities workplaces non-food shops open and green spaces recreational spaces including sports clubs and local outdoor food markets when physical distancing could not be applied the population was required to stay home and only go outside in close proximity for essential needs including grocery shopping medical care legal obligations or limited recreational physical activity within a 1km radius from home under police control only workers from essential sectors eg healthcare food and drug manufactures and supplies garbage collection city cleaning vehicle and technology maintenance were allowed to keep their usual activity with protective equipment and physical distancing guidelines as a result a vast majority of the population either were asked to telework from home or became partially unemployed and parents had to relay school teachers at home on may 11 th and then june 2 nd the lockdown measures were partially lifted but the situation has not returned to normal yet eg most employees are encouraged to keep working from home physical distancing is required in public transports schools companies shops bars and restaurants when open limiting their capacity free movement across borders is still very limited this unprecedented situation has left people with a sudden disruption of their daily routines with nonetheless a variety of circumstances according to the sociodemographic and economic status and the residential area accompanied by major uncertainties and worrystress related to a pandemic with continuous media coverage but also to the current and future professional and familial organization the consequences of the lockdown measures for the physical and mental health of the population have therefore come into question in particular the lockdown has a strong potential for disrupting nutritional behaviours notably due to modified access to food stopping daily travels and mobility sedentary lifestyle foodmeals contributing to give rhythm to the day buying food and limited physical activity being the only authorized activities outside home for most people nutrition diet physical activity weight status is one of the main modifiable factors for chronic disease risk such as cardiovascular diseases type 2 diabetes and some cancers 3 4  besides mounting evidence shows the impact of nutritional factors on the functioning of the immune system through various mechanisms including gut microbiota modulation 5 6  thus nutrition may directly impact the risk of sars cov-2 infection and its prognosis 7 8 9 10  it is therefore important to inform what happened during the lockdown period in terms of nutritional behaviours and assess the related potential consequences for public health now and in the future indeed the duration of the initial lockdown period might have been sufficient for modified habits to settle in some individuals 11 12  moreover the situation is not resolved yet no vaccines or treatment to date and new lockdown periods may occur in the future at the individual or population levels regionally or nationally the nutrinet-sant web platform offered the unique opportunity to collect a large amount of nutritional behavioural and health data during the lockdown for 37000 french adults using online questionnaires and validated dietary records the aim of the present study was to characterise nutritional behaviours in this large population of volunteers during the lockdown period and how these differed from usual nutritional behaviours in light of individual characteristics the nutrinet-sant cohort started in france in 2009 with the objective to study the associations between nutrition and health as well as the determinants of nutritional behaviours 13  recruitment of participants adults and more recently teenagers aged 15 years old is still ongoing the study uses a secured online platform to reach out to participants and collect data this flexible platform allows for the rapid implementation of new research protocols as needed the nutrinet-sant study is conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and all procedures were approved by the institutional review board of the french institute for health and medical research irb inserm 0000388fwa00005831 and by the commission nationale de linformatique et des liberts cnil 908450 and 909216 all participants provided informed consent with an electronic signature this study is registered in clinicaltrialsgov nct03335644 upon inclusion nutrinet-sant participants are asked to complete a set of five validated self-administered web-based questionnaires related to 1 sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics 14  2 health status 3 dietary intakes 15 16 17  4 physical activity short form of the international physical activity questionnaire ipaq 18  and 5 anthropometrics 19 20  these questionnaires are then repeated every 6 to 12 months during follow-up in particular dietary intakes are assessed every 6 months as part of the usual cohort follow-up using three non-consecutive 24h dietary records randomly assigned over two weeks and including two weekdays and one weekend day these web-based 24h dietary records have been validated against dietary records filled during an interview with a dietitian and against biomarkers 15 16 17  portion sizes are estimated using validated photographs standard containers or directly in gl mean daily energy alcohol and macro-and micro-nutrient intakes are estimated using a published french food composition database comprising 3500 food items 21  amounts consumed from composite dishes are estimated using french recipes validated by food and nutrition professionals dietary under-reporters are detected on the basis of the method proposed by black 22  in turn the ipaq is sent each year to the participants assessing their physical activity vigorous intensity moderate intensity or walking and time spent seated on an average day outside sleeping hours during the past 7 days physical activity levels for each participant are computed as metabolic equivalents met minutes per week in april 2020 a set of questionnaires was sent to the nutrinet-sant participants to collect extensive data on nutritional behaviours during the lockdown a specific questionnaire for participants to perform a qualitative assessment of changes in their

the same as those that are regularly sent to the participants as part of their followup described above body weights at the beginning and at the end of the strict lockdown period were collected from self-measures reported as integer values in questionnaires sent respectively in early april and early may 2020 in these questionnaires participants were also asked about their weight just before the lockdown participants were asked if they had been able to measure their weight with a scale during this period and provide measured data the web-based self-reported body weight has been validated in the cohort by comparison with standardized clinical measurements 19  body mass index bmi was computed as weight kilograms  height meters  the following categories of body weight status were defined

that they were somehow stressed from the idea of lacking some food during the lockdown only 33 of participants reported that they stored more food than usual at home because they were afraid of food shortages while 45 stored more food due to a reduced frequency of grocery shopping characteristics of participants associated with these behaviours are shown in supplementary table 5  sources of food supply  figure 5  during the lockdown individuals used on average 36 sd 17 different sources of food supply which is 11 less than usual paired student t-test p0001 the top 3 sources of supply during the lockdown were the supermarket 66 the bakery 603 and the local grocery store 413 the latter owing its third place from reduced visits compared to usual to local outdoor markets which showed the sharpest reduction especially in cities 20000 inhabitants hypermarkets and local shops such as the butchers fishmongers or greengrocers contrary to the reduction observed for all sources of supply slight increases were observed for internet phone or mail-order purchases and for purchase of food baskets from farmers or amap associations supporting small farming and only a small decrease was observed for organic food stores overall 63 participants declared that they were not living in their usual home during the lockdown which may have impacted the sources of supply two main synthetic

this version posted june 5 2020  this study conducted on 37000 french adults provide an overview of the nutritional behaviours observed during the lockdown set in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic to control the spread of the disease our results highlight several trends in nutritional behaviours during the lockdown on one hand there was a trend towards rather unfavourable nutritional behaviours with increased energy intakes decreased physical activity levels and increased sedentary time and eventually weight gain 18kg in two months the weight gained in this short period of time may become permanent in some individuals and further lead to more weight gain in the future all the more if the unfavourable nutritional behaviours observed during the lockdown are not reversed 29  this is of concern especially since individuals more likely to have gained weight were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the lockdown beyond energy balance we also observed trends towards increasing snacking behaviours several times a day every day when the public health recommendation is to avoid snacking between main meals 28  and a consistent increase reported for the consumption of sweets chocolate biscuits or cakes individuals also reported buying fewer fresh products notably due to less frequent shopping or difficulties in accessing their usual food stores or finding their usual food products especially for older individuals decreasing the consumption of fresh vegetables likely led to increases in frozen or canned vegetables intake yet a similar compensation did not appear for fruit or for fish raising the question of substitution between these different types of products and their respective supply in particular the lower intake of fish may be of particular concern since it consistently translated into a reduced intake of related nutrients such as long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or iodine in line lower intakes of vitamin d were also observed in a context where vitamin d status is likely already strongly impacted by the lockdown the majority of vitamin d being produced following sun exposure which was often not compatible with the requirement to stay home the lockdown also resulted in reported nutritional behaviours linked to the disruption of habits and notably the loss of activity work or leisure-related such as eating to compensate for boredom or anxiety or having trouble keeping regular mealtime schedules for some individuals an increase in alcohol intake was also reported this overall unhealthy pattern of nutritional behaviours may have resulted from the deprivation of opportunities due to the lockdown loss of options for exercise food shopping or meals due to the closure of sport facilities restaurants and workplaces the restricted access to food supplies and the instructions for adults and children to stay at home along with this pattern of unhealthy behaviours participants also declared that they spent more time cooking a rather favourable behaviour but which may have contributed here to the increase consumption of biscuits or cakes this overall pattern particularly clustered participants cluster 2 who were women with a higher level of education but lower income teleworking from home which was generalized as a result of the lockdown measures with children aged under 18 y at home higher scores for depressive symptoms and already a higher proportion of ultra-processed foods in their diets before the lockdown less healthy nutritional behaviours have also been underlined in studies involving children and students in italy 30 31 where the lockdown had a negative impact on physical activity but also on the consumption of foods which is in line with this first trend of behaviours on the contrary we also highlighted a second trend of more favourable nutritional behaviours where individuals decreased their energy intake increased or maintained their physical activity and eventually lost weight such modifications being made knowingly to control weight or balance the ratio of energy intakeexpenditure indeed some individuals also considered this lockdown period as an opportunity to spend more time cooking and to balance their overall diet improvements in the nutritional quality of diets were observed increased ahei-2010 score for diet quality decreased proportion of ultra-processed foods increased intakes of fruit and vegetables legumes or nuts decreased intakes of red meat or alcohol these favourable behaviours mostly clustered participants cluster 3 who were overweightobese smokers with a higher level of education and income who were short-time working students in this case more likely students who returned to their parents during the lockdown or teleworking from home with no children under 18 y at home and exhibiting more anxiety but less depressive symptoms looking at their usual diet before the lockdown these individuals were those with a lower diet quality overall individuals adopting healthier nutritional behaviours during the lockdown were probably those already more likely to do so or with more potential for improvement for these individuals the lockdown by disrupting habits might have led to a favourable adaptation considering and adopting newer options beyond established habits of what

concerned about their health notably as regards their risks for covid-19 infection or prognosis eg overweight or obese individuals finally a third group reported stable nutritional behaviours during the lockdown period these clustered participants cluster 1 who were older living in rural areas with no professional activity before the lockdown period ie unemployed housemaker retired or those who kept working outside home hence corresponding to individuals with probably less disruption in their lifestyle or environment or with more settled habits the experience of lockdown may have very different forms and related consequences when considering socioeconomic inequalities our results suggested that higher incomes were associated with more favourable modifications of nutritional behaviours individually and combined as cluster 3 spending more time cooking intentional reduction of food intake to avoid weight gain or compensate for lower physical activity healthy changes in food consumption these individuals were most likely those with more means and options to undertake modifications on the other hand lower incomes associated with less favourable modifications of nutritional behaviours individually and combined as cluster 2 eating in response to boredom or anxiety trouble keeping regular mealtime schedules stress of lacking some food during lockdown buying fewer fresh products unhealthy changes in food consumption individuals with a higher level of education presented favourable nutritional behaviour changes as reflected in cluster 3 especially spending more time cooking but also less favourable changes reflected in cluster 2 especially snacking on the other hand individuals with a lower educational level exhibited a mixed profile more likely to belong to the no change cluster 1 but with trouble keeping regular mealtime schedule buying fewer fresh products but also adjusting dietary intakes to their level of exercise hence the level of education and income did not necessarily correspond to nutritional behaviours and changes in the same way this is likely related to the professional activity during lockdown with most individuals forced to stay home which induced lifestyle changes individuals who kept working at home teleworking most often corresponding to more qualified jobs were present in clusters 2 and 3 suggesting opposite directions for nutritional behaviours which may be related to their experience during the lockdown eg time spent working living with others presence of children at home in particular the presence of children at home which associated with cluster 2 may be linked to more snacking and to the subsequent consumption of sweets biscuits and cakes other individuals became partially unemployed and were more likely to adopt favourable nutritional behaviours cluster 3 finally those who kept working outside of their home essential activities often less qualified jobs except for those working in medical care or those with no professional activity before the lockdown period unemployed retired housewife or husband generally exhibited few modifications in nutritional behaviours compared to others cluster 1 strengths of our study pertained to its large sample size and the in-depth characterisation of participants including nutritional behaviours throughout follow-up and more specifically during the lockdown period with qualitative and also quantitative assessments the flexibility of the web platform of the nutrinet-sant study allowed to quickly implement lockdown-related studies development assessment and treatmentanalysis to provide insights into multiple nutritional aspects of this singular situation at the large-scale level however some limitations should be acknowledged indeed the nutrinet-sant study is a long-term prospective study focusing on nutrition and health and based on continued voluntary recruitment since 2009 this implies that the nutrinet-sant population is composed of more women and individuals with overall higher socioeconomic position compared to the general french population 32 33  all the analyses were weighted to improve representativeness to overcome this bias still our study likely does not accurately capture the experience of more disadvantaged or older populations besides nutrinet-sant participants show an interest in nutrition and health and may therefore adopt healthier nutritional behaviours than the overall french population and to consciously rethink their nutritional behaviours to adapt to the new situation and make the most out of it still trends of unfavourable nutritional behaviours during lockdown were observed in this more health-conscious population which raises even more concerns for the general population to conclude our results suggested that the lockdown led in a substantial part of the population to unhealthy nutritional behaviours that if maintained in the long term may increase the nutrition-related burden of disease 3  a particular vigilance will therefore be needed to assess whether individuals return to healthier nutritional habits at the end of the covid-19 pandemic especially considering that unfavourable

strict lockdown and are still encouraged to keep doing so afterwards nonetheless our study also revealed that the lockdown situation also created at least in some non-negligible segments of the population an opportunity to improve nutritional behaviours such as cooking homemade meals increasing consumption of fresh products and buying food products from local shop andor farmers understanding the leverages to put these healthier nutritional behaviours on a long-term footing eg time tools food supply at work local food supply post-lockdown and try to make the most out of this momentum will be key to improving nutritional behaviours at a broader scale in the future this first descriptive study gave us many clues of how the covid-19 crisis has affected nutritional behaviours further studies are required to better understand the mechanisms behind these changes beyond this report the data collected in the framework of the sapris project combined with the extensive nutritional characterization of participants in the nutrinet-sant study will also allow to study how nutrition associates with the risk of developing covid-19 symptoms and serology that will be soon available for

analysis of the radiographic and clinical features chen lin zixian chen bin xie zhujian sun yuxiao ding xiaogang li meng niu shunlin guo junqiang lei   in december 2019 unexplained pneumonia was found in wuhan china and the disease spread rapidly around the country the virus responsible for this disease 1 has been identified as a novel coronavirus named by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv on february 11 2020 as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 as of march 9 2020 there were 80906 laboratory-confirmed cases in china more than 10000 of which are from outside of hubei almost all confirmed cases had a clear epidemiological history the purpose of this case report is to describe the radiographic and clinical features of a covid-19 pneumonia patient without clear epidemiological history outside wuhan china a 66-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital in lanzhou china 1005 miles from wuhan for high resolution computed tomography hrct the image showed ground glass opacities ggos in both lungs the patients novel coronavirus nucleic acid test returned positive on january 30 2020 the patient was a retired worker in good health and did not have diabetes hypertension or cardiovascular disease and there was no history of smoking three days before admission she experienced coughing fatigue sputum production and dyspnea after activities her body temperature was normal the specialist examination revealed thick breath sounds in both lungs and a few wet pulmonary rales laboratory tests showed elevated levels of white blood cells 107 normal range 410  109l and neutrophils 86 normal range 2070  109l the neutrophil ratio was high 80 normal range 5070 while the lymphocyte ratio was low 1270 normal range 2040 c-reactive protein 3855 normal range 28 mgl and lactate dehydrogenase 263 normal range 115220 ul were elevated d-dimer myoglobin and troponin were normal complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome acute cardiac injury and secondary infection were not evident it is worth noting that the patient had no record of contact with confirmed patients had no travel history in recent months and did not visit other cities including wuhan on the second day of admission january 31 2020 the patients hrct showed ggos distributed in multiple lobes and segments of both lungs which were more obvious under the pleura with thickened interlobular septa in the lesion fig 1a and b two days later february 2 2020 the ct images revealed relatively little change in the lesion with only a few lesions showing a slight increase in density fig 1c and d during hospitalization the patient was treated with oral antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir tablets 400 mg twice daily interferon 50 g twice daily and methylprednisolone 50 mg twice daily combined with oxygen therapy in addition the patient was given antibiotics moxifloxacin hydrochloride and sodium chloride injection and gastric mucosa protectants omeprazole after 7 days of treatment february 6 2020 the patients hrct showed that her bilateral pulmonary lesions had improved and a little fibrous stripe was evident fig 1e and f her novel coronavirus nucleic acid tests demonstrated 2 consecutive negative results february 7 2020 and february 9 2020 medications were stopped and the patient was discharged on february 10 2020 she was subsequently isolated at home for 14 days hrct images obtained after discharge february 18 2020 showed that lesion absorption was more obvious fig 1g and h the aim of this case report was to describe the radiographic and clinical features of a patient with covid-19 pneumonia outside wuhan who had no clear epidemiological history to the knowledge of the authors this is the first reported case without clear epidemiological history most patients with covid-19 have a clear history of exposure or travel and residence in wuhan the patient described in this case report had no clear epidemiological history and has likely been exposed to the virus without her knowledge hence she can be referred to as second-generation patients the patient had similar radiographic and clinical findings to previously reported cases in the literature but there were some differences current research demonstrated that the most common hrct features of covid-19 pneumonia are patchypunctate ground glass opacities 857 patchy consolidation 190 that is mainly distributed in a sub-pleural area and the presence of fibrous stripes after the patients condition improves 2 the hrct images of this patient demonstrated almost all of these features a recent retrospective study found that radiographic findings from chest ct were most severe on day 10 of initial symptom onset and began to improve on day 14 of initial symptom onset 3 the findings from this patients chest ct were typical of those with covid-19 for this patient recovery was earlier than usual in contrast most patients with covid-19 present with fever 98 cough 76 and myalgia or fatigue 44 fever is the most common feature 4 the patient described in this case report had no fever onset which has not been reported previously in patients with respiratory symptoms and ct abnormalities in conclusion this case report aimed to communicate and educate radiologists and clinicians in the recognition of this new disease clinicians need to be vigilant even patients with respiratory symptoms without a history of exposure or fever should be examined radiographically using hrct moreover timely nucleic acid testing should be performed when radiographic findings present similarly to those of patients with covid-19 this work was supported by the gansu province youth science and technology foundation 18jr3ra364 the gansu

procedures during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic jun wen xiaoming qi kristopher lyon a buqing liang xiangyu wang dongxia feng jason huang h   the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first reported in the city of wuhan china in december 2019 despite strenuous efforts to contain the virus it quickly turned into a pandemic that has swept through all continents except antarctica with an exponentially increasing number of patients being diagnosed covid-19 heavily strains our health care system and resources in response to the escalating pandemic of the covid-19 the centers for medicare and medicaid services announced that all nonessential planned surgeries and procedures be postponed until further notice as per the centers for medicare and medicaid services tiered framework neurosurgery falls under the category of tier 3a high acuity surgery and it should not be postponed1 the centers for disease control and prevention informed that covid-19 could spread through close contact or respiratory droplets between persons and from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects2 however whether covid-19 could be airborne is still in dispute nonetheless airborne precautions should be taken while performing neurosurgical procedures on all confirmed or suspected patients with covid-19 the first case with a wide nosocomial spread of covid-19 in wuhan was an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection3 all 14 people who spent time in the operating room or during the procedure became infected the standard surgical gowns and masks worn by health care personnel do not protect them from contracting covid-19 with the intent to advise the neurosurgery team on how to adequately prepare and safely perform life-saving neurosurgical procedures amid the pandemic of covid-19 we discuss the following considerations and recommendations based on the lessons and experience shared by neurosurgeons in china rather than serving as stand-alone guidance these recommendations should be integrated into the systemic planning and preparation implemented by health care facilities and systems except for emergent and urgent neurosurgical procedures that can save a life preserve the brain or restore spinal cord function other nonurgent elective spine surgeries peripheral nerve surgeries pain procedures and functional procedures should be postponed when deemed emergent or urgent airborne precautions must be taken before and during contact with confirmed or suspected covid-19 cases inpatients with suspected covid-19 should be treated as a confirmed case for neurosurgical bedside procedures each patient should be placed separately in a negative-pressure isolation room only essential health care personnel should be allowed to treat patients with covid-19 to minimize medical trainees or students exposure to the virus a properly fitted n95 or higher respirator must be used all health care personnel should undergo respirator fit testing before participating in the patients care it is recommended that men with beards shave their face to ensure a tight seal between their face and the mask a gown spanning and covering the entire body coverall gown protective goggles and shoe covers are recommended avoid touching the eyes nose or mouth after taking off the face mask or goggles at the completion of the procedure collaborate with the anesthesia team and hospitality team to secure a smooth transition between perioperative care and the neurosurgical procedure a designated patient transport route should be established for patients with covid-19 the patient should wear an n95 respirator during transit if the patient is already intubated a mask should be placed over the mouth to avoid any respiratory secretions or droplets contamination due to cough reflex the preoperative holding area and the postanesthesia care unit should be bypassed if an isolation room is not available in these areas to limit potential contamination of these units when obtaining consent telecommunication is strongly recommended if the patient is to return to the designated intensive care unit or medical ward directly extubation and postoperative recovery should be allowed in the or to further minimize the number of staff members directly exposed to the patients airway the patient care team should be prepared with enhanced personal protective equipment ppe for possible immediate medical intervention and avoid procedures performed with inadequate protection wearing a minimum of 2 sets of gloves is recommended during perioperative care and patient transit all health care personnel in the or should be prepared both mentally and physically the operation should be performed in a negative-pressure or paired with an anteroom implemented with airborne precautions4 in the case in which a negative-pressure or is not available an hepa ie high-efficiency particulate air standard filtering system should be implemented surgeons in the or must undergo a careful sequence for putting on proper ppe in addition to sterile surgical gown prior to performing the neurosurgical procedure5

6 first a visual inspection of ppe is performed to ensure that no gross defects are present hand washing is performed with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds shoe covers and nonsterile inner gloves are obtained a gown is worn that covers the entirety of arms legs head and trunk coverall gown then a properly fitting n95 or higher respirator is used next a surgical hood goggles and face shield are put on sterile gloves sterile gown and a second set of sterile gloves are fitted and worn outside of the sterile gown wearing goggles will prevent the use of surgical loupes goggles with an anti-fog coating are recommended as they may block vision when covered in fog furthermore wearing goggles and face shield makes performing surgery under the neurosurgical microscope exceedingly difficult three layers of gloves diminish tactile sensation and make it less reliable during neurosurgical procedures wearing this extensive amount of ppe for a prolonged period during a neurosurgical operation may make the surgeon fatigued and dehydrated due to excessive sweating communication among the health care providers may become difficult given the muffled voices and hearing that results from multiple layers of ppe additional measures including the use of hand gestures may be required for communication during the surgery7 an example of health care personnel wearing proper ppe is provided in figure 1
 other personnel including anesthesiologists surgical technologists and circulating nurses in the or should also be equipped with proper ppe personnel entering and leaving the or should be rigorously restricted a buffering area outside the or should be used for the delivery of surgical supplies operated by a designated team this team also should be fully protected and be ready to enter the or should an emergency arise all equipment used during the procedure should be thoroughly sterilized or properly disposed of to prevent viral spread health care providers involved should perform immediate self-cleaning before leaving the procedure area preferably showering the whole body and changing into a new surgical outfit on february 6 2020 a patient presented to the emergency department with headache followed by a loss of consciousness at a local hospital in guangzhou computed tomography ct scan of the head revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage and left frontal lobe hematoma figure 2a
 the patient was then transferred to our facility for neurosurgical consultation and treatment upon arrival the patient was unconscious body temperature 389c 102f pulse 61 bpm respiratory rate 17 bpm and blood pressure 179120 mm hg neurologic examination showed bilateral pupil diameter 25 mm sluggish pupillary light reflex nuchal rigidity extremities withdrawal to pain bilateral positive babinski sign glasgow coma scale was 5 points hunt  hess was grade 4 modified fishers scale was grade 4 and world federation of neurosurgical societies grading system score was grade 5 medical history was unremarkable with no hypertension or diabetes mellitus there was no family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage the patient had a history of traveling to hubei province where covid-19 started and became the epicenter in china the patients family stated that the patient returned from hubei province 12 days ago and started having a fever the day of presentation to the emergency department given the travel history and high body temperature we suspected that the patient contracted the sars-cov-2 virus during the trip to hubei province the covid-19 task force of our hospital was consulted and a suspected diagnosis of covid-19 was made specimens were collected for testing a nasopharyngeal swab sample was sent for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for sars-cov-2 virus ct angiography of the head figure 2b and c and thoracic ct were obtained with all health care personnel in enhanced ppe ct angiography of the head revealed an anterior communicating artery aneurysm thoracic ct showed bilateral lower lobe inflammatory changes and suspected right upper-lobe exudative change figure 3a
 definitive aneurysm repair procedure was deemed necessary and urgent by the neurosurgery team the covid-19 emergency surgery protocol was then activated a negative-pressure or was requested and the anesthesiology team was informed of the situation and the planned surgical treatment an isolation room was reserved for the patient for immediate postoperative care the patient was transitioned to the or through the designated route all participating health care personnel was wearing enhanced ppe as mentioned previously figure 4
 the patient underwent a modified pterional craniotomy for hematoma evacuation with anterior communicating artery aneurysm clipping and placement of intracranial pressure monitor after surgery the patient was transported to an isolation room for recovery and postoperative care as well as covid-19 treatment the nasopharyngeal testing of covid-19 returned to be negative however due to the high false-negative rate 30 of the testing and the patients symptoms and ct findings a decision was made by the covid-19 task force to treat the patient as a patient under investigation for 14 days the patient did well and eventually was discharged home at 14 days postoperatively with intact neurologic function two-month postoperative ct of the head figure 2d was obtained which showed resolved hematoma stable aneurysm clip and no hydrocephalus a thoracic ct also was obtained and showed improvement from previous hospital admission images figure 3b although not without challenges with proper protection following the aforementioned guidance emergent and urgent neurosurgical surgeries and procedures can be safely performed for the benefit of critical patients during the covid-19 pandemic

 this report describes the epidemiology of the sars outbreak in taiwan and proposes strategies for addressing response operations after any emerging outbreaks in the future further the lessons learned from the response to this outbreak may help to improve current strategies for preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases and for distributing resources efficiently during response operations taiwan has a population of approximately 22549292 the main island is divided into 22 cities and counties taiwan with its close proximity to the sars epicenters of guangdong and hong kong and its extensive business and cultural ties has many travellers from the most affected areas each year more than four million taiwanese visit mainland china for business and tourism bureau of immigration ministry of the interior and the vast majority of flights return through hong kong although taiwan was removed from the list of affected areas on 5 july 2003 it will remain at risk from the importation and spread of sars should it re-emerge3 6
 on 14 march 2003 the day the first cases were reported taiwans department of health initiated a system to respond to the potential spread of sars resulting from the cases a task force committee established medical aid teams to address disruption in the quarantine system to conduct rapid assessment by reviewing every reported sars case within three days after the first case was reported and to implement a legislative procedure for reporting sars on 28 march all suspected sars cases were required by law to be reported to the department of health and health authorities were required to deliver protective equipment including n-95 masks to the sars hospitals immediately and to equip all healthcare workers with enhanced protective equipment beginning with the recognition of the first sars case on 14 march taiwan moved aggressively to isolate all suspect or probable cases in negative pressure rooms and to equip all healthcare workers with enhanced protective equipment specially designed isolation rooms with hepa filtered air negative pressure under continuous electronic monitoring and separate bathrooms and anterooms are commonly available in larger referral hospitals until 22 april most of the probable cases were cared for in such hospital settings from 23 april to 8 may the 277 new cases overwhelmed the capacity of the hospital system to care for all patients in negative pressure rooms when a sars case was reported local public health workers pursued a case investigation and confirmed adequate home quarantine of all contacts the case investigation reviewed the patients history of exposure to patients with sars or sars-affected areas reviewed the signs and symptoms as compared to the who case definition of sars7 and collected information on the patients recent close contacts death certificates were obtained from the statistics division of the ministry of interior in taiwan information from death certificates was used to determine the cause of death mortality was estimated by dividing the number of deaths by the total number of probable cases it was based on cases with a known outcome and was irrespective of the immediate cause of death8
 nasopharyngeal swab or stool specimens were obtained from reported patients and tested for sars-co-v by the laboratory of the center for disease control at the department of health in taiwan the viral rna was extracted and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr was completed for targets specific to various rna viruses including the influenza a and b viruses and sars-co-v a specimen was considered rt-pcr-positive for sars-co-v if at least two different clinical specimens were positive eg nasopharyngeal and stool the same clinical specimens collected on two or more occasions during the course of the illness were positive eg sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates or if two different assays or repeat pcr using a new rna extract from the original clinical sample on each occasion of testing were positive7
 quarantine was implemented on 18 march for persons meeting one of two sets of criteria designed as class a or class b class a included healthcare workers exposed outside isolation settings family and other close contacts and those on airplanes with ill sars patients if seated within three rows in front or three rows behind the patient initially the duration of quarantine was 14 days but after 10 june this was revised to ten days in accordance with the incubation period for sars1 5 6 hospital staff and patients who had been in contact with a sars patient were quarantined in a healthcare facility all others were quarantined at home from 28 april to 4 july those who returned from a who-designated sars-affected area were considered class b resulting in compulsory home quarantine for ten days6 9 passengers arriving could choose to be quarantined in an airport transit hotel at home or at a quarantine site designated and paid for by their employer if these options were not available the traveller was quarantined at a government quarantine center located at a military base on 9 june quarantine regulations were eased for the staff of taiwanese companies based on mainland china who were returning to taiwan for business travellers in this category were allowed to conduct business if they wore a surgical mask public health nurses from local health departments delivered food to the home three times a day body temperature was self-monitored three times a day and reported by telephone to the public health nurses a surgical mask was worn whenever the quarantined individual entered a communal area within their own home if heshe became sick during the home quarantine period the driver of the ambulance took the patient to hospital dressed in a tyvek suit n-95 respirator and gloves there were several hundred such ambulance trips for fever patients between mid-may and july in taiwan after 10 april all airline passengers outbound and inbound were requested to have their body temperature taken at the airport people whose body temperatures were higher than 375 c were examined further by a physician mobile sars containment teams mobile teams a joint program by the center for disease control in taiwan and various teaching hospitals were initiated three days after the first suspected sars case was reported seventeen mobile teams comprising infection control physicians infection control nurses rotating staff from the county department of health staff from the center for disease control taiwan and staff from the centers for disease control and prevention in the usa were deployed from 16 march to 10 may 2003 they observed and demonstrated the recommended sars infection control practices and also provided personal protective equipment ppe to hospitals actively evaluating patients for sars infection each team was equipped with an infection control checklist personal protective equipment ppe blood specimen tubes nasopharyngeal swabs culture media and a specimen cooler mobile teams evaluated infection control practices through observing hospital personnel questioning current practices and detecting the negative pressure of the isolation room using a strip of tissue paper at the entrance of a patients isolation room in this study the who case definition as published in may 2003 was used the results were later compared with those obtained by using the case definition published in august 2003 in may a probable case of sars was defined as a person presenting after 1 february 2003 with a history of fever higher than 38 c and one or more of the following symptoms lower respiratory tract illness cough breathing difficulty shortness of breath or radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome rds or autopsy findings consistent with pneumonia without identifiable cause the person also needed evidence of one or more of the following exposures during the ten days prior to the onset of symptoms to have had close contact with a person who is a suspect or probable case of sars to reside in an affected area7 a suspect case was a probable case without chest radiograph or pathological confirmation patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis could fully explain their illness7
 on 14 august 2003 who proposed a new case definition including laboratory confirmation a clinical case of sars was defined as a person presenting a history of fever higher than 38 c and one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness cough breathing difficulty shortness of breath and radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome rds or autopsy findings consistent with pneumonia without an identifiable cause patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis could fully explain their illness10 a laboratory case was a clinical case with positive laboratory finding for sars-co-v10
 statistical analysis was conducted using spss software spss 1005 windows version11 univariate analysis was used to identify factors associated with outcome in the univariate analysis the association between illness and categorical risk factors was assessed for statistical significance by the chi-square test the association for continuous variables was assessed using t-test a two-sided p-value at a level of less than 005 was considered statistically significant odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals 95 ci were also calculated the first two suspected cases were diagnosed in a couple on 14 march 2003 the man was a 54-year-old businessman who had travelled to guangdong province china on 5 february and returned to taipei via hong kong on 21 february on 25 february he developed fever and myalgia and later a dry cough but was not hospitalized until 8 march several hours after admission he was intubated and required mechanical ventilation for 13 days his wife and son were exposed during the period before full protective measures were in place and both developed sars with a requirement for mechanical ventilation the infections in the wife and son were confirmed by rt-pcr testing to be associated with the novel coronavirus associated with sars worldwide12 13 14 on 26 march a resident of hong kongs amoy gardens flew to taiwan and took a train to taichung the mans brother became taiwans first sars fatality between 14 march and 19 april 51 people met the criteria for a probable case figure 1
 suddenly in the last ten days of april the number of cases began to increase steadily the first increase was in patients and staff at hospital h and was attributed to a laundry worker employed at the hospital aged 42 years with diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease on 12 april he had a fever and diarrhea and was evaluated in the emergency department the laundry worker remained on duty and interacted frequently with patients staff and visitors he had sleeping quarters in the hospitals basement and spent off-duty time socializing in the emergency department on 16 april because of worsening symptoms this worker was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of salmonellosis infectious enteritis and pulmonary edema on 18 april he became short of breath a chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates and the patient was transferred to an isolation room in the intensive care unit with suspected sars this was a potential index patient because he had been symptomatic for six days before sars was diagnosed the number of potentially exposed persons was estimated at up to 10000 patients and visitors and 930 staff on 24 april hospital h was contained and all patients visitors and staff were quarantined within the building15 during the period from 29 april to 14 june a total of 151 sars patients were transferred to 11 hospitals mainly eight hospitals in taipei city case clusters at eight additional hospitals in taiwan have been linked to the initial outbreak at hospital h preliminary data suggested that many of these clusters occurred when pre-symptomatic patients or patients with sars whose symptoms were attributed to other causes were discharged or transferred to other healthcare facilities sars later spread to multiple cities and regions of taiwan including several university and private hospitals four of these hospitals including a 2300-bed facility in southern taiwan discontinued emergency and routine services15
 between 14 march and 30 july 2003 a total of 3032 patients were reported to the department of health in taiwan as having possible sars among them 668 22 patients met the may who criteria for a probable case among these probable cases 53 8 were reported to have travelled to mainland china and hong kong in the ten days before the onset of illness 41 6 were close contacts of a known case 376 56 were hospital-related of whom 120 19 were health care workers 17 doctors 63 nurses and 40 allied health care workers and 256 38 were in the same medical ward or had visited their relatives there table 1

 between 16 march and 10 may mobile teams assessed a total of 86 hospitals fifty-three percent of the study hospitals had triage and segregation of possible sars case-patients but 24 2186 did not prohibit visitors from patients rooms and 31 2786 did not restrict traffic outside the patients rooms of the study hospitals 87 7586 had hand-washing facilities immediately outside patients rooms or anterooms at the other 11 hospitals hand-washing facilities were at a location further from the anteroom seventy-nine 92 had private rooms for sars case-patients and 72 6286 had n-95 or better respirators in stock seventy-two percent used at least one layer of protective gown and had access to eye protection head covers and foot protection overall at the time of the mobile team visits 46 53 hospitals implemented recommendations of triage and segregation of possible sars case-patients private negative pressure isolation rooms minimal ppe for all staff entering patients rooms and effective visitor policies visitors restricted from patients rooms16 17
 this reported outbreak of sars in taiwan caused 668 probable cases with severe deterioration of pulmonary function and 181 deaths consistent with other findings18 19 healthcare workers in taiwan were at higher risk of infection from sars within three months sars developed in 120 healthcare workers after exposure at work in the medical ward where the index patient was hospitalized all had unremarkable medical histories recent reports suggest that infection control practices can be effective in some settings20 21 just over half 53 of taiwanese hospitals had implemented recommended infection control practice at the time of the mobile team visits however as with another report22 an outbreak occurred among hospital healthcare workers as more becomes known about the transmission of sars-associated coronavirus infections infection control practices at hospitals evaluating patients for sars will need to evolve even as the sars epidemic appears to wane23 being prepared for sars infection control remains important among hospitals future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of specific infection control practices as well as assess the implementation of effective measures in countries affected by sars in this study a substantial difference was documented in both the number of cases and the mortality rate after applying the who definition proposed in august 2003 it is important to note that the later definition published after the outbreak was over was developed to serve a different purpose in may 2003 the case definition focused on the clinical picture and was deliberately sensitive in order to identify most suspected cases and implement control measures for sars the case definition in august was modified to increase specificity by focusing on laboratory confirmed cases in addition the new definition allows for the calculation of a low mortality mainly by permitting deaths in sars patients to be attributed to other underlying diseases and therefore not contribute to the numerator including sars patients regardless of etiology would prevent subjectivity and provide more uniform data for comparison across countries quarantining the contacts is a new challenge to the public within this period between 28 march and 30 july a total of 151270 persons 07 of the population of taiwan were quarantined only 46 class a 34 class b 12 were subsequently classified as probable cases in humans infected with the virus there is a wide range of reported incubation periods from five to 15 days before patients become symptomatic18 19 this lag time allows apparently healthy people to travel by air almost anywhere in the world after they have been exposed once they become symptomatic the disease is most likely spread through person-to-person transmission24 as expected based on the known transmission patterns for sars19 20 the fact that transmission appeared to occur from patients in the symptomatic phase of illness but not from those who were in the pre-symptomatic phase suggests that the risk of transmission varies by the phase of illness it is likely that persons who were in contact with patients with the pre-symptomatic phase were at low risk the fact that transmission has been limited to only close contacts of patients such as healthcare workers and family members who were not using contact or respiratory precautions suggests that either droplet secretions or direct contact probably played a role4 sars patients should limit interactions outside the home and should not go to work school out-of-home childcare or other public areas until ten days after the resolution of fever in taiwan family and other close contacts those on airplanes with ill sars patients if seated within three rows in front or three rows behind the patient and those returning from sars affected areas were given strictly compulsory home quarantine for ten days it must be considered whether in the future household members or other close contacts of sars patients need to limit their activities outside the home as recommended by the usa cdc25
 epidemiologic investigation and laboratory studies suggest that most patients with illnesses meeting the case definition of sars in taiwan were linked to a common source to date 375 of cases identified in this report were confirmed positive in this study some clinical and laboratory features were identified on presentation that were associated with death advanced age being male and coexisting underlying medical conditions were independent predictors of mortality from sars information on hepatitis b status was not systematically collected a risk factor reported elsewhere26
 sars has already become a global health hazard and its high infectivity is alarming the decrease in worldwide incidence is gratifying but it may simply reflect the seasonal variation in the transmission of the virus24 some experts have predicted the return of sars in the cool season containing an outbreak at an early stage affords a greater chance of success than does a later response and clearly puts less strain on the healthcare system future strategies to control the spread of sars need to emphasize the greater risk to certain populations health care workers older people and people who have chronic diseases isolation of cases stringent infection control measures in hospitals and vigilant surveillance at both community and population levels are imperative26 27 28
  a review of the 2019 novel coronavirus covid-19 based on current evidence li-sheng wang yi-ru wang da-wei ye qing-quan liu   in late december 2019 a case of unidentified pneumonia was reported in wuhan hubei province peoples republic of china prc its clinical characteristics are very similar to those of viral pneumonia after analysis on respiratory samples prc centers for disease control cdc experts declared that the pneumonia later known as novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp was caused by novel coronavirus 1 who officially named the disease covid-19 international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv named the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 designation of a formal name for the novel coronavirus and the disease it caused is conducive to communications in clinical and scientific research this virus belongs to   coronavirus a large class of viruses prevalent in nature similar to other viruses sars-cov-2 has many potential natural hosts intermediate hosts and final hosts this poses great challenges to prevention and treatment of virus infection compared with sars and mers this virus has high transmissibility and infectivity despite of low mortality rate 2 genome analysis of novel coronavirus sequences revealed that the complete genome sequence recognition rates of sars-cov and bat sars coronavirus sarsr-cov-ratg13 were 795 and 96 respectively 3 it implies that the coronavirus might originate from bat on 29 february 2020 data published by world health organization showed that since 12 december 2019 when the first case was reported 79394 cases were confirmed to be infected by novel coronavirus and 2838 individuals were died in total 4 in the meantime 6009 cases were confirmed and 86 were died in 53 countries and regions outside of china figure 1
 4 it posed a great threat to global public health this report reviews the genetic structure infection source transmission route pathogenesis clinical characteristics and treatment and prevention of the sars-cov-2 so that it can provide references for follow-up research prevention and treatment and may help readers to have the latest understanding of this new infectious disease coronavirus cov is a single strand rna virus with a diameter of 80-120nm it is divided into four types -coronavirus -cov -coronavirus -cov -coronavirus -cov and  - coronavirus -cov 5 six coronaviruses were previously known to cause disease in humans sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects human beings after sars-cov and mers-cov 6 sars-cov-2 like sars-cov and mers-cov belongs to -coronavirus the genome sequence homology of sars-cov-2 and sars is about 79 the 2019-ncov is closer to the sars-like bat covs mg772933 than the sars-cov 7 which is descended from sars-like bat covs interestingly for high similarity of receptor-binding domain rbd in spike-protein several analyses reveal that sars-cov-2 uses angiotension-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as receptor just like as sars-cov 8 coronavirus mainly recognizes the corresponding receptor on the target cell through the s protein on its surface and enters into the cell then causing the occurrence of infection a structure model analysis shows that sars-cov-2 binds ace2 with above 10 folds higher affinity than sars-cov but higher than the threshold required for virus infection 9 the detailed mechanism about whether the sars-cov-2 would infect humans via binding of s-protein to ace2 how strong the interaction is for risk of human transmission and how sars-cov-2 causes pathological mechanisms of organs damage remains unknown which need more studies to elaborate these results further explains the more rapid transmission capability of the sars-cov-2 in humans than sars-cov and the number of confirmed covid-19 much higher than people with sars-cov infection considering the higher affinity of sars-cov-2 binds ace2 soluble ace2 might be a potential candidate for covid-19 treatment basic reproduction number r0 refers to the average amount of secondary infection that patients may produce in completely susceptible population without intervention 10 the estimation of r0 varies among different research teams and is updated as more information is exposed wu jt leung et al of york university estimated the r0 of novel coronavirus to be 247-286 11 using the seir model majumder of boston childrens hospital and his colleagues adjusted r0 to be 20-33 using the idea model 12 the r0 value of other viruses of  - coronavirus such as sars-cov is estimated to be 22-36 13 the r0 value of mers-cov is estimated to be 20-67 14 these indicate that sars-cov-2 has relatively high transmissibility population is generally susceptible to sars-cov-2 the median age was 470 years iqr 350 to 580 87 case patients were 30 to 79 years of age and 3 were age 80 years or older and the number of female patients was 419 1516 most cases were diagnosed in hubei province china 75 81 cases were classified as mild 14 cases were severe and 5 were critical the overall case-fatality rate cfr was 23 but cases in those aged 70 to 79 years had an 80 cfr and cases in those aged 80 years and older had a 148 cfr 16 this implies that elderly male citizens are more susceptible to this coronavirus as compared with other groups and this virus is more likely to affect elderly male citizens with chronic underlying diseases diabetes hypertension heart disease etc 17 in summary covid-19 is high in prevalence and population is generally susceptible to such virus and covid-19 rapidly spread from a single wuhan city to the entire country in just 30 days so that prompt measures should be taken to control the spread of the disease bats are considered to be the natural hosts of sars-cov-2 while pangolins and snakes are thought to be the intermediate hosts studies of institut pasteur of shanghai showed that bats might be the natural hosts of sars-cov-2 furthermore studies of peking university 19 suggest that sars-cov-2 infection is probably caused by snakes however later studies 20 found that no evidence showed that snakes are the hosts of sars-cov-2 study from wuhan institute of virology showed that the similarity of gene sequence between sars-cov-2 and bat coronavirus is as high as 962 by sequencing technology 21 this also implied that bats are the possible source of sars-cov-2 apart from those xu et al 22 showed that the similarity of sars-cov-2 isolated from pangolin and the virus strains currently infecting humans is as high as 99 using macrogenomic sequencing molecular biological detection and electron microscopic analysis the team also observed the typical novel coronavirus granules and revealed that pangolin is the potential intermediate host of the sars-cov-2 although the results of current research have not yet fully elucidated the potential natural host and the intermediate host of the sars-cov-2 adequate evidence has proved that this virus might be sourced from wild animals at present it is considered that the main infectious source of sars-cov-2 is covid-19 patients in the population however there is still a debate about whether sars-cov-2 patients in the incubation period are infectious which needs further study transmission and close contact are the most common ways of transmission for sars-cov-2 aerosol transmission might also be a way of transmission in addition researchers also detected sars-cov-2 in the samples of stool gastrointestinal tract saliva and urine based on bioinformatics evidence indicated that digestive tract might be a potential route of sars-cov-2 infection 23 consistently sars-cov-2 rna was also dectected in gastrointestinal tissues from covid-19 patients 24 moreover sars-cov-2 was detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions of covid-19 patients 25 meanwhile a retrospective study based nine pregnant women with covid-19 had for the first time indicated that the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission between mothers and infants in the late pregnancy was temporarily excluded 26 however available data on pregnant women infected with sars-cov-2 were inadequate and hence further studies are required to verify the potential vertical transmission of sars-cov-2 in pregnant women from the epidemiological investigation report elderly citizens are susceptible groups for sars-cov-2 the median age of death was 75 years and most of them had comorbidities or a history of surgery before admission 27 zhong et al found that based on clinical features of 1099 covid-19 patients the median incubation period was 30 days range 0 to 240 the median time from the first symptom to death was 14 days 1527 for sars the median latency of sars is 4 days the average duration of first symptoms to hospital admission was 38 days and admission to death was 174 days for casualties 28 and the median latency of mers is 7 days 29 from the median incubation period covid-19 is shorter than sars and mers however the maximum latency of sars-cov-2 currently observed is as high as 24 days which may increase the risk of virus transmission moreover it also found that people 70 years or older had shorter median days 115 days from the first symptom to death than those with ages below 70 years 20 days demonstrating that elderly people have faster disease progression than younger people 27 from the above the public should pay more attention to elderly people who might be more vulnerable to the sars-cov-2 covid-19 produces an acute viral infection in humans with median incubation period was 30 days 15 which is similar to the sras with an incubation period ranging from 210 days 30 the presenting features of covid-19 infection in adults are pronounced the presenting features in adults are pronounced the most common clinical symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection were fever 879 cough 677 fatigue 381 whereas diarrhea 37 and vomiting 50 were rare 1531 which were similar to others coronavirus most patients had some degree of dyspnoea at presentation because the time from onset of symptoms to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards was only 9 days among the initial patients with covid-19 infection 1 moreover severe patients are prone to a variety of complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome acute heart injury and secondary infection 17 there are already some evidences that covid-19 can cause damage to tissues and organs other than the lung in a study of 214 covid-19 patients 78 364 patients had neurological manifestations 32 in addition there is already evidence of ocular surface infection in patients with covid-19 and sars-cov-2 rna was detected in eye secretions of patient 33 some covid-19 patients have arrhythmia acute heart injury impaired renal function and abnormal liver function 507 at admission 13435 a case report of the pathological manifestations of a patient with pneumonia showed moderate microvesicular steatosis in his liver tissue 36 besides tissue samples of stomach duodenum and rectal mucosa were confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 rna 37 figure 2

 in general the radiographical features of coronavirus are similar to those found in community-acquired pneumonia caused by other organisms 38 chest ct scan is important tool to diagnose this pneumonia nevertheless several typical imaging features are frequently observed in covid-19 pneumonia including the predominant groundglass opacity 65 consolidations 50 smooth or irregular interlobular septal thickening 35 air bronchogram 47 and thickening of the adjacent pleura 32 with predominantly peripheral and lower lobe involvement 39 a recent study reported that most patients 90 had bilateral chest ct findings and the sensitivity of chest ct to suggest covid-19 was 97 33 combining chest ct imaging features with clinical symptom and laboratory test could facilitate early diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia laboratory examination revealed that 821 of patients was lymphopenia and 362 of patients was hrombocytopenia most patients had normal leukocytes but leukopenia was observed in 337 of patients in addition most patients demonstrated elevated levels of c-reactive protein crp  lactate dehydrogenase ldh and creatinine kinase ck  but minority of patients had elevated transaminase abnormal myocardial enzyme spectrum or elevated serum creatinine 115 as compared with bacterial pneumonia patients with sars-cov-2 showed lower oxygenation index cytokine release syndrome is a vital factor that aggravates disease progression a higher levels of il-6 and il-10 and lower levels of cd4t and cd8t are observed in covid-19 patients parallel with the severity of the disease 40 the detection of viral nucleic acid is the standard for noninvasive diagnosis of covid-19 however the present detection of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid was high in specificity and low in sensitivity so that there might be false negatives and the testing time could be relatively long the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan 5th trial version took suspected cases with pneumonia imaging features as the clinical diagnostic criteria in hubei province 41 but the sixth edition of diagnostic criteria eliminates the distinction between hubei and other provinces outside hubei 42 one reason might be to distinguish the flu from the covid-19 furthermore zhang f of mit developed a test paper for rapid detection of sars-cov-2 in one hour by sherlock technology although the clinical verification has not been carried out yet this technology once proved might be conducive to rapid diagnosis of the disease 43 a research group of peking university claimed to have developed a new method for rapid construction of transcriptome sequencing library of sherry which is helpful for rapid sequencing of sars-cov-2 44 at present the treatments of patients with sars-cov-2 infection are mainly symptomatic treatments remdesivir was recently reported as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of rna viruses holshue et al for the first time reported that treatment of a patient with covid-19 used remdesivir and achieved good results 45 then xiao et al findings reveal that remdesivir effectively in the control of 2019-ncov infection in vitro meanwhile also found that chloroquine has an immune-modulating activity and could effectively inhibit in this virus in vitro 46 clinical controlled trials have shown that chloroquine was proved to be effective in the treatment of patients with covid-19 47 remdesivir is undergoing a large number of clinical trials in several hospitals and the final efficacy of the drug is uncertain arbidol a small indole derivative molecule was found to block viral fusion against influenza a and b viruses and hepatitis c viruses 48 and confirmed to have antiviral effect on sars-cov in cell experiment 49 so that it might be a choice for covid-19 treatment the randomized controlled study on treatment of novel coronavirus by arbidol and kaletra undertaken at present showed that arbidol had better therapeutic effect than kaletra did and could significantly reduce the incidence of severe cases apart from the above lopinavirritonavir nucleoside analogues neuraminidase inhibitors remdesivir and peptide ek1 could also be the choices of antiviral drugs for covid-19 treatment 50 chinese medicine also played an important role in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection local governments and medical institutions published a number of traditional chinese medicine prescriptions the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan 6th trial version suggested to use clearing lung and detoxification decoction in the clinical treatment 42 a joint study made by shanghai institute of materia medica and wuhan institute of virology cas found that shuanghuanglian oral liquid could inhibit sars-cov-2 previous studies have proved that baicalin chlorogenic acid and forsythin in shuanghuanglian oral liquid have certain inhibitory effects on a variety of viruses and bacteria 5152 the mechanism might be that these components played a therapeutic role by effectively reducing the inflammatory response of the body caused by viruses and bacteria 53 lianhuaqingwen capsule has been proven to have a wide-spectrum effect on a series of influenza viruses including h7n9 and could regulate the immune response of the virus reducing the level of inflammatory factors in the early stage of infection 54 synthetic recombinant interferon  has proven to be effective in treatment of sars patients in clinic trials 55 pulmonary x-ray abnormal remission time was reduced by 50 in the interferon-treated group compared with the glucocorticoid-treated group alone interferon was also found to be an effective inhibitor of mers-cov replication 56 those findings suggested that interferon could be used in the treatment of covid-19 intravenous immunoglobulin might be the safest immunomodulator for long-term use in all ages and could help to inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines and increase the production of anti-inflammatory mediators 57 moreover thymosin alpha-1 ta1 can be an immune booster for sars patients effectively controlling the spread of disease 58 intravenous immunoglobulin and ta1 may also be considered as therapeutics for covid-19 when there are no sufficient vaccines and specific drugs convalescent plasma therapy could be an effective way to alleviate the course of disease for severely infected patients 59 in a retrospective analysis convalescent plasma therapy is more effective than severe doses of hormonal shock in patients with severe sars reducing mortality and shortening hospital stays 60 a prospective cohort study by hung and colleagues showed that for patients with pandemic h1n1 influenza virus infection in 2009 the relative risk of death was significantly lower in patients treated with convalescent plasma 61 moreover from the perspective of immunology most of the patients recovered from covid-19 would produce specific antibodies against the sars-cov-2 and their serum could be used to prevent reinfection at the same time antibodies can limit the virus reproduction in the acute phase of infection and help clear the virus which is conducive to the rapid recovery of the disease 62 theoretically viremia peaks during the first week of most viral infections and it should be more effective to give recovery plasma early in the disease 63 therefore the plasma of some patients recovered from covid-19 could be collected to prepare plasma globulin specific to sars-cov-2 however the safety of plasma globulin products specific to sars-cov-2 deserves further consideration at present extracorporeal blood purification technology in the treatment of severe ncp patients 42 according to the latest studies 34 ace2 the key receptor of sars-cov-2 is highly expressed in human kidney nearly 100 times higher than that in lung kidney might be main target of attack for novel coronavirus early continuous blood purification treatment could reduce renal workload and help to promote the recovery of renal function 64 most of the severe patients with novel coronavirus might suffer from cytokine storm the imbalance of pro-inflammatory factors and anti-inflammatory factors might cause immune damage therefore blood purification technology could be used to remove inflammatory factors eliminate cytokine storm correct electrolyte imbalance and maintain acid-base balance to control patients capacity load in an effective manner 65 in this logic the patients symptoms could be improved and the blood oxygen saturation could be increased in summary the drug treatment for covid-19 mainly comprised four ways ie antiviral western medicine chinese medicine immunoenhancement therapy and viral specific plasma globulin machines could be used as auxiliary therapy however randomized double-blind large sample clinical trial should be served as the standard to determine whether the antiviral drugs could be used in clinical practice so far there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines for sars-cov-2 and the clinical treatment of covid-19 has been limited to support and palliative care until now therefore it is urgent to develop a safe and stable covid-19 vaccine dr tedros director-general of who said that novel coronavirus vaccine was expected to be ready in 18 months in addition sars-cov-2 is an rna virus rna virus related vaccines including measles polio encephalitis b virus and influenza virus could be the most promising alternatives and interpersonal transmission of the virus could be prevented by immunizing health care workers and non-infected population 66 prevention of infectious diseases by traditional chinese medicine has been recorded for a long time in chinese history and there have been previous studies on the prevention of sars by traditional chinese medicine 67 the present principles on prevention of covid-19 are to tonify body energy to protect outside body dispel wind dissipate heat and dissipate dampness with aromatic agent the six most commonly used chinese herbal medicines are astragalus liquorice fangfeng baizhu and honeysuckle however the decoction is not suitable for long-term use and the best period is one week only 68 studies have shown that vitamin c may prevent the susceptibility of lower respiratory tract infection under certain conditions 69 while covid-19 may cause lower respiratory tract infection therefore a moderate amount of vitamin c supplementation may be a way to prevent covid-19 in addition the decrease in vitamin d and vitamin e levels in cattle could lead to the infection of bovine coronavirus 70 this suggests that proper supplementation of vitamin d and vitamin e may enhance our resistance to sars-cov-2 patients with primary basic diseases especially those with chronic diseases such as hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease and tumor are more susceptible to sars-cov-2 and their risk of poor prognosis will increase significantly after infection because they have low systemic immunity as a result of the disease itself and treatments 71 therefore it is particularly important to enhance self-resistance the main way to boost personal immunity is to maintain personal hygiene a healthy lifestyle and adequate nutritional intake 72 73 for individuals taking protective measures can effectively prevent sars-cov-2 infection including improving personal hygiene wearing medical masks adequate rest and good ventilation 15 in conclusion covid-19 is a serious infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 its main initial symptoms fever cough and fatigue are similar to that of sars the most likely source of sars-cov-2 is bats this virus is highly infectious and can be transmitted through droplets and close contact some patients are life-threatening and such disease has posed a great threat to global health and safety so to control the spread of the epidemic and reduce the mortality as soon as possible is our burning issue but by far the specific mechanism of the virus remains unknown and no specific drugs for the virus have been developed at present it is important to control the source of infection cut off the transmission route and use the existing drugs and means to control the progress of the disease proactively we should also strive to develop specific drugs promote the research and development of vaccines and reduce morbidity and mortality of the disease so as to better protect the safety of peoples lives the authors report no conflicts of interest in this work  sars

 it is important to understand the meaning of close contact it is defined as having cared for or lived with a person known to have sars or unprotected contact with body secretions from such a person this includes kissing embracing sharing utensils or bedding performing a physical examination or other direct physical contact between persons it does not include sitting across a waiting room for a brief period walking by a person with sars or other casual contact chest radiographs of patients with sars show patchy focal infiltrates or consolidation often with a peripheral distribution which may progress to diffuse infiltrates pleural effusions have not been reported early findings may be subtle and initial findings on chest radiographs may be normal in up to 25 of patients6 computed tomography ct may be more sensitive than plain films highresolution ct scans have shown abnormalities in patients with suspected sars who have normal findings on plain films10 the characteristic ct finding is bilateral peripheral airspaceground-glass consolidation mimicking that seen in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia laboratory findings in patients with sars include thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in particular lymphopenia elevated creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase and transaminase levels have been noted a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level and an initial elevated white blood cell count may carry a poor prognosis7
 the etiologic link of a coronavirus with the sars epidemic was established by peiris et al11 in hong kong several diagnostic laboratory methods were used to initially recover and then characterize coronavirus infection in various specimens obtained from patients with sars these included inoculation and recovery of the virus in cell cultures characterization of morphologic features by electron microscopy serologic antibody determination and molecular amplification and sequencing of the target rna of the agent overall 45 of the 50 patients these investigators studied had 1 or more laboratory tests serology 32 rt-pcr 22 culture 2 that supported a coronavirus etiology the results of this initial report were quickly confirmed and expanded by collaborative studies in several major public health centers and medical institutions throughout the world coordinated by the world health organization12 13 molecular sequencing analyses have indicated that the virus is only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses based on serologic studies it appears that this virus has not previously circulated in humans and is now referred to as sars-cov14 15
 coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses that cause disease in humans and animals the previously known human coronaviruses are a major cause of the common cold and can occasionally cause pneumonia research teams in hong kong and shenzhen china recently detected several coronaviruses closely related genetically to the sars-cov in 2 animal species masked palm civet and raccoon-dog and antibodies against the sars-cov in 1 additional species chinese ferret badger these and other wild animals are traditionally considered delicacies and are sold for human consumption in markets throughout southern china this study provides the first indication that the sars-cov exists outside a human host studies are needed to determine how widespread the sars virus might be in animals in guangdong and elsewhere and if these animals can excrete the virus in an amount sufficient to infect humans and through what route such transmission occurs the sars-cov appears to be transmitted primarily by large droplet spread although surface contamination and possibly airborne spread may play a role recent data suggest that the virus may remain viable for considerable periods on a dry surface up to 24 hours hence transmission through fomites may occur the outbreak in an apartment complex in hong kong that accounted for more than 300 cases has been attributed to fecal spread a patient with sars who had diarrhea stayed with his brother in this building it is thought that infection spread from him to other residents in the building through a leaking sewage drain which allowed aerosolization of virus-containing material sewage also backed into bathroom floor drains in some apartments and may have accounted for some of the transmission the sars-cov is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least 1 to 2 days the virus is more stable up to 4 days in stool from patients with diarrhea which has a higher ph than normal stool16
 it is presently unclear at what stage of the disease viral shedding occurs or whether someone who is infected but asymptomatic can infect others as our knowledge of sars and the etiologic coronavirus evolves we will be able to address these important issues some close contacts have reported a mild febrile illness without respiratory signs or symptoms suggesting the illness might not always progress to the respiratory phase others have not become ill at all in contrast super spreaders have been described who have infected 10 or more contacts including hcws family and social contacts or visitors to the health care facilities where patients were hospitalized a similar phenomenon has been described with some other diseases such as rubella laryngeal tuberculosis and ebola virus and might be the result of a combination of host environment and virus interactions in singapore 5 super spreaders were responsible for a total of 170 suspect and probable cases of sars17 additional data on the natural history of infection are needed to understand factors that might be associated with this phenomenon regardless of whether it is the result of other transmission routes inadequate infection-control measures or more viral shedding by certain patients the fact remains that transmission of the sars virus is highly efficient in some circumstances the initial diagnosis of sars is one of exclusion hence common causes of respiratory illnesses should be sought initial diagnostic testing for patients with suspected sars should include chest radiography pulse oximetry blood cultures sputum gram stain and culture and testing for other respiratory pathogens notably influenza a and b respiratory syncytial virus and legionella table 2
 clinicians should save any available clinical specimens respiratory blood serum and stool for additional testing until a specific diagnosis is made acute and convalescent 21 days after onset of symptoms serum samples should be collected from each patient who meets the sars case definition paired sera and other clinical specimens can be forwarded through state and local health departments for testing at the cdc specific instructions for collecting specimens from suspected sars patients are available from the cdc18 laboratory diagnostic tests used at the cdc to test clinical specimens for evidence of sars-cov include serology pcr testing and viral cultures serologic testing for coronavirus antibody consists of indirect fluorescent antibody testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that are specific for antibody produced after infection patients seem to seroconvert at a mean of 10 days after onset of symptoms the cdc has made reagents for sars antibody testing available to state public health laboratories an rt-pcr test specific for rna from the sars-cov has been positive within the first 10 days after fever onset in respiratory specimens from most patients considered probable cases of sars who have been tested and in stool samples in the second week of illness the duration of detectable viremia or viral shedding needs further study12 13
 despite the fact that several thousand specimens from patients with sars have been processed in laboratories worldwide to date there have been no reported clusters of illness in laboratory workers nevertheless reasonable precautions should be taken in handling these specimens the cdc recommends that specimens from patients with sars be labeled accordingly and that the laboratory be alerted before the samples are sent laboratory workers who handle these specimens should use standard precautions in a biosafety level 2 laboratory any procedure with the potential to generate fine particulate aerosols should be performed in a biological safety cabinet19
 there is no specific treatment currently available for sars management consists of supportive care and appropriate infection control measures to prevent spread because the diagnosis is uncertain empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia should be administered by using antibiotics with activity against both typical and atypical respiratory pathogens including influenza when appropriate in all series of sars cases described to date therapy has involved broad-spectrum antibiotics including a fluoroquinolone or macrolide the antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in most patients treated in hong kong and in toronto without evidence of efficacy7 10 the adverse effects of ribavirin are significant particularly hemolytic anemia and electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia hence empirical therapy with ribavirin is not warranted anecdotal evidence suggests that corticosteroids may be beneficial particularly in patients with progressive pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia various regimens have been used in different centers with dosages of methylpred-nisolone ranging from 40 mg twice daily similar to therapy for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to 2 mgkg per day similar to late-phase therapy for ards to pulse doses of 500 mg intravenously per day20 because corticosteroids have potential adverse effects clinicians should carefully assess the risk vs the benefit on a case-by-case basis early identification of patients with sars in health care facilities and appropriate isolation are essential in preventing large outbreaks the cdc has recommended that in health care settings patients should be screened with targeted questions as soon as possible after arrival or while the patient is on the telephone making an appointment we have been using a simple screening tool figure 2
 to screen all patients in our facility patients who have positive findings on the initial screen are given a mask separated from other patients placed in an examination room a negative-air room if available and evaluated further by a physician with airborne n-95 respirator and contact gown gloves precautions if during this evaluation the patient fits the cdc case definition for sars and needs admission the patient is admitted to a negative-air room if admission is unnecessary but further testing is required the patient is escorted to appropriate areas for laboratory tests radiological studies etc and testing expedited so that exposure of other patients is minimized diagnosis of sars does not automatically necessitate admission patients who do not otherwise need to be admitted to a hospital should be managed as outpatients as long as they can limit interactions outside the home persons being managed as outpatients should be instructed to wear a surgical mask when in the presence of household members and they should contain respiratory secretions in facial tissue and place these in lined containers for disposal with household waste they should wash their hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer especially after touching respiratory secretions and other body fluids sharing of eating utensils towels and bedding between patients with sars and others should be avoided until these items have been washed with soap and hot water such patients should stay away from work school or other activities in a public place for 10 days after the resolution of fever provided that cough and other respiratory symptoms have resolved or have improved a plan will need to be formulated to decide how these outpatients will obtain food and other supplies such as surgical masks during the period of isolation and how arrangements will be made for travel to and from necessary medical appointments household members or other close contacts of patients with sars should be advised to wear disposable gloves for any direct contact with body fluids from the patient and to practice good hand hygiene such people should be vigilant for the development of fever or respiratory symptoms and if these occur they should seek health care evaluation they should inform their health care provider in advance of arriving for the evaluation that they have had close contact with a patient with sars so that arrangements can be made as necessary to prevent transmission to others in the health care setting in the absence of fever or respiratory symptoms they need not limit their activities outside the home patients who require hospitalization should be admitted to a negative pressure specially ventilated room visitors should be discouraged the number of hcws involved in the patients care should be limited all hcws should use personal protective equipment appropriate for standard contact and airborne precautions ie hand hygiene gown gloves and n-95 respirator in addition to eye protection while caring for these patients procedures that result in coughing and aerosolization of respiratory secretions should be avoided if bronchoscopy is considered essential for patient care it should be performed by experienced personnel using maximum infection control precautions table 3
 an important feature of the sars outbreaks in canada singapore and hong kong has been the fact that several hcws have developed sars after caring for patients with sars transmission to hcws appears to have occurred after close unprotected contact with symptomatic individuals this has placed additional strain on health care systems that have already been stressed by outbreaks of sars active surveillance for fever and respiratory symptoms eg daily screening should be conducted in hcws with unprotected exposure for 10 days after the exposure including checking the temperature when the employee reports to work and taking a history of respiratory symptoms workers with unprotected exposure who develop fever andor respiratory symptoms should not come to work they should stay home and report symptoms to infection control or the employee health service immediately health care workers with unprotected exposure during aerosolgenerating procedures intubation suctioning bronchos-copy etc should be quarantined for a 10-day period at home because these procedures pose a higher risk of disease transmission case definitions of sars are currently based on the presence of epidemiological risk factors close contact with patients with sars or travel to sars-affected areas and a combination of fever and respiratory symptoms with or without chest radiographic changes however if sars spreads into the general population our ability to distinguish it from other community-acquired pneumonias based on such epidemiological linkages will fail if this happens sars will need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of any community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia a typical history suggestive laboratory values and failure to respond to conventional antibiotics should raise suspicion diagnostic tests will be crucial in the future both to ensure that patients are isolated rapidly and to provide appropriate therapy sars has resulted in important challenges for the medical community in affected areas policies are changing daily as more information about the virus and the disease is obtained the resurgence of cases in toronto in early may 2003 shows the difficulty of maintaining control over a new disease characterized by many puzzling epidemiological and clinical features the continued alertness of singapore which most recently broke the chain of sars transmission shows the importance of maintaining a high level of vigilance and preparedness to ensure that a single imported case does not reignite an outbreak currently control depends on prompt detection and isolation of cases good infection control in hospitals and the tracing and quarantine of contacts  lung ultrasound in patients with acute respiratory failure reduces conventional imaging and health care provider exposure to covid-19 silvia mongodi anita orlando eric arisi guido tavazzi erminio santangelo luca caneva marco pozzi eleonora pariani giada bettini giuseppe maggio stefano perlini lorenzo preda giorgio iotti antonio francesco mojoli   on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the new coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as an ongoing pandemic emergency the first reported case had been identified in wuhan china on december 8 2019 since then the disease has rapidly spread worldwide around 510 of covid-19 patients require mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure arf of whom 6585 are classified as having acute respiratory distress syndrome wu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the typical radiologic findings are consolidations and ground glass opacities with a peripheral distribution frequently lung involvement is bilateral with destruction of pulmonary parenchyma caused by consolidations and interstitial inflammation chung et al 2020 as in all acutely ill respiratory patients lung imaging is mandatory for assessment of disease severity and to guide clinical management however radiology societies have advised against the systematic use of computed tomography ct and have suggested reducing the number of chest x-rays cxrs in covid-19 to minimize the exposure of health care providers to this highly infective disease simpson et al 2020 in this context lung ultrasound lus could be the ideal imaging technique as it is available at the bedside it is performed directly by the in-charge physicians and it provides reliable information for diagnosis and monitoring of arf chiumello et al 2018 mojoli et al 2019 pescarissi et al 2020 the aim of our study was to test whether the systematic use of a lus-based approach could reduce the number of conventional radiologic exams during the covid-19 epidemic we admitted the first covid-19 patient on february 21 and progressively transformed our intensive care unit icu into a coronavirus unit reaching 100 of patients with covid-19 on march 6 2020 mojoli et al 2020 because our health care providers have high skills and experience in lus and habitually use ultrasound in daily management of arf patients although in general integrated with traditional imaging from the beginning we decided to use an lus-based approach the aim of this self-imposed limitation was to minimize transport of covid-19 patients to the radiology department reduce the number of bedside cxrs and therefore reduce the exposure of health care professionals a complete 12-area examination with computation of the lus score mongodi et al 2017 is performed daily with a vivid iq ultrasound machine ge healthcare chicago il usa a 9-mhz linear probe is used if the pleural line is visualized with one focus on the

cxr when deemed necessary operators were either recognized experts in the field or trainees who had completed 25 supervised examinations rouby et al 2018 we computed the number of traditional imaging exams performed in all icu patients including those previously admitted from february 22 to march 22 2020 and compared it with the number for the same time frame in 2019 we focused on cxrs and chest cts per patient and per patient-bed days in particular for patients with arf informed consent was collected according to the ad hoc procedures defined by the ethics committee for the covid-19 pandemic the treating physicians had the responsibility for the patients data management and protection aiming at the improvement in treatment and safety quantitative and categorical variables are expressed as the median and number percentage respectively normally distributed data were assessed with the shapirowilk test comparisons between time frames were performed with the unpaired wilcoxonmann whitney u-test for quantitative variables and the fisher exact2-test for categorical variables comparisons were performed between the following pairs overall icu population in 2020 versus 2019 arf patients in 2020 versus those in 2019 covid-19 patients in 2020 versus arf patients in 2019 a p value 005 was considered to indicate significance statistical analysis was performed using stata14 for macintosh over the time frames analyzed we had 84 patients in 2020 and 112 in 2019 in our 23-bed icu for a total of 969 and 1070 and patient-bed days respectively table 1
 we had an increased number of arf patients in 2020 762 vs 196 p  0001 mainly because of covid-19 859 comparison of arf patients revealed that male sex was more frequent 53 828 vs 12 546 p  0008 and body mass index was higher 275 246309 vs 235 201276 p  00132 in 2020 than 2019 results concerning the use of traditional imaging are outlined in table 2
 no significant difference was observed when comparing the overall icu population in 2020 versus that in 2019 when comparing covid-19 arf in 2020 with arf in 2019 the percentages of patients having undergone at least one cxr were similar 855 vs 864 p  1000 but the median number of cxrs per patient was significantly lower in covid-19 10 1020 vs 30 1040 p  00098 similar results were obtained when considering the number of exams performed per patient-bed day the percentage of patients who underwent at least one thoracic ct scan was lower in covid-19 versus arf in 2019 36 vs 318 p  0001 only 2 covid-19 patients underwent ct one twice similar results are obtained when considering the median number of ct scans per patient and per patient-bed day the main result of the present work is that a self-imposed lus-based approach reduces the number of cxrs and thoracic ct scans in covid-19 patients compared with standard arf patients this implies that lus helps to reduce the need for transport of infectious patients to the radiology department and for bedside cxrs thus reducing the number of health care providers exposed to possible contamination and sparing personal protective equipment interestingly in our center not all patients with arf underwent at least one cxr and fewer than 1 in 3 underwent chest ct in the examined time frame in 2019 for many years lus has been used in our center for the assessment and management of arf patients even in the context where the use of conventional chest imaging had already been optimized by the daily practice of lus a self-imposed lus-based approach could further reduce the number of conventional exams the two covid-19 patients who underwent ct for lung assessment both had a condition preventing lus examination ie subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum as for limitations first we analyzed only thoracic ct scans and cxrs as no covid-19 patient required imaging other than thoracic so far second the integration of lus findings in the management of arf requires well-trained physicians rouby et al 2019 automation may be of help in the future to overcome this limitation for lung aeration quantification brusasco et al 2019 piculjan et al 2019 a lus-based approach for the management of covid-19 arf reduces the number of conventional thoracic imaging exams and reduces exposure of health care professionals

wu and mcgoogan 2020  visualization of putative coronavirus in kidney sara miller e john brealey k   we read with concern the articles that report the presence of coronavirus in kidney based on electron microscopic evidence 1 2 neither article in fact demonstrates the presence of coronavirus in the kidney the authors of one paper 1 show purported virus particles in the cytoplasm of kidney tubular epithelium and podocytes these structures are not viral particles but rather clathrin-coated vesicles normal cell organelles involved in intracellular transport the objects in figs a b 60 nm are somewhat smaller than coronaviruses 80 to140 nm but more importantly their spikes peplomers are in contact with the cytosol as are those on clathrin-coated vesicles the larger particle in d also has spikes that are touching cytosol and does not have a dense core coronaviruses on the other hand have their projections either facing the extracellular space between cells or the space inside vacuoles within the cells 3 4 5 this phenomenon is due to the fact that coronaviruses receive their outer covering by budding into or upon cellular membranes thereby forming intracellular vacuoles with the viral projections in contact with the vacuolar content not the cytosol during assembly viral structural proteins are incorporated into the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi complex of the infected cell and viral rna packaged with another protein buds into these membranes forming a membrane-bound sac containing mature virions the spikes are on the outside of the virion but inside the vacuole and not in direct contact with the cytosol fig 1
 these virions get out of the cell by exocytosis when the vacuole membrane fuses with the plasma membrane and opens its contents to the outside thus complete virions with peplomers are seen within the cell inside the membrane container sequestered from the cytosol and outside of cells frequently still attached to the opened vacuolar membrane that has fused with the plasma membrane the particles shown in electron micrographs in this article have their spikes in contact with the cytoplasmic fluid like endocytotic vesicles ie clathrin-coated vesicles plate 523 figs 3-5 pp 1214-5 in reference 6 figs 18 c d in reference 8 9 likewise the particles in the second article 2 are not coronaviruses while they are inside a vacuole have spikes and are approximately the correct size they do not have the uniform appearance of virus particles with a dense double-layered membrane outer covering 3 4 5 these objects are inside a vesicle called a multivesicular body plates 277-8 pp 632-345 in reference 6 fig 3 p 393 in reference 7 this article is concerning as electron microscopy is the only alleged evidence presented in support of the suggestion that coronaviruses are actually present in this kidney tissue all other tests for coronavirus in kidney were negative these micrographs do not support the statement that the particles are indeed viruses knowledge of virus morphology and morphogenesis as well as of cellular architecture is necessary to distinguish viral pathogens from normal subcellular organelles this distinction is frequently difficult since numerous cellular components can masquerade as viruses 7 8 9

confirmed for 7 persons patients ag from the same office on floor 7 patient a a 30-year-old woman the only case-patient who indicated that she had been in wuhan china returned from wuhan on december 18 2019 on january 1516 2020 she had a fever but symptoms resolved without treatment despite symptom resolution on january 30 she was confirmed to have sars-cov-2 infection if patient a is the index patient infected in wuhan her incubation period would have been 28 days which would be extremely long according to updated information wj guan et al unpub data httpswwwmedrxivorgcontent1011012020020620020974v1 asymptomatic carrier transmission has been reported for sars-cov-2 2 hence patient a could have been screened as a close contact during her incubation period and then hospitalized on the basis of a positive test pcr result only however her clinical symptoms did not appear until after hospitalization because persons with asymptomatic covid-19 can spread the virus patient a also could have been an asymptomatic carrier with a persistent infection 3 on january 22 the mall was shut down during january 19february 9 covid-19 was diagnosed for 7 mall staff from floors b13 and for 10 mall customers close contacts associated with the mall were traced and covid-19 was confirmed for 11 persons sixteen patients had had direct contact with other patients or had gone shopping in the mall the average incubation period was 73 range 117 days the mall has 8 floors above ground and several basement levels floors b1 to 6 are commercial shopping space and floor 7 contains shopping and office space we created an illustration showing the floors where the eventual covid-19 case-patients worked or shopped along with dates of symptom onset potential incubation periods symptom durations confirmed times of positive diagnosis and times of discharge figure panel a except for those who had been on floor 7 all other case-patients denied direct close contact with other case-patients the possibility of customers being infected from other sources cannot be excluded however most customers reported early symptom onset in a concentrated time frame figure panel b we found no convincing evidence of definitive transmission pathways in this building patients ag figure panel a worked in the same room on floor 7 other case-patients who had been on other floors denied any direct contact with confirmed patients from floor 7 but they shared common building facilities eg restrooms elevators also staff from floor 7 visited shops on other floors daily until now no evidence has shown that sars-cov-2 can survive outside the body for long however middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus demonstrates high robustness and a strong capability to survive outside the body and can remain infectious for up to 60 minutes after aerosolization 4 hence the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 in our study could have resulted from spread via fomites eg elevator buttons or restroom taps or virus aerosolization in a confined public space eg restrooms or elevators all case-patients other than those on floor 7 were female including a restroom cleaner so common restroom use could have been the infection source for case-patients who were customers in the shopping mall but did not report using the restroom the source of infection could have been the elevators the guangzhou center for disease control and prevention detected the nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 on a doorknob at a patients house 5 but wenzhou center for disease control and prevention test results for an environmental sample from the surface of a mall elevator wall and button were negative  we cannot exclude the possibility of unknown infected persons eg asymptomatic carriers spreading the virus however according to screening protocols implemented by the wenzhou center for disease control and prevention we traced all close contacts and included all patients with positive pcr results including the asymptomatic carrier patient a in this study our findings appear to indicate that low intensity transmission occurred without prolonged close contact in this mall that is the virus spread by indirect transmission  clinical findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in jiangsu province china a retrospective multi-center study rui huang li zhu leyang xue

xiaobing chen chun shan juan xia yuxin chen xiaomin yan jie wei chuanwu zhu chao wu helton santiago da   during december 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china and spread among humans in china and other countries 12 global attention was soon focused on this virus due to the rapidly increasing number of confirmed cases 3 sars-cov-2 infection may result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases 4 as of march 13 2020 132536 confirmed cases have been reported in 123 countries with 4947 deaths 5 despite the rapid spread of the disease worldwide the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 remain largely unclear furthermore there are no directly antiviral drugs for covid-19 several studies have reported the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients who were hospitalized in wuhan the outbreak center of the infection 467 huang et al first reported 41 cases of covid-19 and most patients had a history of exposure to huanan seafood market in wuhan 6 fever and cough were the most common symptoms 6 13 32 patients were admitted to an intensive care unit icu due to the severity of disease and six 15 patients died 6 chen et al conducted a retrospective single-center study which included 99 confirmed cases of covid-19 in wuhan and found that the virus was more likely to infect older men with comorbidities and the mortality rate was as high as 11 4 another single-center study which analyzed 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed covid-19 in wuhan found that 26 of patients received icu care and the mortality rate was only 43 7 although several studies have reported the clinical manifestations and short-term prognosis of covid-19 the source of cases in majority of these studies was from a single center in wuhan the characteristics of the disease and risk factors of severe illness among inpatients in other parts of china outside wuhan were still lacking chang et al reported early clinical features of 13 patients with confirmed covid-19 who were admitted to hospitals in beijing china 8 in their study all the patients recovered indicating milder clinical presentation caused by infections 8 however the sample size was very small with only inclusion of 13 patients and the study was limited by the lack of detailed data since patients were transferred to the designated hospitals after diagnosis 8 xu et al summarized the clinical characteristics of 62 patients in zhejiang province which revealed that the symptoms of patients were relatively mild 9 however only 62 patients were included in the study and risk factors for severe illness could not be analyzed due to the limitation of sample size 9 nevertheless these studies provide important evidence that the clinical characteristics of patients outside wuhan may differ from those initially reported in wuhan in this multi-center study we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of covid-19 and to identify the risk factors of severe illness among inpatients with confirmed covid-19 in jiangsu province which is located in the east of china this multi-center study retrospectively recruited 202 confirmed covid-19 patients from 8 designated hospitals in 8 cities of jiangsu province china affiliated hospital of xuzhou medical university 27 cases the affiliated hospital of kangda college of nanjing medical university the first peoples hospital of lianyungang 11 cases infectious disease hospital of suqian 11 cases huaian no 4 peoples hospital 41 cases yancheng second peoples hospital 12 cases the third peoples hospital of yangzhou 15 cases the third peoples hospital of changzhou 28 cases and the affiliated infectious diseases hospital of soochow university 57 cases fig 1 data of the confirmed covid-19 patients were collected from january 22 2020 to february 10 2020 the 8 designated hospitals are responsible for the treatment of covid-19 patients in jiangsu province china assigned by the chinese government all confirmed patients were diagnosed based on the criterion of world health organization who interim guidance 10 the study was approved by the institutional ethics board of these hospitals with a waiver of informed consent all the medical records of confirmed cases were reviewed by more than two health care workers in each medical center the data of epidemiology clinical laboratory radiology treatment and prognosis were collected from medical records the demographic characteristics comorbidities exposure history symptoms signs laboratory data radiological data treatment data and outcomes were collected all data were entered into a computerized database for further analysis different researchers preformed the cross check of the data to avoid errors unclear information was further clarified by directly contacting the specific clinicians who were responsible for the patients the diagnostic criteria of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute cardiac injury acute renal injury and acute liver injury were based on the corresponding guidelines 1114 additionally treatment medication and outcomes of the enrolled cases were also collected based on the medical records the criteria for discharge was based on the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus infection by the chinese national health commission trial version 5 15 patients were grouped into severe and non-severe covid-19 according to the same guidelines 15 all patients were confirmed by throat swab sample obtained from the upper respiratory tract and detected by a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr in accordance with the protocol by the world health organization 16the positive throat swab samples were confirmed by both hospitals and local centers for disease control and prevention these routine laboratory tests were detected according to the state of disease including blood routine tests liver function renal function coagulation function inflammatory biomarkers and myocardial enzymes radiological assessments including chest x-ray or chest computed tomography ct were performed for each patient continuous variables were described as medians interquartile range iqr and categorical variables were presented as the counts and percentages continuous variables were compared by the independent group t tests normal distribution and mann-whitney u non-normal distribution categorical variables were compared by chi-square or fisher exact test the risk factors for severe illness were analyzed by binary logistic regression variables having p values 005 in the univariate analysis were further used for a multivariate logistic regression analysis p005 was regarded to be statistically significant the data analysis was performed by spss version 220 software spss inc chicago il united states distribution map was plotted by qgis version 3102 qgis development team open source geospatial foundation

94 chronic lung diseases 7 35 chronic liver diseases 4 20 cardiovascular diseases 5 25 cerebrovascular diseases 3 15 and malignant tumors 2 10 although only 3 15 patients had direct exposure to huanan seafood market 84 416 patients visited hubei province and 92 455 patients had contact with people who visited hubei province after the onset of the covid-19 epidemic 98 485 patients had known contact with suspected or confirmed cases however 32 158 patients did not report any known contact with hubei the median time from symptom onset to admission was 50 days iqr 2070 days 23 114 of the patients

non-severe patients median bmi 264 kgm2 vs 242 kgm2 p  0004 nearly half 444 of the severe patients were obese bmi  28 kgm2 compared to only 104 of the non-severe patients furthermore more severe patients had history of type 2 diabetes 348 vs 61 p0001 more non-severe patients contacted with suspected or confirmed patients than severe patients 514 vs 261 p  0022 the most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever 156 772 cough 120 594 followed by fatigue 44 218 sore throat 24 119 muscle ache 21 104 shortness of breath 19 94 diarrhea 13 64 and headache 12 59 table 2 the blood counts

representative chest ct findings for a 30-year-old man on admission to the hospital were shown in fig 2 bilateral ground-glass opacities were observed in both lungs on admission fig 2 oxygen therapy was required in 109 540 patients and non-invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 9 45 patients none of the patients required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation 196 970 patients received antiviral therapy lopinavirritonavir 891 interferon -2b 599 arbidol 292 oseltamivir 158 149 738 patients were administered with empirical antibiotic treatment additionally sixty-four 317 patients were given corticosteroids and 31 153 patients were given gamma globulin common complications included respiratory failure 9 45 patients ards 2 10 patients and shock 1 05 patients table 3 by february 10 2020 37 183 of 202 patients have been discharged and 165 817 patients remained hospitalized 11 patients were admitted to the icu however no patient was deceased in our study compared with non-severe patients more severe patients received oxygen therapy 480 vs 1000 p0001 and antibiotic therapy 715 vs 913 p  0042 most of the severe patients received corticosteroid 783 vs 257 p0001 and more severe patients were treated with gamma globulin 435 vs 117 p0001 regarding patients with severe illness 11 478 patients were admitted to the icu and 9 391 patients required non-invasive mechanical ventilation univariate analysis showed that risk factors for severe illness were obesity bmi  28 kgm2 presence of type 2 diabetes lactate dehydrogenase ldh  250 ul crp  10 mgl and alb  35 gl however on multivariate analysis only the bmi  28 kgm2 odds ratio or 9219 95 confidence interval ci 2731 to 31126 p0001 and a known history of diabetes or 4326 95 ci 1059 to 17668 p  0041 were the independent risk factors for developing severe illness table 4 our study provides a comprehensive description of the clinical characteristics of laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 and the risk factors for severe covid-19 in 202 cases from 8 designated hospitals in 8 cities of jiangsu province china consistent with the study by wang et al about half of the patients in our study were male 7 these data differ from the recent reports by huang et al and chen et al which showed sars-cov-2 is more likely to infect male 46 one possible explanation is that more covid-19 patients in the previous report had an exposure history of the huanan seafood market in wuhan and most of patients tended to be male workers 7 however only 15 of patients in our study had known contact with huanan seafood market the median age of the patients was 44 years and only 129 of the patients aged over 60 years 272 of the patients had chronic comorbidities several studies suggested that sars-cov-2 is more likely to infect elder adult males with chronic comorbidities 4717 however our study indicated that patients at a wide age range can be infected by sars-cov-2 recently wei et al even reported nine infants infected by sars-cov-2 18 although 158 of the patients did not report any known contact with wuhan-related people the majority of patients in our study were wuhan-related which indicated the epidemiology are important for the diagnosis of covid-19 for patients outside wuhan consistent with two recent reports fever and cough were the common symptoms whereas other symptoms such as diarrhea were much rare 46 however our study found that 228 of the patients were afebrile on admission the percentage of patients with fever was lower than the previous study which was ranged from 83 to 986 7 thus the afebrile patients with an epidemiological link of the disease should be also suspected for covid-19 compared with symptoms of non-severe patients shortness of breath was more common in severe patients the most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were decreased white blood cells and lymphocyte counts as well as increased crp and ldh levels compared to non-severe patients severe patients had laboratory abnormalities such as lower lymphocytes and alb levels as well as higher ldh and cpr levels the onset of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities on admission may help the physicians identify the covid-19 patients who likely develop severe illness and provide better supportive care currently except for meticulous supportive care no specific treatment has been recommended for covid-19 although antibacterial agents are ineffective for covid-19 over 70 of the patients in this study still receive antibacterial agents about 90 of the patients received antiviral therapy such as atomized inhalation of interferon -2b lopinavirritonavir arbidol and oseltamivir the benefit of the antiviral agents for covid-19 is not yet clear and deserves further investigation 317 of the patients used corticosteroids during the treatment especially for severe patients 783 although some experts recommend the prudently use of short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses for critically ill patients with covid-19 the use of corticosteroids remains controversial in covid-19 19 moreover the optimal time dose and duration of corticosteroids for patients with covid-19 are not yet clear and need to be evaluated by randomized controlled trials to provide a more solid evidence for treatment recommendations in the future gamma globulin was also used for the treatment of covid-19 and severe patients were more likely to receive gamma globulin treatment however the efficacy of gamma globulin for covid-19 remains controversial 23 114 patients were identified as severe illness cases in our study which is lower than the previous study 157 20 the icu admission 54 was also lower as compared with the previous studies which ranged from 261 to 32 67 as of february 10 2020 no patients died in our study the mortality rate in our study is significantly lower than patients in wuhan as previously reported which ranged from 43 to 15 67 wu et al also reported only 1 of 62 patients was transferred to an icu and no patient died in zhejiang province 9 the possible interpretation of the mild disease and better outcomes in our study may be that the patients were younger than previous reports the elderly people may have an increased risk of coexisting disorders and are more susceptible to developing severe forms of disease than younger people 2122 indeed less patients had comorbidities 272 in our study as compared with the previous reports 320-464 467 the median time from symptom onset to admission was 50 days which is also shorter than the previous studies 70 days 67 thus early diagnosis and prompt care of the covid-19 patients might also together contribute to the significant reduction in mortality rate in our study 20 early identification of patients with severe illness is important for the management of patients with covid-19 we conducted univariate and multivariate analysis for risk factors of covid-19 patients with severe illness on admission for the first time we identified the obesity bmi over 28 kgm2 and a history of type 2 diabetes as two independent risk factors of severe illness suggesting that the metabolic conditions was associated the severity of covid-19 in the previous study metabolic syndrome-related conditions such as diabetes and obesity were also demonstrated to be etiologically linked to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov pathogenesis 23 these disorders were reported to down regulate some key mediators of host immune response to pathogenesis 2324 previous study found that a known history of type 2 diabetes was also an independent predictor of death and morbidity in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 25 whether the obesity and known history of type 2 diabetes could predict the fatal outcome of patients with covid-19 deserves further investigation this study has several limitations first only 202 patients with confirmed covid-19 were included from eight cities of jiangsu province it would be better to include as many as possible patients in jiangsu province to get more comprehensive understanding of covid-19 outside wuhan moreover we only included patients with laboratory confirmed cases the suspected but undiagnosed cases were not included in the present study as of february 10 2020 515 confirmed cased have been reported in jiangsu province 5 in fact about a half of the confirmed cases were included in our present study thus our study is very representative second clinical outcomes of the remaining 165 hospitalized patients were not available at the time of analysis thus we could not assess the risk factors for poor outcomes of patients however this multicenter study provides an early assessment of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 outside wuhan china in conclusion covid-19 patients in jiangsu province were less severe and have improved prognosis than the initial covid-19 patients as previously reported in wuhan indicating that mild cases might already have occurred a bmi  28 kgm2 and a history of type 2 diabetes are independent risk factors for severe illness of covid-19 sustained intensive control efforts remain urgently needed to minimize the risk of covid-19  faculty of health sciences paul alexander elias victoria debono borg manoj mammen j alfonso iorio komal aryal dianna deng eva brocard waleed alhazzani paul alexander e   no current treatment or prophylaxis has proven to be effective in coronavirus disease 2019  and patients receive either symptomatic treatment for milder presentations or more advanced life-support strategies in moderate to severe cases as the global community eagerly awaits credible scientific solutions for this pandemic researchers and scientists are under much pressure to identify effective therapeutic and preventive strategies for covid -19 this commentary focuses on the quality of current covid-19 research we used published clinical studies on chloroquinehydroxychloroquine as an example to demonstrate some of the methodological concerns around research currently conducted in the field in recent weeks academic journals and public media published and disseminated information on the use of quinine derivatives ie chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 1 2 for the treatment of covid-19 chloroquine has long been and still is used to prevent and treat malaria whereas hydroxychloroquine was first used to prevent and treat malaria and is currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis some symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other autoimmune diseases although ongoing clinical trials are testing the efficacy and safety of several treatments for covid-19 including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine there is not yet credible evidence from clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of those agents in covid-19 most of the data released or published thus far on chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and covid-19 research in general are imprecise and at high risk of biased estimates of effect here lies our concern this pandemic emergency is fraught with tremendous uncertainty about the evidence on treatment or prophylaxis there are many unknowns and the massive demand for evidence on the treatment of a novel disease like covid-19 may be unintentionally affecting studies design and conduct furthermore it may inadvertently affect the peer-review and publication process leading to significant methodology gaps and overall lower quality evidence on covid-19 these gaps lead to less informative studies loss of precious time and valuable resources therefore current research should balance feasibility and efficiency against methodological rigor and carefully address methodology gaps as much as possible in order to support universal clinical decision-making and minimize harm the research community should focus on conducting and publishing trust-worthy evidence hypothesis generating studies are welcome and essential but should be explicitly framed as such acknowledging their limitation and not be used for critical decisions at the national or global level furthermore experimental studies aiming to confirm or refute these observations should be supported until there is a certainty patients deserve for themselves and for the sake of future patients to be randomized in ethical and well-designed clinical trials our concerns on the state of the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine research thus far expand to the quality of research methodology we see spanning across covid-19 research we sought to draw attention to this to optimally inform our appraisal of the quality of covid-19 research we searched the medline and embase electronic databases to identify clinical studies on the use of these agents in covid-19 2019 to april 3 rd  2020 finding 564 initial citations that were screened for eligibility yielding six clinical studies judged eligible 5 6 7 8 9 10  based on the quality of the evidence to date can a clinical practice guideline issue any recommendations on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or combination with other treatments the case has not been made either way for these quinine derivatives the body of evidence thus far has been from both in vitro studies 2 3 4 and clinical studies 5 6 7 8 9 10 of sub-optimal methodological quality the emerging clinical studies such as case-series cohort studies and randomized control trials rcts are all inconclusive while some may suggest some benefit the entire body of evidence does not reach the level of certainty and confidence that is required to justify the use of quinine derivatives as a treatment for covid-19 5 6 7 8 9 10  as exciting as some of these results may appear the underlying research methodologies are often flawed and as such the reported results cannot be trusted a most recent french prospective study 10 on the use of chloroquine in combination with azithromycin completely contradicts a prior french study asserting the benefit of the combination 8 9  when critically appraised using the appropriate risk of bias tools all studies 5 6 7 8 9 10 have been classified as high risk of biased estimates of effect 11 12 table 1  overall the methodologies of the published studies are not robust and the results are tempered by selection bias and residual confounding bias at the design level most studies lack the randomization and blindingmasking needed to generate sound evidence when they are rcts and not observational uncontrolled single arm case-series at the analysis level they lack the standard steps taken to minimize confounding such as prospective design statistical adjustment for prognostic factors propensity matching or stratification 13  the reporting is very sparse and patient-important outcomes needed for decision-making are often not studied or not reported we do understand the urgency to identify effective treatments as well as the barriers to perform rigorous research in health care settings overwhelmed by an unprecedented workload and a novel deadly disease however these unprecedented and unfortunate circumstances do not transform flawed data into sound results the adequately powered comparative rigorous effectiveness research that is needed for optimal evidence-informed decision-making remains absent researchers need to prioritize minimizing bias by randomizing a large enough number of patients and masking the treatment allocation as much as it is feasible and fully accounting for all the patients enrolled in the study following the intention-to-treat analysis principle  table 2  these critical components of high-quality trustworthy research are required to generate high confidence that the estimates of effect reflect the true effects at this time more than ever the high-quality robust comparative evidence from ethical randomized controlled trials rcts is urgently needed to assess patient-important outcomes including mortality morbidity need for life support safety and toxicity informing on the safe use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin in people with covid-19 again we make this clarion call across the breadth of covid-19 research and across all research in general of course these studies will need to be fast and even better conducted in a flexible framework such as adaptive trials able to accommodate the adding of and switching to different treatments as soon the ones under study are proven ineffective or more promising alternatives are suggested consideration of master protocols harmonization of efforts and adaptive trial designs become very important 16  the world health organization who has advocated for randomized multi-center adaptive clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of investigational therapeutic agents in combination with standard-of-care for the treatment of hospitalized patients with novel coronavirus disease covid-19 17  researchers aligning their methodology to whos master protocol will surely improve quality of the covid research 16 17  additionally global research groups conducting clinical trials would help in disseminating their results by adhering to the consort consolidated standards of reporting trials checklist for optimal clinical trial reporting 15 and the strobe strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology statement that outlines the guidance for optimal reporting of observational studies 14  this is critically important and especially in this covid-19 urgency when very serious national and global public health decisions are being made based on what information is shared or not shared evidence exists to show that clinical trial results are biased when the trials utilize inferior methodology or report findings without satisfactory description of the methods used failing to conceal allocation of the generated sequence has been linked to an exaggeration of the effectiveness of 30 or greater 15  the urgency of the covid-19 situation would also make it appropriate to be creative and move beyond the classical modalities and boundaries of academic research what if a mobile app was made available by a respectable institution to allow randomizing any small number of consenting patients collecting a small set of relevant covariates age sex days since diagnosis relevant comorbidities by any doctor willing to participate in a chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine trial wherever the treatment is available for compassionate prescription ie most of the world what if mortality in the two groups masked as being treatment and control was posted on a website every 100 patients reaching the outcome recovered or dead to transparently show if equipoise persists what if the dataset at 1000 patients or every 1000 patients if needed was made publicly available for highly skilled statisticians to propose their interpretation we would get 1000 patients every few days and we would be receiving clinically sound results faster than any traditional study framework of course this flexibility may not warrant publication in a top tier journal but could save thousands of lives we need to use the most optimal methodology and not compromise on rigor but be willing to think outside of the box the outcomes being reported in the covid-19 research thus far are informative but are not ideally patient-important that could help in patient and clinician decision-making in addition research question gaps are glaring and future methodologically strong comparative research of quinines for covid-19 as well as other drug treatments should assess the following 1 the net benefit ratio of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other interventions 2 specific subgroups classified by age stage and severity of illness and other potential effect modifiers and 3 optimal dosing and timing of dosing we do believe there is still full equipoise justifying the continued investigation of the role of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine in studies in patients hospitalized with covid-19 caution is urged regarding large scale uptake of the treatment as open-label use of the drug why extreme caution is urged in using chloroquine hydroxychloroquine or any drug we could be doing more harm than good primum non nocere -first do no harm potential adverse effects toxicities and medication interactions must remain key considerations when using any drug and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin are no exception indeed the evidence suggests that both drugs prolong the qt interval leading predisposing patients to serious arrhythmias 18 19 20 21  this is of particular concern when co-administering macrolides azithromycin 22  also known to affect cardiac electrophysiology indeed the use of doxycycline 22 has been proposed in azithromycins place the us food and drug administration fda has even warned the public that azithromycin zithromax or zmax can potentially cause irregular changes in the electrical activity of the heart and could lead to a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm 23  in this regard researchers recently looked at 84 covid-19 infected patients who were administered a hydroxychloroquineazithromycin combination 24  they found that the qtc was prolonged maximally after 3-4 days from the beginning of treatment and in 25 patients the qtc increased more than 40ms they also found that in 9 patients 11 the qtc increased to 500 ms indicative of a high-risk group for arrhythmia this issue of potential harmful effects and the urgent need for high-quality methodologically robust studies also comes from a recent pre-publication not yet peer-reviewed of in vitro activity of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in combination with metformin used in treatment of type 2 diabetes to lower blood sugar in humans in mice 25  researches reported that when hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine was combined with metformin as a possible anti-cancer drug 30-40 of all mice died until more high-quality evidence is available and particularly that excludes harm caution is urged especially with combination therapy outside rcts there must also be acute pharmacovigilance and monitoring of adverse drug reactions with regards to these and other drugs in covid-19 patients given so much in unknown some countries have chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine readily available in some cases as an overthe-counter medicine as they are required to treat common conditions national authorities should be mindful of these situations and take measures to govern the use of these medicines and prevent dangerous self-medication on the equity side there is a concern of massive purchasing including for both personal use and research leading to possible shortage of supply this can lead to treatment shortages for malaria and autoimmune diseases where there is confirmed benefit the use of existing drug treatments such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine outside of current guidelines and recommendations may result in adverse effects including serious illness and death affect patients with other diseases who may benefit from its use and hinder the ability to conduct clinical trials if there are high demands to sue these agents by clinicians and patients toxic results from in vitro studies may not translate to toxicity in humans but we caution that care must be exercised in extrapolating in vitro results before establishing clinical efficacy and safety 26  in summary while the massive effort in generating and disseminating evidence globally in response to covid-19 has to be applauded the accumulated body of evidence thus far can at best be considered hypothesis generating due to the methodological flaws across covid clinical research the methodological quality of ongoing and planned clinical research has to be urgently upgraded if the vast amount of time and resources are not to be squandered in this emergency until availability of sound results from one or more covid-19 clinical trial s showing a favorable risk-benefit caution is urged in considering indiscriminate use of these two drugs alone or in association public health authorities are urged to prioritize resources on those interventions that are currently recommended as standard of care and ensure that empirical clinical use or research on these medication does not endanger adequate supply for the patients that need it for conditions in which the efficacy is already known declaration of interest none to declare but note most of the

in the research findings and thus be optimally informed for decision-making the estimates of effect in clinical research depends on the underlying research methodology covid-19 disease is presenting global health systems clinicians and patients grave challenges no treatment or prophylaxis currently exists for covid-19 the overall body of covid-19 research is very flawed methodologically an examination of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin research findings due to the recent media focus revealed very low-quality methodology underpins the research vast amounts of time and resources are being allocated to covid-19 research and being potentially squandered flawed methodology and sub-optimal reporting of research findings could lead to biased estimates of effect this could lead to treatment decisions that are not optimal based on biased estimates which could harm the patient this article provides specific suggestions for improving on the covid-19 methods and reporting with a focus on the issues that researchers must consider in their methodology and reporting if we are to have confidence in the estimates of effect failure to consider harms in research could be detrimental to the patient this article focuses on the potential harms when therapeutic agents such as hydroxychloroquine are being considered research thus far on finding an optimal therapeutic agent s for covid-19

manuscript none for the project  face mask designs following novel coronavirus fang-lin chao   this paper proposes three mask improvement designs for both general users and hospital staff to reduce the chance of face mask contact transmission influenza virus infection occurs through contact transmission between people infectious diseases can spread through droplets respiratory aerosols or direct and indirect contact with contaminated surfaces the effectiveness of face masks in disease prevention has been verified through research1 macintyre et al examined the effect of surgical masks and handwashing on the prevention of influenza transmission2 public compliance with infection control measures is crucial if a large number of people use masks during a severe pandemic the spread of the epidemic is reduced reducing exposure can reduce the spread of disease in public places such as schools cauchemez et al 3 have shown that holidays lead to a 20-29 reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children in school face mask comfort is a key to public compliance with infection control measures in a survey by purdy4 participants were asked to use a likert scale of 1-6 to assess the n95 filtering facepiece respirator ffr based on fitness temperature and respiratory comfort4 in terms of discomfort warmth and breathing comfort fitness was rated the most important and two-dimensional patterns expanded the mask area to cover the facial contours for individuals the use of reusable cloth masks is widespread particularly when surgical face masks are scarce but there is no clinical guidance regarding their use many people repeatedly use a mask every day and the masks are repeatedly donned and doffed placing their users at risk of contact transmission masks are often placed in a purse or pocket further compromising their cleanliness 5 people feel using a face mask is uncomfortably humid and inconvenient for inhalation in a previous evaluation of mask contact diffusion individuals who donned and doffed a face mask during a simple task polluted an average area of 530 square centimeters 6 a novel coronavirus was eventually identified on 1 january 2020 who had set up the imst incident management support team across the three levels of the organization7 virus can be transmitted even during the incubation period as a result asymptomatic carriers may still pass the disease to other people some patients exhibit normal temperatures and there are many milder cases medical practitioners are required to wear complete protective equipment when large numbers of patients flood into the emergency room if the face mask is removed while going to the restroom or drinking water this protective suit may be contaminated in a situation with limited resources it is essential to take care of ones physiological needs without contamination taiwan has so far managed to prevent a large scale community outbreak city forces wearing face masks on public transportation and keep social distancing to stem the virus from spreading when asked by fox news reporter gates highlighted taiwan as an exemplary country because it quickly8 identified the problem and initiated community-wide testing early on and reduced the disease burden taiwan had learned valuable lessons from the sars outbreak in 2003 a centralized cecc command center led the actions and resource allocation and the necessity to be highly skeptical of data and information when an explosion begins the central epidemic command center cecc announced standards for the suspension of classes high schools and below will shut down for 14 days based on following rules i if one teacher or student is listed as a confirmed case of covid-19 by the cecc their classes will be suspended ii if two or more teachers or students are confirmed to have contracted the disease all courses in the entire school will be suspended iii if one-third of schools in a township or city shut down due to infections all schools will be closed the coronavirus is spread through coughing or sneezing or by touching an infected person commuters are particularly at risk since they travel with large crowds in enclosed spaces and subway handrails may spread the virus through contact transmission910 there is also a risk of the virus adhering to the car doors and elevator buttons people cannot avoid the germs that touch their hands and masks which puts them under substantial psychological and physiological pressure relevant literature on masks is mainly in the product catalog or patent database lets summarize them separately from below several variations on the standard surgical face mask are currently offered by companies halyard health face masks offer several features and levels of protection the materials and donning attachments are sonically bonded and a nose piece assists the mask in conforming to the contours of the face figure 1 most surgical face masks contain an adjustable iron wire which is bent with finger pressure to fix its shape close to the bridge of the nose this one-dimensional fixation creates a gap when the mask moves figure 1a also shows an adjustable nose bridge design that maintains a closer fit to the users face three charging techniques viz corona charging tribocharging and electrostatic fiber spinning were used to charge fibers or fabrics of different polymer types11 electrostatic charging technology enables regular masks to filter more air particles figure 1b shows an extended surgical mask designed with respiratory comfort concerns in mind a flat-fold design protects against airborne biological particles and serves as a respirator the three-panel low-profile n95 particulate respirator mask features a soft cover and nose clip the mask is opened by pulling up and down and closed in the opposite way however although it is folded vertically the front outer surface is still touchable during donning and doffing many existing product designs are based on considerations of filtering performance and suitability for individual face shapes figure 1c is a design with an elongated elastic restraint a three-dimensional mask increases the protection of the mask and is convenient to carry13
figure 1d shows the upper section and the lower sections are respectively lifted away from the middle to form a three-dimensional shape the sheet is bent along the first fold line and toward the opposite surface to facilitate carrying the packaging of the snack face mask is easily opened for fast use figure 1e the packaging is part of the mask so it does not come into contact with the outside world when it is folded although there are different folding methods for each design there is no product that can avoid outer layer contact completely the elongated hexagon-shaped portion of the face mask has a clear surface13 another patent features a gathered peripheral bottom which provides an air-tight seal under the face14 greenblat15 proposed a mask with a unique shape design which decreases in volume when folded with a joint style nilsson et al16 proposed a cone-shaped tent structure with forward-extending support with an additional air valve device used to reduce the difficulty of inhalation wang altered the periphery of the breathing area with a compressible gasket and a three-dimensional sealing structure to abut the users face17 a tight seal is necessary between the face and the mask when worn if it is not tight enough contaminants may be inhaled by the user m563890 is a narrow strip mask with reinforced covering18 the m464196 folding three-dimensional mask folds to make a three-dimensional mask with a larger exhalation space19 since the lower edge of the upper mask portion is engaged with the upper edge of the symmetrical mask portion mutual contact is ensured to improve safety after the patent database survey we did not find a model that could completely prevent the outer layer from contacting contaminants after folding design thinking has generated significant attention in the business press and has been heralded as a novel problem solving methodology well suited to the often cited challenges designers face in encouraging innovation20 the solid background of knowledge help starts to think alternative ways to view the problem after the team member identifies innovative solutions the prototype is used to redefine one or further problems li21 proposed six rules for innovation which used in different fields such as advertising commerce engineering and design the six rules are reverse transfer combination reduction change of direction and extension the rules were applied to the development of mask redesign their contents are during the design process the designer needs to think about possible situations and parameters repeatedly and pick the appropriate settings to reduce the time spent on attempts the design flow is firstly i we look for problems and available materials ii we observe the medical characteristics through a simplified model and iii we try to find appropriate implement way secondly concept drawings provided by the design group and screened based on producibility in a medical design the designer needs to extend his knowledge through international regulations such as iso mdr and fda the mdr sets high standards for ensuring reliable data are generated from clinical investigations22 recently fda recommendation on device reuse so that developing cost-effective reusable face masks for the public is essential the 510k submission of surgical mask evaluates medical devices for marketing to ensure they are safe and effective ultraviolet germicidal irradiation microwave-generated steaming and dry heating were tested in reducing or inactivating viral and bacterial pathogens23 a costeffective full-face mask was developed to support safety of stuff24 in this urgent need of the epidemic it also urged the creation of improved mask design designers can develop concepts firmly and realize ideas through cross-domain cooperation through thinking about the real-life environment situation brainstorming between medical consultants and designers we selected ideas and presented three realistic and feasible ideas below caregivers must wear n95 masks before entering closed spaces because the mask isolates the virus from the user via the surface layer touching the mask with hands is dangerous after a sneeze droplets soak through the mask and other individuals have the chance to be infected in addition when caregivers remove their masks to drink water they put themselves at risk of infection design-a aims to reduce mask removal and infection chance during drinking the creative rules applied are reverse-drink water without taking off your mask transfer-transfer the pet cap to the mask extension-drink water with an extension straw medical staff can drink water safely and conveniently without removing their masks a water bag will engage the inlet on the front of the cover figure 2 the flange of the water bag can be extended to the users lips and the water outlet does not touch the outer surface of the mask while drinking which avoids the risk of contact transmission after taking off their masks most subjects carry them in purses or pockets the hands touch the contaminated areas on the mask and the outer edge of the mask also touch the interior of the purse or pocket therefore it is crucial to minimize the chances of contacting the outer edge of the mask design-b can be folded in a w shape so that the outer part of the mask faces inward and reduces contact transmission figure 3a when the mask is unfolded a three-dimensional convex surface is formed over the nose figure 3 bc which increases the available area for inhalation the creative rules applied are reverse- change of direction outer surface facing inward transfertechniques of origami reduction- reduce the chance of hand contact because people often do not wear masks when going out design-c figure 4 combines the mask with the brim of a cap the design usually acts as a hat and when needed the user pulls down the headband which is made of a flexible material at this time the mask and the brim form a sizeable three-dimensional space and it is easy for the user to breathe with a large area of air intake when the mask is doffed and folded the user holds the headband of the cap to avoid contact transmission the creative rules applied are reverse- cap front edge elastic can be pulled down combine- mask combines with hat change direction- pull down extension- increase front end size a major epidemic makes people aware of the importance of avoiding contact and related improvements have distributed in local market the design-d figure 5a added a breathable thin cloth cover outside the mask the outer surface of the cover is in contact with the virus and the inner surface is in contact with the mouth foam after using for a period of time remove the cover to wash and dry to increase the use time of the mask figure 5b shows a foldable box after removing the mask the outer surface folds inwards place the mask in the protective shell with an elastic band to close the protective shell and put it in the pocket this avoids the opportunity for the outside of the mask to contact the body and clothing the creative rules applied are reverse- mask with another mask combination- mask combines with package change direction- the outer surface facing inward to reduce contact the current coronavirus epidemic has increased the need for face masks and respirators that can be used without increasing the chances of contact transmission residents who live in affected areas are at risk of infection from close contact with other residents especially during their daily commute in addition it is nearly impossible to avoid contact with pathogens on face masks and hands current face mask patent designs do not protect the outer layer of the mask from outside pathogens after they have been folded as a result we propose three improved mask designs to reduce the chances of infection from direct contact design-a features a mask with a water channel which allows the user to remain hydrated without removing the mask design-b has a folding pattern which hides the outer mask surface and reduces contact transmission design-c combines the mask with the brim of a cap the mask and the brim form an extended air-intake area for easier breathing the design-d shows related improvements distributed in local market which reduce the chance of mask contact with users body and clothing an epidemic makes us aware of the detail living behaviors which strengthen public health  early nutritional supplementation in non-critically ill patients hospitalized for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease covid-19 rationale and feasibility of a shared pragmatic protocol riccardo caccialanza alessandro laviano federica lobascio elisabetta montagna raffaele bruno serena ludovisi angelo corsico guido antonio di sabatino mirko belliato monica calvi isabella iacona giuseppina grugnetti elisa bonadeo alba muzzi emanuele cereda   beginning in december 2019 the 2019 novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has caused a pneumonia epidemic in wuhan china and as of this writing is rapidly spreading throughout the whole world particularly in italy and the united states the clinical spectrum of covid-19 disease appears wide encompassing asymptomatic infection mild upper respiratory tract infection and severe pneumonia with respiratory failure with many patients being hospitalized and requiring subintensive or intensive care 1 2 3 the majority of severe complications and deaths are reported among older patients with evidence of underlying illness such as cardiovascular liver kidney disease or cancer 1 2 3 4 several factors leading to the progression of covid-19 pneumonia have been identified 5 in addition to age smoking status maximum body temperature respiratory failure c-reactive protein and serum albumin have been shown to be independent prognostic markers 5 although albumin is not exclusively dependent on nutritional status it is part of several nutritional screening indices and is associated with nutritional conditions 6 interestingly low prealbumin levels another marker of malnutrition have been demonstrated to predict the progression to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation 7 this evidence strengthens the concept that nutritional derangements should be systematically and urgently managed in patients affected by covid-19 also considering that the immune response has been shown to be weakened by inadequate nutrition 89 the few available articles that mentioned supportive care in covid-19 recommend that nutritional status should be evaluated in all infected patients at hospital admission 1011 and patients at nutritional risk should receive nutritional support as early as possible particularly increasing protein intake by oral nutritional supplements ons 11 they also underline that even patients with covid-19 who are not at risk for malnutrition should maintain adequate protein 15 gd and calorie 2530 kcald intake 11 and that several vitamins and nutrients may have the potential to benefit infected patients due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidants properties 10 given the above and considering the well-known deleterious consequences of malnutrition 12 which can be prevented or contained by prompt nutritional support 13 and having in mind the peculiarities of the intensive care unit icu setting we are presenting our shared pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-icu patients hospitalized for covid-19 we are aware that our simplified and direct approach may be debatable as it may not appear to be in complete agreement with the current guidelines on clinical nutrition 14 however to cope with the current emergency crisis its principal aim is to promptly and pragmatically implement nutritional care in hospitalized non-icu covid-19 patients which might be overlooked despite being potentially beneficial to clinical outcomes and effective in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient population guidelines are based on the best available scientific evidence therefore our protocol should not be considered as guidelines but rather as the practical implementation of the need to provide nutritional care given the current clinical and organizational situations the early nutritional supplementation protocol is summarized in figure 1
 it is based on the observation that almost all hospitalized patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a major reduction of food intake and that a substantial percentage of them develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation niv or even continuous positive airway pressure cpap in a few days specific high-caloriedense diets in a variety of different textures and consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks yogurt custard fruit mousse sliced fruit soft cheese etc are available for all hospitalized patients to favor the maintenanceincrease of protein-calorie intake however we are unfortunately recording a significant number of patients reporting severe eating difficulties as a consequence of the symptoms hence beyond a simplified nutritional risk screening procedure and biochemical nutritional markers fig 1 we decided to start with a systematic supplementation of oral whey proteins 20 gd and intravenous multivitamin multimineral trace elements solutions target satisfaction of recommended dietary allowance rda upon admission the choice of whey proteins is based on their anabolic and antioxidant properties combined with high digestibility 1516 their potential clinical benefits have been underlined in cancer cachexia 17 and have been recently shown in a randomized controlled trial with malnourished advanced cancer patients conducted by our group 18 whey proteins also have immunomodulatory properties 19 and potential antiviral activity 20 furthermore whey protein supplementation has been associated with improved immune recovery in patients with hiv during the first 3 mo of antiretroviral treatment art 21 the straight intravenous supplementation of multivitamin multimineral trace element solutions aimed at satisfying rda is due to the consideration of their antioxidant properties and that specific vitamin and micronutrient deficits have been shown to be harmful during viral infections 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 although we are aware that this approach is not precise as it should be ideally guided by singular vitamin and micronutrient assessment we think that it may be beneficial with very limited risk for harm secondary to overdosing in consideration of the dosages used in the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin d 25ohd deficit cholecalciferol is promptly supplied according to blood tests results 50 000 uiwk if 25ohd 20 ngml 25 000 uiwk if 25ohd 20 to 30 ngml the particular focus on vitamin d is justified by the increasing evidence that its supplementation and restoration to normal values in infected patients may improve immunologic recovery during art reduce levels of inflammation and immune activation and increase immunity against pathogens 37 38 39 40 41 if nutritional risk is detected by the simplified screening procedure fig 1 two to three bottles 125200 mld of protein-calorie ons 600900 kcald 3555 gd of proteins are provided to patients to be consumed between or immediately after meals if ons are not tolerated ie 2 bottlesd are consumed for 2 consecutive days andor respiratory conditions are worsening ie niv or cpap are expected to be necessary supplementaltotal parenteral nutrition pn is prescribed by the clinical nutrition and dietetics unit which plans blood tests and glucose monitoring the preference of pn over enteral nutrition en which may certainly be debatable is due to the consideration that the presence of a nasogastric tube ngt may result in air leakage and compromise the effectiveness of niv or cpap and that particularly in this emergency scenario special niv masks with a port for ngt are rarely available 42 positive pressure ventilation through a face mask may also result in gastric distention which may adversely affect diaphragmatic function further compromising the respiratory conditions receiving en during niv was associated with a significantly higher rate of airway complications and longer niv duration compared with patients who did not receive en 43 and there is currently no validated strategy to reduce the critical complications of en among patients with niv or cpap 44 moreover in a randomized trial conducted in an icu setting which compared early pn with en in critically ill shocked patients the en group had higher cumulative incidences of vomiting diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complications whereas no differences in mortality rates were detected 45 a further consideration regarding the choice of pn is that patients receiving art which is currently being used in covid-19 disease are frequently likely to experience diarrhea that can contribute to treatment interruption 4647 and further worsen nutrient absorption finally it has been shown that gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently reported in covid-19 particularly by patients with rapid progression and worse outcome 48 which may increase the risk for en intolerance regarding pn treatment consists of multichamber bags containing glucose amino acids with or without lipids and electrolytes and supplemented with multivitamin and multimineral trace elements which are infused via either central when available or peripheral infusion lines for 18 to 24 hd according to clinical conditions and biochemical data fig 1 in particular pn bags without lipids are prescribed in the presence of basal triglyceride levels 200 mgdl energy needs in the obvious absence of indirect calorimeters outside the icu setting are estimated multiplying the resting energy expenditure calculated by the harrisbenedict equation by a correction factor of 15 in obese patients body mass index bmi  30 kgm2 ideal body weight ie with bmi 23 kgm2 was used in the equation whereas amino acid requirements are set to 15 gkg actual body weight in obese patients bmi 30 kgm2  15 gkg ideal body weight ie with bmi 23 kgm2 the principal aim of this empirical protocol is to promptly and pragmatically implement nutritional care in hospitalized non-icu covid-19 patients which would risk being overlooked as a consequence of the current emergency crisis a clear example of this risk is given by the recent guidelines issued by the european society of intensive care medicine and the society of critical care medicine which do not address the issue of nutritional support in critically ill covid-19 patients 49 we are aware of the possible limitations of this approach but we believe that action is much more important than methodological subtlety given the tragic situation we are living in our hospitals systematic weight and height measurement can be difficult or even impossible to perform owing to the lack of scales and in consideration of the hygienic precautions required similarly body composition assessment cannot be regularly performed during the peak of epidemics with many patients admitted to the wards and the associated safety concerns this can obviously limit the accuracy of nutritional assessment and support but it is seems very difficult to us to find a valid alternative to relying on estimated or referred anthropometric values likewise we acknowledge that underfeeding occurs in patients hospitalized for covid-19 for several reasons owing to the emergency scenario and the constantly increasing number of admitted patients assisting even the oldest and most fragile ones during meals is time consuming and distracts health care professionals from taking care of other important procedures also patients relatives are not admitted to the wards hence the accurate monitoring of food intake may be extremely difficult if feasible at all which we believe justifies our straight approach also the pn support may only partially fit the needs of pre-icu covid-19 patients as central infusion lines may be rarely available outside the icu wards and energy requirements are likely to be elevated considering the concurrent severe acute inflammatory state and that the average bmi of covid-19 patients is high 27 kgm2 in our preliminary case histories upon admission furthermore the cardiovascular and pulmonary compliance may limit the infused volume of pn also clinical nutrition units are not widespread in italian hospitals thus specific competences in nutritional care of patients are not available for all italian patients finally also the timely provision and availability of ons en formulas pn bags and enteral and infusion pumps could be problematic in the current scenario nonetheless we believe that every effort should be made to try to avoid or at least limit underfeeding even if it means struggling against objective and often insurmountable difficulties regarding specific nutritional support issues the peculiarity of covid-19 is that it can suddenly require intensive care measures including intubation also in the icu setting nutritional support could become very problematic as new icu wards are progressively being created in emergency circumstances and en tolerance may be incomplete because of gastric distention and erosive gastritis hence different strategies should be considered like the use of supplemental pn or specific high protein-calorie highly digestible enteral formulas enriched in -3 fatty acids or other anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory nutrients the use of -3 fatty acids may be relevant because of their recognized anti-inflammatory properties 50 however their use should be cautiously considered on a case-by-case approach keeping in mind their potential effect on the immune response 51 which may interfere with the currently tested treatments for covid-19 14 clinical research focused on the aforementioned nutritional issues could be decisive for this purpose but the present emergency scenario renders it extremely difficult if not impossible to perform implementing prompt and appropriate nutritional care in covid-19 disease management is a difficult challenge owing to the current dramatic emergency circumstances however all efforts should be made to try to guarantee adequate nutritional support to hospitalized patients as it may be potentially beneficial to clinical outcomes and effective in reducing or preventing the deleterious consequences of malnutrition in this patient population  epidemiological clinical and virological characteristics of 74 cases of

yida yang   the outbreak of novel coronavirus sars-cov-2-infected disease covid-19 began in wuhan hubei province in december 20191 and spread throughout china2 increasing the risk of global dissemination3 although the chinese government provided a quick response and took drastic measures including quarantining wuhan city on january 23 covid-19 has become a major public health threat and economic burden on china on 9 february 2020 the date we finished data collection and started analysis there were a total of 37 251 confirmed 28 942 suspected and 6188 severecritical cases with 812 deaths and 2731 hospital discharges according to official reports from the national health commission the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 in wuhan have been reported elsewhere4 5 with estimated early transmission dynamics presented as the varied basic reproductive numbers r0 of 226 and 2687 indicating a high virus transmission capacity sars-cov-2 was the seventh coronavirus identified with human infection capacity by the chinese authorities its genomic features were revealed in a wuhan patient showing 89 and 82 nuclear acid sequence similarity with bat sars-covzxc21 and human sars-cov8 respectively further functional studies indicated that the spike s protein of 2019-ncov had a high affinity to ace2 which is responsible for the virus invasion9 it is well-known that viral mutations occur during transmission and spreading therefore we would like to know the mutation and transmission ability virulence change and associated clinical features of sars-cov-2 during its spread currently most published data focus on wuhan reporting an approximately 11 fatality rate caused by various complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and acute respiratory failure4 however since wuhan is the original location of the sars-cov-2 outbreak the disease outburst caused a shortage of healthcare resources hence the hospitals only admitted patients with severecritical disease in addition spring festival travel especially train transportation greatly increased the risk of spreading the virus10 therefore it is necessary to explore specific features of covid-19 in areas outside wuhan starting from january 17 sars-cov-2 was first identified in zhejiang province eventually reaching 1117 cases by february 11 with 1054 of cases having a lower severecritical type of covid-19 and zero death cases since the latest study reported the finding of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid in patient faeces11 and single cell analysis revealed the digestive system as a potential route for the virus infection12 it is theoretically plausible that a portion of patients may present with gi tract symptoms we should be very cautious about this speculation since the outpatient centres of gi endoscopy may become high-risk places more formidably doctors serving in these centres may behave less vigilantly with lower levels of protective personal equipment compared with those doctors working in clinics serving those with fevers unknowingly putting the gi practitioners under high exposure risk therefore in this study we provide the first report on the epidemiological clinical and virological characteristics of patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms outside wuhan which is helpful for disease control and medical staff protection a retrospective study investigating the epidemiological clinical and virological characteristics of covid-19 between 17 january 2020 and 8 february 2020 was performed the data were uniformly collected by the health commission of zhejiang province in designated hospitals with all successfully enrolled patients diagnosed as having covid-19 according to who interim guidance13 our preliminary data were reported to the authority of zhejiang province and open for sharing with who written informed consent was waived by the ethics commission of the designated hospital as this study was carried out for emerging infectious disease purposes and is part of a continuing public health outbreak investigation under national authorisation the definition of positive gi symptoms required that the patients have at least one of the following symptoms nausea vomiting and diarrhoea gi symptoms were recorded on admission precluding the influence of other medical therapy and external factors the definition of diarrhoea was the passing of loose stools 3 times per day a stool culture was performed with negative results for all patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms since the diarrhoea was diagnosed on admission those patients had no history of recent antibiotic use therefore clostridium difficile was not detected in the stools patients with covid-19 were divided into four subtypes according to the degree of disease severity based on the diagnosis and treatment scheme for sars-cov-2 of chinese sixth edition the mild type is defined as having slight clinical symptoms without pneumonia on radiography the common type is defined as presenting with fever andor respiratory symptoms plus pneumonia on radiography the severe type was diagnosed according to dyspnoea respiratory rate rr 30 timesmin resting finger oxygen saturation 93 artery pao2fio2300 mm hg 1 mm hg0133 kpa the critical type is defined as respiratory failure with shock and multiorgan failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit icu admission the definition of liver damage was alanine aminotransferase alt 50 ul or aspartate aminotransferase ast 40 ul the incubation period was calculated from the specific date of contact of the confirmed patient with covid-19 to the time of onset of illness epidemiological clinical laboratory therapeutic and outcome data were collected from patients medical records with verification by independent doctors clinical outcomes were followed up to 8 february 2020 when specimens were obtained from throat swabs and sputum for missing or vague data direct communications with attending doctors and other healthcare providers were performed laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 was performed in our hospital and the centre for disease control and prevention of zhejiang provincecity level under authorisation by previously reported real-time rt-pcr5 all patients received chest radiography or ct at admission while other respiratory viruses were

spss v260 was used for all analyses this study enrolled 651 patients with confirmed covid-19 from 17 january 2020 to 8 february 2020 in zhejiang province among which 74 114 patients presented with at least one gi tract symptom nausea vomiting and diarrhoea which was higher than previous wuhan data table 1 in detail of 74 patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms 53 patients had only the symptom of diarrhoea 11 patients had only the symptom of vomiting and 10 patients had only the symptom of nausea in addition only three patients had all the gi symptoms of diarrhoea vomiting and nausea while four patients had the symptoms of both nausea and vomiting diarrhoea was the most common gi symptom in this study and accounted for 814 of the total enrolled 651 patients with covid-19 which was higher than the rate of 38 reported previously14 of 53 patients with covid-19 with diarrhoea the median duration period was 4 days iqr 36 days with the shortest duration of 1 day and longest of 9 days most diarrhoea was self-limiting the average age of the patients with gi symptoms was 46141419 years and the malefemale ratio was 11 there were no coexisting conditions of cancer chronic renal disease pregnancy chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or immunosuppression thirty-eight 5135 patients had a wuhan exposure history and 32 4324 patients had a history of contact with patients with covid-19 intriguingly the rate of chronic liver disease was 1081 in patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms which was significantly higher than that of 295 in those without gi symptoms p0004 more importantly the rate of the severecritical type was also markedly increased in patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms than in those without gi symptoms 2297 vs 814 p0001 family clustering is another pivotal phenomenon of covid-19 we identified that 23 3108 patients with gi symptoms had family clustering which was prominently higher than that in patients without gi symptoms 2045 p0037 twenty-one patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms and 195 without them had definite exposure times with the median calculated incubation period as 4 days iqr 37 days and 5 days iqr 38 days respectively the clinical characteristics of patients with gi symptoms are shown in table 2 fever cough and sputum production were the most common symptoms of the aforementioned symptoms 29 3919 23 3108 8 1081 and 16 2162 patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms had 385c fever fatigue shortness of breath and headache respectively substantially higher than their respective counterparts without gi symptoms of 74 patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms 63 8514 had fever with the highest temperature of 403c additionally 21 patients 2838 lacked respiratory symptoms of coughing and sputum production and presented only with gi symptoms of nausea vomiting and diarrhoea moreover the rate of increased ast but not alt was significantly higher in patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms than in those without gi symptoms 2935 vs 244 p002 finally although most radiographic presentations were similar between patients with covid-19 with and without gi symptoms the rate of unilateral pneumonia was 1216 in patients with gi symptoms much lower than 2322 in those without gi symptoms p0030 concerning infection-related markers there was no significant difference in both procalcitonin and c reactive protein crp between patients with covid-19 with and without gi symptoms as shown in table 3 5 676 13 1757 and 1 135 patient with covid-19 with gi symptoms had complications of ards liver injury and shock respectively where the former two were significantly higher than their counterparts of 208 and 884 in patients with covid-19 without gi symptoms respectively p0034 p0035 all 74 patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms were treated in isolation with supportive and empiric medication while 66 8919 patients received antiviral treatment including interferon- sprays arbidol hydrochloride capsules two tablets three times daily lopinavir and ritonavir two tablets 500 mg twice daily via the oral route furthermore the average time from illness onset to antiviral therapy was 556409 days compared with wuhan data we had lower rates of glucocorticoid and antibiotic use 1486 and 4189 respectively no patients received continuous blood purification due to renal failure and no patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation until now only one patient has died five 676 patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms were treated with mechanical ventilation and transferred to the icu which was a significantly higher rate than that of 208 in the patients with covid-19 without gi symptoms p0034 of severecritical patients with covid-19 2297 presented with gi symptoms in this study when compared with mild and common covid-19 initial univariate analysis of epidemiological clinical and laboratory variables identified 11 significantly changed risk factors for severecritical covid-19 including increased ors of age age 50 years period between illness onset and hospital visit sputum production any existing medical condition multiple lung infection alt lactate dehydrogenase ldh glucose and crp as well as decreased or of the infected area online supplementary table 1 based on these variables further multivariate analysis using the forward method was performed and we found that sputum production of patients from infected areas such as wuhan and increased ldhglucose levels were the independent risk factors for severecritical covid-19 in patients with gi symptoms table 4 zj01 is a strain of sars-cov-2 with 29 381 bases the results of the potential methylation sites of s protein sequences of sars wuhan-hu-1 and zj01 indicated that there were significant differences between sars-cov-2 and sars these coronaviruses can infect host cells through using the s protein to bind to the host cell surface receptor ace2 during virus maturation s proteins are glycosylated and divided into the parts s1 and s2 s1 is spherical and mainly involved in the recognition and binding of viruses to host cells s2 is stalked and able to promote the fusion of the virus into host cells the comparison results of three virus strains showed that zj01 and wuhan-hu-1 had one high-confidence site two moderate-confidence sites and four low-confidence sites sars has three high-confidence sites three moderate-confidence sites and five low-confidence sites from the perspective of high-confidence sites figure 1a red arrow the potential methylation points of sars-cov-2 n1 and sars n3 are predominantly concentrated in the s1 and s2 segments of the s protein the positions of two low-confidence sites and one medium-confidence site on s2 are relatively fixed among the three virus strains blue arrow these results suggest that the s proteins of the two viruses may have structural and functional differences due to m6a methylation during transcription and translation additionally the results of gene sequence alignment figure 1b showed that the variation in s protein sequences between zj01 and wuhan-hu-1 was subtle and these variations were highly concentrated in the s2 segment these variations resulted in five amino acid substitutions and two amino acid deletions however from the perspective of the simulated three-dimensional protein structure the effect of these variations on the overall s protein structure is relatively limited the difference between sars-cov-2 and sars is significant especially at the specific recognition point position in segment s1 figure 1c red circle on the one hand this change may affect the viral binding force on host cells on the other hand the electrostatic changes between zj01 and wuhan-hu-1 are largely concentrated in the mutation zone of s2 figure 1c green ellipse where the detailed mechanisms need further exploration the national spread and global sporadic appearance of sars-cov-2 have become an enormous threat to human beings and the threat is not restricted to china an endeavour has been made by scientists to reveal the epidemiological clinical and virological characteristics of sars-cov-2 with over 30 publications published in pubmed by 5 february 20202 47 nevertheless most of these studies focused on the situation in wuhan china in addition the initiative for sars-cov-2 screening started from fever clinics while fever cough and shortness of breath were the most emphasised symptoms which increases the risk of omitting those patients with other symptoms and normal body temperature it is theoretically plausible that one characteristic of a viral spread is an increased transmission capacity at the cost of decreased virulence which is also true for sars-cov-215 therefore caution should be exercised for suspected patients with covid-19 who had normal body temperatures and visited various outpatient clinics for non-respiratory symptoms the suspected patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhoea should be seriously considered since accumulated evidence supports sars-cov-2 transmission through faeces11 and tears16 and its ability to bind to ace2 of the gi tract has been identified9 12 in this study we reported the epidemiological clinical and virological features of 74 patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms from zhejiang province to our knowledge this is the first report that describes the situation of patients with covid-19 gi symptoms and is the largest group of cases outside wuhan our novel findings are valuable for disease prevention by emphasising suspected patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms and their specific clinical characteristics among the 651 total patients with covid-19 we investigated the rate of patients with gi symptoms was 114 which is higher than in the previously reported data of 3 from wuhan4 however a recent report from wuhan revealed that 101 experienced nauseadiarrhoea and 36 vomiting17 additionally the latest data from wuhan revealed that 791 of patients with covid-19 presented gi symptoms but such data were collected during 110 days after illness onset and reported in a chinese domestic journal18 differing from our strategy of collecting gi symptom data on admission that may be less biassed by various influencing factors including drugs more importantly nationwide data showed gi symptoms in 87 of 1099 confirmed patients with sars-cov-214 reinforcing our data all these data indicated that there were symptom changes in patients with covid-19 we suspect that sars-cov-2 may cause acute gastritis and enteritis as evidenced by the vomiting nausea and diarrhoea since previous studies indicated high ace2 expression in the gi tract we envision that such a change indicates the potential of virus mutation towards increased transmissibility decreased virulence and multiorgan infection as reflected in the clinics of increased r0 and infection routes taken together the patients with covid-19 showed an increased tendency to present with gi symptoms in dissemination increasing infection risk in healthcare providers who were treating suspected patients with covid-19 without respiratory symptoms and fever we further analysed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms we identified a significantly higher rate of 385c fever and family clustering increased complications of ards and a high severity tendency rate of severecritical type mechanical ventilation and icu admission in patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms when compared with those without gi symptoms we suspect that gi symptoms may cause patients with covid-19 to be more prone to electrolyte disturbance such as significantly decreased serum sodium levels p0016 and hence they trend towards the severecritical type of the disease other reasons should be considered and explored based on future data in addition the higher rates of familial clustering may be related to faecal shedding in shared toilets in households further multivariate analysis revealed sputum production from infected areas and increased ldhglucose levels as independent risk factors for the disease in addition symptoms of fatigue shortness of breath and headache were also significantly higher in patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms which may be caused by their higher fevers and increased electrolyte imbalance liver damage should be carefully monitored as we found significantly increased ast levels and coexisting conditions of liver disease in patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms since the ratio of chronic liver disease was higher in patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms it could lead to increased levels of alt and ast although there were no significant differences in glucocorticoid and antibiotic therapy between patients with covid-19 with and without gi symptoms they were both lower than their counterparts in wuhan4 showing our own experience in effective therapy the change and mutation of sars-cov-2 are the basis of its variation in epidemiological and clinical features using in-depth bioinformatics analysis of the novel identified sars-cov-2 sequence from zhejiang province we identified many m6a methylation sites in the s1 segment of zj01 and s2 segment of sars indicating that the s proteins of the two viruses may have structural and functional differences due to m6a methylation the addition of chemical modifications is critical to many steps of mrna processing and fate regulation while the most abundant internal modification is n6-methyladenosin19 20 given the wide prevalence of m6a modification on cellular mrna it is not surprising that a number of viruses contain m6a in their rna21 22 the function of m6a methylation on viruses may be diverse with both proviral and antiviral roles23 24 coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses containing the largest single-stranded positive-sense rna genome with a length between 255 and 32 kb25 in contrast to previously reported m6a modification in viruses methylation at the n7 position of the 5-cap structure of coronavirus rna is commonly identified which facilitates viral rna escape recognition by the host innate immune system26 therefore our findings on the novel m6a methylation situation in sars-cov-2 may provide a novel mechanism for further study a large reservoir of sars-like bat coronavirus has the capacity to efficiently use the human ace2 receptor for docking replication and entry27 ace2 is predominantly expressed in human alveolar cells and intestinal epithelial cells the binding force change is caused by the sequence mutation of sars-cov-2 which merits further investigation we found that the electrostatic changes between zj01 and wuhan-hu-1 were highly concentrated in the mutation zone of s2 the portion of s protein which promotes the fusion of the virus into host cells therefore further studies exploring the underlining mechanisms for these conformations and binding force changes are urgently needed these may help explain the increased gi symptoms in the later phase of this virus outbreak and their novel epidemiologicalclinical features this study has several limitations first it is better to obtain the outcomes and more detailed therapeutic responses in a cohort study of patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms second although the risk factors for the severecritical type of covid-19 were identified according to patient data on admission there is still a lack of a predictive model for disease progression third cytokine storm is common in coronavirus28 and reported in a previous sars-cov-2 study5 thus it would be better if we could also detect cytokine changes in this study fourth it will have more clinical relevance to propose an effective strategy for identifying patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms who lack the typical symptoms such as fever and cough in the early stage according to our experience we should pay more attention to exposure history and family clustering during the screening process fifth it would be meaningful to investigate the correlation between the viral genome and gi symptoms finally since over 50 of sars-cov-2 was detected in the faeces according to one study29 the prevalence of viral rna from faeces samples in patients with gi symptoms should be compared with those in patients without gi symptoms in the future moreover because of the relatively low detection rate for virus in the stool three of nine patients with covid-19 positive in our hospital and rare stool samples were re-tested for the virus in patients after their recovery in this study it is difficult to evaluate the implications of faecal-oral transmission so this needs further investigation in summary we reported for the first time the largest cases of patients with covid-19 with gi symptoms outside wuhan and showed its novel characteristics of increased family clustering and liver injury severecritical tendency and higher rate of body temperature 385c global authorities should pay more attention to patients with covid-19 with gi and other non-classic symptoms and remain cautious in health provider protection  coronavirus update related to the current outbreak of covid-19 giovanni gabutti erica danchera federica sandri marta savio armando stefanati

 coronaviruses covs are a large family of respiratory viruses that can cause mild to moderate diseases ranging from the common cold to severe respiratory syndromes 1 these viruses are common in many animal species and in some cases albeit rarely they can evolve and infect humans and then spread to the population 2 most of the numerous human pathogenic coronaviruses are associated with mild clinical symptoms with two notable exceptions severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers sars is caused by a virus that emerged in southern china in november 2002 and led to  8000 human infections and 774 deaths in 37 countries in the 20022003 period 3 mers is related to a virus detected for the first time in saudi arabia in 2012 responsible for 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and 858 deaths since september 2012 4 in december 2019 some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically linked to a new coronavirus in the province of hubei in china in the following days a possible association with the huanan fish market in wuhan was identified in fact most of the initially identified patients had visited worked at or lived near this market in the month preceding the infection in early january a new coronavirus tentatively called 2019-ncov was isolated and interhuman transmission was confirmed 5 on february 11 2020 the world health organization who officially named the new coronavirus 2019 infection coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 6 subsequently the coronavirus study group csg of the international taxonomy committee of viruses ictv officially classified the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 7 this article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors coronaviruses covs are rna viruses belonging to the subfamily of the coronavirinae coronaviridae family order nidovirales 8 their definition is related to the fact that covs are virions with projections resembling a crown all covs share similarities in organization and genomic expression with 16 non-structural proteins and at least 4 structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n proteins 9 they are divided into four genera alphacov betacov gammacov and deltacov 10 covs can infect different hosts and have a different tissue tropism generally alphacovs and betacovs infect mammals while gammacovs and deltacovs infect other animals such as birds fishes and only a few mammals 8 table 1 seven human covs are known to date common worldwide the first ones were identified in the mid-1960s others more recently 9 the human covs are 229e alfacov nl63 alfacov oc43 betacov hku1 betacov mers-cov betacov which causes mers sars-cov betacov which causes sars and 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 11 in the past 20 years two major human cov epidemics have occurred sars and mers both viruses infect the lower airways and cause severe respiratory syndromes in humans other covs have a global distribution with a seasonality characterized by a peak in winter and in spring and few cases in summer 10 the sars epidemic began in 2002 starting from the town of foshan in the chinese province of guangdong and then spread globally involving 33 countries in 5 different continents more than 8000 cases were recognized 21 in health workers with a case fatality rate cfr of almost 10 3 and a basic reproduction number r0 equal to 23 12 in humans the incubation period ranges between 2 and 10 days and interhuman transmission is very effective which is why the delay of 3 months between the beginning of the epidemic and the first investigations has allowed a worldwide spread of the virus the bat was identified as the natural reservoir of sars-cov and the civet as the intermediate host 13 despite active surveillance no more sars cases have been recognized since july 2003 3 mers was first identified in 2012 from then until january 16 2020 2521 cases were reported worldwide these include 919 deaths with a cfr of 36 4 and an estimated r0 of 07 12 most cases were found in the arabian peninsula and approximately 84 in saudi arabia 4 however the virus was isolated in 27 countries 10 and all patients outside the arabian peninsula had a travel history to or a contact with someone who had traveled to this region 4 in humans the incubation period ranges between 2 and 14 days and unlike sars interhuman transmission is limited the virus is not easily transmitted from person to person unless a close contact occurs the bat was also identified as an animal reservoir for the mers-cov while the intermediate host was the camel 13 both sars and mers have a broad spectrum of clinical pictures ranging from flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards age and comorbidities are prognostic predictors sars mainly involved healthy young adults while half of mers cases were identified in subjects  50 years of age the clinical picture at hospital admission is characterized by fever cough dyspnea and myalgia in both sars and mers atypical symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting are common in both syndromes 10 on december 31 2019 the who chinese office was informed about some cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in the city of wuhan located in the chinese province of hubei 14 on january 3 2020 a new coronavirus was isolated from the bronchial wash samples of a patient from wuhan and was identified as the pathogen responsible for pneumonia 15 on january 11 and 12 2020 the who received further details and information from the chinese national health commission regarding the possible association of this epidemic with exposure in a fish market in wuhan and the chinese authorities shared the genetic sequence of a new coronavirus subsequently identified as sars-cov-2 14 new evidence shows the relation between sars-cov-2 and other covs that are circulating in bats specifically in rhinolophus bats 16 these subspecies are abundant in southern china and asia the middle east africa and europe the mode of transmission to humans is still unclear bats are rare in chinese markets however they are captured and sold directly to restaurants as food the most recent hypothesis is that there is an intermediate animal host that has played a role in the new sars-cov-2 infection 6 several animals have been considered as possible hosts including pangolins 17 identifying the animal source of this new virus would help to prevent other new infections and to understand the initial dynamics of spreading in the wuhan market in this regard strengthening the control of food and hygiene within live animal markets is essential to prevent future new zoonosis 6 the mechanism of sars-cov-2 infection is not yet known the key to human transmission is the ability of the virus to bind to human cells covs use the spike protein to bind to cells and it seems that sars-cov-2 as sars-co virus uses the same receptor for the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 ace2 5 13 a recent study showed that the binding affinity between the viral receptor-binding domain rbd and the host receptor ace2 in the initial viral attachment step determines the host susceptibility to sars-cov-2 the greater transmissibility of sars-cov-2 than sars-cov is partly explained by the fact that due to a higher affinity the binding capacity of viral rbd increases and the number of viruses required to infect a cell is reduced 18 sars-cov-2 appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways where it replicates causing radiologic evidence of pneumonia in patients without any particular clinical symptoms 19 usually the interhuman transmission of covs occurs through different pathways that include droplets direct contact and indirect contact through surfaces 13 the virus has also been isolated in serum blood rectal swabs saliva urine and stool 18 fecal-oral transmission has not yet been proven 20 21 a recent study indicates that the highest viral load is found immediately after the onset of symptoms and in greater quantities in the nose rather than in the throat this analysis suggests that the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus resembles that of influenza more than that of sars the viral load found in asymptomatic subjects was similar to that of symptomatic ones this suggests the potential transmission role of asymptomatic subjects 22 despite several uncertainties the evidence indicates that the cfr for hospitalized covid-19 patients is substantially lower than that for hospitalized sars mers and 2009 pandemic flu h1n1 patients 4 28 65 and 9 respectively taking into account covid-19 and influenza pandemic and seasonal it is important to carefully consider the differences in definition of cases as these are relevant for cfr estimation 18 the r0 has been estimated between 2 and 3 18 and the risk assessment calculated by who is very high for the whole world 23 as of march 10 2020 there were 113702 confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 infection in the world with 4125 new cases in the last 24 h in china the country with the highest number of confirmed cases 80924 occurred of which 20 were within 24 h with 3140 total deaths 17 new in the last 24 h 23 the first case of sars-cov-2 laboratory-confirmed infection outside china was reported on january 13 2020 in thailand 14 as of march 10 2020 outside china there were 32778 confirmed cases and 872 deaths and 109 countries were involved 23 in the western pacific region the countries with the highest number of cases were republic of korea 7513 japan 514 and singapore 160 23 in the european region italy counted 9172 cases thus it was the second country with the most cases after china france germany and spain reported 1402 1139 and 1024 cases respectively while another 44 countries reported  400 cases 23 in the eastern mediterranean region iran was the country with the highest number of cases 7161 23 in the usa 472 cases were reported 23 of note 696 cases including 7 deaths were reported in subjects on a cruise ship that had been anchored in japanese territorial waters 23 several clinical pictures have been associated with sars-cov-2 infection they range from mild malaise to death which occurs from sepsis andor ards early recognition of the clinical picture is essential to promptly start the adequate preventive measures and supportive treatments to avoid spreading of the virus and possible complications in patients 19 table 2 it seems that covid-19 presents with three worsening clinical pictures that evolve in few days at the onset a slight malaise with symptoms of the upper respiratory tract subsequently a mild pneumonia that can later worsen with a picture of ards 19 several retrospective studies show that hospitalization generally takes place on the 7th day after the onset of the symptoms fever fatigue and dry cough with dyspnea 1 15 other possible symptoms are myalgia headache anorexia pharyngodynia and gastrointestinal complaints with diarrhea many patients developed multiorgan dysfunction radiologic signs of bilateral pneumonia with ards and acute renal failure furthermore mental confusion may occur 15 the incubation period lasts up to 14 days 45 days as median incubation period 12 18 recently the chinese center for disease control and prevention ccdc has published a work on a series of cases currently the most numerous in the literature concerning mainland china updated on february 11 2020 healthcare workers represent 38 of cases 148 of these have been confirmed as serious or critical cases 24 25 as for the distribution by age 1 8 and 87 of cases were registered in young subjects  10 years and between 10 and 19 years of age young adults aged between 20 and 29 years and adults and elderly people age range 3079 years respectively elderly patients aged  80 years represented 3 of cases regarding the spectrum of the disease 81 14 and 5 of cases were affected by a medium intensity severe and critical form respectively 24 25 table 3 according to these data the overall cfr rate is 23 in detail cfr was equal to 8 and 148 in subjects aged between 70 and 79 years and in patients aged  80 years respectively no subject  9 years of age died no deaths have been registered in subjects suffering from mild or medium intensity forms while cfr was equal to 49 in critical cases 24 25 table 3 notably cfr was high in subjects with comorbidities in detail cfr was equal to 105 73 63 60 and 56 for cardiovascular diseases diabetes chronic respiratory diseases hypertension and tumors respectively 24 25 table 3 in conclusion people  60 years of age and patients with comorbidities most of all cardiovascular diseases have a greater risk for a more severe clinical picture and for fatal outcome furthermore deaths occurred only in critical cases fortunately covid-19 seems to be relatively rare in children whose clinical picture is often mild 18 according to another chinese study the median age of patients is 56 years with a slightly higher percentage in males 543 males vs 457 females intensive care unit icu admission was needed in 26 of subjects and 43 of them died of multiorgan failure once more the worst clinical pictures refer to elderly subjects with comorbidities such as diabetes high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases 15 inter-human transmission was considered for 41 of patients the infection seems related to previous exposure to the huanan fish market in 87 of cases family members in 123 and healthcare workers in 29 15 according to another study some cases have also been reported in children aged 111 months the clinical picture was less severe than in adults with fever and mild respiratory infections as prevalent symptoms the transmission was mainly intra-familiar or through contacts with visitors to the huanan market 26 a recent study analyzed nine pregnant women with sars-cov-2 pneumonia their clinical picture was similar to that of non-pregnant women affected by the virus in all cases a cesarean delivery was done and no vertical transmission has been documented therefore it can be assumed that there is no evidence of vertical transmission during the third trimester of pregnancy 27 the diagnosis and confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection are carried out by specific tests recommended by who that are described on a dedicated webpage 28 the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc also provided a specific webpage on laboratory support by a coronavirus-specialized laboratory in the european union 29 any person satisfying the criteria of a suspected case table 2 should be tested for sars-cov-2 and when possible samples from both the lower respiratory tract bronchoalveolar lavage endotracheal aspirate expectorated sputum and upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swab oropharyngeal swab nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasal wash should be collected 29 according to a recent chinese study collecting specimens from different sites could be useful to improve the sensitivity and reduce false-negative test results this study highlights that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens showed the highest positive rates followed by sputum nasal swabs bronchial biopsy pharyngeal swabs feces and blood 30 to date there is no specific therapy for covid-19 patients with covid-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms and for severe cases treatment should include care to support vital organ functions 31 32 several randomized clinical trials rcts are currently underway not yet published which are testing different therapies for covid-19 one of the drugs normally used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis targets the interleukin 6 receptor and has been included in the covid-19 treatment guidelines issued by the chinese national health commission 33 34 in addition several rcts are underway regarding the use of antiviral drugs for the treatment of covid-19 32 3538 finally a recent study evaluates the use of plasma from convalescent patients with previous sars-cov-2 infection as a potential therapeutic treatment 39 another study shows that the use of systemic corticosteroids for covid-19 is not recommended 40 the advent of covid-19 is unquestionably reminiscent of previous sars and mers epidemics the increase in the number of cases and expansion of geographical areas have revealed issues regarding the future management of the infection on march 11 2020 the who declared covid-19 a pandemic 41 at the beginning efforts were made by the chinese government to limit the spread of the virus such as suspension of public transport closure of airports 42 cancellation of the lunar new year celebrations and closure of parks and cinemas a ban on the wild animal trade within china was declared on january 26 2020 12 as the number of cases increased more drastic containment measures were applied in china up to the suspension of all non-essential activities these measures appear to have slowed the progression of sars-cov-2 infections in china as can be seen from the progressive decrease in incidence in wuhan 23 since the beginning the who and the emergency committee under international health regulations have stressed chinas need to strengthen screening of exits from affected areas in general evidence in the peer-reviewed literature does not support entry screening as an effective measure for detecting infected travelers especially when symptoms of the disease are very commonaspecific and the seasonal flu activity in europe and china is ongoing however some imported cases of covid-19 in asian countries have been detected through entry screening procedures at the destination airports 12 one of the screening methods for covid-19 is the measurement of body temperature although current evidence shows that this method is not effective in controlling disease transmission 18 as of march 10 2020 who believes that restrictive measures for travelers and the exchange of goods must be proportional to the risk to public health with the minimum duration possible and daily updates accordingly on the available epidemiology 43 currently the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc has increased the level of traveler health alert and recommends avoiding non-essential travel 44 other countries are considering implementing restrictions for people traveling from and to the most affected countries since the beginning of the pandemic the who has developed a strategy and response plan to contain the impact of covid-19 the main points included in this plan are related to blocking the chain of transmission working on patients as well as close contacts identifying and reducing transmission from animal sources developing correct and scientifically sound risk communication and controlling the social and economic impact of the pandemic as much as possible to minimize it through multisectoral partnerships 6 the ecdc taking into account the evolving epidemiologic situation considers five possible scenarios from 0 to 4 the objective is to avoid the health system disruption and to limit the impact of the pandemic as much as possible 18 table 4 crucial general preventive measures should include rigorous hand hygiene avoiding coughing andor sneezing without covering the mouth and the use of disposable tissues to mechanically block droplets 18 the who recommends hand washing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based solutions 45 the use of surgical face masks can reduce the risk of infection transmission masks should be used by subjects with respiratory symptoms there is no evidence of the usefulness of face masks by healthy subjects besides their use can be related to an increased risk due to a false sense of safety 18 isolation of symptomatic subjects can be considered to reduce transmission patients suspected or confirmed should be asked to wear a surgical mask to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets considered the most likely route of transmission 18 currently many countries are considering or have already implemented relevant social measures such as school closures smart working and cancelling meetings sports and cultural events social distancing is essential it implies avoiding shaking hands and kissing use of public and crowded means of transportation and gatherings of people 18 strict compliance with all these measures is essential to lower the spread of infection to gain time to identify adequate therapeutic options and to design and hopefully develop a vaccine 18 italy is now the second country in the world in terms of case numbers 23 the first cases occurred in some areas of lombardy and the veneto regions and then spread all over the country as of march 9 2020 considering that new cases of covid-19 registered in italy had started to increase considerably and national restrictive measures had not yet been put in place the council of ministers issued a decree law with measures to prohibit access to and exit from the country as well as suspension of all the activities that were not strictly necessary 46 47 the current italian situation confirms that a local outbreak once started can quickly spread and have a huge impact on the most vulnerable citizens mainly elderly subjects with comorbidities 18 although to date no sars-cov-2 bloodborne transmission has been documented the national blood center of the national institute of health iss has activated precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 from blood donors 48 ecdc reports that as of march 2 2020 the risk of covid-19 infection in europe is currently moderate to high and can change it should be considered that the transmission chain has not always been identified and that the epidemiologic situation is constantly evolving 18 the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus represents a global health emergency involving the health authorities of all countries especially since the pandemic state was declared many aspects of the infection have been studied available epidemiologic clinical and impact data have made it possible to outline preventive interventions that have been shared internationally unfortunately the spread of the virus is ongoing and the impact of the infection is still growing despite the application of preventive interventions which in some contexts are very restrictive the impact of the infection is evident not only from a clinical but also from an economic point of view the considerable cost in terms of infecteddead health workers who operate on the front line and as such are particularly exposed to the risk of infection should not be underestimated 25 strict observance of the rules issued by the who and the other international bodies eg cdc ecdc etc is essential as we need to understand the dynamics of virus spread in more detail identify new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and develop a vaccine reasonably quickly the international effort is enormous and hopefully will allow preventing further spreading of the virus 42  considerations for bedside urologic procedures in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 colby souders p hanson zhao a ackerman lenore   the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has profoundly impacted the practice of urology in fundamental waysmost elective surgeries are on hold outpatient visits are shifting to telehealth and protocols for in-person visits have been significantly modified1 according to the centers for disease control and prevention covid-net data 745 of hospitalized sars-cov-2 patients are 50 years or older and 544 are male2 given these demographics patients hospitalized with sars-cov-2 are likely to have urologic conditions previously diagnosed or undiagnosed in addition 42 of patients in the intensive care unit require invasive mechanical ventilation necessitating sedation and foley catheter insertion3
 inpatient urologic consultations are very common 26 of which will result in bedside procedures4 in the first few weeks of the current outbreak roughly 20-25 of urologic consults at our institution have been for patients with confirmed or suspected sars-cov-2 although this percentage may change over time bedside procedures performed for these patients have included difficult foley placement bedside cystoscopy suprapubic tube exchanges incision and drainage of scrotal and perineal abscesses and gross hematuria with clot retention as the number of patients hospitalized with sars-cov-2 continues to increase we anticipate growth in urologic consults and bedside procedures for infected patients we queried urologic trainees and attending physicians at our institution who are familiar with existing safety recommendations and guidelines regarding the care of infected patients regarding their experiences this data was compiled to summarize an expert consensus on best practices for bedside procedures for sars-cov-2 positive patients our aim is to share our experiences performing bedside urologic procedures on sars-cov-2-positive patients and offer considerations to maximize the safety of the patients and providers involved and conserve supplies while maintaining a high standard of care to decrease the amount of time providers and patients spend together in close contact we support telehealth for the initial evaluation of inpatient consults for patients who do not require a bedside procedure or for whom physical exam would be unlikely to change treatment an in-person evaluation is deferred for patients who require an exam or procedure the history and any procedural consent can be obtained prior to intervention to reduce the duration of potential exposure for both provider and patient and minimize the usage of personal protective equipment ppe for procedural interventions a decision needs to be made as to whether it should be performed in the operating room or at the bedside this will largely depend on the type of procedure need for anesthesia patients health status availability of resources and the providers comfort level given the risk of aerosolization with intubation increased ppe consumption in the operating room and potential for exposure of additional operating room staff we suggest attempting bedside interventions whenever possible for bedside procedures we suggest judicious use of ppe for providers during the procedure but recommendations may vary by institution if not ventilated the patient should wear a surgical mask other forms of barrier protection can be considered on an individual basis as urine does not appear to contain sars-cov-25 a face shield or eye protection to protect against gross contamination is advisable but not specific to coronavirus-infected patients we also recommend collecting all supplies that may be needed outside the patients room but only those that will definitely be used should be taken inside initially the rest should be left outside to avoid unnecessary contamination a second person a nurse or colleague familiar with the supplies should be enlisted to help and remain outside the room to remain in contact with the primary provider the provider may require a hands-free headset or speakerphone within the room to facilitate easy communication this assistant can pass additional supplies into the room as needed or obtain other instruments from other treatment areas to keep the patients door closed as much as possible we recommend the assistant transfer additional supplies under the door or through a crack in the door onto a small table in the patients room avoiding direct handoff to the contaminated provider it also reduces excessive donning and doffing of ppe expedites the procedure and decreases time in the patients room once the procedure is complete contaminated supplies should be disposed of in the patients room for men we typically bring 18fr coud and 12fr silicone catheters in addition to a foley kit with lubrication bag and water syringe for balloon inflation as well as lidocaine jelly into the patient room for an initial attempt we also leave a glide wire and council-tip catheter outside the room in case the first two attempts at catheter placement are unsuccessful it is also useful to have irrigation supplies available including saline and a catheter-tipped syringe if these maneuvers are unsuccessful we proceed to bedside cystoscopy after a catheter has been successfully placed we recommend discharging patients home with the catheter to follow up in the outpatient setting in several weeks this allows for complete recovery prior to attempting another void trial our bedside cystoscopy cart is stocked with a wide variety of catheters a light source several types of wires dilators a cystoscope saline bags and irrigation tubing however we cannot bring the entire cart into the room of a patient with sars-cov-2 due to the risk of contamination of the entire cart and its supplies we have instead created makeshift carts with only a single light source light cord flexible cystoscope saline bag and irrigation tubing this makeshift cart with a single guide wire and council-tip catheter are brought into the patients room while other types of wires catheters and dilators are left outside as backup a portable monitor is also highly recommended both to reduce the risk of possible facial contamination with body fluids during direct visualization to improve the difficulties of visualization through an eyepiece when wearing appropriate eyeface protection after the procedure is complete the cystoscope is cleaned per institutional protocol placed inside a biohazard bag and sent to sterile processing the entire cart and light source are sanitized once inside the room and then additionally outside the patients room all supplies should be brought into the room including local anesthetic and either sutures or hemostatic agents in case bleeding is encountered the patient should be taught early on how to manage the wound and packing for larger defects the benefits and risks of negative pressure wound therapy are clear prior to this pandemic but should be considered on a case-by-case basis for sars-cov-2 patients while it would allow for less frequent dressing changes and faster closure of larger wounds there may be an increased need for troubleshooting of leaks in addition it is unknown if negative pressure can lead to aerosolization of viral particles for patients with sars-cov-2 and gross hematuria it is critical again to ensure adequate irrigation fluid and supplies are obtained prior to beginning the procedure we have a low threshold to then initiate continuous bladder irrigation cbi to reduce the need for manual irrigations and prevent unnecessary exposures for nursing staff it is important to initially irrigate out as much clot burden as possible to prevent possible clot obstruction of the catheter to allow for easier monitoring and titration of continuous irrigation flow from a distance it is important to set up the irrigation fluid tubing and catheter bag to be easily visible we recommend ensuring that adequate gravity drainage is present throughout the system and securing all tubes to prevent migration or kinking to avoid the need for difficult troubleshooting after the procedure for men we also routinely inflate the retention balloon to 30 cc with light catheter traction for a limited period if these patients need an endoscopic fulguration procedure spinal anesthesia may reduce the amount of aerosolization outlined above are our experiences with inpatient consultations and bedside procedures in sars-cov-2 patients and how we have attempted to address urologic challenges that have emerged with this pandemic please review these suggested protocols within your department and relevant hospital administrators prior to implementing we recognize that while there is tremendous variation in how different regions have been affected by this pandemic we have no doubt urologists will have a prominent role helping manage these patients throughout the country  coronavirus contact tracing evaluating the potential of using bluetooth received signal strength for proximity detection douglas leith j stephen farrell  we report on measurements of

use of mobile apps to facilitate covid-19 contact tracing this is motivated by the hope that more efficient and scalable contact tracing might allow the lockdown measures currently in place in many countries to be relaxed more quickly 1  in this report we take a first step in evaluating the potential for using bluetooth low energy le received signal strength to detect periods of close contact between people we present measurements taken on mobile handsets in a variety of common real-world settings we also measure the effect on received signal strength caused by the human body by different types of indoor wall the relative orientation of mobile handsets and so on the basic idea of a contact tracing app is that if two people carrying mobile handsets installed with the app spend significant time in close proximity to one another eg spending 15 minutes within 2 metres 1  then the apps on their handsets will both record this contact event if subsequently one of these people is diagnosed with covid-19 then the contact events logged on that persons handset in the recent past eg over the last two weeks are used to identify people who have been in close contact with the infected person these people might then be made aware of the contact and advised to self-isolate or take other appropriate precautions for this approach to be effective it is of course necessary that the app can accurately detect contact events almost all modern handsets are equipped with bluetooth le wireless technology and there is currently much interest in using this as the means for detecting contact events the singapore tracetogether contact tracing app 2   tracetogether uses the bluetooth le received signal strength to estimate proximity and likely the applegoogle api will do the same in general a radio signal tends to get weaker as it gets further from the transmitter since the transmit power is spread over a greater area bluetooth le devices can be configured to transmit beacons at regular intervals and the idea is that the signal strength with which a beacon is received provides a rough measure of the distance between transmitter and receiver namely when the received signal strength is sufficiently high then this may indicate a contact event and conversely when the received signal strength is sufficiently low then this may indicate that the handsets are not in close proximity however the propagation of radio signals in practice is often complex especially in indoor environments where walls floors ceiling furniture etc can absorbreflect radio waves and so change the received signal strength a persons body also absorbs bluetooth le radio signals so that the received signal strength can be substantially reduced if their body lies on the path between the transmitter and receiver with this in mind we report here on measurements of bluetooth le received signal strength taken on mobile handsets in a variety of common real-world settings a key difficulty in evaluating proximity detection accuracy in real-world settings is establishing ground truth ie recording when contact events actually happened this ground truth is needed so that the contact events flagged by a contact tracing app can be compared against the actual contact events and so allow the accuracy of the app at detecting contact events to be assessed to address this we generally adopt a scenario-based approach for example we take measurements as two people walk a circuit in city streets side by side while maintaining a 1 metre distance between them this has the great advantage that i ground truth is clear to within experimental error eg people will not be able to maintain an exactly 1 metre distance while walking and ii data is collected in real-world settings with all their associated complexity the disadvantage of course is that this limits our study to fairly simple well structured scenarios however by selecting scenarios that aim to capture some of the key elements in common activities we can still gain useful insight into the real-world performance of bluetooth le received signal strength for proximity detection we present measurements for four real-world scenarios people walking outdoors in city streets people sitting around a meeting table people sitting in a train carriage and people grocery shopping in a supermarket in addition we present supporting measurements evaluating the impact of the relative orientation of handsets on received signal strength and on the signal attenuation caused by the human body by a womans handbag and by different types of indoor wall in summary we find that i the bluetooth le received signal strength can vary substantially depending on the relative orientation of handsets and on absorption by the human body this means that for example the received signal strength is considerably higher when people are walking side by side compared to when they walk one behind the other at the same distance similarly we find that when people are sitting around a meeting table with their phones in their trouser pockets the received signal strength is low even when the people are sitting less than 1m apart when they place their phones on the table the received signal strength is much increased we also find that ii within complex indoor environments the received signal strength need not decrease with distance and indeed may increase with distance recall that we generally expect signal strength to decrease with increasing distance not to increase for example for two people walking around a large supermarket we find that the received signal strength is much the same when they walk close together and when they walk 2m apart we observe increases in signal strength with increasing distance within a domestic house and within a train carriage on a more positive note we find that iii outdoors the received signal strength indeed tends to decrease with increasing distance thus facilitating proximity detection also that blockwork walls strongly attenuate bluetooth le radio signals and so leakage of these signals between adjacent housesbuildings is likely to be small while we consider a much wider range of real-world scenarios and our focus is on contact tracing our observations are consistent with previous measurement studies on the use of bluetooth for proximity detection for other purposes for example 6  7  8  9 in the context of measuring social interaction and 10  11  12 in the context of indoor localisation these previous studies have generally found simple thresholding of received signal strength to be highly error prone and therefore found it necessary to use machine learning methods trained on data collected from the particular environment of interest in order to obtain accuate proximity detection these methods depend upon the availability of ground truth data and the ability of the developed methods to generalise beyond the specific setting considered is not clear this suggests that the development of accurate methods for proximity detection based on bluetooth le received signal strength is likely to be challenging apps based on bluetooth le are therefore probably not a panacea but rather are best viewed as a potentially useful addition to existing contact tracing methods our measurements also suggest that combining use of bluetooth le contact tracing apps with adoption of new social protocols 2 may yield benefits although this requires further investigation for example placing phones on the table during meetings is likely to simplify proximity detection using received signal strength similarly carrying handbags with phones placed close to the outside surface in locations where the complexity of signal propagation makes proximity detection using received signal strength problematic one might consider logging entry toexit from the area in an app this would allow the bluetooth data collected in that area to be flagged as being less reliable hopefully reducing the rate of contact tracing errors logging of entryedit might for example be achieved by scanning a time-varying qr code tapping a handset on a near-field tag similar to contactless payment or by placing a dedicated bluetooth beaconing device at the entryexit point whose beacons can be logged 3  bluetooth low energy le was standardised in 2010 the low energy moniker refers to the reduced drain on the device battery compared to the older bluetooth classic technology the first mobile handsets using bluetooth le appeared in 2011-12 eg the iphone 4s and today almost all modern handsets come equipped with it bluetooth le operates in the same 24ghz unlicensed radio band as wifi and other devices including microwave ovens bluetooth le devices advertise their presence by periodically typically once per second broadcasting short beacon messages to mitigate the effects of interference from other users of the 24ghz band each beacon is broadcast simultaneously on three widely spaced radio channels each beacon essentially consists of a short fixed preamble followed by a small beacon payload the payload contains an identifier of the device making the boadcast in modern devices this identifier is usually randomised and changes frequently to improve privacy plus a short message generally up to 31 bytes long this message is typically used to indicate that the beacon is associated with a particular app or service eg to associate it with a contact tracing app a device equipped with a bluetooth le receiver scans the three beacon radio channels listening for beacon transmissions when the start of a transmission is detected the receiver uses the fact that the beacon preamble is fixed and known to fine tune the radio receiver to the incoming signal as part of this fine tuning process a received signal strength indicator rssi is output which is an estimate of the radio power in the received signal it is worth noting that this rssi measurement is intrinsically noisy with fluctuations of 5db or greater common even in situations with simple line-of-sight radio transmission eg see 10 and figure 1 below if the received signal strength is too weak either the transmission is simply not noticed or this fine-tuning process fails typically this occurs when the received signal strength is below around -90db the noise floor of the receiver upon successful fine-tuning of the receiver the payload of the beacon is decoded and passed up to the operating system and then on to relevant apps the received signal strength is affected by the transmit power used by the device broadcasting the beacon bluetooth le devices generally use a relatively low transmit power to save on battery drain and a rough guideline is that beacons cannot be decoded at distances beyond about 10 metres from the transmitter in practice the received signal strength is however also greatly affected by the way in which the radio signal propagates from transmitter to receiver in general the radio signal gets weaker as it travels further since the transmit power is spread over a greater area however many complex effects can be superimposed upon this basic behaviour in particular obstacles lying on the path between the transmitter and receiver furniture walls etc can absorb andor reflect the radio signal and cause it to be received with higher or lower signal strength a persons body also absorbs radio signals in the 24 ghz band and so the received signal strength can be substantially reduced if their body lies on the path between the transmitter and receiver in indoor enviroment walls floors and ceilings can reflect radio signals even when they are not on the direct path between transmitter and receiver and so increase or decrease the received signal strength metal in particular strongly reflects radio waves and this can be an important factor in radio propagation in environments with a lot of metal in buses and trains the walls floor and ceiling are mainly metal and the seats often contain metal parts in supermarkets not only are the shelving fridges and freezers typically made of metal but also tinned groceries etc located on the shelving we can therefore expect that radio propagation in these environments will be complex and in particular due to reflections the signal strength may not decrease as quickly with distance as in other environments eg see 13  14  in our tests we used two pairs of mobile handsets a pair of google pixel 2s and a pair of samsung galaxy a10s both running android 9 since we only acquired the galaxy a10s after our measurement study had already started most of our measurements were made using the pixel 2s and unless otherwise stated the measurements that we report below are pixel 2 data we used the opentrace app 3 to collect measurements this is an open source version of the tracetogether 4 contact tracing app used in singapore we slightly modified opentrace to i dump the measured receive signal strength values to disk in csv format and ii to scanadvertise bluetooth beacons more frequently allowing us to collect data more quickly albeit at the cost of an increased drain on the handset battery which is why these settings would not be used in a production contact tracing app note that in our initial experiments we used the default scanadvertise settings of opentrace which yields a receives signal strength measurement roughly every 10s the change ii above increases the sample rate to a measurement roughly every second we verified that this caused no other change to the collected received signal strength values to provide a baseline we collected measurements of received signal strength vs distance we placed two handsets at the same height and collected measurements of received signal strength as we varied the spacing between them at each distance the handsets are held in a fixed position for at least 10 minutes while the measurements are taken giving around 80 signal strength observations one for each advertised beacon detected at each distance the handsets are placed flat with the screen facing upwards as we will see later the relative orientation of the handsets can affect the received signal strength the solid line in figure 1 a shows the measured received signal strength vs distance for our pair of google pixel 2 handsets placed in an open space outdoors the location is shown in figure 1 b it can be seen that the received signal strength decreases steadily with increasing distance as expected also shown are error bars indicating one standard deviation of the measured signal strength at each distance it can be seen that the standard deviation is around 5db consistent with previous observations in the literature eg see 10  since the received signal strength depends on the transmit power and antenna gain of the transmitter and also on the antenna gain at the receiver it can be expected that the measured received signal strength may vary with the handset model the dashed line in figure 1 a shows received signal strength vs distance for a pair of samsung galaxy a10 handsets observe that the received signal strength is lower than with the pixel 2s presumably their transmit power andor antenna gain differs and also the standard deviation is somewhat higher at around 10db we also collected measurements for a huawei p10 and the rssi vs distance curve not shown in the figure to avoid clutter is almost the same as that for the pixel 2 but again with somewhat higher standard deviation it is also important to note that due to reflections from walls furniture etc wireless signal propagation indoors is usually more complex than it is outdoors figure 2 a shows measurements of received signal strength vs distance taken in a relatively open domestic indoor space shown in figure 2b  observe the increase in received signal strength in figure  2 a as the distance increases from 2 to 25m this effect is consistent and reproducible using multiple devices it is not a measurement error we believe that it is associated with the narrowing of the indoor space that can be seen towards the top of figure 2 blockwork covered in plaster acting to focus the wireless signal and so increase the received signal strength as the handset is moved from the open room into this narrower space we have also observed similar effects outdoors such behaviour has obvious implications for the use of received signal strength to measure proximity and confirms that caution is needed when interpreting received signal strength we also expect that attenuation of bluetooth le wireless signals by the human body bluetooth le transmits at 24ghz a frequency which is absorbed by water molecules hence why it is also used in microwave ovens may affect received signal strength and that the relative orientation of handsets may matter figure 3 a shows measurements of received signal strength as a person rotates around a fixed point 1m away from a mobile handset places flat on a wooden table the person carries a second handset in their left trouser pocket figure 3 b shows the experimental setup schematically it can be seen from figure 3 a that the received signal strength varies by around 20db as the person rotates the received signal strength is slightly higher around -75db when the persons left side is oriented towards the fixed handset than when their left-side is oriented away from the handset around -80 db as might be expected since in the latter case the persons body lies between the phone in their left pocket and the fixed handset observe also that the received signal strength is substantially higher around -60db when the person is facing the fixed handset than when they have their back to it around -80db again presumably due to signal absorption by the persons body the pocket is located towards the front of their trousers in figure 3 a both the signal path between the two handsets and their relative orientations change to separate out these effects we also took measurements with two handsets held in fixed positions at a 1m distance and roughly waist height 1m above the ground figure 4 shows the measured received signal strength as a person takes up various positions close to one of the handsets perhaps unsurprisingly it can be seen that when the person stands close in front of the handset roughly fig 4  measured received signal strength between two handsets spaced 1m apart as a person changes position relative to the handsets the positions of the handsets remains fixed in the left-hand section of the plot nobody is near the handsets in the centre-left section a person stands closely behind one of the handsets mimicking a handset being in a front trouser pocket in the centre-right section they stand closely in front of the handset mimicking a handset being in a rear trouser pocket and in the right section they stand beside the handset mimicking a handset being in a rear trouser pocket the received signal strength is around 15db lower than when the person stands closely behind the handset roughly mimicking a handset being in a front trouser pocket we also took measurements with a person holding a phone in a fixed position and orientation at chest height at a 1m distance from a fixed handset the received signal strength with the person facing the fixed handset so with an unobstructed path between the two handsets was observed to be around 10db higher than when the person faced away from the fixed handset so that their torso lay on the signal path figure 5a plots received signal strength measurements for a similar setup to the previous section but now with one handset placed inside a handbag rather than in a trouser pocket the handbag contains other items purse cosmetics hairbrush etc and the phone is located within a pocket inside the left side of the bag a second phone is placed 1m from the handbag and the measurements are taken as the handbag is rotated see figure 5 b for a schematic of the setup in section i of figure 5 a the handbag is orientated so that left-hand side is facing the second phone and a signal strength of around -68db is observed the handbag is then rotated 180  so that the right-hand side of the bag now faces the second phone section ii of the plot it can be seen that the signal strength falls by about 10db to around -75db the handbag is now rotated by 90  so that it is end on to the second phone section iii of the plot and this change increases the signal strength to around -65db house comparing figure 6 a with the 1m point in figure  1 a it can be seen that the stud wall creates little signal attenuation in contrast it can be seen from figure 6 a that the blockwork wall attenuates the signal by around 20db blockwork is commonly used for the party walls separating semi-detached houses and apartments these measurements therefore suggest there is little danger of bluetooth signal strength data triggering a false alarm regarding proximity between people located in adjacent housesapartments stud walls however are widely used internally within buildings and our measurements indicate that they have little effect on bluetooth received signal strength hence false alarms regarding proximity between people located in adjacent rooms within the same building may be a concern iv scenario-based measurements our first scenario seeks to evaluate proximity measurement between people walking in city streets the observations from this scenario are probably also applicable to people walking in parks and large indoor spaces such as shopping centres and airports we collected measurements of bluetooth le received signal strength for two people walking the same 15km circuit along suburban streets in dublin in four different configurations side by side shoulders touching side by side maintaining a 1m gap one behind the other maintaining a 1m gap and a 2m gap both people carry a mobile handset in their left-hand trouser pocket figure 7 shows time histories of the measured received signal strength for each configuration when the two people are walking close together figure 7 a the received signal strength is around -65db10db from figure 7 d it can be seen that when walking with a 2m gap the received signal strength consistently falls to around -95db10db that is there is a clear shift in received signal strength as the distance changes this suggests that the limited task of distinguishing between whether people outdoors are side by side or one is 2m behind the other when no other configurations can occur can indeed likely be achieved using bluetooth le received signal strength data unfortunately the situation becomes more complex when other configurations are considered figure 7 b shows measurements taken when walking side by side while maintaining a 1m gap and figure 7 c when walking one behind the other with a 1m gap in the first case the received signal strength is around -75db10db but in the second case it is much lower at around -92db10db ie similar to the signal strength measured when one behind the other and 2m apart this indicates that this data cannot readily be used to distinguish between whether people are 1m or 2m apart when they are walking behind each other that is this data suggests that we cannot reliably distinguish whether people are located less than 2m of each other when walking behind each other in a city street although we may be able to distinguish this when people are walking side by side further investigation suggests that the substantial difference in measured received signal strength at a distance of 1m seen in roughly speaking when two people are walking one behind the other with handsets in their pockets then the handsets are orientated edge on ie similarly to the configuration in the middle section of figure 8  when the people walk side by side the handsets are roughly orientated so that the screens face one another data for this configuration is not shown in figure 8  but our measurements indicate that the received signal strength at 1m is similar to that when the phones are lying flat ie to the right-hand side of figure 8 and around 10db higher than when the handsets are edge on the data in figure 8 is for a controlled indoor setup with no obstructions from peoples bodies etc and so is not directly comparable to the data in figures 7b-c  but it does suggest that significant shift in received signal strength observed when walking side by side vs one behind the other can largely be explained by the change in relative phone orientation our second scenario aims to evaluate proximity measurement within an office-based workplace a crude model of workplace movement is that during the work day people mainly spend time either i at their desk and ii in meetings regarding i if it is a shared office then if one person becomes infected their office mates are known and so contact-tracing is straightforward with the possible exception of a large openplan office but we leave evaluation of that more complex scenario to future work regarding ii the hope is that to assist with contact tracing we can augment an infected persons recollection of meetings attended and of the other people present by using bluetooth le received signal strength measurements we assume that during a meeting people spend the bulk of their time sitting around a table and so we try to evaluate the accuracy of bluetooth le signal strength data for proximity detection in this scenario we collect measurements of bluetooth le received signal strength with four people sitting around a wooden table as illustrated schematically in figure 9  we take measurements both when people have their mobile handset in their trouser pocket and when it is placed on the based on this received signal strength data this suggests it would be hard to detect when people sitting close together at a table unless people place their handsets on the table during the meeting our third scenario aims to evaluate proximity measurement while travelling on public transport our rough model is that people mainly spend their time seated and so we take measurements of the received signal strength between various seating positions we focus on a train since irish rail very kindly let us take measuments on two of their rail carriages at short notice but of course buses trams and aircraft are also important while our measurements are taken within a stationary train carriage we do not expect movement of the carriage to change things much figure 11 b shows the carriage layout seats are arranged in groups of four around a small table we placed a handset on one seat indicated at the bottom left of figure 11 b a person with a second handset in their left trouser pocket then sat in the positions marked 1 2 and 3 in figure 11 b and the received signal signal strength from the first handset recorded figures  11a  d and d show the measurements obtained it can be seen from figures 11a and 11c that the received signal strength is about -62db when the person is seated around 1m from the first handset which is in quite good agreement with figure 1a  when seated around 27m from the first handset the signal strength falls to about -70db also in reasonable agreement with figure 1a  we also collected measurements of received signal strength vs distance along the aisle in the middle of the rail carriage roughly at the seat height approximately 50cm above the floor see figure 12 b the measurement setup used is the same as that used in figure 1  figure 12 a shows the measured received signal strength with the error bars indicating one standard deviation it can be seen that the received signal strength remains roughly constant up to a distance of 2m and then falls sharply as noted above seats in this carriage are arranged in groups of four around small tables the sharp fall in received signal strength coincides with moving from one group of four seats to another this data therefore suggests that the signal strength is high between seats with the same in b they stay close together while walking around the aisles for 10mins in c they walk one behind the other maintaining a distance of 2m group but lower between seats in different groups it can be seen from figure 12 a that the received signal strength then stays roughly constant out to a distance of 4m but appears to increase when moving from 35 to 4m recall that we expect signal strength to generally fall with increasing distance hence while our measurements suggest that received signal strength might be used to distinguish between people sitting in the same group of seats and those sitting in a different group the increase in signal strength at 4m is potentially of concern for proximity detection based on received signal strength we note that the walls floor and ceiling of a train carriage are primarily made of metal albeit with the walls and ceiling lined with plastic cladding and the floor with carpet the seats also likely contain metal since metal strongly reflects radio signals it is unsurprising that the radio signal propagation behaves in quite a complex manner and a further more extensive measurement campaign would be prudent this scenario aims to evaluate the use of bluetooth le for proximity measurement while grocery shopping in a typical irish supermarket grocery shopping is of course something that everyone has to do and under the current lockdown for many people it is also one of the few activities where they are likely to come into relatively close contact with people outside their immediate social circle shoppers who are social distancing are also present see figure 13 a the two people walk one behind the other the relatively narrow aisles in the shop encourage this in any case and both carry a phone in their left-hand trouser pocket in figure 13 b the two people stay close together although still one behind the other while walking in figure 13 c they walk one behind the other maintaining a distance of 2m somewhat surprisingly it can be seen that the received signal strength measurements look much the same in both cases presumably this is due to a mix of the impact of the handset orientation already noted when walking one behind the other and of the effect on wireless signal propagation of the complex environment metal shelves etc within the supermarket these measurements suggest that received signal strength probably cannot be used to distinguish between whether people are close together or 2m apart when walking around a supermarket however we note that it is probably unlikely that people will spend more than 15 minutes within 2 metres of each other while walking around a supermarket and so failure to detect close proximity using received signal strength is perhaps of less importance than in other scenarios of more concern are false positives where people are detected as being close together when in fact they are not in light of the relatively high received signal strengths we see in figure  13 c when people are 2m apart current social distance measures in ireland limit the number of people who can be inside a shop at the same time this means that people often need to queue outside until allowed to enter while queueing people are asked to remain spaced 2m apart figure 14 shows received signal strength measurements collected while queueing outside a supermarket beside metal shopping trolleys comparing figures 14a and 14b it can be seen that the received signal strength falls as people stand further apart a third person standing in between does not change the received signal strength by much see figure  14 c this data suggests that received signal strength might successfully be used to detect proximity while queueing v related work while there have been some studies on use of the magnetometers on smartphones for contact tracing eg see 15  16  to the best of our knowledge there are no previous measurement studies on the use of bluetooth le specifically in the context of contact tracing perhaps the closest work is fluphone 17  an approach proposed in 2011 that made use of bluetooth rather than bluetooth le and did not try to distinguish between contact events where people are less than 2m apart and when they are further away the app simply logged all observed bluetooth mac addresses use of bluetooth le for proximity detection has however been investigated in the context of measuring social interaction and also indirectly in the context of indoor localisation bluetooth le was standardised in 2010 with the first devices using bluetooth le appearing in 2011-12 although the original non-low energy bluetooth classic technology is older the use of the bluetooth received signal strength reported by smartphones to infer proximity has received attention since around 2014 mainly in the context of studies on social interaction in indoor office settings and only more recently making using of bluetooth le in summary this work highlights that i simple thresholding of received signal strength to estimate proximity results in a high error-rate ii by using standard machine learning classifiers much better accuracy can be achieved but since these are supervised learning methods they require training data which is generally difficult and timeconsuming to obtain in these studies determining ground truth involved manual observation of camera footage or shadowing of people by observers one of the earliest studies is that reported in 6  this makes use of bluetooth rather than bluetooth le measurements are collected as two people carrying mobile handsets follow a prescribed path on a university campus walking between two buildings and spending time indoors and outdoors the aim is to use received signal strength to detect when the two people are within 15m of each other it was found that simple thresholding of the received signal strength yields a high error rate of around 50 even when people are in the proximity of one another for 10 mins averaging of the measured signal strength values improves the accuracy somewhat but since the signal strength was observed to vary significantly depending on whether people were indoors or outdoors then in order to achieve a low error rate the authors needed to employ multiple thresholds tuned to the particular environment used on the study combined with use of a light sensor to detect operation indoors or out the latter meant that operation in evening and at night needed to be excluded a much larger follow-up study is also reported on in 6 but since it lacks ground truth it is hard to draw quantitative conclusions regarding the accuracy with which proximity is estimated around the same time the use of bluetooth again not bluetooth le for proximity detection was also considered by 7  in this study it is noted that phone orientation can have a substantial effect on received signal strength water-filled cylinders with mobile handsets attached were used to collect baseline data on received signal strength that was then used to train a decision tree classifier in experiments involving 8 students interacting in an office environment and with ground truth obtained via a human observer proximity was estimated with an accuracy of around 80 more recently 8 studies the use of bluetooth le for proximity sensing within 3m they use custom bluetooth le bracelets rather than smartphones and take measurements in an officebased workplace ground truth is obtained by an observer logging all interactions plus the office space is equipped with multiple static beacons whose transmissions are logged by the smartphones a decision tree classifier was trained using this data and an accuracy of around 80 reported for bluetooth le settings similar to those used in android similarly last year 9 reports on a study where people carry ibeacons data is collected data for 24 people interacting in a 6m by 5m indoor space with ground truth on interactions being obtained via two video cameras covering the indoor space a regression tree classifier achieves an accuracy of around 80 apple introduced ibeacons using bluetooth le in mid-2013 18 19  these are typically placed in fixed locations indoors and transmit bluetooth le beacons these beacons typically transmit at low power so that they can only be detected when a receiver is relatively close and this allows them to be used by a mobile handset to roughly estimate its location within an office or shop handsets use the received signal strength to estimate their distance from an ibeacon but this is limited to whether the beacon is immediate near far or has unknown status other manufacturers have since developed similar beacon technology there has of course been much interest in obtaining more accurate distance estimates so as to improve indoor localisation however received signal strength measurements are known to exhibit large fluctuations eg see 10  and so in more recent work it has been common to i try to combine received signal strength data with other measurements eg accelerometer and time of flight data and ii employ machine learning methods to help map from received signal strength data to distance similarly to the approaches adopted by the proximity detection community see above see 10  11  12  and citations therein for recent work in this direction we report on measurements of the bluetooth le received signal strength taken on mobile handsets in a variety of common real-world settings in summary we find that the bluetooth le received signal strength can vary substantially depending on the relative orientation of handsets on absorption by the human body reflectionabsorption of radio signals in buildings and trains indeed we observe that the received signal strength need not decrease with increasing distance this suggests that the development of accurate methods for proximity detection based on bluetooth le received signal strength is likely to be challenging and time consuming our measurements also suggest that it may be necessary for bluetooth le contact tracing apps to be combined with the adoption of new social protocols to yield benefits although this requires further study for example placing phones on the table during meetings is likely to simplify proximity detection using received signal strength similarly carrying handbags with phones placed close to the outside surface in locations where the complexity of signal propagation makes proximity detection using received signal strength problematic additional non-bluetooth le mechanisms may be required looking ahead further work is needed to try to quantify the error rates of proximity detection methods based on bluetooth le received signal strength in particular it is important to distinguish between false positives where people are flagged as having been in contact with an infected person but in fact have not been and false negatives where people are not flagged as having been in contact with an infected person but in fact were false positives are likely when the received signal strength does not decrease sufficiently quickly with distance and false negatives when the received signal strength decreases too quickly our data suggests that there may be significant potential for both types of error in common realworld situations false positives are of concern since they mean that people may be led to unnecessarily self-isolate with associated disruption and perhaps also leading to a loss of confidence in the contact tracing app if the error rate is too high false negatives are of concern since they directly reduce the effectiveness of contact tracing for disease control namely they mean that people in contact with an infected person may inadvertently spread the infection further  covid-19 the wrong target for healthcare liability claims saverio parisi g guido viel rossana cecchi massimo montisci   regrettably in the complex setting of the current coronavirus pandemic an incoercible succession of events revolving around the question of the professional liability of healthcare personnel with the typical peculiarities of emergency situations is emerging 1 as a matter of fact after an initial choral and unquestioning appreciation and praise of the citizens for healthcare operators 2 numerous episodes of actions taken against them on the issue of their legal liability followed 3 this has prompted the medical scientific societies and trade unions to take a defensive stance and loudly call for the healthcare system as a whole to safeguard its interests they have asked for targeted political actions to issue clear rules and not only about the implementation of quarantine measures 4 but the exceptional nature of the present emergency cannot hide the fact that individual health operators are responsible for their own work behavior making it difficult to build a national normative barrier criminal and civil to protect them 1 the scenario that has come true can undeniably be defined in insurance terms as catastrophic and as such necessitates organizational measures at all health facilities to identify appropriate standards of care competencies compliance with shift-scheduling rules tracking of communications and activities and the postponement of non-covid-19 services provisions based on a proper definition of the guaranteed minimum levels of patient care many stakeholders ie some politicians economists citizens etc do not appear to have fully understood what a global pandemic crisis means and what efforts are being made to contain this new emergency situation this is partly due to the paucity or absence of authoritative and shared scientific grounds ie guidelines also at an international level for dealing with the disease caused by covid-19 virus which is still scarcely known 5 soon it will be possible to predict that this situation will generate a marked increase in the insurance claims that the various health organizations and insurance companies will struggle to cope with demands for financial compensation will include not only the diseases caused by covid-19 but also other health conditions with important repercussions of the covid-19 emergency on the management of all other patients and also on the availability of personal protective equipment ppe which have necessitated a fast supply to numerous urgent demands the present catastrophic situation undeniably imposes the need to take irreducible risks that cannot be assessed by local technical body delegated to act as a centralized hub otherwise to bring forward the technical assessment that is usually one of the fundamental parts of the criminal and civil trial it would be not only complicated to organize and unavoidably self-referential for the sole decision-maker but it would also be unacceptable for cultural and legal reasons there would be indeed no chance of a cross-examination and the rightful role of the judgecourt in arriving at an autonomous synthesis would be lacking the most realistic option might be to establish an ad hoc fund for all claims for financial damages coronavirus-emergency related that could award lump-sum payments for claims considered worthy of compensation and thus contain the numbers of lawsuits in such cases it would be recommended to appeal for mediation trained mediators could be more effective in finding an agreement between the parties another workable solution could be to emphasize by law that the pandemic is characterized by technical-scientific difficulty andor novelty inasmuch as it is an emergency  a condition that almost always renders even the easiest tasks difficult to accomplish in these cases similarly as in mass disasters once the emergency has elapsed responsibility can be recognized only for those who have clearly allowed an avoidable event to occur the main problems in this setting will ineluctably gradually shift the focus of liability evaluations from the physicians conduct to the handling of the various levels of management primarily technical and organizational that have to suggest appropriate risk parameters to the political decision-makers perhaps the world of politics has lost the ability to choose the right experts based on the grounds of their merits those able to guide government strategies at their best 6 the real problem is to ascertain the liability of top managers in the health administration those appointed to handle public health emergencies though with unclear margins of autonomy the lack or late adoption of clear and cogent directives applicable everywhere also does not exempt all the intermediate-level institutions from their obligation to take independent actions if necessary dictated by common sense andor trustworthy experts 7 different countries have a specific technical support framework stsf for political and administrative decision-makers on a local level which for instance advises health facilities and hospitals on matters of infectious diseases leveraging on the emergency as an excuse for failing to activate and consult the stsf either urgently or according to the established protocols and even after its involvement had been specifically requested by other parties certainly has all the features of a culpable omission and therefore of a liability in the same way the disregard for bottom-up recommendations made by the stsfs experts made it necessary to deal with problems that their suggestions would have enabled to be managed differently these seem to be the issues most likely to be the focus of discussion in the future below are a few examples of clinical and care activity management areas susceptible to the recommendations and coordination of a stsf inside hospitals1the opening of spaces sars-cov-2 patients dedicated outside infectious diseases departments with the related problems of a structural adequacy who assessed them and based on what expertise b the use of dedicated medical and paramedical personnel whole teams established ex abrupto who was responsible for the infections propagation to personnel and patients c the distribution of personnel expert on matters of infectious diseases who could serve as tutors for other workgroups2responsibility for exposure to the risk of infection with the need for constant monitoring of the rates of detection of new positive cases in-hospital exposure for patients previously tested negative for covid-19 the timely identification of clusters the management of personnel testing positive for the virus and their contacts and the corresponding quarantine measures which often take on a different meaning when applied to the general population or to public health personnel3workflows of follow-up tests for personnel in all areas based on the risk of transmission within teams and to the patients4responsibility for managing tests turn-around-time to get results materials procurement prioritizing different requests suspected cases tests on patients personnel and other potentially exposed individuals and the demand for other diagnostic services who is in charge and whose responsibility is it
 outside hospitals1long-term care facilities in a setting where specialist expertise is not widespread the role of bodies responsible for controlling the spread of infections with the aid of specialized individuals becomes essential in disseminating appropriate organization and control measures in this setting any responsibility for delays and omissions certainly cannot be attributed to the managers of these territorial facilities responsibilities have therefore to be ascribed to the competent public health bodies and control authorities from the moment they are informed2general practitioners specific training and support for the management and control of their professional exposure should be carefully coordinated at top management level and translated into timely action
 all these problems will demand an economically sustainable response that will affect the budgeting of health organizations and insurance companies alike at the time of writing the situation may still not be entirely clear it will take a while to find solutions for all the problems in the longer term it will be essential to strike the correct balance between the rights of damaged individuals and the proper safeguarding of health-care professionals in a frame that considers the responsibilities of the whole health system this system should be submitted to a necessary and not self-referential auditing process all authors provided critical feedback contributed to the writing of the letter and approved the final version we declare no competing interests  mice and rats thomas tully n mark mitchell a thomas tully n   mice may be maintained as pets because of their size and playful nature although playful mice can be aggressive to cagemates and owners the aggressive nature often manifests as barbering andor fighting with cagemates and biting their owners any potential owner should be educated on the ag-gressive nature of these small dynamos domestic mice mus musculus and the african pygmy mouse baiomys spp are commonly sold for pets and are available in several varieties the mice varieties sold in pet stores include white black or tan colored satin hair coat shiny pied or spotted and longhaired1 2 figure 12-1
 the size and ability of mice to escape quickly from the grasp of a human handler make these animals as pets better suited for older individuals the timid nature of mice predispose these animals to biting if handled roughly which commonly occurs with a young owner mice are nocturnal animals and may be a disturbance at night if maintained in a bedroom female mice produce less odor than males and therefore may be more desirable as pets as mentioned earlier male mice are territorial and if placed with other male mice may fight advantages of having mice as pets include their size ability to be a good companion animal for the educated regarding mouse behavior owner and adorable appearance mice also rarely become infected with bacterial diseases and their life span is approximately 2 years box 12-1

mice are continuous polyestrous rodents that should be bred in polygamous or monogamous setups because of the males aggressive territoriality behavior2 when breeding mice that have been housed in a polygamous ratio there may be one male with two to six females2 females are removed from a polygamous cage before parturition whereas the monogamous pair is maintained together with the young until weaning2
 mice can chew out of enclosures therefore it is important that the housing be mouse proof if an animal escapes the best way to capture the pet is to place food in the center of the room once it has been determined in which room the animal is staying then it should be sealed and measures taken to look for the pet because mice are nocturnal animals capture at night in a dark room with a flashlight may work best this technique will work for capture of other small rodents and pocket pets too mice are maintained in environments that are similar to other small rodents but require a thorough cleaning of their cage more often because of their malodorous urine ventilation is essential for small rodent housing to prevent irritation of the respiratory tract from ammonia vapors generated by urine the recommended housing unit for mice is 12-15 12-15 6 length width height for each adult mouse females and young require 2 to 3 times the space listed2 the major considerations for selecting an enclosure for mice is that it be resistant to their escape and easy to clean an open screen top of the enclosure is recommended for proper ventilation available rodent cages that fit this criterion are wire or metal mesh plastic and plexiglas if the plastic tube housing systems are used there should be routine cleaning of the sections using hot water and a mild detergent owners should be informed of the small distance required for a mouse to escape and their ability to chew through plastic an owner must always monitor the cage for possible escape avenues especially if the animal has a predilection for modifying the cage opening through chewing it is very important to provide cage toys and exercise opportunities for mice the enclosure should be large enough to house not only food and water containers but also cage toys and an exercise wheel figure 12-2
 although not a cage toy a hide box in some form should also be included for the psychological well-being of the animal this hide box can be manufactured or a small cardboard container that has one end cut out mice like to hide and also sleep during the day this piece of cage furniture will enable the mouse to sleep undisturbed during the daylight hours mice especially males have odiferous urine to prevent the buildup of urine and fecal material in the cage commercially available paper rodent bedding or hardwood shavings should be used as a cage substrate although softwood pine and cedar shavings are available the volatile oils that radiate from these substrates are irritating to small animals these irritating compounds can cause dermal and respiratory inflammation often leading to secondary bacterial infections cardboard tissue tubes can be placed in a mouse enclosure mice like to chew and run through these items because many fabrics have strong thread and elastic it is not recommended to put clothes items in enclosures with animals that chew often mice will shred the clothing items exposing thread and elastic that can become entangled around an extremity this can lead to necrosis distal to the stricture it is recommended to change the substrate within the enclosure at least twice a weekmore often if there is a problem with odor or excessive excreta temperature humidity and lighting within the enclosure should follow what is commonly maintained with the ambient conditions within the house if the animals are housed outside or in an outbuilding the temperature range should be 65 f to 85 f and humidity 30 to 70 although the recommended humidity is on the higher end of the range provided2 mice especially males are extremely territorial animals if mice are housed alone it is better to keep them separate as introduction of new animals will often lead to aggression and fighting to prevent aggression fighting and psychologically induced adverse behavior eg barbering a single mouse is recommended as a companion animal for those who intend to breed the animals enclosures with a single pair is necessary for reproductive success because mice are commonly used as laboratory animals in investigations of human disease processes much research literature is available on the recommended nutritional requirements of these animals the benefit of these dietary studies is the availability of commercially produced diets that provide the recommended daily nutritional requirements of the mouse the problem that most owners face is the multitude of dietary products available for mice and the lack of knowledge regarding which food to buy most new mouse owners think that rodents eat seed-based diets although mice will happily eat seed seed-based diets are lacking in a number of the nutritional requirements needed to maintain long-term health commercial rodent biscuits or pellets with more than 14 protein are the recommended diets for mice2 the commercial rodent biscuits or pellets are the only food mice need to obtain their required nutrients figure 12-3
 again seed-based diets are not recommended nor is a significant supplementation of fruits nuts vegetables cheese or other human foods eg peanut butter if a treat is to be given yogurt or dried fruit treats manufactured specifically for rodents andor mice should be provided 2 to 3 times a week for younger mice less than 3 weeks old softer pellets are needed because babies start eating pellets and drinking water at 2 to 3 weeks of age2 a sipper bottle placed on the outside of the cage is easy to maintain and does not take any space within the enclosure if the cage is plastic or plexiglas modifications will be needed to attach the sipper bottle on the outside of the cage most sipper bottles come with attachment hardware to attach to wire cages figure 12-4
 fresh bottled water is recommended for mice although chlorinated tap water is acceptable the water should be checked on a daily basis and clean water supplied at least every 2 days if not every day quarantining an animal is important when a new animal is being introduced into a setting in which there is an established group as with other animals a 30-day quarantine period is recommended along with a physical examination and fecal parasite check unfortunately there is no time period that will screen 100 against potential infectious agents and with mice time is critical because their life span and reproductive time frame are so short the animals should be quarantined in conditions similar to those in which they will be permanently maintained providing adequate food and water will make for a smooth transition it is imperative that the owner screen the new animal for diseases and watch for any signs of illness the most common sign of clinical illness is a rough hair coat the lack of grooming is most often related to the animal feeling depressed or sick thereby not having the energy to perform routine behaviors if a number of animals are being quarantined sacrificing an apparently diseased animal is the most efficient way to determine a rapid definitive diagnosis if it is a single or an expensive animal routine diagnostic testing will be required to maintain oversight of breeding animals health and reduce the exposure of young animals to infectious disease and parasites routine screening of representative animals within the colony is recommended in very large colonies special caging eg filter food and water may be necessary to prevent exposure to disease organisms2
 to catch a mouse the tail should be grabbed with the thumb and forefinger allowing the mouse to hold on to an object with their front feet figure 12-5
 when the mouse securely attaches itself to an object the opposite hand then grabs the dorsal skin in the cervical region while keeping the tail in a firm grasp if one is unable to adequately restrain a mouse while the animal is conscious inhalant anesthesia may be used for sedation purposes the animal should be placed in a small induction chamber and isoflurane gas permeated into the closed space once the animal has stopped moving the enclosure top is removed and a nose cone placed on the anesthesia tube and placed on the patients face a syringe case can be modified as a nose cone for small rodents including mice once the physical examination is complete the nose cone is removed allowing the patient to breath oxygen from the anesthesia unit obtaining a detailed history of the mouse patient is very important as it is with other animal patients that are brought to a veterinarians office it is important to get as much information from the owner as possible even if it is a routine health examination typical background information required includes how long the mouse been owned where it was acquired how often it is handled and what the character of the feces and urine is husbandry questions should focus on the animals housing and whether it is allowed to roam unobserved cage location type size and material of the cage cage substrate furniture and toys and the frequency with which the cage is cleaned and what disinfectant is used when investigating the diet the veterinarian should ask not only if pellets are fed and in what quantity but also what the animal is eating and what the primary diet is supplemental offerings and frequency of feeding are important data for the case work-up the veterinarian should find out about the water supply how often the water is changed and how much the animal drinks on a daily basis because there are transmissible diseases among animals the final questions should center on the other pets in the household if new animals have been added to the family and if the animals are housed together a description of any previous problems and a complete chronological description of the presenting problem are needed to complete the history form before the animal is restrained an observation should be made on the attitude activity and posture of the animal the next step is to weigh the mouse in a basket on a digital gram scale if possible temperature respiration and pulse should be measured and any abnormalities in rate andor character noted the veterinarian should start the physical examination at the head looking for any abnormalities eyes ears and nares are observed looking for discharge or inflammation the oral cavity is difficult to examine in mice because of the small opening and tendency for the buccal mucosa to encroach toward the middle of the mouth a small speculum eg modified paper clip or an otoscope may be used to examine the oral cavity and cheek teeth mucous membranes help determine hydration status using capillary refill time and moisture body condition and abdominal palpation are important information that should be obtained lymph nodes and limbs are palpated before checking the nails and plantar surface of each foot the patient should have a normal posture be aware of its surroundings and move properly any problems should be noted in the record finally a dermatologic exam considers hair coat quality alopecia external parasites and any skin abnormalities all abnormal findings are written in the record for case review differential diagnoses determination diagnostic testing and treatment considerations most of the common problems noted during the physical examination of mice involve the skin and hair coat as mentioned previously an unkempt hair coat may point toward generalized illness or external parasitism abrasive lesions or pustules on the skin can be signs of external parasites or infectious dermatitis if external parasites are a problem the mouse may be uncontrollably scratching hair loss may be associated with barbering either cagemate or self-induced or with infection eg ringworm although not common trichophyton mentagrophytes will cause hair loss in mice from the face head and neck4
 mice will commonly present with tumors and abscesses the entire body of the mouse should be palpated for any evidence of masses if a mass is identified a fine needle aspirate is recommended for basic diagnostic evaluation with most fine needle aspirate samples the clinical pathology results are not very rewarding if a diagnosis cannot be obtained through cytologic examination a biopsy of the lesion is required and if possible an excisional biopsy is the procedure of choice as with many rodents respiratory disease is commonly identified in mice mice may have presenting symptoms of dyspnea sneezing coughing chattering and sniffling if they have a respiratory infection in cases where respiratory signs are observed anesthetizing the animal to perform the physical examination is not recommended and handling should be kept to a minimum the two most common respiratory disease conditions in mice are sendai virus and mycoplasma pulmonis4 these two organisms are very difficult to identify through routine diagnostic measures and obtaining samples significantly stresses the patient if the animal is being examined for placement into a colony or breeding environment sacrifice to identify the disease condition is recommended if the animal is an individual companion animal doxycycline treatment should be initiated although treatment with doxycycline will not clear the organism from the animal it will reduce clinical disease and improve the quality of life the treated animal should always be considered a carrier of these respiratory diseases if a definitive diagnosis cannot be obtained male mice that are licking andor mutilating their penis may be suffering from a urethral obstruction infection of accessory sex glands young males with aggressive breeding activity urolithiasis and trauma may initiate this self-induced trauma to the penis4
pasteurella pneumotropica is often isolated from accessory sex gland infections as well as subdermal abscesses4 treatment for this organism may aid in the recovery of a mouse affected by urethral obstruction diarrhea in mice is rare but endoparasite examinations should be performed if the animal has diarrhea although pinworms are considered nonpathogenic in mice syphacia obvelata and aspiculuris tetraptera may cause rectal prolapse due to straining in immunosuppressed individuals5 as with other animals a tape test is the best way to identify these parasites a tape test follows a procedure of pressing the sticky side of the tape against the rectum and perianal area and then examining the tape under a microscope for eggs and parasites5
 as with other pocket pets blood collection from mice can be quite difficult approximately 05 to 07 ml100 g body weight can be safely removed from a nonanemic healthy mouse2 the mouse patient should always be anesthetized for blood collection procedures usually inducing the animals in a closed chamber and maintaining the patients in a mask will allow the technician plenty of time to collect the blood sample a small 25- 26- or 30-gauge needle usually placed on a 1-ml syringe is recommended for collecting the blood recommended blood collection sites in a mouse are a warmed ventral tail vein or the tip of the tail2

describes the technique used for retroorbital bleeding in mice the retroorbital bleeding technique is commonly used in laboratory animal settings and is easily performed by an experienced veterinarian or veterinary technician5
 on smaller rodents the saphenous vein or lateral vein of the tarsus may be used for multiple blood collections without the use of anesthesia the patient must be properly immobilized in a restraint tube 35-ml syringe with the leg extended and the skin held tight on the medial aspect of the thigh using the thumb and forefinger2 the taut skin on the lateral aspect of the thigh allows exposure of the saphenous vein a 23-gauge needle is used to puncture the vein and blood is collected in a microhematocrit tube as it flows from the vessel5
 blood samples obtained from nail and ear clips are not considered appropriate diagnostic samples cardiac puncture is recommended only in terminal cases and when the animal is maintained under general anesthesia because of possible complications involving the lungs and heart vessels reference ranges for complete blood counts and serum biochemistry panels for mice are listed in box 12-3 box 12-4

 even though most of the diagnostic testing is performed through pathologic examination for mice there are serologic tests available that can be run on a minimum of 50 ml of undiluted serum sound diagnostics inc woodinville washington provides serologic testing on a number of common mouse diseases including ectromelia virus mouse hepatitis virus mouse parvovirus mouse minute virus rotavirus theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus pneumonia virus of mice reovirus 3 sendai virus mycoplasma pulmonis lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and mouse adenovirus the serologic tests are done using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and when indicated are confirmed by indirect fluorescent antibody testing many of the diseases for which there are available serologic tests are beneficial in maintaining disease-free animals in laboratory settings or large breeding facilities in cases of unknown disease conditions for the individual pet mouse there are panels available that test for multiple diseases from a single serum sample it is very important for the veterinary clinician to understand both the significance of any test that is being promoted for mice and how the results are interpreted bacterial infections associated with dermatitis lesions and subcutaneous abscesses in mice are commonly caused by staphylococcus aureus pasteurella pneumotropica and streptococcus pyogens
4 acute and chronic respiratory infections may be caused by sendai virus or mycoplasma pulmonis
4 acute respiratory infections usually are associated with sendai virus adults live while neonates often die chronic respiratory infection with clinical signs being pneumonia suppurative rhinitis and occasionally otitis media may be the result of a mycoplasma pulmonis infection4 both infections should be treated using supportive care whereas mycoplasmosis can be treated with enrofloxacin in combination with doxycycline hyclate for 7 days7
 
p pneumotropica has been associated with urethral obstruction caused by inflammation and swelling related to infection of accessory sex glands4 although uncommon trichophyton mentagrophytes ringworm can cause alopecia of the face head and neck of mice4 in addition to the disease organisms mentioned in this chapter which are the most common disease organisms identified in pet mice there are other bacterial fungal and viral organisms that can cause disease in mice proper diagnostic protocol should always be followed to identify the causal agent once the cause is identified the proper treatment can be initiated and control measures implemented to prevent other animals exposure to the disease numerous parasites have been identified in mice hymenolepis nana dwarf tapeworm and cysticercus fasciolaris the larval stage of the cat tapeworm can be isolated from these small rodents5 the dwarf tapeworm is often found in young mice that are dead or have severe gastroenteritis resulting in diarrhea diagnosis of the dwarf tapeworm can be made following either a fecal flotation exam or necropsy when the adults may be found in the small intestine treatment for the dwarf tapeworm is with praziquantel the mouse pinworm syphacia obvelata is a commensal oxyurid nematode that feeds on bacteria that inhabit the intestinal tract of mice6 although these nematodes are nonpathogenic in most cases an overwhelming number of them can cause severe irritation of the terminal gastrointestinal tract these nematode parasites can be diagnosed using transparent tape and applying it to the rectal area after removing the tape from the affected rectal area it is placed on a slide and the ova may be viewed under a microscope ivermectin and fenbendazole have been used effectively in treating this parasite in mice6
 
giardia muris is a common protozoal parasite affecting mice5 this organism can be seen using a direct fecal examination of an affected patients fecal material metronidazole is the treatment of choice for giardia spp infections in small rodents 
myobia musculi myocoptes musculinis radfordia affinis and psorergates simplex are fur mites that can cause severe self-mutilation and hair loss in mice6
polyplax serrata house mouse louse can cause anemia pruritus dermatitis and death in severely infested mice6 diagnosis of ectoparasites in mice is similar to that in other companion animal species eg skin scraping examining hair samples for nits treatment of ectoparasites can be accomplished with ivermectin and a topical miticide as with other rodent species there has been an increasing ectoparasite resistance to ivermectin treatment because most rodent diets are manufactured in the form of pellets or small biscuits that provide all recommended nutrients there are few nutritional disease problems diagnosed in pet mice if mice are fed an all-seed diet there could be nutritionally related consequences a lack of vitamin a could result in roughened hair coat or skin lesions a breakdown of the protective epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal andor respiratory tract could predispose the mouse to secondary bacterial infections affecting those body systems nutritional deficiencies may also result in poor reproductive activity it is important to provide an adequate supply of fresh water and appropriate rodent food on a daily basis following these basic nutritional instructions should provide a nutritional basis for mice to live healthy lives the average life span of a mouse is 2 years old this short life span and aging process increase the prevalence of tumors in these small rodents if an animal is over 18 months of age neoplastic disease should be considered as a differential diagnosis especially if an asymmetrical mass is present the most common tumors diagnosed in mice are mammary adenocarcinomas and fibroadenomas4 other tumor types are identified in mice and if possible the suspect tissue should be completely excised representative tissue sections should be submitted for histopathological evaluation although there are treatment options available for mice that have been diagnosed with neoplasia eg radiation chemotherapy its small size does not allow it to withstand the stress and negative side effects of these healing modalities in mice the recommended treatment for neoplasia is removal of the affected tissue if possible to increase its quality of life the most common disease in mice colonies is barbering barbering is defined as the dominant mouse nibbling off the whiskers and hair around the face of the subservient cagemates5 the hair clipping is very close to the skin without causing skin lesions this behavior is noted often among female mice whereas male mice are more likely to fight mice may injure themselves on cage furniture or poorly designed cages and sustain abrasions on the face or nose individual animals may show stereotypic behavior that results in abrasions andor alopecia enrichment furniture and toys may help alleviate this initial cause of dermatologic abnormality the size of mice contributes to the difficulty in properly administering therapeutic medications the scruff of the neck or caudal flank are the subcutaneous sites that may be utilized to administer medication fluids or both2 the semitendinosus triceps and epaxial muscles are commonly used for intramuscular injections whereas intraperitoneal injections are used in extremely small animal species including mice2 intraosseous catheters are much easier to place in mice than are intravenous catheters the tibial plateau and the greater trochanter are the sites of choice for intraosseous catheter placement in mice5
 
although there are many methods that may be used to administer medication in small mammals oral treatment using a dropper or tuberculin syringe is the easiest to administer and the least stressful for the patient medication can be added to the food or water but often the patient is anorexic or the medicated food or water is not palatable in which case the patient does not receive the treatment although a relatively difficult procedure in mice gastric gavage can be performed using a bulbed stainless steel feeding needle or flexible red rubber feeding tube the length of the tube is premeasured externally from the nares to the last rib and marked a water-based lubricant is applied to the feeding tube before it is inserted through the intradermal space toward the back of the oral cavity2 the tube should advance without difficulty until the premeasured mark is reached restraint of mice for this procedure is accomplished by pinching the dorsal neck skin fold and holding the body with the remaining free fingers both oral medication and nutritional supplementation can be administered through an oral gastric feeding tube medication dosages for mice can be found in a number of formularies before administration of any therapeutic agent the dosage should be checked twice and calculations thoroughly evaluated to make sure they are correct because mice are very small patients any overdose of medication can have adverse consequences on the patients recovery inducing and maintaining mouse patients under anesthesia can be very challenging with the widespread use of isoflurane anesthesia in small animal practices the previous problems associated with methoxyflurane and halothane anesthetic agents has been overcome there are still concerns and differences in anesthetic protocol because of these animals small size but in general isoflurane is a safe agent when used on a relatively healthy surgical candidate although there are doses of injectable agents for sedation the small size of the mouse makes it difficult to respond to anesthetic crises that may appear during a diagnostic or surgical procedure therefore inhalant anesthetic agents eg isoflurane sevoflurane are recommended for anesthetizing mouse patients an induction chamber is used to induce the patients and then they are maintained under gas anesthesia using a face mask it may be possible to intubate a larger rodent but it is very difficult in mice under most conditions a modified syringe case face mask is used5 to guard against aspiration of stomach contents in a patient that is not intubated the veterinary surgeon should place the head and neck in a position slightly higher than the body

 premedication and sedation doses for mice and rats are listed in table 12-1
 although general anesthesia is not recommended under most circumstances injectable doses are listed in table 12-2
 analgesia is important for patient recovery and should be administered before during and after surgery depending on the patients presenting symptoms and the procedure being performed table 12-3
lists analgesic drug dosages for mice and rats surgical procedures that are performed on mouse patients require similar techniques to those used with larger animals veterinarians should follow the same protocol but remember that the surgical field is smaller and patient manipulation more delicate with patients that weigh less than 50 g zoonotic diseases associated with mice maintained as pets are rare possibly the most commonly reported zoonotic condition associated with mice is an allergic reaction to their dander and urine as with all animals it is important that a handler wash his or her hands after interacting with a mouse salmonella spp may colonize the intestinal tract of small mammals including mice7 contact with the feces or anus of a mouse may expose the handler to this enteric pathogen washing hands after handling a mouse will help prevent exposure to possible pathogenic organisms a mouse may carry one can monitor the individual mouse and mice colonies for subclinical carriers of zoonotic organisms by culturing the terminal intestinal tract mice are carriers of two potentially deadly viruses the hantaan disease virus and an arenavirus that causes lymphocytic choriomeningitis lcm in humans7 mice that are propagated for sale in the pet trade are rarely if ever exposed to the hantaan disease virus7 lymphocytic choriomeningitisinfected mice generally show no clinical signs although weight loss photophobia tremors and convulsions may occur7 humans are exposed to lcm through contaminated feces urine or a bite wound disease signs in humans infected with lcm are flu-like eg malaise headaches fever myalgia arthritis7 fatal aseptic meningitis or meningoencephalitis in humans infected with lcm is rare 
hymenolepis spp are cestodes found in mice that can infect humans if contaminated feces are ingested7 rarely identified in pet mice giardia spp are protozoan parasites that can cause severe gastroenteritis in humans because feces have to be ingested for someone to be exposed it is more common for children to become infected with zoonotic intestinal parasites than for adults using proper sanitary practices after handling mice helps reduce exposure to zoonotic intestinal parasites and other potentially transmissible diseases although there are diseases listed in this zoonotic section that can be transmitted from mice to humans the occurrence of this happening is extremely rare when commercially bred mice are purchased at reputable pet stores rats like mice are common laboratory animals and are propagated for commercial sale in the pet trade and for use as reptile food the life expectancy of a rat is 2 to 3 years unlike mice rats have excellent pet characteristics that include a charming personable disposition and extreme intelligence figure 12-6
 the common rat species maintained as a companion animal is rattus norvegicus with the white rat and hooded rat being the most common variations although rats have an excellent temperament for companionship they can inflict a serious bite if provoked also as with other animal species humans can be allergic to their hair skin dander and urine and salivary proteins2 rats are not as territorial as other rodent species and are very social the integument of rats is commonly associated with a number of presenting symptoms of disease as with mice a rats hair coat that has not been adequately maintained is often the first clinical sign associated with disease rats are fastidious with their grooming and when healthy maintain a very tidy hair coat common problems associated with a hair coat that is not maintained include general illness parasitism internal and external aggression by cagemates as a result of psychological trauma and infectious dermatitis 
staphylococcus aureus infections initiated by self-trauma due to a fur mite infestation will manifest as ulcerative dermatitis4 the most common tumor in rats is a mammary-associated fibroadenoma4 fibroadenomas rarely metastasize but are locally invasive and can grow to a large size a coronavirus is the etiologic agent behind sialodacryoadenitis which results in inflammation and swelling of the cervical salivary glands4 the most common disease presentations in rats involve the respiratory system the three major pathogens that infect rat respiratory systems are mycoplasma pulmonis streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium kutcheri
5 respiratory disease in rats often produces red tears and a red nasal discharge this red staining around the eyes and nose is not blood but porphyrins produced by an irritated harderian gland located behind each eye the red staining at the nasal opening is due to the drainage of the porphyrins via the nasolacrimal duct renal disease may present in older males in the form of chronic progressive nephrosis4 on necropsy kidneys in affected animals are enlarged appear pale and have a pitted mottled surface4
 rats are continuous polyestrous rodents that should be bred in polygamous or monogamous systems2 when breeding rats that are housed in a polygamous ratio it is recommended to have one male with two to six females2 females are removed from a polygamous cage on day 16 of gestation whereas the monogamous pair is maintained together with the young until weaning2

modified from bihune c bauck l basic anatomy physiology husbandry and clinical techniques in quesenberry ke carpenter jw editors ferrets rabbits and rodents clinical medicine and surgery ed 2 st louis 2004 wb saunders johnson-delaney ca harrison lr small rodents exotic companion medicine handbook for veterinarians lake worth fla 1996 wingers rats like mice can chew out of enclosures therefore it is important that the housing be rat proof regarding the animals ability to chew through the substance and escape into the house rats are maintained in environments that are similar to those of other small rodents but rats do not produce the quantities of odiferous urine associated with other rodents for rats large wire cages with easy-to-remove plastic bottoms are the optimal enclosure figure 12-7
 the recommended housing unit size for rats is 15-20 15-20 7-10 length width height for each adult rat with females and young requiring 2 to 3 times the space listed2 rats like to climb ramps and rope for exercise so a cage that is taller than the listed requirements would be better suited for most singly housed animals the major considerations for selecting an enclosure for rats as with mice are that it is resistant to their escape and easy to clean an open screen top on the enclosure is recommended for proper ventilation available rodent cages that fit this criterion are wire or metal mesh plastic and plexiglas if the plastic tube housing systems are used there should be routine cleaning of the sections using hot water and a mild detergent an owner must always monitor the cage for possible escape avenues especially if the animal has a predilection for modifying the cage opening through chewing it is very important to provide cage toys and exercise opportunities for rats therefore the enclosure should be large enough to house not only food and water containers but also cage toys and an exercise wheel although not a cage toy a hide box in some form should also be included for the psychological well-being of the animal this hide box can be a manufactured one or a small cardboard container that has one end cut out rats like to hide and also sleep during the day by providing this piece of cage furniture or deep enough substrate for the rat to burrow it will be able to sleep undisturbed during the daylight hours to prevent the buildup of urine and fecal material in the cage commercially available paper rodent bedding or hardwood shavings should be used as a cage substrate figure 12-8
 although softwood pine and cedar shavings are available the volatile oils that radiate from these substrates are irritating to small animals especially because they are in very close contact with the material these irritating compounds can cause dermal and respiratory inflammation often leading to secondary bacterial infections cardboard tissue tubes can be placed in a rat enclosure for chewing and play clothes items are not recommended in cages with animals that chew rats will shred the clothing items exposing thread and elastic material that can become entangled around a rats extremity leading to necrosis distal to the stricture it is recommended to change the substrate within the enclosure at least twice a week and more often if there is a problem with odor or excessive excreta temperature humidity and lighting within the enclosure should follow what is commonly maintained with the ambient conditions within the house for animals housed outside or in an outbuilding the temperature range should be 65 f to 85 f2 the preferred light cycle for rats is 12 hours of light alternating with 12 hours of darkness2
 there have been a number of studies investigating the recommended nutritional requirements of rats these studies have taken place because of the fact that rats are one of the most commonly used laboratory animals when investigating human disease processes the benefit of these dietary studies is the availability of commercially produced diets that provide the recommended daily nutritional requirements of the rat the problem that most owners face is the multitude of dietary products available for rats and owners often buy seed-based diets like mice rats will happily eat seed although seed-based diets are lacking in a number of the nutritional requirements needed to maintain long-term health commercial rodent biscuits or pellets with 20 to 27 protein are the recommended diets for rats the commercial rodent biscuits or pellets are the only food rats need to obtain their required nutrients again seed-based diets are not recommended nor is a significant supplementation of fruits nuts vegetables cheese or other human foods eg peanut butter if a treat is to be given yogurt or dried fruit treats manufactured specifically for rodents andor rats should be provided 2 to 3 times a week figure 12-9
 for younger rats less than 3 weeks old softer pellets are needed because babies start eating pellets and drinking water at 2 to 3 weeks of age2 a sipper bottle placed on the outside of the cage is easy to maintain and does not take up space within the enclosure if the cage is plastic or plexiglas modifications will be needed to attach the sipper bottle on the outside of the cage most sipper bottles come with attachment hardware to attach to wire cages fresh bottled water is recommended for rats although chlorinated tap water can also be used the water should be checked on a daily basis and clean water supplied at least every 2 days if not every day 
quarantining an animal is important for the pet owner who is introducing a new animal into a setting in which there is an established group as with other animals a 30-day quarantine period is recommended along with a physical examination and fecal parasite check unfortunately there is no time period that will screen 100 against potential infectious agents and with rats time is critical because their life span and reproductive time frame is so short quarantining the introduced animals in conditions similar to those in which they will be maintained permanently reduction of handling and providing adequate food and water will make for a smooth transition it is imperative that the owner screen the new animal for diseases and watch for any signs of illness all rats that are captive either as pets or in a breeding setup should have no access to insects wild rodents or other animals the most common sign of clinical illness is an unkempt hair coat the lack of grooming is most often related to the animal feeling depressed or sick and thereby not having the energy to perform routine behaviors if a number of animals are being quarantined sacrificing an apparently diseased animal is the most efficient way to determine a rapid definitive diagnosis if it is a single or an expensive animal routine diagnostic testing will be required to maintain oversight of a breeding animals health and reduce the exposure of young animals to infectious disease and parasites routine screening of representative animals within the colony is recommended in very large colonies special caging eg filter food and water may be necessary to maintain disease control1
 before examining a rat the examination table should be disinfected with either a dilute sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine solution the examiner should always wash his or her hands and if necessary put on gloves before the capture and restraint of the patient the difficulty with using latex gloves when examining a rat is the small size of the patient and its ability to twist and turn some rat patients can be restrained only if the examiner is not wearing gloves if gloves are not worn the examiner must thoroughly wash his or her hands as with all cases after the examination is completed to restrain a rat the animal should be picked up with one hand being placed over the back and rib cage restraining the head with the thumb and forefinger directly behind the jaws the other hand is grasping the tail stabilizing the animal figure 12-10
 the skin on the dorsal cervical region may also be used as with other rodents to pick up the rat a plastic sandwich bag can be modified as a restraint device for rats and small rodents the rats head is placed toward a bottom corner and the sides folded over the animals back to limit movement if one is unable to adequately restrain a rat while the animal is conscious an inhalant anesthetic may be used for sedation purposes the animal should be placed in a small induction chamber and isoflurane gas permeated into the closed space figure 12-11
 once the animal has stopped moving the enclosure top is removed and a nose cone placed on the anesthesia tube and placed on the patients face a syringe case can be modified as a nose cone for small rodents after the physical examination is completed the nose cone is removed and the patient is allowed to recover breathing oxygen from the anesthesia unit injectable agents are another form of sedation used with rats for examination and diagnostic sample collection purposes see table 12-2 a thorough assessment of the patient is necessary before using injectable drugs for sedation and anesthesia because of the inability of veterinarians or technicians to rapidly manipulate the effects of these treatments 
obtaining a detailed history for the rat patient is very important it is imperative to get as much information from the owner as possible as it relates to the patients presenting problem even if it is routine health examination typical background information required for the rat patient includes how long the owner has had the animal where it was acquired how often it is handled and the appearance of the feces and urine husbandry questions should focus on where the animal is housed whether it is allowed to roam unobserved where its cage is located type size and material of the cage cage substrate furniture and toys how often the cage is cleaned and what disinfectant is used when investigating the diet it is important to ask not only if pellets are fed and in what quantity but also what the animal is eating and what its primary diet is supplemental offerings and frequency of feeding are very important data for the case work-up the technician should find out about the water supply how often the water is changed and how much the animal drinks on a daily basis because there are transmissible diseases among animals the final questions should center on other pets in the household if new animals have been added to the family or if the animals are housed together a description of any previous problems and a complete chronological description of the presenting problem are needed to complete the history form before restraining the animal an observation should be made on its attitude activity and posture the next step is to weigh the rat in a basket on a digital gram scale if possible temperature respiration and pulse should be measured and any abnormalities in rate andor character noted the physical examination starts at the head where the veterinarian should look for any abnormalities eyes ears and nares are observed for signs of discharge or inflammation the oral cavity is difficult to examine in rats because of the small opening and tendency for the buccal mucosa to encroach toward the middle of the mouth rat incisors have a tendency to overgrow so examination of the front teeth for normal occlusion and length is essential a small speculum eg modified paper clip or an otoscope may be used to examine the oral cavity and cheek teeth mucous membranes help determine hydration status using capillary refill time and moisture body condition should be examined and abdominal palpation performed lymph nodes and limbs are palpated before checking the nails and plantar surface of each foot the patient should have a normal posture be aware of its surroundings and move properly any problems should be noted in the record finally a dermatologic exam considers hair coat quality alopecia external parasites or any skin abnormalities all abnormal findings are written in the record for case review differential diagnoses determination diagnostic testing and treatment considerations respiratory disease is often the primary complaint offered by owners when presenting a sick rat to the veterinary hospital bacterial and viral pathogens can infect rats and are easily spread within breeding colonies because most of the organisms are transmitted by subclinical carriers ocular and nasal discharge is often observed in combination with dark red pigment this pigment may be mistaken for blood by owners but actually is porphyrins produced by the harderian glands located behind the eyes the irritation of the harderian glands causes the excessive production of porphyrins which are secreted around the eye and down the nasolacrimal duct to the nose rats have incisors that grow continuously the continuous growth is not a problem for animals with normal occlusion if the incisors do not line up then there is a condition that leads to overgrowth of these teeth the upper incisors will curve around and if they are not cut they will lodge in the dorsal aspect of the oral cavity the ventral incisors will flare out from the oral cavity a common tumor found in older intact female rats is the mammary tumor mammary tumors can be large and extensive rat mammary tissue extends on their ventrum from the inguinal area to the thoracic inlet and up to their dorsal lateral body wall the most common subcutaneous mammary tumor in the rat is a fibroadenoma figure 12-12
4 removing the ovaries at an early age reduces the incidence of the hormonally influenced tumor later in a female rats life swelling of the cervical salivary gland is caused by a virus the etiologic agent of this condition is a coronavirus sialodacryoadenitis virus resulting in upper respiratory inflammation and the previously mentioned swelling of the cervical salivary and lacrimal gland4 there is no treatment for this highly contagious viral disease external and internal parasites may affect rats in the form of a rough hair coat or dermal lesions rats that are pruritic may cause abrasions or scratches that become infected with staphylococcus aureus bacteria leading to secondary ulcerative dermatitis4 routine parasite examinations are necessary so that the veterinarian can identify parasitic infestations and administer treatment rats can also present with neurologic gastrointestinal and urinary disease signs a detailed history and examination will help direct the clinician toward a differential diagnosis list in which the appropriate diagnostic tests can be submitted to obtain a definitive diagnosis as with other pocket pets blood collection from rats can be quite difficult approximately 05 to 07 ml100 g body weight can be safely removed from a nonanemic healthy rat2 a rat patient should always be anesthetized for blood collection procedures to reduce patient stress and movement usually inducing the animals in a closed chamber and maintaining the patients in a mask will allow the technician plenty of time to collect the blood sample using a warmed ventral tail vein 05 ml can be collected through a 23-gauge butterfly needle2 to collect from the tail vein warm the distal two-thirds of the ventral aspect of the tail in a container of warm water for approximately 15 minutes2 the tail vein can be observed more clearly in the distal aspect of the tail a 22- to 25-gauge butterfly needle is used and free flowing blood can be collected directly into the microtainer tubes2 a tape bandage should be placed on the injection site to aid in hemostasis the easiest way to collect blood from many small mammals including rats is from the anterior vena cava with the rat under general anesthesia a 25-gauge 1-inch needle attached to a 3-ml syringe is directed toward the umbilicus from the right side of the manubrium2

describes the technique used for retroorbital bleeding in rats and is not recommended for companion animals the retroorbital bleeding technique is commonly used in laboratory animal settings and is easily performed by an experienced veterinarian or veterinary technician as with smaller rodents the saphenous vein or lateral vein of the tarsus may be used for multiple blood collections without the use of an anesthetic the patient must be properly immobilized in a restraint tube 35-ml syringe with the leg extended and the skin on the medial aspect of the thigh held tightly between the handlers thumb and forefinger the taut skin on the lateral aspect of the thigh allows exposure of the saphenous vein a 23-gauge needle is used to puncture the vein and blood is collected in a microhematocrit tube as it flows from the vessel2
 blood samples obtained from nail and ear clips are not considered appropriate diagnostic samples cardiac puncture is recommended only in terminal cases and when the animal is maintained under general anesthesia because of possible complications involving the lungs and heart vessels the collection of samples for diagnostic testing in rats is similar to that in other rodents the reference ranges for complete blood counts and serum biochemistry panels are listed in box 12-9 box 12-10

 for the rat patient in which microbiological testing is recommended standard collection techniques used for other animals are appropriate with the most common respiratory conditions in rats being viral and bacterial organisms it is important to try and aid the diagnostic laboratory in organism isolation through listing the potential pathogens as always if in doubt on collecting preserving andor shipping a microbiological sample the diagnostic laboratory should be contacted for full instructions regarding rat submissions

staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of ulcerative dermatitis in rats4 this organism is ubiquitous in most rat colonies and survives on the animals skin unless there is a break in the skin there is no infection or disease caused by the organism in cases where there is a fur mite radfordia ensifera infestation rats become pruritic developing lesions that seed the s aureus organism4 the ulcerative dermatitis can be treated with an appropriate antibiotic through both systemic and topical application cleaning the affected areas and clipping the toe nails of the rear feet 
mycoplasma pulmonis streptococcus pneumoniae corynebacterium kutscheri sendai virus and cilia-associated respiratory bacillus have been isolated and identified as infectious agents causing rat respiratory disease4 with the respiratory pathogens clinical signs can vary from mild dyspnea to severe pneumonia and death rats with mycoplasmosis are treated in much the same way as infected mice sialodacryoadenitis virus is a highly contagious disease that causes rhinitis and inflammation of the cervical salivary and lacrimal glands4 there is no treatment for this viral disease and supportive care is recommended for the affected patient there are other infectious diseases that can infect rats as evidenced by the available serologic tests eg kilhams rat virus pneumonia virus of mice rat parvovirus rat coronavirus toolans h-1 virus theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus mouse adenovirus reovirus 3 these infectious diseases are diagnosed less commonly than those previously identified even so veterinarians should be aware of the infectious disease organisms to which rat patients may be exposed and aware that tests are available for antemortem diagnosis specific intestinal parasites identified in rats include the dwarf tapeworm hymenolepis nana pinworms syphacia muris nematodes specifically trichosomoides crassicauda and giardia muris
5 diagnosis of intestinal parasites is important for the implementation of the appropriate treatment plan pinworms are diagnosed through the anal tape test protozoan parasites eg giardia muris through a direct fecal exam and cestodes and nematodes from fecal flotation on macerated fecal pellets5 once the parasite has been identified proper treatment can be initiated and environmental recommendations applied to prevent exposure of other animals and reexposure of the patient being treated rats do not appear as susceptible to ectoparasites as mice but the following have been identified ornithonyssus bacoti tropical rat mite radfordia ensifera rat fur mite demodex nanus demodex polyplax spinulosa the spined rat louse and fleas5 diagnosis and treatments are similar to those recommended for mice although the dosages and duration differ treatment of ectoparasites can be accomplished with ivermectin and a topical miticide as with other rodent species there has been an increasing ectoparasite resistance to ivermectin treatment because most rodent diets are manufactured in the form of pellets or small biscuits that provide all recommended nutrients there are few nutritional disease problems diagnosed in pet rats it is also important to provide an adequate supply of fresh water and appropriate rodent food on a daily basis if rats are fed an all-seed diet there could be nutrition-related consequences a lack of vitamin a could result in roughened hair coat or skin lesions a breakdown of the protective epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal andor respiratory tract could predispose the rat to secondary bacterial infections affecting those body systems2 nutritional deficiencies may also result in poor reproductive activity vitamins b complex c and e plus selenium are recommended for treatment of female rats diagnosed with pregnancy toxemia2
 rats if fed a high quantity of human food will develop dental plaque on the cheek teeth8 proper diet primarily rodent biscuits or pellets will reduce the formation and buildup of dental plaque8 if left unattended the excess plaque may lead to gum disease and dental caries if caries develop within cheek teeth the recommended treatment is removal of the affected teeth8
 rats are susceptible to tumors most likely because of their short life span and physiologic predisposition the most common subcutaneous tumor in rats is the fibroadenoma of the mammary tissue4 the mammary tumors can reach very large sizes and affect both males and females to reduce the incidence of fibroadenomas ovariohysterectomies are advocated at an early age in female animals whereas mammary tumors in mice are almost always malignant rat mammary tumors are usually localized and respond to surgical resection4
 rats have continuously growing incisors under normal anatomic conditions the incisors maintain their length by grinding on their occlusive surface if the position of the incisors is compromised malocclusion will occur causing overgrowth of their front teeth the teeth if left untrimmed can cause trauma to the dorsal surface of the oral cavity upper incisors and the lower teeth extending outside of the mouth in severe cases the teeth may adversely affect the animals ability to eat the teeth can be trimmed with a high-speed motor tool eg dremel with a cutting disk attachment a common disease in older male rats is chronic progressive nephrosis the disease can also affect females4 the protein level in the urine commonly exceeds 10 mgday and progressively increases as the animal ages4 the pathophysiology of chronic progressive nephrosis involves glomerulosclerosis with tubulointerstitial disease primarily affecting the convoluted proximal tubule4 the progression of the disease process may be slowed through a low-protein diet and anabolic steroid therapy4
 fluid therapy can be given to rats through intramuscular subcutaneous intraperitoneal and intravenous routes using a 25-gauge needle a volume of up to 02 ml of fluid can be injected into the quadriceps muscle2 up to 5 ml of fluid can be injected under the loose skin covering the neck or lateral body wall2 intraperitoneal fluids should be administered while the rat is properly restrained to restrict movement with one of the rats hindlimbs extended a 25-gauge needle is inserted into the center of the caudal quadrant of the abdomen following the line of the extended leg2 up to 5 ml of fluids can be given via the intraperitoneal route2 the most difficult method of providing fluids is intravenously to the lateral tail vein to access the tail vein warming the tail to dilate the vessel in warm water for approximately 15 minutes is required to aid in visualization2 the older the animal is the more difficult it is to see the vessel through the tail skin although there are many methods that may be used to administer medication in small mammals oral treatment with a dropper or tuberculin syringe is the easiest for the veterinarian and least stressful to the patient medication can be added to the food or water but often the patient is anorexic or the medicated foodwater is not palatable in which case the patient does not receive treatment both oral medication and nutritional supplementation can be administered through an oral gastric feeding tube to rat patients the techniques described earlier for mice can also be applied to rats medication dosages for rats can be found in a number of formularies before administration of any therapeutic agent the dosage should be checked twice and calculations thoroughly evaluated to make sure they are correct the same surgical and anesthetic techniques described for mice can be used for rats see box 12-6 dosages for rat injectable anesthetic and sedative agents and analgesic treatment can be found in table 12-1 table 12-2 rats are larger than mice and can be intubated using a modified otoscope head figure 12-13
 when using inhalant anesthesia an intubated animal can be ventilated and there is less risk of aspiration from fluid that enters the oral cavity surgical procedures that are performed on rat patients use similar techniques utilized on larger animals veterinary surgeons should follow the same protocols but remember that the surgical field is small and patient manipulation is delicate the most common surgical procedures performed on rats are castration ovariohysterectomy and tumor especially mammary tumor removal occurrences of humans becoming infected with zoonotic diseases associated with pet rats are uncommon as with mice an allergic reaction to rat dander and urine may be the most commonly reported zoonotic condition as with all animals it is important that a handler always wash his or her hands after interacting with a rat salmonella spp may colonize the intestinal tract of rats7
 there has been a human case of chorioamnionitis in which corynebacterium kutscheri has been isolated7 this gram-positive bacillus is routinely isolated from the nasopharynx of rats and therefore can be considered a zoonotic agent 
streptobacillus moniliformis and spirillum minus are organisms that initiate the disease called rat-bite fever7 a rat bite is required to seed the bacteria in a human and after a 6- to 10-day incubation cycle the human begins to show clinical signs associated with the disease eg relapsing fever chills vomiting myalgia regional lymphadenopathy7
 rats appear to be one of the primary rodent carriers of streptococcus pneumoniae the rodent develops respiratory disease through which the organism is shed and humans are exposed infected humans have respiratory and meningeal disease signs associated with s pneumoniae illness7
 it should be mentioned that the rodent flea xenopsylla cheopis transmits the plague organism yersinia pestis
7 it is wild rodents in which the plague organism is of most concern but the disease is found worldwide especially in the american southwest this is a very good reason why rats under the care of humans should have no access to wild animals 
leptospira interrogans is transmitted from the infected urine of rats7 again restricting contact with wild rodents will reduce the risk of pet exposure humans infected with l interrogans have chills and fever and often develop septicemic conditions that can lead to organ dysfunction7
 
hymenolepis sp is a cestode found in rats which can infect humans if contaminated feces are ingested7
giardia sp is a protozoan parasite rarely identified in pet rats that can cause severe gastroenteritis in humans7 because feces have to be ingested for exposure it is more common for children to become infected with zoonotic intestinal parasites than for adults proper sanitary practices after handling rats will help reduce humans exposure to zoonotic intestinal parasites and other potentially transmissible diseases all potential rat owners and current rat owners should know that the occurrence of zoonotic disease transmission is extremely rare when commercially bred rats are purchased from reputable pet stores  impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in china yun qiu xi chen wei shi   the first pneumonia case of unknown cause was found close to a seafood market in wuhan the capital city of hubei province china on december 8 2019 several clusters of patients with similar pneumonia were reported through late december 2019 the pneumonia was later identified to be caused by a new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 zhu et al 2020 later named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who1 while the seafood market was closed on january 1 2020 a massive outflow of travelers during the chinese spring festival travel rush chunyun in mid-january2 led to the rapid spread of covid-19 throughout china and to other countries the first confirmed case outside wuhan in china was reported in shenzhen on january 19 li et al 2020 as of april 5 over 12 million confirmed cases were reported in at least 200 countries or territories3 two fundamental strategies have been taken globally one focused on mitigating but not necessarily stopping the virus spread and the other relying on more stringent measures to suppress and reverse the growth trajectories while most western countries initially implemented the former strategy more and more of them including most european countries and the usa have since shifted towards the more stringent suppression strategy and some other countries such as china singapore and south korea have adopted the latter strategy from the beginning in particular china has rolled out one of the most stringent public health strategies that strategy involves city lockdowns and mandatory quarantines to ban or restrict traffic since january 23 social distanceencouraging strategies since january 28 and a centralized treatment and isolation strategy since february 2 this study estimates how the number of daily newly confirmed covid-19 cases in a city is influenced by the number of new covid-19 cases in the same city nearby cities and wuhan during the preceding 2 weeks using the data on confirmed covid-19 case counts in china from january 19 to february 29 by comparing the estimates before and after february 2 we examine whether the comprehensive set of policies at the national scale delays the spread of covid-19 besides we estimate the impacts of social distancing measures in reducing the transmission rate utilizing the closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions policies that were gradually rolled out across different cities as covid-19 evolves into a global pandemic and mitigating strategies are faced with growing pressure to flatten the curve of virus transmissions more and more nations are considering implementing stringent suppression measures therefore examining the factors that influence the transmission of covid-19 and the effectiveness of the large-scale mandatory quarantine and social distancing measures in china not only adds to our understanding of the containment of covid-19 but also provides insights into future prevention work against similar infectious diseases in a linear equation of the current number of new cases on the number of new cases in the past the unobserved determinants of new infections may be serially correlated for two reasons first the number of people infected by a disease usually first increases reaches a peak and then drops second there are persistent unobservable variables such as clusters that generate large numbers of infections peoples living habits and government policies serial correlations in errors give rise to correlations between the lagged numbers of cases and the error term rendering the ordinary least square ols estimator biased combining insights in adda 2016 the existing knowledge of the incubation period of covid-19 world health organization 2020b and data on weather conditions that affect the transmission rates of covid-19 lowen and steel 2014 wang et al 2020b we construct instrumental variables for the number of new covid-19 cases during the preceding 2 weeks weather characteristics in the previous third and fourth weeks do not directly affect the number of new covid-19 cases after controlling for the number of new covid-19 cases and weather conditions in the preceding first and second weeks therefore our estimated impacts have causal interpretations and reflect population transmission rates meanwhile we estimate the mediating effects of socioeconomic factors on the transmission of covid-19 in china these factors include population flow out of wuhan the distance between cities gdp per capita the number of doctors and contemporaneous weather conditions we examine whether population flows from the origin of the covid-19 outbreak which is a major city and an important transportation hub in central china can explain the spread of the virus using data on real-time travel intensity between cities that have recently become available for research realizing the urgency of forestalling widespread community transmissions in areas that had not seen many infections in late january many chinese cities implemented public health measures that encourage social distancing we also examine the impacts of these measures on curtailing the spread of the virus we find that transmission rates were lower in february than in january and cities outside hubei province had lower transmission rates preventing the transmission rates in non-hubei cities from increasing to the level observed in late january in hubei caused the largest reduction in the number of infections apart from the policies implemented nationwide the additional social distancing policies imposed in some cities in late january further helped reduce the number of infections by mid february the spread of the virus was contained in china while many socioeconomic factors moderated the spread of the virus the actual population flow from the source posed a higher risk to destinations than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions our analysis contributes to the existing literature in three aspects first our analysis is connected to the economics and epidemiological literature on the determinants of the spread of infectious diseases and prevention of such spread existing studies find that reductions in population flow zhan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 fang et al 2020 and interpersonal contact from holiday school closings adda 2016 reactive school closures litvinova et al 2019 public transportation strikes godzinski and suarez castillo 2019 strategic targeting of travelers from high-incidence locations milusheva 2017 and paid sick leave to keep contagious workers at home barmby and larguem 2009 pichler and ziebarth 2017 can mitigate the prevalence of disease transmissions in addition studies show viruses spread faster during economic booms adda 2016 increases in employment are associated with increased incidence of influenza markowitz et al 2019 and growth in trade can significantly increase the spread of influenza adda 2016 and hiv oster 2012 vaccination maurer 2009 white 2019 and sunlight exposure slusky and zeckhauser 2018 are also found effective in reducing the spread of influenza second our paper adds to the epidemiological studies on the basic reproduction number r0 of covid-19 ie the average number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection given the short time period since the beginning of the covid-19 outbreak research is urgently needed to assess the dynamics of transmissions and the implications for how the covid-19 outbreak will evolve wu et al 2020b 2020c liu et al 2020 identify 12 studies that estimated the basic reproductive number in the wide range of 14 to 65 with a mean of 328 and a median of 279 for wuhan hubei china or overseas during january 1 through january 28 20204 our r0 estimate relies on spatially disaggregated data during an extended period until february 29 2020 to mitigate potential biases and the instrumental variable approach we use isolates the causal effect of virus transmissions and imposes fewer restrictions on the relationship between the unobserved determinants of new cases and the number of cases in the past simultaneously considering a more comprehensive set of factors in the model that may influence virus spread we find that one case generates 2992 more cases within 2 weeks 1876 if cities in hubei province are excluded in the sub-sample from january 19 to february 1 in the sub-sample from february 2 to february 29 the transmission rates fall to 1243 0614 excluding hubei province our estimate of r0 for the period in late january 2020 that overlaps with existing studies falls well within the range of the estimated r0 in the emerging covid-19 literature liu et al 2020 third our study contributes to the assessments of public health measures aiming at reducing virus transmissions and mortality through a set of policy simulations we report initial evidence on the number of avoided infections through the end of february 2020 for cities outside hubei province specifically the stringent health policies at the national and provincial levels reduced the transmission rate and resulted in 1408479 95 ci 815585 to 2001373 fewer infections and potentially 56339 fewer deaths5 in contrast the effects of the wuhan lockdown and local non-pharmaceutical interventions npis are considerably smaller as a result of the wuhan lockdown closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions 31071 95 ci 8296 to 53845 3803 95 ci 1142 to 6465 and 2703 95 ci 654 to 4751 fewer cases were avoided respectively these three policies may respectively avoid 1243 deaths 152 deaths and 108 deaths making some additional assumptions such as the value of statistical life and lost productive time these estimates may provide the basis for more rigorous cost-benefit analysis regarding relevant public health measures this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the empirical model section 3 discusses our data and the construction of key variables section 4 presents the results section 5 documents the public health measures implemented in china whose impacts are quantified in a series of counterfactual exercises section 6 concludes the appendix contains additional details on the instrumental variables data quality and the computation of counterfactuals our analysis sample includes 304 prefecture-level cities in china we exclude wuhan the capital city of hubei province from our analysis for two reasons first the epidemic patterns in wuhan are significantly different from those in other cities some confirmed cases in wuhan contracted the virus through direct exposure to huanan seafood wholesale market which is the most probable origin of the virus6 in other cities infections arise from human-to-human transmissions second covid-19 cases were still pneumonia of previously unknown virus infections in peoples perception until early january so that wuhans health care system became overwhelmed as the number of new confirmed cases increased exponentially since mid-january this may have caused severe delay and measurement errors in the number of cases reported in wuhan and to a lesser extent in other cities in hubei province to alleviate this concern we also conduct analyses excluding all cities in hubei province from our sample to model the spread of the virus we consider within-city spread and between-city transmissions simultaneously adda 2016 our starting point is

				begindocumentbar zttau enddocumentzt may be correlated with the error term ct the unobserved determinants of new infections such as local residents and governments preparedness are likely correlated over time which causes correlations between the error term and the lagged dependent variables as noted by the world health organization 2020b most cases that were locally generated outside hubei occurred in households or clusters the fact that big clusters give rise to a large number of cases within a short period of time may still be compatible with a general low rate of community transmissions especially when measures such as social distancing are implemented therefore the coefficients are estimated by two-stage least squares in order to obtain consistent estimates on the transmission rates in the population
 in eq 2 the instrumental variables include averages of daily maximum temperature total precipitation average wind speed and the interaction between precipitation and wind speed for city c in the preceding third and fourth weeks detailed discussion of the selection of weather characteristics as instruments is in section 32 the timeline of key variables are displayed in fig 1 the primary assumption on the instrumental variables is that weather conditions before 2 weeks do not affect the likelihood that a person susceptible to the virus contracts the disease conditional on weather conditions and the number of infectious people within the 2-week window on the other hand they affect the number of other persons who have become infectious within the 2-week window because they may have contracted the virus earlier than 2 weeks these weather variables are exogenous to the error term and affect the spread of the virus which have been used by adda 2016 to instrument flu infections9
 another objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus which may identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections for within-city transmissions we consider the effects of local public health measures see section 5 for details and the mediating effects of population density level of economic development number of doctors and environmental factors such as temperature wind and precipitation for between-city transmissions apart from proximity measures based on geographic distance we also consider similarity in population density and the level of economic development to measure the spread of the virus from wuhan we also include the number of people traveling from wuhan the full empirical model is as follows 3documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentbar mctext wuhantktau enddocumentmcwuhantk are the mediating factors for between-city transmissions and imported cases from wuhan january 19 2020 is the first day that covid-19 cases were reported outside of wuhan so we collect the daily number of new cases of covid-19 for 305 cities from january 19 to february 29 all these data are reported by 32 provincial-level health commissions in china10 figure 2 shows the time patterns of daily confirmed new cases in wuhan in hubei province outside wuhan and in non-hubei provinces of mainland china because hubei province started to include clinically diagnosed cases into new confirmed cases on february 12 we notice a spike in the number of new cases in wuhan and other cities in hubei province on this day fig 2 the common effects of such changes in case definitions on other cities can be absorbed by time fixed effects as robustness checks we re-estimate models a and b without the cities in hubei province in addition since the number of clinically diagnosed cases at the city level was reported for the days of february 12 13 and 14 we recalculated the daily number of new cases for the 3 days by removing the clinically diagnosed cases from our data and re-estimate models a and b our main findings still hold appendix b
 regarding the explanatory variables we calculate the number of new cases of covid-19 in the preceding first and second weeks for each city on each day to estimate the impacts of new covid-19 cases in other cities we first calculate the geographic distance between a city and all other cities using the latitudes and longitudes of the centroids of each city and then calculate the weighted sum of the number of covid-19 new cases in all other cities using the inverse of log distance between a city and each of the other cities as the weight since the covid-19 outbreak started from wuhan we also calculate the weighted number of covid-19 new cases in wuhan using the inverse of log distance as the weight furthermore to explore the mediating impact of population flow from wuhan we collect the daily population flow index from baidu that proxies for the total intensity of migration from wuhan to other cities11 figure 3 plots the baidu index of population flow out of wuhan and compares its values this year with those in 2019 we then interact the flow index with the share that a destination city takes fig 4 to construct a measure on the population flow from wuhan to a destination city other mediating variables include population density gdp per capita and the number of doctors at the city level which we collect from the most recent china city statistical yearbook table 1 presents the summary statistics of these variables on average gdp per capita and population density are larger in cities outside hubei province than those in hubei compared with cities in hubei province cities outside hubei have more doctors
 we rely on meteorological data to construct instrumental variables for the endogenous variables the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa provides average maximum and minimum temperatures air pressure average and maximum wind speeds precipitation snowfall amount and dew point for 362 weather stations at the daily level in china to merge the meteorological variables with the number of new cases of covid-19 we first calculate daily weather variables for each city on each day from 2019 december to 2020 february from station-level weather records following the inverse distance weighting method specifically for each city we draw a circle of 100 km from the citys centroid and calculate the weighted average daily weather variables using stations within the 100-km circle12 we use the inverse of the distance between the citys centroid and each station as the weight second we match the daily weather variables to the number of new cases of covid-19 based on city name and date
 the transmission rate of covid-19 may be affected by many environmental factors human-to-human transmission of covid-19 is mostly through droplets and contacts national health commission of the prc 2020 weather conditions such as rainfall wind speed and temperature may shape infections via their influences on social activities and virus transmissions for instance increased precipitation results in higher humidity which may weaken virus transmissions lowen and steel 2014 the virus may survive longer with lower temperature wang et al 2020b puhani 2020 greater wind speed and therefore ventilated air may decrease virus transmissions in addition increased rainfall and lower temperature may also reduce social activities newly confirmed covid-19 cases typically arise from contracting the virus within 2 weeks in the past eg world health organization 2020b the extent of human-to-human transmission is determined by the number of people who have already contracted the virus and the environmental conditions within the next 2 weeks conditional on the number of people who are infectious and environmental conditions in the previous first and second weeks it is plausible that weather conditions further in the past ie in the previous third and fourth weeks should not directly affect the number of current new cases based on the existing literature we select weather characteristics as the instrumental variables which include daily maximum temperature precipitation wind speed and the interaction between precipitation and wind speed we then regress the endogenous variables on the instrumental variables contemporaneous weather controls city date and city by week fixed effects table 2 shows that f-tests on the coefficients of the instrumental variables all reject joint insignificance which confirms that overall the selected instrumental variables are not weak the coefficients of the first stage regressions are reported in table 9 in the appendix
 we also need additional weather variables to instrument the adoption of public health measures at the city level since there is no theoretical guidance from the existing literature we implement the cluster-lasso method of belloni et al 2016 and ahrens et al 2019 to select weather characteristics that have good predictive power details are displayed in appendix a table 3 reports the estimation results of the ols and iv regressions of eq 2 in which only within-city transmission is considered after controlling for time-invariant city fixed effects and time effects that are common to all cities on average one new infection leads to 1142 more cases in the next week but 0824 fewer cases 1 week later the negative effect can be attributed to the fact that both local authorities and residents would have taken more protective measures in response to a higher perceived risk of contracting the virus given more time information disclosure on newly confirmed cases at the daily level by official media and information dissemination on social media throughout china may have promoted more timely actions by the public resulting in slower virus transmissions we then compare the transmission rates in different time windows in the first sub-sample one new infection leads to 2135 more cases within a week implying a fast growth in the number of cases however in the second sub-sample the effect decreases to 1077 suggesting that public health measures imposed in late january were effective in limiting a further spread of the virus similar patterns are also observed in model b
 many cases were also reported in other cities in hubei province apart from wuhan where six of them reported over 1000 cumulative cases by february 1513 their overstretched health care system exacerbates the concern over delayed reporting of confirmed cases in these cities to mitigate the effect of such potential measurement errors on our estimates we re-estimate 2 excluding all cities in hubei province the bottom panel of table 3 reports these estimates comparing the iv estimates in columns 4 and 6 between the upper and lower panels we find that the transmission rates are lower in cities outside hubei in the january 19february 1 sub-sample one new case leads to 1483 more cases in the following week and this is reduced to 0903 in the february 2february 29 sub-sample we also find a similar pattern when comparing the estimates from model b people may contract the virus from interaction with the infected people who live in the same city or other cities in eq 1 we consider the effects of the number of new infections in other cities and in the epicenter of the epidemic wuhan respectively using inverse log distance as weights in addition geographic proximity may not fully describe the level of social interactions between residents in wuhan and other cities since the lockdown in wuhan on january 23 significantly reduced the population flow from wuhan to other cities to alleviate this concern we also use a measure of the size of population flow from wuhan to a destination city which is constructed by multiplying the daily migration index on the population flow out of wuhan fig 3 with the share of the flow that a destination city receives provided by baidu fig 4 for days before january 25 we use the average destination shares between january 10 and january 24 for days on or after january 24 we use the average destination shares between january 25 and february 2314
 table 4 reports the estimates from iv regressions of eq 1 and table 5 reports the results from the same regressions excluding hubei province column 4 of table 4 indicates that in the first sub-sample one new case leads to 2456 more cases within 1 week and the effect is not statistically significant between 1 and 2 weeks column 6 suggests that in the second sub-sample one new case leads to 1127 more cases within 1 week and the effect is not statistically significant between 1 and 2 weeks the comparison of the coefficients on own city between different sub-samples indicates that the responses of the government and the public have effectively decreased the risk of additional infections comparing table 4 with table 3 we find that although the number of new cases in the preceding second week turns insignificant and smaller in magnitude coefficients on the number of new cases in the preceding first week are not sensitive to the inclusion of terms on between-city transmissions
 as a robustness test table 5 reports the estimation results excluding the cities in hubei province column 4 of table 5 indicates that in the first sub-sample one new case leads to 1194 more cases within a week while in the second sub-sample one new case only leads to 0899 more cases within a week besides in the second subsample one new case results in 0250 fewer new infections between 1 and 2 weeks which is larger in magnitude and more significant than the estimate  0171 when cities in hubei province are included for estimation column 6 of table 4 the time varying patterns in local transmissions are evident using the rolling window analysis fig 5 the upper left panel displays the estimated coefficients on local transmissions for various 14-day sub-samples with the starting date labelled on the horizontal axis after a slight increase in the local transmission rates one case generally leads to fewer and fewer additional cases a few days after january 19 besides the transmission rate displays a slight increase beginning around february 4 which corresponds to the return travels and work resumption after chinese spring festival but eventually decreases at around february 12 such decrease may be partly attributed to the social distancing strategies at the city level so we examine the impacts of relevant policies in section 5 moreover the transmission rates in cities outside hubei province have been kept at low levels throughout the whole sample period columns 4 and 6 of table 5 these results suggest that the policies adopted at the national and provincial levels soon after january 19 prevented cities outside hubei from becoming new hotspots of infections overall the spread of the virus has been effectively contained by mid february particularly for cities outside hubei province

				begindocument14sim 65enddocument1465 liu et al 2020 its value depends on the estimation method used underlying assumptions of modeling time period covered geographic regions with varying preparedness of health care systems and factors considered in the models that affect disease transmissions such as the behavior of the susceptible and infected population intuitively it can be interpreted as measuring the expected number of new cases that are generated by one existing case it is of interest to note that our estimates are within this range based on the results from model b in tables 4 and 5 one case leads to 2992 more cases in the same city in the next 14 days 1876 if cities in hubei province are excluded in the second sub-sample february 2february 29 these numbers are reduced to 1243 and 0614 respectively suggesting that factors such as public health measures and peoples behavior may play an important role in containing the transmission of covid-19 while our basic reproduction number estimate r0 is within the range of estimates in the literature and is close to its median five features may distinguish our estimates from some of the existing epidemiological estimates first our instrumental variable approach helps isolate the causal effect of virus transmissions from other confounded factors second our estimate is based on an extended time period of the covid-19 pandemic until the end of february 2020 that may mitigate potential biases in the literature that relies on a shorter sampling period within 128 january 2020 third our modeling makes minimum assumptions of virus transmissions such as imposing fewer restrictions on the relationship between the unobserved determinants of new cases and the number of cases in the past fourth our model simultaneously considers comprehensive factors that may affect virus transmissions including multiple policy instruments such as closed management of communities and shelter-at-home order population flow within- and between-city transmissions economic and demographic conditions weather patterns and preparedness of health care system fifth our study uses spatially disaggregated data that cover china except its hubei province while some other studies examine wuhan city hubei province china as a whole or overseas regarding the between-city transmission from wuhan we observe that the population flow better explains the contagion effect than geographic proximity table 4 in the first sub-sample one new case in wuhan leads to more cases in other cities receiving more population flows from wuhan within 1 week interestingly in the second sub-sample population flow from wuhan significantly decreases the transmission rate within 1 week suggesting that people have been taking more cautious measures from high covid-19 risk areas however more arrivals from wuhan in the preceding second week can still be a risk a back of the envelope calculation indicates that one new case in wuhan leads to 0064 0050 more cases in the destination city per 10000 travelers from wuhan within 1 2 week between january 19 and february 1 february 2 and february 2915 note that while the effect is statistically significant it should be interpreted in context it was estimated that 15000000 people would travel out of wuhan during the lunar new year holiday16 if all had gone to one city this would have directly generated about 171 cases within 2 weeks the risk of infection is likely very low for most travelers except for few who have previous contacts with sources of infection and person-specific history of past contacts may be an essential predictor for infection risk in addition to the total number of population flows17 a city may also be affected by infections in nearby cities apart from spillovers from wuhan we find that the coefficients that represent the infectious effects from nearby cities are generally small and not statistically significant table 4 implying that few cities outside wuhan are themselves exporting infections this is consistent with the findings in the world health organization 2020b that other than cases that are imported from hubei additional human-to-human transmissions are limited for cities outside hubei restricting to cities outside hubei province the results are similar table 5 except that the transmission from wuhan is not significant in the first half sample we also investigate the mediating impacts of some socioeconomic and environmental characteristics on the transmission rates 3 to ease the comparison between different moderators we consider the mediating impacts on the influence of the average number of new cases in the past 2 weeks regarding own-city transmissions we examine the mediating effects of population density gdp per capita number of doctors and average temperature wind speed precipitation and a dummy variable of adverse weather conditions regarding between-city transmissions we consider the mediating effects of distance difference in population density and difference in gdp per capita since cities that are similar in density or economic development level may be more closely linked we also include a measure of population flows from wuhan table 6 reports the estimation results of the iv regressions to ease the comparison across various moderators for the mediating variables of within-city transmissions that are significant at 10 we compute the changes in the variables so that the effect of new confirmed infections in the past 14 days on current new confirmed cases is reduced by 1 columns 2 and 4
 in the early phase of the epidemic january 19 to february 1 cities with more medical resources which are measured by the number of doctors have lower transmission rates one standard deviation increase in the number of doctors reduces the transmission rate by 012 cities with higher gdp per capita have higher transmission rates which can be ascribed to the increased social interactions as economic activities increase18 in the second sub-sample these effects become insignificant probably because public health measures and inter-city resource sharing take effects in fact cities with higher population density have lower transmission rates in the second sub-sample regarding the environmental factors we notice different significant mediating variables across the first and second sub-samples the transmission rates are lower with adverse weather conditions lower temperature or less rain further research is needed to identify clear mechanisms in addition population flow from wuhan still poses a risk of new infections for other cities even after we account for the above mediating effects on own-city transmission this effect is robust to the inclusion of the proximity measures based on economic similarity and geographic proximity between wuhan and other cities nevertheless we do not find much evidence on between-city transmissions among cities other than wuhan early detection of covid-19 importation and prevention of onward transmission are crucial to all areas at risk of importation from areas with active transmissions gilbert et al 2020 to contain the virus at the epicenter wuhan was placed under lockdown with traffic ban for all residents starting on january 23 the lockdown is not expected to be lifted until april 8 local buses subways and ferries ceased operation ride-hailing services were prohibited and only a limited number of taxis were allowed on road by january 24 residents are not permitted to leave the city departure flights and trains were canceled at the city airport and train stations checkpoints were set up at highway entrances to prevent cars from leaving the city since january 22 it became mandatory to wear masks at work or in public places in addition all cities in hubei province implemented the lockdown policy and most hubei cities had also adopted measures commensurate with class a infectious diseases by january 2821 residents in those areas were strongly encouraged to stay at home and not to attend any activity involving public gathering health facilities in wuhan had been extremely overstretched with shortage in medical supplies and high rates of nosocomial infections until february 2 when 1 two new hospitals ie huoshenshan and leishenshan were built to treat patients of covid-19 with severe symptoms and 2 14 makeshift health facilities were converted to isolate patients with mild symptoms and to quarantine people suspected of contracting covid-19 patients with fever symptoms and close contacts of confirmed patients this centralized treatment and isolation strategy since february 2 has substantially reduced transmission and incident cases however stringent public health measures within hubei province enforced after the massive lockdown may have little to do with virus transmissions out of hubei province due to the complete travel ban since january 23 quarantine measures have been implemented in other provinces that aim at restricting population mobility across cities and reducing the risk of importing infections22 seven cities in zhejiang henan heilongjiang and fujian provinces had adopted the partial shutdown strategy by february 4 fang et al 202023 in wenzhou most public transportation was shut down and traffic leaving the city was banned temporarily on january 21 the ministry of transport of china launched level 2 responses to emergencies in order to cooperate with the national health commission in preventing the virus spread on january 23 the ministry of transport of china civil aviation administration of china and china state railway group company ltd csrgc declared to waive the change fees for flight train bus and ferry tickets that were bought before january 24 later the csrgc extended the fee waiver policy to train tickets that were bought before february 6 by february 2 all railway stations in china had started to monitor body temperature of travelers when they enter and exit the station across the whole country transportation departments set up 14000 health checkpoints at bus and ferry terminals at service centers and toll gates on highways monitoring the body temperature of passengers and controlling the inflow of population world health organization 2020b recent visitors to high covid-19 risk areas are required to self-quarantine for 14 days at home or in designated facilities on february 2 chinas exit and entry administration temporarily suspended the approval and issuance of the travel permits to hong kong and macau on january 23 wuhan municipal administration of culture and tourism ordered all tour groups to cancel travels to wuhan on january 27 the ministry of education of china postponed start of the spring semester in 2020 and on february 7 it further announced that students were not allowed to return to school campus without approvals from school recent studies suggest that there is a large proportion of asymptomatic or mild-symptomatic cases who can also spread the virus dong et al 2020 mizumoto et al 2020 nishiura et al 2020 wang et al 2020a thus maintaining social distance is of crucial importance in order to curtail the local transmission of the virus the period from january 24 to 31 2020 is the traditional chinese spring festival holiday when families are supposed to get together so that inter-city travel is usually much less people were frequently reminded by official media via tv news and phone messages and social media to stay at home and avoid gathering activities on january 26 china state council extended this holiday to february 2 to delay peoples return travel and curtail the virus spread nevertheless economic activities are still supposed to resume after the spring festival bringing people back to workplaces which may increase the risk of virus spread
 to help local residents keep social distance and decrease the risk of virus transmissions many cities started to implement the closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions policies since late january table 7 encouraging residents to restrict nonessential travels from january 28 to february 20 more than 250 prefecture-level cities in china implemented closed management of communities which typically includes 1 keeping only one entrance for each community 2 allowing only community residents to enter and exit the community 3 checking body temperature for each entrant 4 testing and quarantining cases that exhibit fever immediately and 5 tracing and quarantining close contacts of suspicious cases meanwhile residents who had symptoms of fever or dry cough were required to report to the community and were quarantined and treated in special medical facilities furthermore local governments of 127 cities also imposed more stringent family outdoor restrictionsresidents are confined or strongly encouraged to stay at home with limited exceptions eg only one person in each family may go out for shopping for necessities once every 2 days24 exit permits were usually distributed to each family in advance and recollected when residents reenter the community contacts of those patients were also traced and quarantined table 7 summarizes the number of cities that had imposed closed management of communities or family outdoor restrictions by different dates in february
 in order to help inform evidence-based covid-19 control measures we examine the effect of these local quarantine measures in reducing the virus transmission rates dummy variables for the presence of closed management of communities or family outdoor restrictions are created and they are interacted with the number of infections in the preceding 2 weeks
 several factors may contribute to the containment of the epidemic the transmission dynamics may change during the course of this epidemic because of improved medical treatments more effective case isolation and contact tracing increased public awareness etc therefore we have split the sample into two sub-samples and the estimated coefficients can be different across the sub-samples section 4 npis such as closed management of communities city lockdowns and restrictions on population flow out of areas with high infection risks may also directly affect the transmission rates while many public health measures are implemented nationwide spatial variations exist in the adoption of two types of measures closed management of communities denoted by closed management and family outdoor restrictions denoted by stay at home which allow us to quantify the effect of these npis on the transmission dynamics because most of these local npis are adopted in february and our earlier results indicate that the transmission of covid-19 declines during late january we restrict the analysis sample to february 2february 29 we also exclude cities in hubei province which modified the case definition related to clinically diagnosed cases on february 12 and changed the case definition related to reduced backlogs from increased capacity of molecular diagnostic tests on february 20 these modifications coincide with the adoption of local npis and can significantly affect the observed dynamics of confirmed cases the adoption of closed management or stay at home is likely affected by the severity of the epidemic and correlated with the unobservables additional weather controls that have a good predictive power for these npis are selected as the instrumental variables based on the method of belloni et al 2016 details are displayed in appendix a the estimation results of ols and iv regressions are reported in table 8
 we find that closed management and stay at home significantly decrease the transmission rates as a result of closed management of communities one infection will generate 0244 95 ci documentclass12ptminimal

 our counterfactual simulations indicate that suppressing local virus transmissions so that transmission rates are kept well below those observed in hubei in late january is crucial in forestalling large numbers of infections for cities outside hubei our retrospective analysis of the data from china complements the simulation study of ferguson et al 2020 our estimates indicate that suppressing local transmission rates at low levels might have avoided one million or more infections in china chinazzi et al 2020 also find that reducing local transmission rates is necessary for effective containment of covid-19 the public health policies announced by the national and provincial authorities in the last 2 weeks in january may have played a determinant role tian et al 2020 in keeping local transmission rates in cities outside hubei at low levels throughout january and february among the measures implemented following provincial level i responses shen et al 2020 highlight the importance of contact tracing and isolation of close contacts before onset of symptoms in preventing a resurgence of infections once the covid-19 suppression measures are relaxed we also find that travel restrictions on high-risk areas the lockdown in wuhan and to a lesser extent closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions further reduce the number of cases it should be noted that these factors may overlap in the real world in the absence of the lockdown in wuhan the health care systems in cities outside hubei could face much more pressure and local transmissions may have been much higher in china the arrival of the covid-19 epidemic coincided with the lunar new year for many cities had the outbreak started at a different time the effects and costs of these policies would likely be different this paper examines the transmission dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 in china considering both within- and between-city transmissions our sample is from january 19 to february 29 and covers key episodes such as the initial spread of the virus across china the peak of infections in terms of domestic case counts and the gradual containment of the virus in china changes in weather conditions induce exogenous variations in past infection rates which allow us to identify the causal impact of past infections on new cases the estimates suggest that the infectious effect of the existing cases is mostly observed within 1 week and peoples responses can break the chain of infections comparing estimates in two sub-samples we observe that the spread of covid-19 has been effectively contained by mid february especially for cities outside hubei province data on real-time population flows between cities have become available in recent years we show that this new source of data is valuable in explaining between-city transmissions of covid-19 even after controlling for traditional measures of geographic and economic proximity by april 5 of 2020 covid-19 infections have been reported in more than 200 countries or territories and more than 64700 people have died behind the grim statistics more and more national and local governments are implementing countermeasures cross border travel restrictions are imposed in order to reduce the risk of case importation in areas with risks of community transmissions public health measures such as social distancing mandatory quarantine and city lockdown are implemented in a series of counterfactual simulations we find that based on the experience in china preventing sustained community transmissions from taking hold in the first place has the largest impact followed by restricting population flows from areas with high risks of infections local public health measures such as closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions can further reduce the number of infections a key limitation of the paper is that we are not able to disentangle the effects from each of the stringent measures taken as within this 6-week sampling period china enforced such a large number of densely timed policies to contain the virus spreading often simultaneously in many cities a second limitation is that shortly after the starting date of the official data release for confirmed infected cases throughout china ie january 19 2020 many stringent measures were implemented which prevents researchers to compare the post treatment sub-sample with a pre treatment sub-sample during which no strict policies were enforced key knowledge gaps remain in the understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 such as individual risk factors for contracting the virus and infections from asymptotic cases data on the demographics and exposure history for those who have shown symptoms as well as those who have not will help facilitate these research  influenza measles sars mers and smallpox jorge hidalgo laila woc-colburn daniel chertow s jason kindrachuk   influenza

measles is pathogenic for humans and nonhuman primates although sustained transmission occurs only among humans raising potential for global elimination 30 historically measles infected an estimated 90 of children by age 5 years resulting in approximately 2 million global deaths each year 10 with the introduction of the measles vaccine in1963 and advances in global vaccination programs measles cases and mortality have drastically declined fig 52b by 2017 85 of children worldwide had received at least one dose of the measles vaccine by age 1 year and during 20002017 global measles mortality decreased by 80 preventing an estimated 21 million deaths 31 of the 24 known measles genotypes only five were detected in circulation during20162017 despite these gains measles remains endemic in many regions of the world including africa western pacific south east asia and europe and measles has resurged in previously low-incidence areas eg regions within europe and the americas with epidemics attributable to importation of cases and suboptimal immunization coverage 3234 an estimated 93 population immunity is required to preventmeasles transmission within communities a prerequisite for global elimination 35 chinese horseshoe bats are the putative reservoir for
sars-cov and dromedary camels are thought to be the reservoir for mers-cov 3643 animal-to-human transmission likely occurs following direct contact with intermediate hosts 38 44 during the 20032004 sars epidemic 8096 cases and 774 deaths were reported from 26 countries with no cases reported since fig 52c 45 human-to-human transmission of sars-cov
occurred primarily in healthcare settings with healthcare workers comprising 22 and 40 of reported cases in china and canada respectively 45 mers was first reported in saudi arabia in 2012 with 2000 cases and 800 deaths reported from 27 countries through 2018 46 while most cases have been reported from the arabian peninsula an imported case to south
korea in 2015 resulted in a large outbreak in multiple healthcare facilities 47 mers transmission occurs primarily
in healthcare facilities and to a lesser degree within households 48 49 while the only known reservoir forvarv is humans it has been postulated that the virus emerged from an ancestral rodent-borne poxvirus more than 10000 years ago 18 50 numerous smallpox epidemics have occurred throughout recorded history including more than 300 million fatalities during the twentieth century alone 5153 smallpox was eventually eradicated following the implementation of the smallpox eradication program by the who from 1966 to 1980 fig 52d which was facilitated by the absence of a zoonotic reservoir for varv 51 influenza viruses are transmitted bylarge respiratory droplets by coughing sneezing or talking or through contact with infected surfaces 54 influenza viruses bind to sugar moieties on the surface of airway epithelial cells where early viral replication propagation and shedding occur during an average 12 days of incubationperiod 5557 peak viral replication typically occurs within 4 days of symptom onset and resolves within 710 days lasting longer in children and immunocompromised hosts 5860 on average one person infects one to two additional people however this reproductive number r0 varies by viral strain and social and environmental factors 61 viral infection impairs the airway mucosal barrier and disrupts the alveolar-capillary membrane contributing to leakage of fluid and inflammatory cells into the alveolar space which impairs gas exchange resulting in hypoxemia 62 63 bacterial coinfection often complicates severe cases contributing to respiratory failure and death with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus species as predominant copathogens 64 seasonal influenza virus infection is largely limited to the respiratory tract however h5 and h7 hpai viruses have a polybasic cleave site within the hemagglutinin allowing for replication outside of the respiratory tract 65 66 infectionwith one strain of influenza does not confer complete immunity to other strains or subtypes 67 measles is among the most highlycontagious respiratory infections spread by exposure to large respiratory droplets through coughing sneezing or talking by indirect contact with infected surfaces or by small infectious droplets that can remain suspended in air for up to 2 hours 10 68 respiratory tract dendritic cells lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages are early targets of infection where during an average 8- to 12-day incubation period measles replicates and spreads to local lymphatics and respiratory epithelium and then disseminates in blood via infected lymphocytes to epithelial and endothelial cells in most organs 6971 the infectious period begins with fever onset and extends for several days after rash appears 72 the estimated r0 of measles is 918 dependent upon host susceptibility and social and environmental factors 73 measles infects and disrupts tissues throughout the bodyhowever severe disease is primarily due to lower respiratory tract and neurological complications 72 natural measles infection confers lifelong immunity and passive transfer of maternal antibodies protects newborns during the early postnatal period 74 individuals who recover from measles infection are at increasedrisk of secondary infection 75 76 sars-cov is transmitted by
large respiratory droplets and by contact with infected surfaces epidemiologic data also support small droplet airborne transmission of sars-cov although the estimated r0 of 086183 argues against this being a predominate route of spread 77 78 sars-cov binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme ace-2 receptors on respiratory epithelial
cells pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages resulting in diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure 79 80 sars is a systemic infection with viremia detected in most cases affecting multiple cell types and organs 81 82 acute kidney injury is multifactorial with evidence of acute tubule necrosis vasculitis and glomerular fibrosis and central
nervous system manifestations are at least in part attributable to direct infection of neurons resulting in edema and degeneration 83 mers-cov is transmitted
by large respiratory droplets and by contact with infected surfaces with an estimated r0 of 1 to 1 outside of versus within healthcare settings respectively 84 mers-cov binds dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 on respiratory epithelial cells and pneumocytes where it undergoes productive replication during a 214 days incubation period 16 viral shedding from the lower respiratory tract may persist for weeks 85 86 viremia while not documented in all cases is associated with severe disease and productive infection of dcs and macrophages is thought to facilitate immune dysregulation 87 88 dpp4 is broadly expressed on cells outside of the lung however
few autopsy data are available to define viral distribution 16 89 varv is transmitted primarily by large respiratory droplets and to a lesser degree through contact with contaminated objects such as scabs bedding or clothing or by airborne small respiratory droplets 90 91 varv is thought to replicate in airway epithelium and spread to regional lymph nodes 92 93 varv replicates within lymph nodes and disseminates via the bloodstream seeding distant sightsincluding skin spleen bone marrow liver kidney and other organs 94 fever manifests following an average 12 days incubation and rash follows fever by 34 days concurrent with high-level viral shedding from oropharyngeal secretions 95 96 the estimated r0 of smallpox is between 35 and 6 97 high-level viremia is detected more often with hemorrhagic compared with ordinary type smallpox although exact mechanisms of organ failure observed in fatal case are not welldefined 98101 influenza infection manifests as acute onset of fever chills malaise headache and myalgias following an average 12 days asymptomatic incubation period 9 most infections are self-limited resolving within 12 weeks upper or lower airway complications include otitis media sinusitis bronchitis and pneumonia with or without bacterial coinfection 63 64 102 risk factors for severe infection include age 65 years or 5 years pregnancy preexisting respiratory cardiac neurologic or metabolic conditions immunosuppression andobesity progressive lethargy and shortness of breath typically within 5 days of symptom onset suggest development of lower respiratory tract complications which may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and death in severe cases 64 pneumonia due to influenza infection alone versus influenza and bacterialcoinfection cannot be reliably distinguished by clinical or radiological grounds and so a high index of suspicion is needed influenza complications outside of the respiratory tract include exacerbation of underlying heart disease including ischemic heart disease and heart failure myocarditis encephalopathyand encephalitis 103 measles infectionmanifests by acute onset fever coryza conjunctivitis and cough 10 small white papules koplik spots appear on the buccal mucosa within 3 days of fever onset followed by development of diffuse maculopapular rash 1 or 2 days later diarrhea commonly begins shortly following rash onset and may result in dehydration symptoms typically resolve within 7 days of fever onset in self-limited illness groups at increased risk for measles complications include malnourished infants and those with vitamin a deficiency adults 20 years old and immunocompromised individuals 72 respiratory complications include otitis media laryngotracheobronchitis croup and pneumonia pneumonia often complicated by bacterial coinfection is the most common severe complication of measles contributing to respiratory failure and death 72 104 predominantbacterial copathogens include streptococcus pneumonia staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae three rare but severe neurologic complications occur 105 acute disseminated encephalomyelitis adem is a demyelinating autoimmune process that occurs within weeks of acute illness in approximately 1 in 1000 cases adem is characterized by fevers seizures and neurologic deficits measles inclusion body encephalitis is a progressive lethal brain infection occurring within months of acute illness primarily among individuals with impaired cellular immunity subacute sclerosing panencephalitis sspe occurs 510 years following initial infection resulting in seizures and cognitive and motor decline resulting in death sspe affects an estimated 1 in 10000 infants under 1 year of age and is attributed to host responses to defective viral particleproduction in the brain following an average 5-day

 characterized by discrete skin lesions  where pustular skin lesions were confluent on the face and extremities and  where skin lesions were confluent on the face but disparate over the rest of the body modified-type smallpox where lesions were less numerous than in ordinary-type smallpox was primarily associated with vaccinated individuals and had an accelerated nonfatal disease course 125 flat-type and hemorrhagic-type smallpox were the most lethalforms of the disease but were also very rare 7 and 3 of patients respectively 51 flat-type smallpox had high cfrs in both unvaccinated and vaccinated patients 97 and 67 respectively hemorrhagic-type smallpox was nearly 100 fatal in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and death normally came prior to macular rash development the clinical symptoms of flat-type smallpox were more severe during the prodromal period and did not subside skin lesions were flat and often black or dark purple respiratory complications were common and patients were febrile throughout disease death typically occurred 812 days post-fever onset hemorrhagic-type smallpox could be divided into early and late hemorrhagic-type smallpox the early form was characterized by hemorrhage primarily subconjunctival early in the disease course generalized erythemapetechiae and ecchymosis within 2 days of fever and flat matter lesions formed across the entire body surface lesions turned purple by day 4 with death by day 6 as a result of cardiac and pulmonary complications in the late form hemorrhages occurred following rash development and death followed between8 and 10 days post-fever onset in healthcare settings patients under evaluation for influenza should be isolated and standard droplet and contact precautions should be implemented 126 traditional antigen-based rapid diagnostic assays rdas for influenza lack sensitivity and cannot be relied upon to rule out infection 26 newer antigen-based rdas that employ a digital scan of the test strip and molecular assays that employisothermal amplification technology have improved sensitivity and specificity that more closely approximates highly sensitive and specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr-based assays 127 acceptable sample types for influenza testing include nasopharyngeal swab or wash and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens individuals suspected of zoonotic influenza infection should have case evaluation and specimen testing coordinated through local or state public health authorities measles should be consideredin patients without preexisting immunity and a compatible febrile rash illness travel to a region with ongoing measles transmission or exposure to other individuals with a febrile rash illness should raise suspicion patients under evaluation for measles require isolation and implementation of standard airborne and contact precautions local or state health authorities should be contacted within 24 hours to assist with confirmatory testing case finding and infection control measles is typically confirmed by measles-specific igm serology or detection of measles rna in a nasopharyngeal throat or urine specimen by rt-pcr 10 a fourfold or greater rise in measles igg titers between acute and convalescent samples tested 2 or more weeks apart can assist with diagnostic uncertainty virus can also be cultured from respiratory blood and urine specimens in appropriate public health laboratories while sars is no longer
circulating mers should be suspected in individuals with a compatible febrile illness and an epidemiological risk factor 128 risk factors include travel to the arabian peninsula or contact with a confirmed or suspected case within 14 days of symptom onset patients under evaluation for mers require isolation and implementation of standard airborne and contact precautions confirmatory testing and infection control should be coordinated
through local or state health authorities mers may be confirmed in designated public health laboratories by rt-pcr testing of lower respiratory tract specimens 129 multiple other specimen types including upper respiratory tract samples serum and stool should also be collected for testing serologic testing can
be used to evaluate for suspected infection among individuals no longer shedding virus 129 130 smallpox has not been observedin over 40 years however concerns remain for use as a bioweapon major and minor criteria have been established to assist clinicians in recognition of smallpox 131 individuals under evaluation should be isolated and standard airborne and contact precautions should be implemented local or state health authorities should be contacted to assist with confirmatory testing and public health interventions pcr identification of variola dna or isolation of the virus from a clinical specimen isrequired to confirm a diagnosis in specialized high-containment laboratories annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended in the united states for all individuals aged 6 months or older and has been associated with decreased risk of pneumonia and death particularly among high-risk groups 132134 seasonal influenza vaccination does not provide protection against novel strains consequently efforts are underway to develop a vaccine that would protect against most or all influenza strains 135 three classes of drugs are licensed for the treatment of influenza in the united states 136 adamantanes including amantadine and rimantadineare not currently recommended given resistance of circulating seasonal strains baloxavir morboxil a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor was recently approved for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza 137 neuraminidase inhibitors nai include oral oseltamivir inhaled zanamivir and intravenous peramivir prophylactic use of nais is recommended in unvaccinated individuals with risk factors for severe disease and during institutional outbreaks to limit spread therapeutic use is recommended for individuals with suspected or confirmed influenza that have developed or are at high risk for influenza complications 26 influenza complicationsincluding respiratory and multiorgan failure are managed with supportive care bacterial coinfection should be considered and empirically treated early pending results of microbiologic testing among severe cases measles can be effectively prevented through vaccination typically given in combination with vaccines for rubella mr mumps mmr or varicella mmr-v who recommends the first dose of measles vaccine be administered at 9 or 12 months of age in high and low prevalence settings respectively 138 a second dose should be administered after a minimum of 4-week interval nonimmune individuals that have been exposed to measles should receive post-exposure prophylaxis with mmr or immunoglobulin within 72 hours or 6 days respectively although not concurrently 139 clinical management of patients with measles consists of fluid electrolyte and nutritional support and early recognition and treatment of bacterial coinfection 10 two doses of vitamin a inchildren under 2 years have been associated with reduced risk of pneumonia and death 140 who recommends administering 200000 iu of vitamin a daily for 2 days in children aged 1 year and older with reduced dosingin younger infants 141 there are currently
no licensed therapeutics or vaccines for sars or mers consequently supportive care is the mainstay of treatment 142 renal replacement therapy is frequently required in severe illness 119 143 144 empiric antibiotics are often administered given potential for secondary bacterial infection ribavirin and pegylated interferon alpha 2b have been administered to mers patients although effectiveness data is lacking 144 aerosol-generating procedures including endotracheal intubation are associated with increased risk of healthcare worker infection necessitating strict adherence to infection control measures
including use of eye protection in addition to standard airborne and contact precautions 145 while routine smallpox vaccinationceased at the end of the smallpox eradication program it is still employed for those at increased risk for exposure first-generation vaccines comprise a significant proportion of both the us national and global vaccine stockpiles 146 however first-generation vaccines carry high risk of adverse events due to use of replication-competent vacv and potential manufacturing contaminants second-generation smallpox vaccines have reduced concerns for contaminants and are expected to have similar protective efficacy as first-generation vaccines acam2000 has garnered us food and drug administration licensure for vaccination of those at high risk for exposure and is part of the us strategic national stockpile 147 acam2000 and the lister-derived vaccines rivm and elstree-bn also contribute to the global stockpile imvamune mva a third-generation vaccine is licensed in europe and canada and is part of the us national stockpile passive immunization with vig has been employed to treat complications of vaccinations 148 149 there has also been increasing interest in the development and licensure of small molecule antivirals for treatment of orthopoxvirus infections cmx001 brincidofovir a dna synthesis inhibitor has demonstrated protection against lethal varv in nonhuman primates 150 and has been granted ophan drug designation while also being included in the us strategic national stockpile st-246 tecovirimat which inhibits viral egress has potent ic50  0010 m and selective cc50  40 mm inhibitory activities against multiple orthopoxvirues 151 is the only antipoxvirus therapeutic that has been granted approval in the us and has been added to the strategic national stockpile  rapid asymptomatic transmission of covid-19 during the incubation period demonstrating strong infectivity in a cluster of youngsters aged 16-23 years outside wuhan and characteristics of young patients with covid-19 a prospective contact-tracing study lei huang xiuwen zhang xinyue zhang zhijian wei lingli zhang jingjing xu peipei liang yuanhong xu chengyuan zhang aman xu   the outbreak of the 2019-novel-coronavirus-disease covid-19 caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 emerging from wuhan in december 2019 has been arousing great global health concern with many unknowns regarding the transmission dynamics and spectrum of illness to be answered1

3 sars-cov-2 has rapidly spread to many places outside wuhan where imported cases with ascertained covid-19 among travelers returning from wuhan without direct exposure to any wet-markets or wild-animals have been reported2

4 current epidemiologic data indicate that human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 has been rapidly occurring2

 the great number of covid-19 infections may be attributable to the late identification of sources-of-infection and the ability of the host to shed the infection while asymptomatic1

7 while a study8 suggests that transmission may occur during the incubation-period the validity was questioned by science because the evidence was not directly obtained from the infectious-patient who actually had developed symptoms which were controlled by a fever-lowering agent before disease transmission to others9

karaoke in a confined-room at about 1400-1630 with air-conditioning and with some fruits shared with 15 of his previous classmates whose hometowns are all in hefei further details on the get-together are shown in supplementary results table s1 and figs s1 and s4 afterwards he had supper with a 22-year-old otherwise-healthy male patient-4 while the others went right back home nobody found him unhealthy that day he reported that he was totally asymptomatic and well before and on january 21 among his classmates he contacted six patients-3-8 were later confirmed with covid-19 and the person who first experienced any relevant symptoms was patients-4 and 8 both on january 22 patient-index reported that the very first symptom that he experienced was itchy eyes at noon on january 22 fig s1 in the afternoon he felt dizzy with a fever of 375c developed measured by himself and he starting to wear a mask attended a local outpatient-clinic in feidong and was prescribed amoxicillin capsules paracetamol and amantadine compound capsules and ambroxol dispersible-tablets after taking which his temperature returned to normal 365c on the same day he also developed mild nasal-congestion and rhinorrhea both lasting 2 days on january 23 his body temperature was normal in the morning but rose again to 375c at noon which was again temporarily controlled by the drugs however in the evening he had fever again on the same day before the onset of fever patient-2 went to visit patient-index and brought him some home-made food they ate and chatted together in his room which was tightly confined with no doors or windows open and without air-conditioning for about 05 h patient-2 later became infected having learned about the covid-19 emergence in wuhan and the possible human-to-human-transmission from internet at noon on january 22 he decided to go to hospital-1 for further assessment and management in the evening on january 23 virus-rna detection using respiratory-samples taken on january 26 and 27 both revealed positive results on rrt-pcr assays confirming the sars-cov-2 infection fig 1 assays to detect other pathogens were all negative further descriptions of the disease-course and management of patient-index are detailed in supplementary results tracing of the contacts of patient-index started immediately after his admission to hospital before illness onset he closely contacted 22 people 15 classmates and seven family-members 16 of the contacts were admitted to hospital under isolation seven patients-2-8 developed covid-19-relavent symptoms and were later identified to have laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2-infection and nine contacts-1-9 tested negative for sars-cov-2 and had normal ct-scan findings and were discharged to home-isolation 4-5 days after admission the other six contacts were quarantined and isolated at home and closely watched by healthcare-workers they all tested negative for sars-cov-2 none of the contacts had visited any wet-markets or hospitals contacted any wild-animals or eaten any game-meat within three months tables s1 none of them had resided in traveled to or passed wuhan other cities in hubei or any region where sars-cov-2-transmission was known to be occurring within three months they reported no contacts with any individual recently returning from such a region with anyone having any suspicious symptoms eg fever cough or other respiratory or relevant digestive symptoms or with anybody later developing relevant symptoms or confirmed with covid-19 except patient-index within three months this was ascertained by an investigation by the healthcare-authority in hefei they did not have any infected family-members or members having visited wuhan none of the contacts had any symptom of illness during exposure patients-2-8 were admitted to hospital under isolation 1-3 days after the admission of patient-index on february 25-27 the respiratory-samples of all patients tested positive for sars-cov-2 for at least two times five of the classmates patient-index contacted in the get-together initially tested positive for sars-cov-2 on january 26 and another classmate and patient-indexs cousin initially on january 27 we did not find any evidence of co-infection with other known respiratory viral bacterial or fungal pathogens in any of the patients on microbiological-testing of all the eight infected youngsters the median-age was 22 years range 1623 table 1 and six were male three were company-employees four university-students and patient-2 a senior-high-school-student three were overweight patients-4 and 8 were current-smokers three had mild comorbidities patients-5 and 7 chronic gastritis patient 6 fatty-liver while patient-3 initially reported no coexisting medical-conditions his blood-pressure was measured to be 15094 mm hg on admission they all immediately wore masks and paid special attention to hand-hygiene after illness-onset the median incubation-period for patients-38 was two days range 14 table 1 the median serial-interval in the young-cluster was one day range 04 patients-4 and 8 had symptom onset on the same day as patient-index among the eight youngsters with covid-19 the median duration from illness-onset to first-hospital-admission was two days range 1-3 the median interval between illness-onset and second positive-test for sars-cov-2 which ascertained the covid-19 diagnosis was four days range 25 the presentations of the eight young-patients are shown in table 2
and fig s2 because manifestations acquired after hospitalization may be influenced by the hospital-environment and drug-use we primarily describe those developed before or on admission we did not identify any patients asymptomatic on admission but testing positive for sars-cov-2 all patients had mild clinical-conditions and developed 2 symptoms andor signs before or on admission most youngsters seven developed fever except patient-6 the median body-temperature on admission was 375c range 370382 and the median highest temperature during disease-course was 385c range 371389 none had a high fever temperature 39c the fever of patients-index 2 and 5 showed an intermittent pattern and patients-3-5 experienced chills four patients had productive-cough and patients-6 and 7 had dry-cough five patients had both fever and cough four youngsters experienced fatigue and three myalgia patients-2 and 7 reported experiencing no upper-respiratory-tract-infection symptoms sore-throat nasal-congestion rhinorrhea andor sneezing while five youngsters had more than two such symptoms patient-7 reported shortness of breath for two days on admission none of the youngsters developed dyspnea or chest-discomfort or pain three patients had headache and patient-index reported dizziness eye-discomfort was noted in patients-index and 3 and backache in patient-3 two patients had anorexia and three nausea but vomiting did not develop in any of them before or on admission only patient-8 developed diarrhea and patient-5 reported abdominal-discomfort nobody only presented with digestive-symptoms patient-2 the youngest patient 16 years had only two presentations on admission intermittent fever for two days and headache for one day while the others reported 4-11 symptoms the symptoms on illness onset are described in supplementary results on admission abnormalities in chest-ct-images suggesting viral-pneumonia were detected in six all males 2223 years of the eight youngsters confirmed with covid-19 table 2 fig 1 none of the conditions were severe of the six pneumonia-patients five had unilateral-involvement and patient-8 had bilateral-pneumonia on admission four had involvement of the lower-lobe and the other two of the middle-lobe of the five patients with unilateral-disease pneumonia was located in the right-lung in four patients and in the left-lung in patient-3 the typical-findings on chest-ct-scan multifocal-mottling patchy-shadows andor ground-glass-opacities2 which were mostly around the peripheral-parts of the lungs and which were compatible with abnormalities seen in viral-pneumonia were detected in the pneumonia-patients on admission patient-indexs pneumonia progressed to bilateral-pneumonia two days after the initial scan for the youngest patient patient-2 16 years while no abnormalities were detected the next day after illness-onset a few infiltrates were noticed in the lower-lob of left-lung six days later the blood-routine tests of the seven youngsters with available information on admission showed leucopenia and substantial neutropenia in patients-2 and 4 table 3
 patient-8 had increased neutrophils but decreased lymphocytes patient-7 also had lymphopenia patients-1 and 3 had both red-blood-cell count and hemoglobin above the normal-range patient-2 had slightly shortened prothrombin-time while patient-4 showed mildly extended activated-partial-thromboplastin-time and patient-8 slightly increased international-normalized-ratio patient-3 had elevation of creatine-kinase and lactate-dehydrogenase reaching the upper-limit of reference-range regarding the infection-index procalcitonin was above the normal-range in patient-4 patient-1 had an elevated level of c-reactive-protein most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission five of six youngsters with available information while testing negative for sars-cov-2 contacts-1-9 also showed some changes in blood-examinations table 4
 supplementary results when comparing the laboratory-findings between patients-1-5 ascertained with covid-19 with contacts-1-9 with negative sars-cov-2-tests fig s3 all of whom were initially admitted to hospital-1 lymphocyte-count on admission was lower in the sars-cov-2-positive patients than the sars-cov-2-negative contacts p0042 initial fibrinogen-concentrations were higher in the patients p0019 levels of sodium were lower in the patients p0016 plasma-concentrations of c-reactive-protein were markedly higher in sars-cov-2-positive patients p0016 management and outcomes of the eight youngsters with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 and description of all the other contacts are detailed in supplementary results currently our understanding of the spectrum and natural-history of sars-cov-2-infection remains limited we herein provide an assessment of the infectivity transmission dynamics and other characteristics of a cluster of eight young-patients aged 16-23 years confirmed with sars-cov-2 on rrt-pcr originating from patient-index returning from wuhan who rapidly transmitted covid-19 when totally asymptomatic and compare them to the other nine close-contacts of patient-index testing negative for sars-cov-2 the disease was transmitted outside wuhan and all patients were diagnosed and managed in hefei the young patients admitted with covid-19 had fast illness-onset and symptoms somehow resembling a common-cold which were much milder than those of older hospitalized adults with covid-19 as recently-reported1

2

10 while patchy-shadows and ground-glass-opacity on ct-scan were common they were much less severe than the older patients2

10 not all patients had radiological-changes indicating viral-pneumonia on admission notably our findings provide valid evidence demonstrating efficient local human-to-human-transmission with strong infectivity of sars-cov-2 within this cluster of youngsters during the incubation-period and asymptomatic-phase of covid-19 sars-cov-2 tested positive in six of the 15 young classmates patient-index contacted in the get-together when he was totally asymptomatic with the minimal exposure-duration of only two hours the attack-rate is high 40 the symptoms of patients-4 and 8 developed on the same day as that of patient-index we carefully had interviews directly with both patient-index himself and all the other contacts to confirm the absence of any symptoms of patient-index before and during the contacts thus ascertaining the transmission during asymptomatic-phase we may need to pay special attention to preventing covid-19 transmission from people looking asymptomatic but with exposure-history the incubation-period and serial-interval in this young cluster were much shorter than previously-reported for majorly older patients at the earlier stage of the epidemic1
 infected-youngsters may act as important sources-of-infection notably patient-6 remained afebrile throughout the disease-course these cryptic cases of walking-sars-cov-2-infection might act as potential sources to propagate the epidemic since it is difficult to differentiate and screen patients during the incubation-period further studies on the popularity of this transmission-pattern and the epidemiological-significance of cases with null or mild symptoms are warranted which would help make relevant control-measures to prevent the future spread of infection it may be needed to commit sufficient resources to examination in outpatient-clinics and emergency-departments for proactive case-identification both as part of the containment-strategy in locations without local-spread yet and to permit earlier clinical-management of infected-individuals the most likely transmission-scenario is that patient-index acquired the sars-cov-2-infection in wuhan and then transmitted the virus to patient-2 after two contacts and patients-3-8 during get-together on january 21 after returning to feidong on january 19 patient-2 more likely acquired the infection during the second contact on january 23 with an incubation-period of three days rather than on january 19 since contacts-1 and 2 with whom patient-index had close-contacts in the evening on january 19 and on january 20 respectively did not develop the infection these indicate the relatively weak infectivity up till january 20 and the possibility of dynamic changes in infectivity which possibly became strong enough to enable the disease to affect others sometime on january 20 or 21 still during the incubation-period of patient-index further studies on the diverse infectivity during different stages of disease and the corresponding time-points are warranted almost half of the previously-reported cases were in adults aged 60 years1 younger patients were thought to be less likely infected1 few reports exist on younger patients aged 1525 years delays from illness-onset to admission were generally short in these eight youngsters with covid-19 in our study with five hospitalized within two days of illness-onset the symptoms of these youngsters were all mild and largely-nonspecific which may be hardly clinically-distinguishable from many other common infectious-diseases particularly in winter the first three most common symptoms on illness-onset were fever cough and sore-throat none initially presented with a digestive-symptom on admission half or more of the youngsters with covid-19 presented with fever cough sputum-production nasal-congestion and fatigue which are much milder than previous reports including majorly older hospitalized-patients with frequent comorbidities who may have lower immune-function than younger people2

10 fever developed in seven of the eight youngsters with six having fever on illness-onset three youngsters developed one or more digestive-manifestations before or on admission which are more frequent than the previous report on older hospitalized-patients2

10 patient-8 developed diarrhea before admission about 11 of sars-cov14 and 30 of mers-cov patients15 also had diarrhea none of the abovementioned symptoms was present in all youngsters notably two youngsters presented with eye-discomfort on admission one had itchy-eyes as the very initial symptom and one with backache at illness-onset which appears to not have been observed in older patients2

10
 for the six youngsters showing pneumonia on admission multifocal ground-glass opacities typical of viral-pneumonia on chest-ct-scans were frequently seen while their lung-involvement was much milder and more local and limited than older patients2

10 unlike older patients typically having bilateral-pneumonia2

10 the pneumonia youngsters mostly had showed unilateral lung-involvement on admission regarding laboratory-examinations two patients had leucopenia the absolute neutrophil-counts were reduced in the same two patients while they were elevated in another patient furthermore lymphopenia occurred in two patients and two youngsters had both elevated red-blood-cell-count and hemoglobin level these changes were not consistent with the previous report on older patients with more severe conditions10 these may suggest diverse immune-status against the virus neutrophilia may be related to cytokine-storm induced by sars-cov-2 invasion compared with sars-cov-2-negative contacts sars-cov-2-positive patients had fewer lymphocytes and higher fibrinogen and c-reactive-protein levels these suggest that sars-cov-2-infection may be associated with deficiency in immune-function and activation of coagulation which could have been related to inflammatory-response as of february 20 2020 none of the eight young patients had dyspnea developed any severe clinical-conditions complications or adverse-outcomes were admitted to an intensive-care-unit required machine-ventilation or died which is largely different from the findings in older patients2

10 they mostly remained stable during hospitalization these suggest that age comorbidity and symptoms on illness-onset or admission may be important prognostic factors our study has some limitations first the case number is limited which necessitates the cautious interpretation of the generalizability of our findings collection of data for a larger cohort would help to enable a more comprehensive understanding of covid-19 among youngsters second the route of transmission was not totally clear while the most likely one was via droplets or aerosol or airborne we did not collect urine or fecal samples which prevented us from analyzing whether covid-19 could be transmitted through the fecal-oral pathway third the relative-risk of infection among youngsters compared to older individuals and the association of timing or mode of manifestations and ct and laboratory findings with disease-course outcomes and spread need to be further evaluated fourth the serum of patients and contacts was not obtained to evaluate possible viremia respiratory-tract samples were used to diagnose covid-19 through rrt-pcr according to the guidelines1

16 17 18 19 and they have a higher positive rate than blood and other samples and are more clinically and epidemiologically relevant20 there could have been transient viremia in the sars-cov-2-negative contacts which was not captured on admission the corresponding epidemiological and clinical significances need to be further clarified we provide valid evidence supporting efficient asymptomatic human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 showing strong infectivity based on a cluster of youngsters aged 1623 years in a local community setting outside wuhan covid-19 was rapidly transmitted by the index patient during the late incubation-period to other seven youngsters demonstrating strong infectivity the symptoms of the youngsters with covid-19 had fast-onset and were generally mild nonspecific atypical and diverse none reported  sars  the health care system exploring your questions about this new infectious disease ann holden c   
a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome sars is a respiratory illness characterized by fever and other symptoms which may includea fever with the temperature greater than 1004 f or 380 ca general feeling of malaise headache andor cough
 

 after two to seven days the respiratory symptoms may become increasingly severe so that oxygen support and mechanical ventilation are necessary according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc approximately 10 to 20 percent of cases progress to the stage of requiring respiratory support the exact cause of sars is still under investigation however scientists have identified a type of coronavirus in patients with sars the common known types of coronavirus cause upper respiratory illnesses sars coronavirus sars co-v may survive in the environment for up to several days laboratory studies at the cdc and around the world are currently studying sars co-v to determine what factors and conditions support its survival outside the body because the sars co-v has only been identified recently there are no environmental protection agency epa approved cleaning agents known to be specifically effective disinfectants the cdc recommends using products already proven effective against other related viruses such as bleach ammonia or alcohol or agents that contain any of these disinfectants the treatment for sars is directed at alleviating the symptoms presently in the absence of a specific antiviral agent for sars the cdc currently recommends treating the patient similarly to a patient with serious community- acquired atypical pneumonia 
a careful screening is essential ideally this will occur at the hospital entrance and consist of a written tool with specific questions related to symptoms present or recent illnesses in the household and any history of recent travel to affected areas when a woman presents to the nursing unit with her completed screening tool its prudent to review it with her and ensure that she has carefully read and understood the questions cultural diversity in a health care community may require additional resources see box 1

a frontline staff such as the birthing unit triage nurse responsible for seeing patients who may not have been screened should wear an n95 mask face shield or goggles gown and gloves until the screening for sars has been completed and all questions related to possible symptoms or an epidemiological link have been answered and are negative universal precautions are the minimum standard of care additional precautions should be taken depending on the specific situation frequent hand washing and the use of alcohol-based hand rubs should be stressed during the recent sars breakout in toronto ontario canada patients and visitors were given surgical masks to wear during their time in the hospital laboring women were not expected to wear a mask however the health care providers were in full protective garb medical and surgical patients as well as postpartum women were instructed in the use of masks 
a public education about the disease and hospital restrictions in the form of public information announcements and publications are useful defining visitors versus family or significant others for the door screeners is also necessary during the height of the recent toronto sars experience women giving birth were able to have their support person remain with them postpartum visitation was limited to one support person newborns in the nicu and pediatric patients were permitted both parents no visiting or support persons other than translators were permitted on the medical or surgical units the restrictions were relaxed slightly when the disease was believed to be under control to date visiting has not returned to pre-sars practices among toronto hospitals 
a minimizing the risk of infection to others is one of the goals when caring for any patient who may be infected therefore the less movement through the hospital the better creating an isolation ldrp room in an ldr is preferable a negative pressure isolation room is ideal minimizing the risk of infection to others is one of the goals when caring for any patient who may be infected therefore the less movement through the hospital the better there should be a supply of all required protective garments and supplies located outside the room disposable equipment should be used whenever possible protective coverings should be used on non disposable items no equipment or supplies should be shared between the isolated patient and others the mother-baby couplet should be nursed together and discharged home in quarantine as per the current guidelines when a newborn requires special care isolation precautions must be implemented in the nursery setting women who remain asymptomatic may be discharged and complete the quarantine period at home arrangements for follow-up appointments and assessments must be made with consideration for the period of quarantine community resources and contact telephone numbers may help provide the isolated family with some reassurance that help is still available for them in their unique situation 
a the ministry of health and long term care for the province of ontario immediately activated a sars provincial operations centre poc which functioned as a type of mission control for all health care organizations in the province in addition to working with the local toronto authorities the operations centre ensured that communication was maintained throughout the province strategic planning for the containment of the disease and treatment of sars patients was co-coordinated through this body regular teleconferences were held and directives issued the directives clearly articulate how all acute care hospitals in toronto and the surrounding area are to conduct business with the goal of containing and eradicating sars examples of some of the directives includeadvising all hospitals to restrict the number of entrances to control accessrequiring all patients and visitors entering through the emergency department to apply a surgical mask prior to entering the departmentrequiring every hospital to establish a sars- specific isolation unit and details pertaining to the numbers of beds the unit should have based on the size of the hospital and specific infection control measures that are to be implemented
 in june 2003 as sars was contained and toronto experienced a 20-day period twice the incubation period with no new cases of sars diagnosed recognizing the need for continued vigilance the poc issued a directive that requires all hospitals to have a comprehensive sars surveillance program in effect 
a hospital workers are exposed to a certain level of risk simply because they are working in an environment where there are sick people during the outbreak of any disease its important to become as educated as possible about the disease the symptoms its mode of transmission incubation period and treatments adherence to and application of the appropriate infection control measures for the situation is essential communicating accurate information to patients visitors and the public will assist with the containment of a disease when door screening is done vigilantly and staff are compliant with frequent hand washing and the proper wearing and use of protective equipment the risk to health care workers is minimized  patients with coronavirus 2019 covid-19 and surgery guidelines and checklist proposal michael grelat benjamin pommier sylvain portet aymeric amelot cdric barrey henri-arthur leroy rachid madkouri   in december 2019 pneumonia of unknown causes was described in the wuhan province of china1

2 patients were identified and a new coronavirus was described quickly coronavirus 2019 covid-19 many cases have been described and the spread has occurred quickly in china but also internationally with the virus reaching europe2 3 4 5 the disease seems to spread with human-to-human transmission6 implying professionals can be contaminated during the care of some patients7

8 as of february 11 2020 3019 chinese health care workers were infected with covid-19 and 6 died from it9 in recent decades we have had examples of epidemic coronaviruses during the severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome epidemics infected patients had to undergo emergency surgery10 11 12 13 cases of transmission to health professionals while in operating theaters also have been described in previous epidemics and should be prevented10

14
 the situation is rapidly evolving and we have observed an alarming increase in cases around the world the european situation is worrying at the beginning of march 2020 15 million people were placed in quarantine in italy and thereafter the whole country and a significant increase in the number of cases has been observed in other countries especially in france which is now in quarantine figure 1
 the situation subsequently spread worryingly to north america surgical emergencies may be multiple and some infected patients will need surgical care facing this increase of cases in the same way as china8

16 we will be confronted with patients needing emergency surgery it is necessary to anticipate and prepare to take care of patients with covid-19 in the operating room or the objective of this study is to establish recommendations for the management of a patient with covid-19 coronavirus in the or it is essential to be prepared and to have received good information to deal with the management of these cases to reduce the risk of contamination the degree of emergency must be assessed and it is preferable to postpone the surgical procedure if it is not urgently needed it is necessary to use protective material in the right situation and avoid shortages we recommend seeking the advice of the hospitals infectious disease department to consider surgery in a patient with covid-19 in our centers scheduled patients are hospitalized 48 hours before surgery if the patient is asymptomatic we perform a polymerase chain reaction pcr screening test on the patients arrival if the patient is symptomatic we perform 2 screening tests 24 hours apart combined with a computed tomography scan of the chest the same procedure is applied for patients arriving in emergency adjusted to the required delay of surgery antibodies are not routine tests at this time as soon as they will be available and reliable they probably should be added to the screening strategy and coupled with the pcr technique to optimize preoperative screening several situations can be encountered1if the patient is suspected or confirmed to have coronavirus covid-19 it is necessary to take the utmost precaution for the management of this patient a specific protocol should be followed in the or it is obvious that a pcr test must be performed to obtain a necessary diagnosis in these patients17
2if the patient is cured resolution of clinical symptoms we currently advise taking the same precautions in the or as for a confirmed patient the precautionary principle should be followed given the absence of follow-up on this disease risk of asymptomatic case risk of second contamination of the patient risk of carrying the virus longer3if a coronavirus diagnosis is made after surgery it is necessary to identify all the surgical staff who have been in contact with the patient and consider quarantining them after advice from the infectious disease department
 the surgical staff that will take care of this type of patient must have been trained in this risk management and aware of the protocol established in the institution in this protocol the patients journey must be planned in advance by the or referents it is necessary to delimit a precise route to avoid as much as possible the patients contact with other unprotected personnel as well as other patients by the use of dedicated elevators and corridors figure 2
 in this course the patients route should avoid buffer zones such as the recovery room or the induction room an or must be dedicated for these patients the patient must wear a surgical mask when transferring to the or personnel must use a dedicated stretcher with disposable protections that will be well disinfected after use moreover caregivers should take their temperature before surgery ors are generally under positive pressure in these cases an or must be dedicated and should be switched to negative pressure10 11 12 13

15 we must therefore anticipate this situation and plan to modify the environment in these rooms in fact the passage of air from the room to the outside must be limited as much as possible18 this procedure should be planned upstream with the hospital engineers to obtain a negative room pressure 5 pa10 we recommend for each surgical team to approach their engineering team to study the feasibility and prepare their structure to anticipate such a situation a clear display must be set up outside the room to inform other health care workers the number of people in the or must be reduced to the strict minimum it is necessary to establish the traceability of any health care worker present during the surgery all the equipment necessary for the surgery procedure must be prepared and present in the or it is necessary to avoid entering and leaving the room as much as possible during surgery disposable equipment is preferred all health staff in the or area should use the following protections11 head cover shoe cover surgical gowns surgical goggles 2 pairs of surgical gloves and respiratory masks ffp2 ie filtering facepiece particles 2 if the material is available it is possible to use a system-powered air-purifying respirator10 the staff must be trained to wear the equipment in good conditions in particular the ffp2 respiratory masks the anesthesiologist must wear the same protective equipment when faced with a very high risk of contamination during intubation and extubation procedures11 the patient must benefit from an adequate sedation preferably associated with a curarization to avoid agitation and episodes of cough after the intubation a wet compress can be added to the patients nose to avoid spreading the virus in the air in the event of a cough15 it is also important limiting disconnection of the circuit when positioning the patient the surgeon must take the utmost precaution during the surgical procedure to reduce the risk of accidents involving exposure to body fluids and tissues in the event of an exposure accident the establishments standard protocols should be followed to deal with a blood exposure accident the infectious disease department should immediately be contacted and a test could be considered19
 the patient should be awakened in the or the patient should wear a surgical mask as soon as he or she is awake once again the recovery room should be avoided and the patient should be brought back to his or her room directly if possible10 a 30-minute ventilation of the room at the end of surgery should be achieved12

20
 at each transfer the patient should wear a surgical mask when leaving the or a strict disinfection of the or should be achieved the or should be closed for 2 hours and then switched to the laminar flow again we recommend the elimination and destruction of body fluids and tissues using bags that allow double closure and waste and liquids to be destroyed with infectious medical waste for bacteriological or anatomopathologic samples also use a hermetically sealed bag with a double closure and call the center to recover and inform about the situation the health care staff must undress at the end of the procedure helped by another caregiver because of the risk of contamination during this procedure strict decontamination of the or is required the infectious disease department of the hospital or hygiene department may be requested to perform tests in the or to check the presence of viruses the reusable material used must be carefully cleaned with the usual decontaminating detergent products concerning patients during postoperative time they present with a high risk of pneumonia fevers infections with an increase in the level of white blood cells which can make diagnosis of postoperative infection difficult in addition to regular temperature monitoring for patients the surgical staff in contact also must monitor their temperature twice a day15 postoperative temperature monitoring is necessary for patients not at risk who are being treated for another pathology indeed we can cite the situation in a wuhan hospital with the postoperative appearance of several cases of covid-19 coronavirus either in asymptomatic patients16
 we recommend the daily washing of hands for staff patients and families of patients family visits should be limited to the strict minimum however in the current situation in our centers family visits are prohibited in the case of visits the patients family also should wear a surgical mask when visiting the patient and staff should pay attention to contact with families indeed they can also carry covid-19 so it is necessary to apply the protection procedures for suspicious cases the management of patients with covid-19 represents a new challenge for medical and surgical teams not accustomed to a large flow of patients it is important as of now that each establishment and structure became aware of the development and prepare for an adequate crisis management it is obvious that these recommendations are the result of thinking and research between health care professionals working in the or figure 3
 these recommendations will be confirmed by additional studies with more perspectives on the situation concerning this new virus patient supervision in the or must be considered and organized previously to guarantee the safety of the surgical staff and to limit the spread of the disease each or in the world must prepare with thinking by developing a protocol and patient route the surgical staff must be aware of the procedure for the care of patients with covid-19 well trained in the establishment and prepared to deal with it including during emergencies

 for lung cancer patients who have not yet started medical treatment the treatment strategy should be comprehensively considered according to the tumor burden and general condition of the patient for patients awaiting adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery reasonable decisions should be made based on the postoperative pathology clinical stage genetic status risk factors and prognostic indicators one study showed that lung cancer patients with a sluggish recovery can still benefit from delayed adjuvant chemotherapy starting four months after surgery without increasing mortality5 therefore the duration of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with postoperative lung cancer with earlier clinical stage and better prognosis can be appropriately extended during the epidemic in addition for patients with lymph node stage n2 after surgery with epidermal growth factor receptor egfr gene mutations oral egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor egfrtki treatment at home may be considered as the optional adjuvant treatment option6 which may reduce the risk of cross infection caused by repeated hospital visits however for patients with advanced lung cancer awaiting chemotherapy in principle limited extension of the waiting time with administration of antitumor treatment at the earliest are recommended possible professional oncologists must be consulted to identify more convenient alternatives such as oral targeted drugs or chemotherapeutic agents for patients that need immediate chemotherapy choosing the nearest hospital with experience in chemotherapy is recommended lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not be able to receive timely chemotherapy during the epidemic a major concern in these patients is the reduction in antitumor efficacy due to interruption of chemotherapy even if there is no effect of the epidemic during normal chemotherapy several patients have difficulty in advancing chemotherapy due to intolerable adverse events local medical conditions and family factors therefore while we attach importance to the adverse effects of this epidemic on chemotherapy delays in patients with lung cancer we should also regard the adjustment of chemotherapy regimen rationally the treatment strategies should be appropriately adjusted under the guidance of an oncologist according to the tumor burden of the individual stage and effect of antitumor treatment tolerance of antitumor treatment and local epidemic situation we suggest that for patients with a low tumor burden and stable disease and those undergoing postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and maintenance treatment chemotherapy in hospital can be appropriately postponed or switched to oral chemotherapy with targeted drug administration at home for patients who need further chemotherapy it is recommended that the treatment should be carried out under the supervision of an oncologist a safe chemotherapy regimen with appropriate dosage should be chosen and any adverse events post chemotherapy should be closely monitored targeted therapy is recommended for patients with advanced lung cancer with sensitive mutations such as egfr anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion alk and ros1 fusion7 8 studies show that patients receiving targeted therapy in combination with antivascular therapy chemotherapy or immunotherapy may experience enhanced antitumor effects9 10 11 12 13 however in the current epidemic situation being vigilant about a possible increase in adverse events due to combination therapy is necessary14 15 therefore it is recommended that lung cancer patients with sensitive gene mutations be treated with oral targeted drugs during the outbreak without combination therapy16 although patients can be treated at home with oral drugs attention should still be paid to the adverse events of some targeted drugs patients whose symptoms are obviously relieved after targeted therapy and those with stable disease can be appropriately deferred to the hospital for review during the epidemic further it is necessary to promptly consult a doctor under proper protection under emergency symptoms or obvious disease progression immune escape mechanism is one of the reasons why tumor cells can continuously replicate and proliferate in the human body17 programmed cell death1programmed cell death ligand1 pd1pdl1 inhibitors developed by selectively blocking the pathway involved in tumor cell escape have spring boarded this therapy to a new stage which to a certain extent may maintain longerlasting antitumor effects18 19 20 we suggest that for lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapy during the epidemic it is not urgent to receive immunotherapy on a set date considering the adverse events of potential pulmonary toxicity or injury caused by immunotherapeutic drugs immunotherapy can be suspended or postponed in patients with stable disease regular examination of patients with earlystage postoperative lung cancer can be delayed for advanced lung cancer patients receiving targeted therapy with sensitive gene mutations the scheduled examination can be appropriately postponed or delayed on the basis of the cancer conditions the interval between examinations can be extended to more than 23 months for patients with symptomatic remission or stable disease during the postponed examination period patients are advised to continuously take the original targeted drugs and closely monitor symptoms patients should be examined immediately and be kept wellprotected from infection if symptoms progressively worsen examinations during chemotherapy should be performed in a timely manner as far as possible under permissible epidemic situations the examination procedures and methods should be simplified to shorten hospital stays after examination patients may consult oncologists online or offline to comprehensively select the appropriate followup treatment plans some lung cancer patients are required to undergo antitumor treatment such as systemic chemotherapy during the epidemic and deal with treatmentrelated adverse events outside the hospital the common adverse events include myelosuppression nausea and vomiting we provide some recommendations for management of common adverse events outside the hospital for reference routine blood examination should be emphasized in the management of patients during chemotherapy intermission to monitor the extent of myelosuppression through the important concerns including leukocyte counts neutrophils platelets and red blood cells and hemoglobin levels mildtomoderate myelosuppression can be treated with corresponding oral drugs however the following conditions need to be treated under medical guidance leukocyte count 20  109l neutrophil count 10  109l or infection symptoms such as fever frequent urination and abnormal vaginal secretions in women platelet count 50  109l or the occurrence of gumnose bleeds and skin congestion hemoglobin level  100 gl or pale appearance fatigue anorexia etc in order to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting we recommend that patients rest and maintain a reasonable diet before chemotherapy in addition to medication to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy such as ondansetron studies have shown that psychological adjustments such as periorbital massage listening to music enjoying pictures and yoga can also reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting21 22 23 if vomiting persists a lateral position is essential when vomiting to prevent choking after vomiting we recommend that patients rinse their mouths with warm water in order to keep their mouths clean as well as clearing up vomit to avoid revomiting caused by the pungent smell moreover if the manifestations continue such as abnormal vomit color excessive vomiting and dizziness then patients should be taken to hospital for symptomatic treatment in addition it is necessary to monitor the liver kidney function and electrolytes in a timely manner and intervene if necessary during the intervals between courses of chemotherapy moreover lung cancer patients at home need to be aware of dyspnea caused by mass compression bleeding or massive hemoptysis caused by tumor invasion of surrounding organs electrolytes imbalance and other emergencies such as severe arrhythmia in case of emergencies patients should seek medical treatments immediately under the condition of epidemic protection lung cancer patients may be prone to lung infections due to low immunity or lung damage caused by chemotherapy and targeted and immunotherapy drugs which may lead to different degrees of lung infiltrative lesions on chest ct14 24 25 these lesions need to be distinguished from the chest manifestations of covid19 with multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes in early stage multiple lung groundglass shadows and infiltration shadows later and even lung consolidation in severe cases26 27 we suggest that if this kind of problem occurs patients should pay more attention to monitoring their respiratory symptoms and temperature with the suspension of antitumor treatment and visit a hospital under the premise of selfisolation and protection even patients without typical clinical symptoms and peripheral blood routine performance cannot rule out the possibility of asymptomatic sarscov2 infection we recommend that patients complete epidemiological history screening sarscov2 nucleic acid and igmigg antibody tests at designated hospitals to rule out covid19 infection from other bacteriological infectious pneumonia or druginduced lung injury28 the procedures recommended for sarscov2 infection screening and distinguished diagnosis are shown in fig 1 the next appropriate treatment may be determined according to the causes and comprehensive situation of the individual patient the covid19 global health emergency has resulted in increased anxiety fear depression and other negative emotions among civilians29 studies have shown that approximately half of the survivors of malignant tumors have moderate fear of cancer recurrence30 coupled with epidemic lung cancer patients may worry about covid19 and the impact of delayed antitumor treatment on their own treatment efficacy which makes them more predisposed to anxiety depression and insomnia we recommend that lung cancer patients may utilize association relaxation exercises appropriate venting to eliminate negative emotions31 and use online psychological consultations and interventions if necessary32
 in conclusion the covid19 epidemic is undoubtedly a profound global health emergency but people worldwide are courageous and need to be brave to fight this battle here we provide available recommendations for the alternative transitional treatment and management of common treatmentrelated adverse events for lung cancer patients at different stages during the epidemic the war against the covid19 epidemic will eventually be won and we are willing to work with cancer patients to overcome the challenges the authors declare they have no competing interests  ct manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 of imported infection versus second-generation infection in patients outside the original district wuhan china of this disease yu-ping wu jin-ming cao tian-wu chen rui li feng-jun liu yue zeng xiao-ming zhang qi-wen mu hong-jun li oliver schildgen   in late december 2019 several medical institutions in wuhan admitted a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unexplained etiology12 an unknown novel coronavirus which was temporarily named as the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was identified as the pathogen3 subsequently the pneumonia caused by the 2019-ncov has been officially named by the world health organization as the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-194 accompanied with the arrival of the chinese spring festival travel rush the 2019-ncov spread rapidly all over china5 as of february 17 2020 a total of 72436 patients with confirmed covid-19 including 42752 590 in wuhan have been reported in china67 of these 11741 and 1868 cases were severe and death cases respectively furthermore most of severe 9222 785 and death 1381 739 population were from wuhan china the original district of this disease the rate of severity and mortality in covid-19 patients from wuhan were significantly higher than that in other regions outside wuhan suggesting patients infected in the original district wuhan china of this disease may have more rapid aggravation to detect covid-19 viral nucleic acid detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr remains the standard of reference8 however several defects such as immature development of nucleic acid detection technology variation in detection rate from different manufacturers false negative caused by low patient viral load or improper clinical sampling may cause low efficiency of detection and limit its clinical application8 as a promising method recommended by chinese society of radiology9 computed tomography ct plays an essential role in diagnosis and monitoring treatment responses in covid-19 multifocal bilateral ground glass opacity ggo as an indicator of early disease stage and patchy consolidations as a marker of the disease progression are the most common patterns of ct abnormalities911 based on above-mentioned typical ct findings the severity of covid-19 could be staged into early progression severe and dissipation stage which embodied in the consensus of chinese society of radiology9 as for the patients outside the original district wuhan china of this disease the infection routes included an exposure history of the original district wuhan china in short term ie imported infection and a close contact with the infected individuals exposed to the original district recently ie second-generation infection to the best of our knowledge there were no reports focusing on the discrimination in severity of the covid-19 between patients outside the original district wuhan china according to different routes of infection thus the purpose of our research was to determine the discrepancy in ct manifestations of covid-19 in patients outside the original district wuhan china between cases with imported infection and with second-generation infection aiming to help clinicians outside the original district formulate more accurate and effective prevention and treatment measures the institutional ethics committee of the affiliated hospital of north sichuan medical college approved this study approval number 2020er0071 and the written informed consent was obtained from each participant from january 23 to february 17 2020 22 consecutive covid-19 patients derived from 2 designated hospitals in nanchong china 938 km away from the original district wuhan china of this disease were enrolled into our study all patients had positive results for 2019-ncov detection via the initial rt-pcr after admission patients were subsequently classified into 2 groups based on the following criteria the baseline data of the onset of symptoms are recorded in table 1 all patients underwent initial thoracic ct examinations fig 1a andfig 2a after admission the intervals between the initial ct scan and the onset of symptoms were 49  39 days in group a and 10  45 days in group b it should be noted that 1 patient in group a and 3 in group b were asymptomatic and there was no interval between the initial ct scan and the onset of symptoms all patients underwent follow-up ct scans fig 1b and c and fig 2b and rt-pcr every 3 to 8 days during their hospitalization based on the severity of covid-19 but for the asymptomatic patients in group b they received follow-up ct scans when their rt-pcr results were positive in addition all patients received relevant medical management during their hospitalization thoracic non-contrast enhanced ct scans were performed in 17 patients with 16-row multidetector row ct system uct 510 united imaging shanghai china and in 5 patients with a 128-row multidetector ct system somatom definition flash siemens healthcare systems germany each examination was performed in a breath-hold mode at full suspended inspiration the scanning coverage was from the thoracic inlet to the middle level of the left kidney scanning parameters for the uct 510 scanner were as follows the scanning parameters for somatom definition flash scanner were similar to those for the 16-multidetector row ct scanner except the tube current of 250 ma and detector collimation of 06 mm data from 2 ct scanners were respectively transferred to the image processing workstation somatom definition flash siemens healthcare systems germany the window width and level were set to 350 hu and 40 hu for mediastinal window and to 1000 hu and -700 for lung window respectively all image data were independently reviewed on above-mentioned workstation by 2 experienced radiologists the first author with 1 year of experience in radiology and the co first author with 8 years of experience in radiology blinded to epidemiologic and clinical information in case of discrepancy between the 2 observers a third radiologist co corresponding author with 12 years of experience in radiology reviewed the images for the final adjudication before the previous radiologists reviewed the image data a professor of radiology the corresponding author with 22 years of experience in body radiology trained them on how to review the image data according to the expert consensus9 the initial ct manifestations in groups a and b were assessed based on the following features in order to assess the severity of the disease more accurately we also devised a semi-quantitative scoring system to evaluate the extent and severity of disease in this study as illustrated in tables 2 and 3 the ct lesion extent and density scores were determined based on the anatomic distribution and density of lung lesions referencing to the reported semi-quantitative score system12 the extent score was assessed on lung window based on the extent of the 5 lung lobes involved by covid-19 the overall lung extent score was obtained by summing the 5 lobe scores the density score was evaluated on lung window based on the percentages of consolidation and other abnormalities in each covid-19 lesion and the overall lung density score was acquired by summing the 5 lobe scores the score range for both lungs in each patient is from 0 no detectable abnormality to 20 more than 75 of each lung lobe involved by covid-19 lesion and 100 of consolidation in each lesion in order to assess the intra-observer variability of the above semi-quantitative measurements the first author repeated the image data analysis 3 days later the intra-observer variability was obtained by comparison of the 2 measurements by the first author the inter-observer variability was accessed with the results by 2 independent double-blinded observers the first author and the co-first author all data were statistically analyzed by ibm spss statistics software version 250 for windows spss chicago il usa the normality of distribution was evaluated by shapirowilk test continuous variables expressed as the mean and standard deviation the categorical variables were described in percentiles and compared using the chi-squared test or fisher exact test both intra-observer and inter-observer variability were tested for ct score using inter-class correlation coefficient icc the semi-quantitative extent and density scores of covid-19 lesions on initial ct were considered to be reproducible when the icc was greater than 07513 statistical difference was defined as p  05 for all tests 15 100 patients in group a fig 1a and 3 429 in group b had abnormal findings on initial ct while the remaining 4 571 patients had none abnormal ct findings patients with abnormal ct findings were more frequent in group a than in group b p  05 pure ggos and ggos with consolidation andor other abnormalities were observed in 3 20 and 12 80 patients in group a respectively in group b 1 143 and 2 286 patients had pure ggos and ggos with consolidation respectively among the previous 4 patients with normal image on initial ct scan 3 cases 75 developed into focal pure ggo on follow-up scans fig 2a the mean intra-observer and inter-observer icc values were 096 95ci 091098 and 094 95ci 086097 for extent score and 095 95ci 090098 and 093 95ci 084097 for density score respectively therefore the average of the extent score and density score from the first author and the co first authors measurements was used for the subsequent statistical analysis as demonstrated in table 4 the mean extent score of lesions on ct in group a was 67 ranged from 1 to 17 in group b the mean extent score of lesions on ct was 11 ranged from 0 to 4 in group a 13 867 and 2 133 patients scored at least 5 and 10 respectively except the 4 patients with a normal ct finding on initial scans the remaining 3 patients in group b scored 1 3 and 4 according to the extent scoring system the extent of lung lobe involved by covid-19 lesions in group a was strikingly greater than that observed in group b p  001 as shown in table 4 the mean density score of lesions in both lungs in group a mean score 101 range 117 was significantly higher than that in group b mean score 13 range 04 in group a 14 and 11 patients scored at least 5 933 and 10 733 respectively in contrast none of patients in group b with abnormal ct findings on initial scans had lesion density score of more than 5 p  001 indicating that the covid-19 in second-generation infected patients could be milder when compared with those with imported infection covid-19 is a new disease with high infectivity causing an enormous impact on public health14 the chinese spring festival travel rush has triggered massive population movements which gave rise to the confirmed cases of covid-19 outside the original district wuhan china of this disease with imported infection as well as cases with second-generation infection in succession in order to better master the characteristics of covid-19 in patients outside the original district for appropriate treatment we carried out our study to investigate the discrepancy in ct manifestations of this pneumonia in patients outside the original district wuhan china between cases with imported infection and the second-generation infection our study revealed that abnormal findings on initial ct scans can be found in each patient with imported infection but not patients with the second-generation infection in patients with the second-generation infection some patients could have abnormal initial ct appearances and some could not our findings can be explained by the following pathological mechanism as reported1517 rna virus is characterized by error-prone viral replication and recombination and usually generates progeny viruses with highly diverse genomes which might result in reduction of virulence and pathogenicity we could presume that the 2019-ncov as a novel rna virus might have the similar characteristics of reduction of virulence and pathogenicity resulted from the error-prone viral replication and recombination as shown in our study ggo and consolidation could be the most common patterns of ct abnormalities of the confirmed covid-19 in patients with imported infection which was consistent with the published reports911 as reported9 ggo and consolidation could respectively reflect the potential pathological abnormalities in different stages of the disease seen mainly in the early stage of the disease the underlying pathologic change of pure ggo can be small amount of exudation of fluid in alveolar cavity and interlobular interstitial edema10 consolidation lesions could be regarded as a marker of more severe phase11 reflecting a large amount of cell-rich or fibrous exudation accumulated in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitium10 it is noteworthy that 3 cases of second-generation with normal finding on initial ct scan developed into focal ggos during follow-up ct suggesting that the limitation of ct in the early detection of asymptomatic patients with the second-generation the covid-19 case without abnormal manifestation on initial ct scan should be confirmed by 2019-ncov detection via rt-pcr together with a history of close contact with imported infection moreover we found that the discrepancies of extent and density scores obtained on the initial ct could exist between patients with imported infection and with the second-generation infection in detail the extent of lung lobe involved by covid-19 lesions in patients with imported infection was strikingly greater than that in patients with second-generation infection the previous discrepancies of extent and density scores between groups can be explained as follows on one hand the virus load or the chance of being exposed to the virus in the environment in the original district wuhan could be much higher than any other district where there were much fewer covi-19 cases on the other hand ggos with consolidation or other abnormalities ie reticular andor interlobular septal thickening involving multiple lobes could be more common in patients with imported infection than in patients with the second-generation infection resulting in elevated ct density and extent scores in patients with imported infection when compared with patients with second-generation infection our findings suggest that patients with imported infection might have more rapid progression of disease and increasing likelihood of mixed bacterial coinfection1819 based on the comparison of ct density score between groups we can presume that the covid-19 in second-generation infected patients could be milder when compared to those with imported infection our study had several limitations for one thing a larger sample size of covid-19 patients is required for further investigation especially with an emphasis on asymptomatic second-generation patients for another thing the semi-quantitative scoring system of disease in this study was based on the typical ct manifestations applied in the expert consensus9 the other abnormal findings such as reticulation and interlobular septal thickening did not particularly evaluate and further modification is required the ct findings of covid-19 vary according to the routes of infection patients with imported infection tend to have more severe ct manifestations suggesting that ct could accurately evaluate the covid-19 in the population cases with second-generation infection could be manifested as normal finding on the initial ct scan but may progress to mild abnormalities on follow-up cts indicating 2019-ncov detection via rt-pcr could be essential in the population with high risk of infection we hope that our findings can help clinicians outside the original district wuhan china of this disease formulate more accurate and effective

acute respiratory syndrome sars is an acute respiratory tract infectious disease induced by sars-cov and mainly transmitted through the short-distance air droplets and close contact its main clinical characteristics is abrupt onset of the disease and the initial symptom is fever accompanied with systematic symptoms of headache soreness and fatigue and respiratory tract symptoms such as cough chest dullness and dyspnea a few cases may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards due to its self-limiting feature the prognosis is predominantly good but may be poor in severe cases with mortality about 93  some patients may develop such complications such as lung fibrosis and necrosis of the head of femur on april 8 2003 sars was defined as a legal infectious disease by the ministry of heath of china 
the first sars case was reported around the world on january 2 2003 a hospital in heyuan city of guangdong province hospitalized two patients with severe pulmonary infection of unknown cause which was the first traceable report of sars around the globalon february 28 2003 sars was first diagnosed by the who expert carlor urbani in hanoi of vietnam who also named this new unexplained disease severe acute respiratory syndrome sars
 following the emergence of sars who and governments around the world attached great importance and took consecutively effective control and prevention measures which reined in the infection rapidly controlled in a short time on april 28 2003 who eliminated vietnam from the name list of the sars-infected area which made vietnam the first to get rid of sars outbreaks since then numerous countries were also ticked off the list on july 5 2003 who announced to remove taiwan of china from sars-affected area list which is also the last at present there is no sars-affected area around the world signaling the victory of global battle against sars by the end of september 26 2003 there were in total 8098 people infected and 774 deceased with the mortality at 95  some canadian laboratories excluded influenza virus a and b para-influenza virus type 1 2 and 3 adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus by scanning electron microscopy and direct fluorescent antibody test they also conducted immunohistochemistry on the corpse tissues of dead patients about viruses including influenza virus a and b respiratory syncytial virus adenovirus circovirus hantaan virus measles virus intestinal tract virus and pneumonia mycoplasma and chlamydia which showed negative scholars from german france america hong kong and taiwan applied specific pcr tests targeted at corresponding pathogens to examine pneumonia mycoplasma pneumonia chlamydia human cytomegalovirus circovirus herpes virus human coronavirus oc43 and 229e and arenaviruses bunyavirus hantaan virus crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus which also indicated negative on march 21 2003 hong kong university firstly separated and cultured coronavirus from the nasopharyngeal specimen of sars patients by vero cells and then several laboratories of canada and america disease center and sars international coordination group also cultured coronavirus on april 16 2003 based on the aforementioned research findings who declared a new coronavirus as the pathogen of sars and named it as sars coronavirus sars-cov sars-cov is a single-stranded and positive rna virus belonging to the genus coronavirus of coronaviridae family of nidovirales order it bears great morphological resemblance with known human coronaviruses under the electric microscopes sars coronavirus presents with pleomorphic spherical particles with envelopes in vero e6 cell in vitro and with a diameter of about 80140 mm it has distinct coronavirus morphological characteristics that rodlike surface projections about 2040 nm long protrude outside viral envelope to form a corona for separation and culture of viruses in vero e6 cells viral particles are mostly found in vacuoles inside cells under electric microscope mainly hollow particle and viruses outside cells observed with spikes the coronavirus is mainly composed of nucleic acid protein carbonate and lipid sars-cov are relatively stable in human specimens and environment but relatively sensitive to chemical and physical factors the viruses could be killed by exposure to ultraviolet rays for 60 min as the envelope of sars-cov contains lipoids they are sensitive to lipid solvents and could be inactivated by ether chloroform tween 70  ethyl alcohol methanol pancreatic enzymes and ultraviolet rays ether could sterilize the virus completely under 4cafter 24 h 75  ethyl alcohol could deactivate virus after 5 min and disinfectants containing chlorine may kill the virus aft sars is the first newly emerging infectious disease in the twenty-first century since the first case was detected in guangdong on january 2 2003 sars spread to 29 countries at five states at an unprecedented speed with several months according to the report of who sars epidemics was found in total 29 countries at five states including hong kong and taiwan of china from january 2 2003 to september 26 2003 since january 2 2003 which infected 8098 patients and caused 774 casualties besides there were 5327 patients in china mainland including 1002 medical workers with 349 deaths 1755 patients in hong kong with 299 deaths 346 patients in taiwan with 37 deaths 251 patients in canada with 43 deaths 238 patients in singapore with 33 deaths 63 patients in vietnam with 5 deaths and 29 patients in america but without casualty meanwhile sars cases were reported in 24 provinces municipalities under direct governance of central government and autonomous regions in china mainland with 2521 infection cases and 183 deaths in beijing and 512 infection cases and 57 deaths in guangdong it is regarded that only symptomatic patients can effectively spread sars-cov at present there still lacks clinical proof that asymptomatic sars patients could spread sars coronavirus few cases are highly contagious and able to directly infect over 10 patients who are called super-spreader the five super-spreaders in singapore have been found infecting 103 people such powerful infectiousness is attributable to the high viral load inside patients who could discharge abundant viruses via respiratory tract in a short time specialists from the department of microbiology of hong kong university and guangdong provincial disease control and prevention center tested abundant sars coronaviruses from the samples collected from civet cats sold in guangzhou and shenzhen suggesting that the human sars coronavirus might originate from civet cats high level of sars coronavirus could be detected in the throat swabs and sputum specimens of the patients in acute phase viruses discharged by patients via cough would exist in the air within certain radius thus forming short-distance respiratory tract droplet spread it is a main route of sars dissemination indirect or direct contact spread could also spread sars coronavirus it could be spread through contact with the respiratory tract secretion or through the mouth and nose via contaminated hands and toys as viruses proliferate abundantly in the respiratory tract exfoliated cells containing infectious viruses could be expelled outside the body through patients respiration cough and sneeze and suspend in the air thus forming the aerosol of sars virus cough and sneeze could greatly contribute to production of sars virus aerosol present data reveal that sars is an acute self-limiting infectious disease and neutralizing antibodies to sars could be detected 3 weeks after onset however the change patterns of neutralizing antibody titer have not been fully elucidated the epidemics of sars mainly take place in the winter and spring sars outbreaks are mainly concentrated at coastal tourism cities with prosperous economy dense population and convenient transport particularly air transport from the perspective of international geography sars primarily occurs in southeastern countries or regions including china mainland hong kong taiwan singapore and vietnam analysis of the statistics of various countries shows that sars onset is mainly recorded in young populations aged 2050 years old occupying around 80  of the total sars coronavirus sars-cov a mutant of coronaviridae is pathogenic to hosts in the following two aspects firstly viral infections could directly damage the structure and functions of infected cells and trigger cell apoptosis secondly immune reactions and release of various cytokines induced by viral infections could not only eliminate infectious pathogens but also may deal severe damages on histiocytes due to excessive immune reactions the member of coronaviridae is a single-chain positive rna virus which taxonomically belongs to nidovirales with arteriviridae the homological analysis of sars-cov structural protein amino-acid sequences shows that the main structural protein s spike protein m membrane protein n nucleocapsid protein and e envelope protein bear very low homology with other known coronaviruses between 20 and 30  besides bioinformation analysis infers that sars-cov may also encode 59 nonstructural proteins of unknown functions all these sars-cov specific proteins may play key roles in determining the viral virulence s-protein existent on the viral surface in form of trimer is the main component in constructing the coronal structure and major structural protein for the integration of virus and host cell receptors and fusion of viral envelope and cell membrane to enable invasion of viruses after infection with sensitive cells sars-cov could replicate enormously and release virions which may disturb cell metabolism and directly result in injury of body tissues and cells in the early phase of the disease and in the continual progression phase the active immune cells such as cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes nk cells and dc cells are decreased prominently to an extent positively correlated with severity of conditions and speed of progression besides all dead patients are detected with irreversible significant decline however along with remission of conditions and entry into recovery phase the number of aforementioned immune cells could be recovered to some extent whose change presents distinct parallel correlation with disease evolution dynamic observations suggest that serum pre-inflammatory cytokine il-6 il-8 il-16 and inf- level of sars patients could reach the peak at about second week of disease course which relatively corresponds to the acute aggravation phase all these consolidate the immune damage of sars-cov infections lung tissues become swollen and heavier according to domestic report the left lung may reach 5001480 g average 8114 g and right lung 7001125 g average 8693 g with the total lung up to 11702605 g average 14607 g the lung tissues appear in dark red texture is hard indicative of consolidation the surface is relatively smooth and free of pleural adhesions lung tissues are observed with blood vessel dilation and congestion spotted and patchy necrosis and hemorrhagic infarct foci and focal compensatory emphysema sections of various lung lobes are visualized with outflows of light red orand a few foamy blood-stained fluids the trachea and bronchi are found with exudations of slight mucoid or blood-stained secretions pulmonary hilar lymph nodes are revealed with slight enlargement and pleural cavity without or with a few effusions microscopy reveals bilateral diffusive severe injuries of alveoli characterized by acute exudative hemorrhagic and fibrinous inflammation however the injury may be inhomogeneous and diverse at different lung lobes and different parts of the same lobe the characteristic change in early phase is pulmonary edema with homogeneous pink serous or fibrinous effusions filling alveolar cavities as well as erythrocytes leakages in some cavities the effusions from some alveolar cavities may condense to form thin-layer membranelike substance which adheres to alveolar walls namely formation of hyaline membrane fig 21 alveolar epithelia present with such diffusive injuries as degeneration and necrosis with exfoliated orand apoptotic type ii alveolar epithelial cells observable in alveolar cavities which are similar to changes of desquamative pneumonia fig 22 among them some appear like apoptotic bodies partial regional type ii alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages proliferate actively with obvious increase of cell volume and distinct nucleolus in some case cells are detected fusing with each other to form syncytial monocytes and multinucleated giant cells fig 23 the alveolar epithelia of some cases are examined with structures similar to viral inclusion bodies mostly spherical and with eosinophilic staining around which a transparent halo is visible fig 24 pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces are detected with high dilation and congestion of capillaries swelling and exfoliation of epithelial cells as well as widening of the latter which present slight lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration small vessel proliferation and enlargement characteristic of vasculitis changes some regions are observed with pulmonary vascular embolism or fibrinous microthrombi in alveolar capillaries while some alveolar capillary cavities manifest dilation but free of blood components in addition some patients are detected with lung tissue focal hemorrhage compensatory emphysema and small airway necrotizing inflammation and alveolar collapse or shrinkage patients with a disease course of over three weeks manifest fibroblast proliferation in alveolar septa and individual cases demonstrate organization of fibrinous exudates from alveoli and fibroblast proliferation which gives rise to glomeruloid structures named glomeruloid organizing pneumonia fig 25 the bronchial epithelial cells are revealed with exfoliation scarce and exfoliated cilia as well as structures similar to viral inclusions and squamous cell metaplasia at the inside the bronchioli are detected with submucosal edema inflammatory cell infiltration and serous grandular hyperplasia with hyperactive secretion




 pulmonary hilar lymph nodes demonstrate light swelling and present different degrees of congestion hemorrhagic necrosis and decrease of innate lymphocytes under the microscope blood sinus in the lymph nodes presents with grave congestion and dilatation lymphoid nodule atrophy or disappearance prominently the cortex and lymphatic tissue focal necrosis accompanied by apoptosis of some lymphocytes fig 26
 the spleen mostly shrinks with soft texture and has patchy and focal hemorrhage at the surface and sections splenic white pulp is detected obviously atrophic or absent with central arterial wall thickened endothelial cells swollen and partially shed peripheral lymphatic sheath lymphocyte depleted greatly and germinal center disappeared splenic corpuscle is observed with plasma protein sedimentation in central arterial walls white pulp and marginal sinus lymph tissues with large patchy necrosis and partial remaining lymphocytes with apoptosis the splenic sinus inside red pulp is revealed with obvious congestion and focal hemorrhagic necrosis as well as proliferation of histiocytes fig 27
 the number of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow declines and granulocyte system and megakaryocytic system are relatively inhibited polychromatic erythroblasts present with small focal proliferation tissues of the brain liver kidney and heart demonstrate varying degrees of congestion edema degeneration and necrosis as well as infiltration of a few lymphocytes secondary bacterial pneumonia and fungal infection may occur fig 28
 generally the incubation phase lasts 214 days with an average of 47 days and a median of 6 days predominantly 210 days the initial symptom primarily is fever mostly high fever accounting for 944100  patient body temperature may reach 3840 c and 42 c at the highest the fever type varies including remittent fever irregular fever and continuous fever the duration of fever is mostly 59 days it presents as headache joint orand systematic soreness and chest pain it is reported that the incidence of headache in sars patients is 1790  most sars patients have cough which is dry with scanty sputum generally sars does not incur upper respiratory tract catarrhal symptoms severe cases may suffer from accelerated respiration shortness of breath or even acute respiratory distress syndrome characterized by progressive dyspnea or even distress with respiratory frequency up to 20 times patients complain of heart beat or palpitation accompanied often by precordial discomfort the incidence is 3590  the incidence of diarrhea is reported mostly at 744  with single case up to 70  dyspnea presents irregular respiratory frequency depth and rhythm the incidence of dyspnea of sars patients is 2157  severe patients may manifest nose fanning orthopnea and cyanosis involvement of accessory respiratory muscles in respiration as well as three depression signs upon inhalation according to report 11  of typical patients and 14  of severe patients have sinus tachycardia and 23  of sars patients suffer from paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia the pulmonary signs of sars patients are frequently unobvious or absent in the early phase light moist rales may be audible 1762  patients may also demonstrate pulmonary consolidation sign and attenuated breath sounds there may also be a few pleural effusions in light of conditions it could be classified in clinics into light type common typical type severe type and special atypical type the follow-up visit of 267 sars patients via x-ray and hrct by choi et al found that about 34  patients developed fibrotic changes of lung interstitium and shrinkage of lung volume application of glucocorticoids could to some extent alleviate lung injury of patients with severe infectious atypical pneumonia however long-term and abundant use of glucocorticoids may generate numerous side effects and it is an undisputable fact that hormones may induce femoral head ischemic necrosis literature reports suggest that the incidence of femoral head ischemic necrosis is 525  the white blood cell count remains within normal range in majority patients and may decrease in some patients 242  95  of severe patients without secondary infections are revealed with decreased total white blood cell and normal neutrocyte and monocyte differential white blood cell count however 80  initially diagnosed patients manifest a decrease of absolute lymphocyte count suggestive of a tendency of gradual decline and morphocytology change with abnormal lymphocytes observable 13241  patients are examined with thrombocytopenia many evidences prove that sars-cov could directly invade the immune system and act mainly on lymphocytic system especially the t lymphocytes which could lower peripheral blood lymphocytes the peripheral blood white cell count is normal or decreased in most sars patients but cd3 cd4 and cd8 t lymphocyte counts are distinctly lower compared with those of healthy population the more severe the condition the more drastically declined the t lymphocyte count blood gas analysis reveals hypoxemia of different degrees and commonly no carbon dioxide retention generally under 35 lmin oxygen uptake patients with severe hypoxemia are measured of arterial partial pressure from oxygen pao2 70 mmhg or blood oxygen saturation spo2 93  or develop acute lung injury ali or acute respiratory distress syndrome ards one of the main immunopathogenesis changes in sars patients is insufficiency of t-lymphocyte-mediated specific cellular immunity characterized by distinct damages of t lymphocytes and its subgroups particularly cd3 cd4 and cd8 there exists distinct correlation between the extent of t lymphocyte damages and severity of the disease the method recommended by who for test of serum sars-cov antibodies is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa upon test of the sars-cov-specific antibodies in the infected patients including igg igm or total antibody seroconversion or increase by 4 times and above of any serum antibody in progress phase and recovery phase could serve as evidence for definite diagnosis 
presence of any of the following three circumstances could be sars virus positiveclinical specimens from at least two different sites are tested positive nasopharyngeal secretions and fecesthe same clinical specimens collected by at least 2 days apart are tested positive two or more specimens of nasopharyngeal excretionsthe same clinical specimen is tested positive by two different methods or in different laboratoriesrepeated pcr examination indicated positive
 
the patient has a history of intimate contact with patients or is one of the infected populations or consolidated having infected others by definite evidencesthe patient had been to or lived in the areas with sars patients and secondary infection epidemics
 the onset is acute and initial symptom is fever with body temperature 38 c and occasionally accompanied by concurrent chillness patients may also suffer from headache joint and muscular soreness fatigue and diarrhea and generally there is no upper respiratory tract catarrhal symptom patients may have cough mostly dry with scanty sputum and chest dullness severe patients demonstrate accelerated respiration shortness of breath or obvious respiratory distress pulmonary signs are not obvious and light moist rales may be audible or pulmonary consolidation observable there is generally no increase of peripheral white blood cell count or decrease besides the lymphocyte count is found generally declined lungs present different degrees of patchy and plaque-shaped infiltration shadows or reticulate changes which may progress rapidly into large patchy shadows these commonly occur at multiple lobes or both sides and absorption and dissipation of shadows are relatively slow pulmonary shadows and symptoms and signs may be inconsistent if the test indicates negative reexaminations shall be conducted after 12 days there are no remarkable responses to antibiotics patients in compliance with any of the following three circumstances are diagnosed as suspected casesthe patient has a history of intimate contact with patients or is one of the infected population or is confirmed having infecting other people by concrete evidences who also manifest aforementioned clinical symptoms but not high white blood cell count by test of peripheral bloodthe patient has been to or lived in areas reported with infectious sars patients and patients suffering from secondary infections 2 weeks before the disease onset who also have abovementioned clinical symptoms and consistent pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray films with the abovementioned characteristicsdespite the lack of epidemic data the patient has abovementioned clinical manifestations and not high peripheral white blood cell count as well as pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray that accord with abovementioned characteristics
 in other words the patient conform to the aforementioned 1 1  2  3 or 1 2 2  4 or 2  3  4 in case of any of the three following circumstances the patient could be clinically diagnosed with sarsthe patient has a history of intimate contact with patients or is one of the infected population or is confirmed having infecting other people by concrete evidences who also manifest aforementioned clinical symptoms and pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray imagethe patient has been to or lived in areas reported with infectious sars patients and patients suffering from secondary infections 2 weeks before the disease onset who also have abovementioned clinical symptoms not high peripheral blood white cell count and pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray filmsthe patient has been to or lived in areas reported with infectious sars patients and patients suffering from secondary infections 2 weeks before the disease onset who also have abovementioned clinical symptoms pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray films and no obvious response to anti-infectious treatment
 in other words the patient conform to aforementioned 1 1  2  4 or 1 2 2  3  4 or 1 2  2  4  5 the conditions are mild without pulmonary fibrosis and other sequela the prognosis is good patients have typical clinical manifestations of the early phase progression phase and recovery phase the onset is acute and the first symptom is fever with body temperature generally 38 c besides the patients have no obvious respiratory distress or hypoxemia some patients are auscultated with slight moist rales or observed with pulmonary consolidation the prognosis is good without sequelae severe type accounts for about 30  it is same with the common type in clinical process but presents severe conditions and rapid progression some cases may progress to acute pulmonary injury or ards rapidly incurring respiratory failure or even death the diagnosis could be reached in case of any of the following three circumstancesdyspnea adult respiratory frequency is 30 times min accompanied by one of the following conditionsthe chest imaging shows that the total surface of multilobar lesions or foci occupies more than 13 of the two lungs on orthotopic imagingconditions progress with the focal area increased by over 50  within 48 h or accounting for over 14 of the two lungs on orthotopic imaging
obvious hypoxemia is detected with the oxygenation index lower than 300 mmhgshock or multi-organic dysfunction syndrome occurs
 there are still some atypical cases of this disease this generally refers to the first 17 days the onset is acute and initial symptom is fever half of the patients are accompanied by the nonspecific systemic symptoms such as chillness headache and joint and muscular soreness this phase spans the day 814 of the disease course infectious toxic symptoms such as fever fatigue muscular soreness continue to exist or even aggravate patients body temperature rises possibly to 39 c or higher in a short time and the high fever is persistent lung lesions demonstrate progressive exacerbation a few patients 1015  may develop ards which is life threatening it mostly takes place at day 1521 of disease course most patients have good prognosis after recovery for about 2 weeks some severe patients could gradually recover within 23 months after discharge these mainly encompass standing chest x-ray and bedside chest x-ray which are economic and effective examination methods and first optional examination for preliminary diagnosis and reexamination mobile x-ray bedside imaging should be applied for patients under observation and inpatients as lung disease of sars patients progress rapidly chest x-ray reexamination within a short period could help observe changes of conditions commonly once every 12 days at the early phase and progression phase regular chest x-ray also need to be conducted during recovery phase so as to ascertain absorption and dissipation of lesions residual foci and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis for sars patients ct scan generally is not a preferred method and if necessary could be conducted under strict disinfected quarantine if the foci could not be absorbed for a long term in sars recovery phase or patients still have symptoms but normal chest presentations ct scan need to be carried out for further observation as it can better visualize the subtle pulmonary interstitial changes such as lung interlobular septum thickening intralobular septum thickening subpleural linear shadow and small ground-glass-density lesion and regional and segmental bronchiectasis and therefore is helpful for clinical diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis thin-layer ct scan or hrct scan can better visualize intrapulmonary low-density small lesions thus contributory to early diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis ct examination could also aid identification of other concurrent lung lesions 
ward shall be equipped with bedside x-ray machine imaging for all sars inpatients shall be conducted in wards and patients shall wear masksthe personal protection for imaging technician should be subject to the level-two protection requirements and when necessary imaging for critically ill patients to level-three protection requirementsx-ray film magazine should be put into the isolation bag before imaging one isolation bag for each personthe imaging technicians should sterilize their hands before return to the radiological department and then remove protective clothing gloves and protective glasses at the designated place they should wash hands thoroughly gargle take a shower and change clean working clothes before work

 the imaging manifestations of sars are closely related to its pathological changes besides edema inflammatory cell infiltration and other nonspecific inflammatory changes the more prominent pulmonary pathological feature of sars is abundant exfoliation of epithelial cells inducing obvious thickening and damage of alveolar septum as well as significant organization of effusions inside alveolar cavities all the three changes of inflammation in early phase degeneration exudation hyperplasia are observable the mechanism of acute lung injury induced by sars may be ascribed to sars coronavirus direct attack of alveolar epithelia and alveolar capillary epithelia or and indirect damage via lymphocyte macrophage and effector cells and lymphokine cytokine and inflammatory mediator released by them this suggests that besides viral direct infection immune reactions are also involved in lung injury in severe lung injury pulmonary interstitial and pulmonary parenchymal air cavity changes detected by autopsy pathology especially pulmonary air cavity not completely filled by lesion or filled but coexistent with unfilled alveoli are visualized as ground-glass-density shadows on x-ray and ct varying degrees of residual lung cavity present with different densities of ground-glass shadows on thin-layer ct or high-resolution ct hrct complete filling of the alveolar space leads to pulmonary consolidation shadows once pulmonary edema and alveolar hyaline membrane are formed patients clinically manifest decreased lung compliance progressive dyspnea and intractable hypoxemia it is such rapid pathological changes of sars that give rise to characteristic presentations by chest x-ray examination including rapid progression of lesions diverse morphological states and wide range often spanning several segments and lobes therefore dynamic observation of chest image holds great significance for diagnosis of sars ground-glass-density shadows are pathologically the result of lesions mainly at pulmonary interstitium and alveoli with pulmonary interstitial lesions frequently complicated by alveolitis ground-glass-density shadows incurred by alveolar consolidation are attributable to partial filling of alveoli or coexistence of filling and unfilled alveoli such shadows on x-ray and ct can be determined if the density of lesions is lower than that of blood vessels and blood vessel presentations are observable inside the density of lesions lower than that of pulmonary hila on x-ray could also help identify ground-glass-density shadows pulmonary consolidation shadows are pathologically due to filling of alveoli by pathological tissues which is frequently complicated with lung interstitial lesions pulmonary consolidation could be confirmed if the lesions are found with higher density than vascular shadows and without vascular shadows inside but with air bronchogram on x-ray and ct it could also be determined if the lesions present higher density than pulmonary hila or similar density to mediastinum the lesions are solitary or multiple in small patches and some lesions are distributed along lung lobes and segments 96  of sars patients may develop subsequently solitary and multiple small patchy shadows within seven days of onset with relatively low density blurry borders and irregular shapes predominantly solitary occasionally the pulmonary textures around lesions are revealed increased and thickened and mainly distributed at peripheral area more commonly at bilateral inferior lungs since chest x-ray can poorly visualize relatively small lesions and at sometimes posteroanterior x-ray can hardly display lesions overlapping with heart shadows orthotopic chest imaging should be conducted at the same time fig 29
 the conditions of most patients become worse within 14 days after onset the small patchy shadows in the early phase may progress into large patchy multiple or diffusive lesions the lesions may spread from unilateral lung to both lungs and from one lung field to several fields severe patients may demonstrate obvious changes 12 days after onset lesions present mainly as ground-glass-density shadows or coexist with lung consolidation shadows the center of some shadows with high density indicates consolidation and relatively low-density peripheral area suggests ground-glass density which may be complicated with thickening and increase of pulmonary textures severe patients may develop white lung some cases may have pneumothorax pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema after the use of ventilator a small part of lesions adjacent to the pleura may be complicated with local pleural thickening or revealed with mild tentiform adhesion pleural changes may reside after absorption of intrapulmonary lesions complication of slight pleural effusions may also be observable fig 210
 the lesions of sars patients begin to be absorbed in 1530 days which can be completely absorbed for majority patients a few patients may show pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary interstitial hyperplasia with apparent pulmonary interstitial hyperplasia occurring 3040 days after the onset the intrapulmonary patchy shadows present with shrinkage and increase of density to gradually form high-density cord-like and honeycomb-shaped shadows in lungs severe pulmonary interstitial proliferation could dwindle the lung volume and make the mediastinum shift to the affected side the imaging may reveal local irregular high-density plaque and cord-shaped shadows occurrence of intrapulmonary honeycomb-shaped shadows and tractional bronchiectasis is the characteristic of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis fig 211
 as rapid change is an important feature of sars chest x-ray manifestations dynamic x-ray studies and observations could provide evidences for sars definite diagnosis therefore observation of the disease dynamic change is critical to sars chest x-ray which is a major difference from x-ray examinations of other pneumonia in the early phase and progression phase of sars lung foci may undergo remarkable changes within a short time 24 h at the shortest such as expansion and dissemination which are characterized by changes in shape extent and site of the foci this suggests that clinical physicians shall conduct chest orthotopic imaging once every 2448 h after the sars patients are hospitalized so as to ascertain the disease changes imaging dynamic changes are associated with multiple factors such as age original underlying disease treatment method and efficacy the lesions are generally absorbed 14 days after onset but possibly on day 7 in some mild patients the focal shadows may become smaller with the density gradually decreased one characteristic dynamic change of sars is migrating change of lesions in some patients suggesting that the foci firstly occur at the unilateral inferior lung field and then spread to contralateral andor superior and middle lung field patients with worse lesions may manifest wider imaging extent and new foci and severe patients may develop white lung ards is a key cause leading to death of patients fig 212
 after sars infection chest abnormal changes frequently occur on day 17 in initial phase focal shadows are frequently seen which might be unilateral but dominantly bilateral ct reveals small patchy ground-glass-density shadows some of which are quasi-circular lesions present as solitary small patchy lung consolidation and multiple small patchy or relatively large patchy shadows large foci may appear as ground-glass-density shadows and concurrent lung consolidation shadows with relatively higher-density vascular shadows observable in the former besides some foci are found with increased vascular shadows at the periphery in addition lesions are unveiled frequently at the bilateral lung inferior fields and lung margins fig 213
 lesions in majority patients may progress and worsen within 14 days after onset the small patchy shadows in early phase could expand into large patchy multiple or diffusive lesions within 37 days besides lesions extend from unilateral lung to bilateral lungs from one lung field to multiple lung fields most patients could develop the severest infiltration of lungs on day 814 namely peak phase or critical phase ct presentations are still predominated by ground-glass-density shadows which may be complicated by pulmonary consolidation lesions are commonly multiple and in diffusive distribution at both lungs and lesions of varying shapes may coexist with quasi-circular foci relatively common some cases appear with ground-glass-density shadows all the time from onset to absorption of lesions when ground-glass-density shadows are complicated by pulmonary consolidation the large patchy small patchy or quasi-circular ground-glass-density shadows could be observed with pulmonary consolidation shadows of relatively high density ground-glass density and pulmonary consolidation may also occur at different parts of the lung and could be visualized on the same layer or different layers of ct for lesions typical of pulmonary consolidation pulmonary consolidation appears as plaque-shaped high-density shadows or consolidation signs at lung lobes and segments in addition lesions are frequently recorded at lung lobe segment of the inferior lobe and outer band of lung field fig 214
 lesions usually begin to be absorbed 23 weeks after onset with the shadow shrunk and density gradually reduced and absorbed although the clinical symptoms of some patients improve and disappear light ground-glass-density shadows could still be seen in lungs on ct it may prolong a relatively long time during the absorption of intrapulmonary lesions there is also concurrent pulmonary interstitial proliferation which begins to be absorbed under dynamic observation some lesions may develop into pulmonary interstitial fibrosis characterized by lobular septum intralobular septum interstitial thickening and subpleural curvature imaging signs as well as regional irregular high-density plaque and cord-like presentations occurrence of intrapulmonary honeycomb manifestations and tractional bronchiectasis signifies pulmonary interstitial fibrosis fig 215
 in the early phase sars manifests bronchiolar and peripheral interstitial pneumonia which could further progress into alveolar consolidation with interstitial lesions present persistently and mostly reversible in the recovery phase only some cases develop into pulmonary interstitial proliferation and then cause fibrotic changes pulmonary interstitial proliferation and fibrosis degree and outcome are associated with the extent of pulmonary involvement in peak phase occurrence of complications and treatment generally if lesions on chest image are light in peak phase there will be fewer pulmonary changes left in recovery phase contrarily patients with diffusive lung interstitial thickening in recovery phase are often those suffering from relatively severe pulmonary injury in peak phase and involvement of the great mass of lungs particularly patients with recurrent conditions protracted course and concurrent infections researches demonstrate that 78  of sars patients have pulmonary fibrosis of varying degrees and male patients display relatively more obvious pulmonary impairment than female patients primary manifestations are lung dysfunction such as decrease of pulmonary diffusion capacity lung capacity impairment and change of total lung capacity particularly residual volume generally obvious pulmonary interstitial proliferation occurs at about 3050 days after onset which presents firstly lobular septum and intralobular thickening and subpleural curvature shadows then there is the shrinkage of intrapulmonary patchy shadows with increase of density and gradual formation of high-density cord and honeycomb shadows inside lungs severe pulmonary interstitial proliferation could diminish lung volume and compel the mediastinum to affected side besides pulmonary interstitial proliferation could occur extensively inside lungs predominated by lobular septum intralobular interstitial thickening and subpleural curvature shadows as well as irregular high-density plaque and cord-like shadows at some regions honeycomb-shaped shadows and tractional bronchiectasis are signs of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis ct reveals cord reticulate and honeycomb-shaped shadows and hrct could better visualize the subtle abnormal changes of pulmonary interstitium such as lobular septum thickening intralobular interstitial thickening subpleural curvature shadows and honeycomb-shaped shadows whether the cord-like and reticulate changes visualized by ct are completely absorbed or induce persistent fibrosis still entails long-term follow-up observation fig 216
 numerous sars patients develop osteonecrosis after recovery which mostly appears as femoral head necrosis and also possibly necrosis of the ankle joint knee joint and shoulder joint scans of bilateral hips and knees of 82 sars patients in rehabilitation phase disclosed that 51 patients 62  suffered from osseous abnormality of which bone ischemia accounts for 17  and implication of three sites for 20  its pathogenesis still remains not completely ascertained and it may be ascribed to improper use of hormones and injury of sclerotin from sars viruses bacterial embolism lipid embolism or multiple mixed factors the primary pathological change of aseptic necrosis of femoral head is degenerative alteration due to femoral head blood circulation disturbance mainly characterized by limping and pain the lower limb of the affected side is relatively shorter and presents with light flexion and adduction as well as with slightly limited abduction and intorsion initial x-ray examinations suggest that the involved femoral head has normal appearance but inhomogeneous density with spotted osteoporosis gradually ensue the increase of density as a result of osteonecrosis which meanwhile is interspersed with some transparent shadows femoral head may become flat fragmented and irregular in contour from pressures typical femoral head necrosis appears in the shape of wedge with the base toward articular surface and the top toward metaphysis since lesions are dominantly confined at the anterosuperior area of femoral head lateral imaging of hip joints could clearly reproduce the extent of lesions the necrotic area is encircled by a ring of transparent band hip articular cavity may become wider and irregular due to flattening of the femur sometimes there may be complication of dislocation the fragments of femoral head may be shed off into the joint giving rise to joint mouse normal femoral head is located at the acetabular center in the transverse ct image and may appear in the shape of sphere or hook on different layers with delicate high-density bone cortex at the periphery the high-density trabeculae inside femoral head are arranged in stelliform formation from the center continually to bone cortex named as stelliform sign ct manifestations of aseptic necrosis of femoral head can be divided into early and advanced phase in the early phase the stelliform sign formed by the trabeculae of femoral head is deformed or absent presenting spotted and patchy shadows of increased density inside femoral head and fasciculate changes or mutual fusion at its periphery in the advanced phase femoral head become ruptured and out of shape and absorption of sclerotin between bone fragments appears as irregular low-density area with stelliform sign disappeared mri manifestations of aseptic necrosis of femoral head include necrotic areas of femoral head of early cases have no repair reactions or mechanic collapse and still maintain normal lipid signals of medullary bones however low-signal margins incurred by sclerosis reactions could be seen at the periphery of foci the t1 high signals of normal femoral head on t1-weighted image are detected with black linear low signals representing demarcation between normal and ischemic bone tissues on t2-weighted image a high-signal line is visible at the medial low-signal sclerotic reaction line thus forming the typical double-line sign the double-line sign could reflect congestion and inflammation of granulation tissues and proves specific to aseptic necrosis of femoral head severe inflammation congestion fibrosis and sclerosis could greatly deplete the amount of lipids of femoral head which presents liquid-like signals on mri low signals on t1-weighted image and high signals on t2-weighted images advanced cases are typical of fibrosis and sclerosis and the affected area present with fibrotic mri features that is low signals on t1- and t2-weighted and proton density-weighted imaging complication with effusions in hip joints appears as t1 low signals and t2 high signals based on mri presentations aseptic necrosis of femoral head could be classified into four phases phase i is characterized by homogenous or inhomogeneous low-signal areas adjacent to the joint above the femoral head on t1-weighted imaging phase ii is visualized with wedge-shaped low-signal bands phase iii presents with sequestrum crescent sign and cortex collapse phase iv manifests joint degeneration and joint space narrowing besides presentations of phase iii in light of the aforementioned mr staging criteria sars cases complicated by aseptic necrosis of femoral head already reported are mostly in phase ii additionally aseptic necrosis after use of hormones besides most frequently involvement of the femoral head could also implicate other joints such as the knee joint elbow joint ankle joint and acetabulum therefore if necessary mr examinations of other joints shall be conducted to ascertain the extent and degree of lesions if sars patients complain of pain at both hip joints and limited movement ct scan or mri examination of both hip joints is recommended to conclude definite diagnosis x-ray plain scan is not sensitive to early bone ischemic necrosis which therefore is not preferred fig 217 and 218

  the search for a practical approach to emerging diseases the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars carlo selmi aftab ansari a pietro invernizzi mauro podda m gershwin eric   perhaps the most intimate relationship between the environment and the development of the vertebrate species is the interaction of the immune system with infectious disease agents this is best exemplified by antigenic variations that occur in infectious disease agents such as viral peptides and the corresponding plasticity of the host to recognize the new variant in order to survive this constant battle between host and parasite has occupied the minds of scientists from a number of disciplines not only including immunologists but also evolutionary biologists it is hypothesized that the fine components of our innate and acquired immune systems have evolved by such environmental pressures some of which have translated into beneficial outcomes and others to debilitating chronic diseases and others yet to death the beneficial outcomes clearly outweigh the negatives as evidenced by the mere survival of the human species the debilitating outcomes are manifest by the ever increasing rise in chronic urban diseases such as asthma or autoimmune diseases and those leading to death include conditions such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids or ebola haemorragic fever the recent appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is the latest amongst these challenges for the human immune system these illnesses may be seen as a race for evolution between mutualistic partners one of which is represented by humans the evolution rates of the partners are always asymmetric for reasons peculiar to each and every interaction dawkins and krebs 1979  as a consequence of these factors however it is now accepted that coevolutionary processes always favor the rapid rate of evolution as stated by the red queen theory bergstrom and lachmann 2003  this explains why in the challenge against sars or other emerging infectious diseases research will be the key element to the final victory according to a retrospective study by the center for disease control cdc involving case reports during the year 1992 from four us counties located in california oregon minnesota and connecticut as many as 14 of deaths occurred in people 1 -49 years old without an underlying medical condition may have been due to infectious causes perkins et al 1996  this observation takes on added significance because in the latter quarter of the last century a number of new infectious agents and diseases have been identified including among others legionnaires disease winn 1988  lymes disease burgdorfer 2001  the human immunodeficiency virus hiv montagnier 2002  the hepatitis c virus hcv purcell 1993  and more recently the hantavirus responsible for a new pulmonary syndrome hawes and seabolt 2003 and the nipah virus outbreak in south east asia lam and chua 2002  although some of these diseases ie legionnaires disease and lymes borrelliosis are treated with antibiotics new and untreatable pathology is constantly emerging because of human intrusions into newer ecological surroundings international transportation advances and the evolution of organisms by spontaneous andor induced mutations or recombinations leading to the potential to cross species barriers ironically the evolution of new etiological agents of disease are reminiscent of the japanese art of origami with new patterns and images formed at each and every turn in such situations clinicians and researchers face the challenge of defining etiological agents establishing assays for rapid diagnosis instituting barriers to limit infection and developing efficient therapeutic and preventive options sars is the latest of these infectious challenges outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-worldwide 2003 indeed sars appears as the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century it is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality thus making it a challenge for clinicians and researchers worldwide as of april 18th 2003 over 3400 patients have been diagnosed with the disease with almost 200 deaths in 25 countries across all five continents this may be just the tip of the iceberg as the number of cases in china may be inaccurate major outbreaks of sars were initially reported in some provinces of the peoples republic of china both mainland and hong kong acute respiratory syndrome china hong kong special administrative region of china and viet nam 2003 tsang et al 2003  as well as in singapore outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-worldwide 2003 hanoi vietnam outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-worldwide 2003 and canada poutanen et al 2003  the clusters in toronto canada and hong kong in which the index cases apparently stayed on the same floor of the same hotel together with the high number of healthcare workers that became infected made the hypothesis of an environmental non-infectious cause unlikely after the first reports were known several measures were proposed to limit the spread of the disease table i  despite such measures sars continues to spread in the united states so far over two hundred suspected cases in 34 states have been reported with no lethal case observed cdc reports as of april 17th 2003 some of the specimens found positive for the suspected viral agent were from us patients ksiazek et al 2003  however until a clear definition of sars is established the number of actual cases will be unreliable major problems stand in the way of limiting the spread of disease first sars has spread throughout the world along international air travel routes thus individuals may travel during an incubation period and become symptomatic only later second as the number of cases increases it is becoming harder to identify some of the risk factors involved in the infection thus making the tracking of previous contacts more difficult third the potential of a vector that can transmit this disease whether alive or not has yet to be entertained fourth the first sars cases were in november 2002 but there was no warning by the chinese government acute respiratory syndrome china hong kong special administrative region of china and viet nam 2003 causing a tragic delay in control measures various laboratory based diagnostic methods have been used for the detection of a responsible agent including light and electron microscopy immunohistochemistry cell culture isolation serology and molecular techniques these studies have led to the identification of a viral agent in a significant fraction of infected patients from different sars clusters and by different laboratories which was not detected in geographically matched healthy controls drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003  thus denoting an element of specificity the virus belongs to the coronavirus family although it appears to be significantly different from any known members of the same family so far described based on the entire nucleotide sequence which has recently been determined drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003  it must be stressed however that this virus has been identified in most but not all patients diagnosed with sars thus failing to exclude the co-occurrence of some other infectious agent as suggested by some evidence drosten et al 2003  or the presence of a diverse group of coronavirus nonetheless a recent press release suggests that a sars-like disease has been experimentally induced in monkeys infected with the same organism altman 2003  thus fulfilling kochs postulate the coronaviruses family is known to have a very narrow host range each of them infecting one or just a few species known human pathogens belonging to this group include viruses responsible for the common cold in small seasonal outbreaks makela et al 1998  a method to mutate the spike glycoprotein of some coronaviruses has been recently described that allows the naturally irreversible crossing of host cell species barriers kuo et al 2000 haijema et al 2003  the hypothesis that this newly identified virus might be the result of wet bench laboratory experiments in this direction is clearly cause for concern but no evidence has yet been found to support this view on the other hand such data raise new patients should limit interactions outside the home and should not go to work school out-of-home child care or other public areas until 10 days after the resolution of fever provided respiratory symptoms are absent or improving during the same time infection control precautions should be used to minimize the potential for transmission  all members of a household with a sars patient should carefully follow recommendations for hand hygiene eg frequent hand washing or use of alcohol-based hand rubs particularly after contact with body fluids eg respiratory secretions urine or feces  use of disposable gloves should be considered for any direct contact with body fluids of a sars patient  if possible a sars patient should wear a surgical mask during close contact with uninfected persons when a sars patient is unable to wear a surgical mask household members should wear surgical masks when in close contact with the patient  sharing of eating utensils towels and bedding between sars patients and others should be avoided  household waste soiled with body fluids of sars patients including facial tissues and surgical masks may be discarded as normal waste  household members and other close contacts of sars patients should be actively monitored by the local health department and should be vigilant for the development of fever or respiratory symptoms and if these develop should seek healthcare evaluation however at this time in the absence of fever or respiratory symptoms household members or other close contacts of sars patients do not need to limit their activities outside the home hope in the attempt to inactivate the virus other features previously described for coronaviruses should be addressed for the understanding of mechanisms of human pathogenicity for example only a few genomic point mutations can lead to a drastic change in the organ trophism of the virus thus modifying the clinical syndrome ballesteros et al 1997 sanchez et al 1999  a similar process may have caused the leap from animals into humans pearson 2003  others have suggested that the appearance of this new agent is a result of the high recombination rate amongst these viruses de haan et al 2002  however data from the complete genome sequence of the putative agent do not support this latter hypothesis pearson 2003  finally from a clinical standpoint while no clear diagnostic criteria have been defined a list of readily recognized signs and symptoms has been outlined by the cdc which should raise an index of suspicion for possible diagnosis of sars table ii  nonetheless until the etiologic factor is clearly identified and a true and reliable diagnostic test described it will be mandatory to keep a high index of suspicion for cases that fit the general criteria of sars and to follow isolation precautions for known cases sars has been described by the world health organization who as a rapidly progressive sometimes fatal pneumonia that appears to have arisen from the guangdong province in southern china in november 2002 acute respiratory syndrome china hong kong special administrative region of china and viet nam 2003  accordingly initial laboratory efforts towards the identification of the responsible agent were focused on a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and available epidemiologic information evidence collected so far preliminary clinical description of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2003 indicates that sars has an incubation period spanning from 1 to 11 days and the major mode of transmission is through droplet spread although airborne transmission or a role for contaminated objects cannot be ruled out at the present time it is accepted that patients are highly infectious during the symptomatic phase of sars it is not clear at present whether the infectious state is also present in pre-symptomatic stages andor during recovery however a list of hygienic measures that should be implemented has been described by the cdc table i  there is also no current information about the potential for an asymptomatic carrier state there have been extraordinary efforts already made to identify the agent obtain viral nucleotide sequence establish methods to culture and grow the potential agent develop a reliable elisa assay establish rt-pcr conditions etc all made possible by well co-ordinated studies of scientists throughout the world this degree of co-coperationsharing of data is a monumental accomplishment by the scientific community and should be applauded within this context unlike hiv where the formulation of an effective candidate vaccine has been a daunting task it is reasonable to assume that a candidate vaccine for the coronavirus agent responsible for sars will be a reality in the relatively near future this is likely because unlike hiv a large number of individuals who get infected with sars recover from the infection and appear to become healthy and normal this evidence suggests that the bodys immune system is capable of containing the virus thus it seems reasonable that a safe and effective vaccine in the form of a live attenuated recombinant or killed vaccine may become a reality based on epidemiological and clinical characteristics sars is the first severe new disease of the 21st century with worldwide epidemic potential the mode of transmission and its lethal potential have generated alarm with the notable exception of hivaids the new diseases that appeared during the last twenty years or have established endemicity in new geographical areas have features that limit their capacity to pose a major threat to international public health some of these in fact such as avian influenza horimoto and kawaoka 2001  nipah virus hooper and williamson 2000  hendra virus hooper and williamson 2000  hanta virus hawes and seabolt 2003 do not demonstrate a high rate of efficient human-to-human transmission other infections such as escherichia coli o157h7 park et al 2001  variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease taylor 2002  strictly depend on food as a vehicle of transmission west nile fever nedry and mahon 2003 and rift valley fever wilson 1994 that have spread to new geographical areas beside requiring a vector as part of the transmission cycle were moreover associated with low mortality often in high-risk groups other entities such as neisseria meningitidis w135 wilder-smith et al 2003  and the imported haemorrhagic fevers ebola marburg and crimean-congo leduc 1989 did not significantly spread from the original strong geographical foci the ebola fever in particular raised major concerns as some outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever were found associated with mortality rates in the range of 53 in uganda outbreak of ebola haemorrhagic fever uganda august 2000 -january 2001  2001 to 81 in the democratic republic of the congo ebola hemorragic fever congo-update 2003  it must be stressed however that with these agents the transmission of the responsible agents requires close physical exposure to infected blood and other bodily fluids and that in most cases patients in the period of high infectivity are too sick to travel sars indicates a great potential for rapid international spread under favorable conditions such as those created by the density of international travels data available so far preliminary clinical description of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2003 indicate that the incubation period should vary from 1 to 11 days allowing the infectious agent to be transported unsuspected and undetected in an asymptomatic air traveller throughout the world on the other hand interpersonal transmission through close contact with respiratory secretions associated with a lack of knowledge of the precise initial symptoms led to a concentration of cases in previously healthy hospital staff and an alarming proportion of patients requiring intensive care the economic losses due to sars have already been substantial in se asia and should sars continue to spread will have a global effect prompt identification of suspect cases is critical in the definition of emerging infectious diseases in order to achieve this goal the cdc established in 1994 an emerging infections program eip aimed at receiving reports from physicians on potential unexplained deaths or admission due to possibly infectious causes this project together with an effort to strengthen global surveillance including prompt reporting adequate laboratory capacity and the expertise to be mobilized quickly across national boundaries to follow disease movements as also provided by the global outbreak alert and response network by the who is of obvious importance in the challenge provided by sars and all emerging diseases even those derived from terroristic threats at the present time it is impossible to foresee the outcome of this global emergency will the outbreaks be contained and prevented from becoming an endemic infection in human populations or will they assume a cyclic pattern thus reappearing again in the same or in another geographical area in the future an rt-pcr assay for the identification of the agent an elisa assay for the detection of acute and convalescent serum titers against the coronavirus agent and a method to culture the etiologic agent have been established chemotherapeutic agents are currently being screened for their potential anti-coronavirus effects and a potential animal model for vaccine testing is in progress in a world where all national borders are permeable to microbial agents we are reminded of a quote from the american poet wallace stevens who stated at the beginning of the 20th century that thought is an infection and in the case of certain thoughts it becomes an epidemic  operative team checklist for aerosol generating procedures to minimise exposure of healthcare workers to sars-cov-2 marlene soma ian jacobson jessica brewer angela blondin gretel davidson shamani singham   the world health organization who declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the virus sars-cov-2 a pandemic on 11 march 2020 1 droplet inhalation into the respiratory tract and contact transmission through infected secretions are thought to be the chief routes of person to person transmission 2 the potential for airborne transmission is still being studied 3 4 5 6 and if proven will have a major impact on measures to reduce transmission as well as the need and use of personal protective equipment ppe 7 8 9 10 patient respiratory activity and medical procedures such as intubation bronchoscopy or respiratory tract suctioning are thought to generate aerosols that may remain airborne for some time and place healthcare workers at risk of infection otolaryngologists and anaesthetists in particular perform these high risk aerosol generating procedures agp which expose them to potential droplet contact and airborne transmission of sars-cov-2 5 8 10 11 12 13 whether the patient is in a symptomatic or asymptomatic phase of the disease process as the case numbers of covid-19 have grown exponentially around the world elective surgical operations have been reduced in many centres to allow diversion of resources to areas of need such as intensive care units there are circumstances however in which agp still need to be performed in preparation for undertaking these procedures as safely as possible there has been an overwhelming amount of information to absorb from the growing literature medical society statements governmental recommendations hospital infection control and local department policies as well as newsfeeds and social media exchanges between health professionals the situation is changing daily resulting in generalised heightened anxiety among healthcare workers about access to appropriate ppe 7 10 or powered air-purifying respirators papr 10 11 and how to modify protocols for agp from usual practice to minimise risk during this pandemic some paediatric services have been taken over by adult patients and staff have needed to be deployed to areas they have had minimal training in infected healthcare workers can affect departmental rostering such that agp may need to be undertaken by clinicians who are less accustomed to the procedure in normal circumstances emergencies requiring agp may need attendance after hours and working with unfamiliar staff with variable skillsets and knowledge of the risks for all of these reasons a concise and unified operative team checklist detailing the principles of patient flow can be helpful for staff involved with agp to consider and follow approaching agp during this crisis requires a shift in mindset of the whole team involved moving away from productivity and turnover to instead emphasising safety and risk mitigation this requires actively taking time to pause and contemplate instances when respiratory secretions could be aerosolised and the area where they might linger the surfaces that may be contaminated by droplets and how to minimise these routes of transmission to healthcare workers surgeons and anaesthetists need to be proactive in balancing safe patient management with protection not only of themselves but their trainees nursing and operating theatre staff a checklist can provide a practical framework for the immediate pre-operative intra-operative and post-operative needs of the participating teams and can be modified to suit individual preferences procedures hospital layout and practices breaking down the steps into manageable practical components that can be printed onto a couple of pages and ticked off rather than multi-page documents from several stakeholder departments and authorities may reduce the intimidation of undertaking agp during the covid-19 pandemic the authors work at a tertiary childrens hospital that is co-located with a tertiary adults and womens hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit the operating theatre complex is shared between the hospitals with designated theatres for adults children and the womens hospital though there can be crossover use of the facilities if needed all authors are experienced in otolaryngology procedures especially those involving aerosol generation in preparation for performing agp on patients positive for covid-19 or whose status is unknown and treated as potentially positive the authors collated information from australian and international society statements 14 15 16 17 18 who publications 8 local state health department recommendations hospital department policies and reviewed the emerging literature 5 10 11 12 19 20 21 22 23 three agp were undertaken prior to the formulation of the operative team checklist simulation was performed with a mannequin in the operating theatre using the example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy for retrieval of an airway foreign body amendments to the checklist were made after performing 14 various high risk otolaryngology agp on paediatric and adult patients with unknown covid-19 status presumed positive one of these cases was the emergency removal of a pistachio nut from a distal left main bronchus on a 16-month old child weighing 107kg that had been inhaled 6 days prior to presentation figure 1
 the child was covid negative but managed as status unknown with full high risk agp precautions to allow real life simulation and identification of areas for improvement a unified checklist was created to incorporate the perspectives of all the teams involved details were included as reminders for staff less acquainted with the nuances of the modifications to be made for agp the design was intended to be adaptable such that equipment or considerations for other high risk agp eg tracheostomy endoscopic sinus surgery could be easily substituted and updates made as further evidence unfolds and practices are refined depending on the patients condition it is preferable to perform agp during daytime working hours a designated covid-19 or on call anaesthetic team may need to be activated to attend a pre-operative anaesthetic assessment should include the need for pre-medication and local anaesthesia cream application as well as timing of administration for a child the surgical team is responsible for ensuring that all relevant results are available as well as consent paperwork including consent for collection of intra-operative swab for covid-19 testing if status is unknown specific operating theatres should be allocated for treating these patients preferably in a negative pressure room with separate access to the main theatre block entrance if the layout of the operating complex dictates that the room is in a thoroughfare area signs or barriers should be erected to notify staff that a high risk patient is attending and to avoid unnecessary passage through that area essential information from the surgical team should include the patients age covid-19 status and risk profile procedure indication relevant clinical background and investigations fasting time and anticipated need for ppe versus papr if available in our institution papr sterilised through the central sterile services department is available though not mandated for all participating staff prior training in its use donning and doffing is required and the surgical team will not perform high risk agp without it relevant clinical imaging may need to be printed to have available in the operating theatre though will be disposed of at the end of the case specific anticipated concerns should be acknowledged such as highlighting the times when aerosol generation is anticipated to be greatest patient in extremis known difficult airway extreme obesity and difficult intravenous access or druganaesthetic allergies the senior surgeon and anaesthetist should communicate their preferred techniques for general anaesthesia delivery and surgical plan with back-up plans discussed both teams need to be flexible and open to considering alternative techniques balancing the goals for the agp with the risks of secretion aerosolisation the use of the microscope might be deemed impractical or not feasible due to the use of papr and a telescopic assessment may need to suffice if a therapeutic intervention is indicated cold steel techniques are preferred over powered instrumentation diathermy and laser modalities are avoided due to the generation of plume haemostasis is obtained through the use of topical agents eg 110000 adrenaline or oxymetazoline applied on neuropatties in the case of a paediatric patient the caregiver may or may not be allowed to escort the child to the operating theatre complex and anticipated pre-medication timing or transport issues to the designated entrance should be considered in our institution the childs caregiver who is presumed to be covid-19 positive does not accompany them to reduce the number of people involved and to maintain distancing from the operative team the anaesthetic team is responsible for notifying the patients location of the plan and any ancillary items needed to accompany the patient such as essential photocopied paperwork and paediatric surgical masks for laryngo-bronchoscopy the pros and cons of spontaneous ventilation versus apnoeic techniques should be evaluated depending on the indication for surgery patient condition individual preference and experience trying new techniques under circumstances of heightened staff anxiety may not be as safe or efficient as usual practice and may risk unnecessary rescue procedures that will increase inadvertent aerosolisation of patient secretions modes of general anaesthesia delivery should be decided upon including the need for suitable adaptors or connectors attempts to use closed suctioning and ventilating systems are advised if practical and available the use of topical local anaesthesia amount type and who is going to deliver it should be clarified if using the mode of administration onto the larynx should be slow and deliberate eg droplet delivered through a blunt catheter avoiding atomisation and potential spray back towards the operator systemic agents to reduce upper airway secretions or topical nasal decongestants applied on a pledget or slowly dripped in via a syringe rather than sprayed can be of benefit in some circumstances systemic steroids to reduce airway inflammation may need to be clarified depending on the patients pathology and the latest evidence based recommendations for a known covid-19 positive patient the role of preparing the nasal and oral cavity with a 05 solution of povidone iodine on pledgets for its virocidal properties towards sars-cov-2 is unknown at this point in time 24 25 26 27 but is considered an option at our institution care should be taken in an open airway to avoid aspiration of large volumes of topical treatments that may trigger laryngospasm talking through the process from start to finish can be helpful for the whole team to hear in the rare event of an arrest situation the anaesthetic team are expected to manage within the room without activation of the general emergency call button until other staff with appropriate ppe or papr arrive concept of protected code blue 11 the post-operative strategy including reversal of anaesthesia to minimise coughing and aerosol generation recovery location recovery staff involvement and transfer destination should also be communicated prior to commencing the case designating the orientation of the operating table position of staff equipment cables suction sharps bins and waste disposal units can be helpful to streamline the procedure patient transfer in and out minimise theatre door opening and time wastage the anaesthetic team should allocate sites to place contaminated masks and laryngoscopes that may be required at later stages to minimise contact exposure for both teams eg disposable kidney dish on left side of patient near the head under plastic drape alternative warming technologies are employed rather than forced air warming blankets such as 3m bair huggertm further barrier precautions between the patient and team may be considered depending on the level of ppe available and type of procedure this can include items such as a clear perspex box 28 operating table side arm used for suspension microlaryngoscopy screening bar attachment or even a mayo instrument table with the solid tray removed draped with a large clear plastic sheet to limit aerosolisation in the room but allow for unhampered hand movements during manipulation of the airway 22 29 the clear plastic can be secured to the operating table with adhesive drape tape at the free edges to prevent air escape and slippage only keeping access for instruments unrestricted ideally these measures should have been trialled in a simulation setting beforehand to identify any visual or ergonomic concerns and the choice made available in the room before the patient arrives clear plastic drapes however may encourage condensation and concentrate droplet secretions onto surfaces underneath it especially the anaesthetists and surgeons hands and forearms the patients face and surrounds a suction device or smoke evacuator under the plastic drape may draw aerosols away from the operators and if used should be secured as close to the source of aerosol emission as possible such that flow is directed caudally away from the team but not in a position to interfere with anaesthetic gas delivery at our institution an additional plastic backed absorbable underpad sheet 395 x 550 mm blue sheet is placed beneath the patients head and a smaller clear plastic drape over the patients exposed torso to allow visualisation of chest movements and to reduce surface contamination of the patient adjacent operating table and linen 22 a team member is designated to oversee plastic drape removal at the end of the case to reduce the risk of droplet spread from these sites the surgical and anaesthetic teams each have essential equipment and consumables required to be kept inside the operating theatre for agp anaesthetic drugs should be drawn up and labelled in disposable trays to minimise the need to access the drug trolley these requirements can be detailed beforehand on preference cards based on local practices and supplies available however it is advisable that the surgeon and anaesthetist in charge confirm what they anticipate will be required for that specific procedure and not just rely on a pre-prepared list to limit having to search for things outside the room once the procedure has commenced and to reduce wastage of unused items that will be deemed contaminated detailing the need not only for surgical hardware but other specific items such as size and types of syringes eg luer lock sizes of flexible forceps topical medications microbiology swabs sputum traps and specimen containers with patient labels available can be helpful beforehand to streamline the execution of agp and allow the focus to be maintained on minimising aerosolisation keeping potential equipment drugs and consumables close at hand but not in the theatre will reduce time taken for the nursing runners to travel to stock rooms and search for items sterile reusable instruments that have been opened during agp may be subject to a lengthy turnaround time for sterilisation after the case if there are limited supplies in the institution eg bronchoscopy grasper forceps it may be preferable to keep anticipated instruments clean just outside the room to be handed in as needed technology can sometimes fail at crucial moments and unexpected pathology may make it prudent to have spare telescopes of various sizes and angulation cameras and light leads also in close proximity extra anti-fog and warmed water can assist in poor endoscopic visibility situations arising from the temperature differential between the operating theatre environment and the patients lower airway a range of airway devices eg different endotracheal tubes disposable or non-disposable flexible bronchoscopes with associated adaptorsconnectors endoscopic baskets and balloon catheters may need to be available if the initial plan is altered once the full team huddle has been completed the anaesthetic and surgical teams should have their own individual team huddles to prepare themselves and equipment they will be using a brief moment should be taken for staff welfare nutritionhydration bathroom use and to remove personal devices such as watches jewellery pens pagers and mobile phones to reduce their contamination back up arrangements are made to cover the surgical and anaesthetic teams who will not be able to be contacted during the procedure patient details can be entered onto an image capture system at this point if being used if covid-19 status is unknown and no testing has occurred prior a request form for an intra-operative swab is prepared so a specimen can be collected under general anaesthesia in our institution this does not change the management or approach but will be useful for contact tracing if the result is positive communication methods within the operating theatre and between the operating room and the outside should be checked as it can be extremely challenging to relay equipment needs through the closed doors when wearing ppe papr in particular generates background noise for each individual and muffles voices such that deliberate effort is required to speak slowly loudly and clearly closed loop communication is essential for the smooth progression of the case and patience is required for the repetition this entails bluetooth headsets worn under papr may be an option if they are able to be inclusive for enough critical staff and be cleaned appropriately theatre phones intercoms and walkie talkie devices if being used should be checked to be functional beforehand in our experience having a specific hand gesture to flag attention between the inside team members is useful writing messages on a small portable whiteboard or even simply paper on a clipboard can facilitate being understood within the operating theatre or for the inside team to communicate with the outside clean runners through the viewing window hand hygiene and donning of ppe or papr is performed in line with local institution infection control practice this should be rehearsed prior ideally on several occasions so that it is familiar and comfortable if departmental rather than individually allocated papr are being used keeping a register of the device user will be important for contact tracing in the event of a healthcare worker becoming covid-19 positive name or role tags on the front of balaclavas or head coverings can be helpful as the team is likely to vary due to rostering staff may be difficult to differentiate when in identical full ppe and addressing an individual by name tends to be more effective for gaining attention all surgical instruments are opened and checked in the operating theatre surgical staff should test that the telescopes forceps and suction devices are the correct size and length to fit through closed circuit ports as we have encountered this step can be crucial in a small child where rigid instrumentation has limitations in terms of access concurrent ventilation delivery and therapeutic retrieval resulting in a prolonged airway procedure even with experienced team members depending on the layout of the room endoscopic equipment should be connected white balance and focus adjustments pre-completed and instrument trolleys positioned so as to not impede access of the patient and their bed into the room when all teams are in agreement the patient location is notified to prepare the patient and they are retrieved by the designated members the patient preferably wears a surgical mask for the transport though this may be variably tolerated by a child a phone call should be made to update the operating theatre when the patient is about to depart to confirm readiness for arrival and to minimise patient waiting time in an open environment in our institution a photocopy of the patients identifying details pre-operative checklist and consent form are the only paperwork to accompany them and are destroyed after the case to reduce staff contamination following the procedure a surgical check-in is performed on arrival to the theatre complex and the patient is brought directly into the operating theatre for the team time out who surgical safety checklist to be performed the anaesthetic bay is bypassed to keep it a clean area for the anaesthetic runner once the patient has entered the room the team within the operating theatre do not exit it until the completion of the case to minimise external contamination prior to commencement all staff are reminded to cross monitor each other for potential contamination during the procedure the anaesthetic team commence induction using their preferred technique and instrumentation with the surgical and scrub staff staying distanced from the head of the patient preferably more than 15 metres away in a cranial direction until required to approach intravenous access is established by the clean anaesthetist and laryngoscopy is performed by the contaminated anaesthetist use of a video-laryngoscope is recommended to improve visualisation reduce the need for repeated airway instrumentation and distance the anaesthetist from the airway the shared screen may also allow the surgeon to obtain enough of an overview of the supraglottis and larynx prior to airway securement to not require direct re-examination of an open airway in some circumstances if using local anaesthesia or other topical preparations are carefully applied at this point in our institution a nasopharyngealoropharyngeal swab is collected for covid-19 once the child is sufficiently deep but prior to the application of povidone iodine to these sites avoiding irrigation or spraying a tracheal aspirate obtained via a sputum trap may have a higher sensitivity for polymerase chain reaction pcr testing though care should be taken to collect this via a closed system to reduce risk to heath care workers in the room the patient is positioned and draped in the agreed manner the goals when undertaking agp during the covid-19 pandemic are to minimise aerosolisation reduce open airway time and avoid staff exposure this may require a higher awareness to slow down familiar movements and reflexive behaviours if working under a clear plastic drape the primary operator and anaesthetist should try to keep their hands under it minimise excessive or rapid drape elevation as instruments are passed in and avoid touching other surfaces or items unnecessarily having instruments required under the drape if it is large enough to extend to the adjacent instrument table may be possible if an open airway technique is preferred for laryngo-bronchoscopy the lowest gas flows possible to maintain oxygenation are used consider methods such as using insufflating channels on the laryngoscope to distance the anaesthetists hands from the airway an initial diagnostic look for dynamic and anatomical assessment with a hopkins rod can allow for further procedure planning depending on the circumstances and patient size an appropriate endotracheal tube loaded over the hopkins rod during this look can be left in situ once the telescope is withdrawn to buy some time with a safely secured airway whilst other instruments are prepared a rigid ventilating bronchoscope can be used for the same purpose and allows maintenance of visualisation accessories such as the rubber telescope guide bridge attachment storz fluvog adaptor and guide piece with rubber stopper for the working channel assist creating a greater seal in the example of paediatric foreign body retrieval the spontaneous ventilation technique can be more familiar and efficient allow an unobstructed view and the position of the foreign body may be more stable inhalational anaesthetic induction may be delivered via a standard face mask followed by several options including oropharyngeal insufflation less mucosal manipulation than nasopharyngeal route temporary placement of a laryngeal mask airway lma or endotracheal tube or immediate handover to the surgical team to take over management with their instruments of choice if a face mask is used excessive positive pressure is avoided however gentle support may be required to avoid atelectasis and alveolar derecruitment the best airway seal will be obtained by inflating the cuff of an endotracheal tube but this may not always be appropriate or available depending on the size of the child or the condition being treated eg child with croup subglottic stenosis or proximal airway foreign body maintaining distance from the open end of airway devices is advised to avoid close direct visualisation and suction through a rigid bronchoscope the use of a glass window plug flexible suction catheter and endoscopy forceps through the working channel can help if other endoscopic equipment is not available or suitable but may have its limitations there will however be circumstances where having an open airway is unavoidable such as retrieval of a laryngeal foreign body suction in this situation should be minimised as much as possible with all airway manipulation nursing staff andor surgical assistants need to occlude suction tubing and only release it when signalled similarly the anaesthetic team should communicate with each other when to stop gas flows during periods when the rigid bronchoscope or other airway devices are being inserted or withdrawn alternatively flexible bronchoscopy can be employed via a lma or endotracheal tube via self-sealing adaptors to reduce aerosol exposure for staff the lma does not provide a complete seal but may be a better alternative to an open airway in situations where avoiding intubation is preferable flexible bronchoscopy can be useful for a diagnostic assessment however it is generally a less familiar approach ventilation can be obstructed by the presence of the scope in an endotracheal tube the scope may be too big for a small child the working channel is smaller and longer limiting therapeutic instrumentation available it may be harder to manipulate and maintain coverage under the plastic drapes and the image quality may be inferior to the rigid telescope final smooth withdrawal of an airway foreign body using flexible forceps may be hampered by the size of the material and the holding strength of the forceps flexible endoscopy forceps that are small enough to fit through working channels are usually designed for taking biopsies and may break an organic foreign body into smaller pieces necessitating multiple passes for complete retrieval the use of an apnoeic ventilation technique via rapid sequence induction or at later stages of the procedure can be considered to reduce aerosol generation but should only be undertaken if both the anaesthetist and surgeon are comfortable with the method and feel that it is suitable for the patient and the condition being managed the time available for airway assessment and instrumentation by the surgeon is reduced single lung ventilation may be more challenging in the situation of an occluding foreign body in a main bronchus and if positive pressure is required the position of an unstable foreign body may alter the completion of agp will bring relief to all involved especially after the lengthy preparation and vigilance required however elevated attention to aerosol exposure needs to be maintained by the whole team during anaesthesia reversal whether it occurs with or without extubation the anaesthetic team may prefer to keep plastic draping or screening attachments in situ to distance themselves from a coughing gagging or crying child and remove it after the patient is in a more settled state a designated team member eg anaesthetic nurse is delegated to supervise plastic drape removal by several staff members together to ensure the contaminated surface is rolled onto itself and away from staff in a caudal direction before discarding accessories under plastic drapes such as the perspex box or side arm must be carefully detached as they will potentially be soiled by surface droplets patient eye tapes need to be removed slowly depending on the procedure the surgical team should distance themselves from the patient but may need to stay in the operating room with all equipment still connected to assist in the event of laryngospasm or unexpected deterioration once stabilised a surgical mask is placed on the patients face if tolerated supplemental low flow oxygen can be delivered either via nasal prongs under the surgical mask or a hudson mask on top of the surgical mask local preference will dictate whether the patient stays in the operating room for their recovery or is transferred to another location in our institution the patient is recovered in the operating theatre with the anaesthetic team and a recovery nurse who will also escort them out transport to the final destination should involve a notification to the receiving area operating assistants and cleaning services to minimise delays and allow preparation for arrival images and videos from the image capture device can be saved and backed up at this point prior to powering down in preparation for terminal cleaning when the anaesthesia team are satisfied with the patients progress the surgical staff may stand down careful and deliberate doffing of ppe or papr is essential to avoid self-contamination of healthcare workers an experienced spotter can assist the process otherwise prior training and practice is highly recommended to allow the team to help each other in the correct sequence and technique hand hygiene and avoiding touching their own faces conjunctivae and mucous membranes is essential staff should immediately shower and change scrubs especially if the ppe or papr available does not provide complete front and back skin coverage if the patient is known to be covid-19 positive self-administration of 05 povidone iodine gargle for 30 seconds andor topical nasal application may be considered by those closely involved with the procedure 27 the surgical team can then return to designated clean areas to complete the operation note sign the surgical count sheet and provide handovers the operating theatre is not re-entered once the patient has departed for 30 mins to allow aerosols to settle and ventilation exchange prior to cleaning this period of time can be variable between institutions depending on the number of air changes per hour in the operating theatre once the anaesthesia team have completed their care of the patient they may need to return to the operating theatre complex for their own doffing if that is the safest place for it to be performed under supervision and for access to showers prior to completing their own paperwork the time taken from the commencement of the full team huddle to when all involved have stood down after the completion of the procedure has been considerably lengthy in our experience all team members may be exhausted however a team debrief to communicate feedback is essential to improve the process for forthcoming procedures as subsequent agp are unlikely to be performed by exactly the same participants it may be helpful to assign a clinical lead from the otolaryngology department or several leads for subspecialty interest groups eg paediatric airway rhinology otology head and neck to provide oversight for each agp checklist used at the institution and to be the person to incorporate and distribute recommendations after each case to enhance it teamwork collaboration and communication are essential in usual surgical practice but even more so at present a unified team approach can provide reassurance in a time of overwhelming change resource rationing anxiety about risk and confusion about which hospital department flowsheet to follow surgical anaesthesia nursing and operation assisting staff should be encouraged to contribute even seemingly minor details to help improve the process of performing agp efficiently and minimising their exposure to sars-cov-2 in the context of their own facilities and resources it can be helpful to print an operative team checklist in a concise format to keep it less intimidating the overall template can be maintained for different agp with substitution of relevant anaesthesia and surgical requirements the intention is not to be prescriptive but to raise awareness of techniques to modify practice even if experienced with undertaking agp in normal situations a checklist of alternative approaches can be a reminder that things need to be done differently to reduce droplet contact and potential airborne transmission and highlights other risk management steps of the patient journey that the team are not usually collectively involved with treating all high risk agp as potentially covid-19 positive at present has been time and resource intensive but invaluable in terms of real life simulation and team training this may not be sustainable as disease prevalence fluctuates however it has allowed for preparation and system planning like all new approaches there is a learning curve before attaining proficiency and mannequin simulation can be substituted to provide ongoing skill maintenance similar to the spotters role to minimise contamination with donning and doffing stepping back to take an outsiders view with the general principles of approach in mind figure 3 should raise awareness alter behaviour and potentially reduce transmission to date every agp undertaken at our institution using this process has resulted in a refinement of our practices and will continue to do so in the future recommendations for risk reduction for healthcare workers during the covid-19 crisis will continue to develop as the pandemic unfolds and more is understood about the virus itself an operative team checklist and its execution however are no substitute for meticulous hand hygiene respiratory etiquette environmental cleaning and disinfection and physical distancing as recommended by the who for healthcare workers when within the healthcare environment and when in the general community an operative team checklist detailing the immediate pre-operative intra-operative and post-operative handling of patients who are covid-19 positive or whose status is unknown is suggested to prompt healthcare workers to modify usual practices to reduce their exposure to sars-cov-2 during agp in a time of rapidly growing information and recommendations a concise checklist customised for local needs may alert frontline staff of subtle techniques to reduce droplet contact and airborne transmission and help provide focus during these high risk situations this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors none  infection prevention measures for surgical procedures during a middle east respiratory syndrome outbreak in a tertiary care hospital in south korea jiyeon park seung yoo yeon jae-hoon ko sangmin lee m yoon chung joo jong-hwan lee kyong peck ran jeong min jin   the middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a serious acute respiratory disease caused by the mers coronavirus mers-cov and the mortality rates in infected patients are estimated at 20401 since the first case report in saudi arabia in 20122 mers outbreaks have occurred mainly in middle eastern countries and a small number of imported cases arose in europe asia united states and africa37 from may to july 2015 south korea experienced the largest mers outbreak outside the arabian peninsula89 the south korean outbreak resulted in 186 laboratory-confirmed mers cases 92 of which were associated with our tertiary care hospital1011 according to our institutional policy during the mers outbreak all elective surgeries for mers-related patients were postponed when possible however several mers-related patients inevitably required emergency operations under anesthesia two of the 92-mers confirmed cases and four mers-exposed patients underwent surgery although there is some literature regarding infection prevention during operative procedures for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus1213 guidelines or references for mers prevention during perioperative patient care were very limited therefore we developed institutional guidelines for perioperative mers infection prevention and we set up a temporary negative-pressure operating room in this globalized era along with small and large outbreaks that persist in the arabian peninsula mers outbreaks may recur in any other regions especially if a super spreader introduces a mers infection to a high-volume healthcare facility which is how the previous south korea outbreak occurred11 moreover there may be very few hospitals that are prepared to provide perioperative care for mers patients therefore herein we share our experience of providing infection prevention and control measures for surgeries for mers-related patients in our hospital the operating rooms in our hospital were generally positive-pressure environments and we had no permanent negative-pressure operating rooms because a negative-pressure operating room is the optimal environment to prevent airborne virus spreading to adjacent areas13 two of our 25 operating rooms in the main operating suite of the hospital were temporarily converted into negative-pressure operating rooms to perform surgical procedures on mers-related patients operating rooms no 16 and 17 were selected because they were connected to each other but each room had separate atmospheric air inlets and exhaust systems they also had separate air-conditioning and humidification systems of the two connected rooms one was used as the main operating room and the other was used as the anteroom where healthcare workers hcws applied and removed the personal protective equipment ppe in each room fresh air was supplied from an inlet duct and discharged outside through the exhaust duct fig 2 because a constant exhausting air volume was maintained through the outlet duct negative pressure in the operating room was achieved by decreasing the inflow air volume that entered through the inlet duct first the blades of the air volume control damper in the inlet duct were closed as much as possible fig 2 however because the damper was not intended to be air-tight the inflow volume to the operating room did not decrease sufficiently second as an additional measure to decrease the inflow volume we opened the access hole in the inlet duct which was originally used for duct inspection purposes fig 2 finally a smoke test was carried out to ensure negative pressure the room pressure was maintained at 47 pa in the main operating room and at 12 pa in the anteroom fig 3 47 pa is below the negative pressure room standard of 25 pa15 airflow in both rooms reached 1418 air exchanges per hour according to airflow velocity measurements with an anemometer ebt731 balometer tsi alnor minnesota united states in this environment removing airborne contaminants requires 18 minutes for 99 efficiency and 28 minutes for 999 efficiency16 therefore 30 minutes of room ventilation was required after aerosol forming high-risk procedures such as endotracheal intubation or extubation1217 the cleanliness level of each room was also measured using a particle counter tsi 9310 tsi united states main operating room  2604 and the anteroom  2540 which were much lower than the institutional target level of 10000 for general surgery fig 3 cleanliness level was defined as the number of particles smaller than 05 m in 03048 m3 all built-in instruments such as computers telephones and ventilators were covered with plastic paper sufficient amounts of drugs fluids and other equipment were prepared in the operating room before surgery and other unnecessary equipment was moved out additionally we used disposable equipment when possible high efficiency particulate air hepa filters were installed in the breathing circuits both on the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the ventilators and at the patients site that connected to endotracheal tube after operations with mers-exposed patients 30 minutes of room ventilation was followed by surface disinfection with diluted chlorine bleach 500 ppm1819 cleaners wore standard ppe while disinfecting surfaces for mers-confirmed patients surface disinfection was performed twice during the mers outbreak we set the following principles for perioperative management of mers-related patients all elective surgeries for mers-confirmed patients were postponed to reduce the risk of potential in-hospital transmission for mers-exposed patients surgical procedures were delayed until after the potential incubation period of 14 days20 when a mers-related patient required an urgent or emergency operation mers-cov pcr tests were performed twice with distinct specimens preoperatively to account for asymptomatic mers patients or delayed positive conversion in symptomatic mers-exposed patients for patients with ambiguous pcr results or without a pcr test operations were performed according to the management guidelines for mers-confirmed patients all the surgical procedures for mers-related patients were performed in the last order of the day as possible when an operation for a mers-related patient was scheduled the division of infectious diseases and infection control department confirmed the protection level of the hcws according to institutional guidelines table 1 in principle standard ppe was applied to hcws who cared for asymptomatic mers-exposed patients standard ppe includes surgical gloves surgical gowns eye shields and n95 respirators while managing mers-confirmed or mers-exposed patients with mers-associated symptoms including fever myalgia respiratory symptoms or diarrhea hcws implemented enhanced ppe which included coverall clothes with head cover shoe covers goggles two pairs of surgical gloves and powered air purifying respirator papr or n95 respirators although we performed preoperative mers-cov pcr screening enhanced ppe was still recommended when managing symptomatic mers-exposed patients regardless of their pcr results anesthesiologists were recommended to apply enhanced ppe including papr from the middle of the outbreak when managing all mers-related patients because they were most directly exposed to the aerosol-producing high-risk procedures such as endotracheal intubation and extubation only minimal numbers of hcws were present in the operating room institutional education regarding the precise use of ppe was provided to the all associated hcws and they were assisted by skilled nurses in the operating room during the ppe donning and doffing processes mers-related patients were transferred directly to the negative-pressure main operating room through an exclusive path and elevator by a physician wearing proper ppe the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator were covered with plastic paper mers-related patients wore a surgical mask during transfer because only anesthesiologists wore enhanced ppe when in proximity to asymptomatic mers-exposed patients 30 minutes of room ventilation was performed after anesthetic induction including endotracheal intubation the surgical team then entered the main operating room through the anteroom in the cases of symptomatic mers-exposed patients or mers-confirmed cases all hcws wore enhanced ppe and the 30-minute ventilation time was not required after completion of operation procedures patients who were moved to the general ward recovered in the main operating room without going through the post-anesthesia care unit thirty minutes of room ventilation was performed after tracheal extubation a physician in the main operating room sent the patient into the corridor while the other physician outside the main operating room wearing ppe took over and transferred the patient to the general ward directly through the exclusive pathway fig 4 patients moving to the intensive care unit icu were transferred while remaining intubated before transfers we injected patients with a sufficient amount of intravenous muscle relaxant and sedative drugs to prevent coughing or movement and we applied a portable ventilator or bag-valve mask with a hepa filter to the patient the details of the six mers-related patients undergoing surgery are presented in table 2 two patients had operations during phase 1 and four patients during phase 2 of the outbreak fig 1 the negative-pressure operating room was set up to be used from phase 2 regarding ppe levels for the hcws attending these six patients standard ppe was applied during management of patient a asymptomatic mers-exposed patient while anesthesiologists wore enhanced ppe for high-risk procedures tracheal intubation enhanced ppe was applied to hcws for patient b because the patient was symptomatic and still within the two-week incubation period even though both pcr results were negative enhanced ppe including papr to reduce risk of mers-transmission was applied for patient c who underwent surgery in the middle of the outbreak phase 2 papr provides more perfect sealing and protection of the head surface patients d and e had documented mers-cov infection and their recovery was confirmed with symptom resolution and two negative mers-cov pcr tests however enhanced ppe with papr was applied to hcws because the infection risk could not be eliminated during exposure to a large amount of body fluid especially during cesarean section patient d after spinal anesthesia she recovered in the main operating room and was transferred directly to the general ward patient f had a history of exposure to a mers patient in the emergency room and was isolated due to a fever enhanced ppe was applied to the hcws for patient f and she underwent surgery with only one set of negative pcr results because of her emergency condition all operative procedures for the mers-related patients were performed without specific adverse events and there was no reported perioperative mers transmission the temporary negative-pressure operating room was maintained until june 25 2015 and was converted back to two ordinary positive-pressure operating rooms after a declaration of the end of the mers outbreak in our hospital mers as well as sars is associated with coronaviruses both of which have high affinity for the lower repiratory tract and easily produce severe pneumonia2125 although mers has lower human-to-human transmission potential and has resulted in fewer large outbreaks than sars there may be occasional amplification of clusters in healthcare settings2123 moreover mers case fatalities are reported to be much higher than sars 3545 for mers and 1015 for sars1217232426 unlike sars ongoing small and large mers outbreaks in the arabian peninsula foster potential future mers outbreaks in non-endemic countries however there is likely to be a very limited number of hospitals that are prepared with negative-pressure operating rooms except for a few hospitals in hong kong that experienced the 2003 sars outbreak13 almost all hospitals generally have positive-pressure operating rooms and they may experience an outbreak without facilities that are prepared for perioperative management of mers patients as our hospital did in 2015 one of the highlights of our experience during the outbreak was the temporary set-up of a negative-pressure operation room with an adequate pressure gradient 25 pa by modifying two connected operating rooms according to us centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidelines15 continuous negative pressure was maintained in the main operating room 47 pa and the anteroom 12 pa this temporary setting was possible because the two adjacent rooms had separate atmospheric air inlets and exhaust systems although we could not measure the airflow pattern or dispersion of infectious particles directly27 the cleanliness levels in both operating rooms were 2500 particles well below the institutional target cleanliness for general surgery 10000 particles although the precise route of mers-virus transmission is currently not clearly understood21 mers as well as sars is known to spread by direct contact with infectious material such as large respiratory droplets and also by airborne routes2829 touching contaminated objects may also be a source of transmission this is different from tuberculosis which is transmitted by airborne routes1929 therefore when performing procedures that generate aerosols such as endotracheal intubation in patients with mers or sars hcws must wear enhanced ppe including gloves a gown either a face-shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face or goggles and respiratory protection at least as protective as an n95 filtering face piece respirator192830 when removing ppe care should also be taken not to contact contaminated materials considering potential aerosol generation in operating rooms and the transmission risk of mers-cov while changing ppe the temporary modification of an operating room to a negative-pressure room with an anteroom should provide suitable protection for hcws participating in operations on mers-related patients5 a second highlight of our experience is the highly conservative application of ppe to hcws at the time of the outbreak there were no specific guidelines for perioperative management31 therefore we used a conservative approach based on our experience and previous reports first although the previous guidelines recommended that asymptomatic mers-exposed patients be managed as general patients undergoing surgery we applied standard ppe to hcws and we performed mers-cov pcr screening twice although mers progressed gradually after symptom onset32 we could not exclude the possibility that asymptomatic mers-exposed patients had the potential to develop symptomatic disease perioperatively moreover we observed development of mers after the known incubation period of 14 days in an immunocompromised host1033 thus the possibility of exceptional cases could be considered furthermore a certain proportion of asymptomatic mers-exposed patients could actually be asymptomatic mers-infected patients approximately 21 of laboratory confirmed mers patients have been classified as asymptomatic or having nonspecific mild symptoms at the time of testing34 the potential for transmission from asymptomatic mers-cov pcr-positive person is currently unknown but there are reports about prolonged viral rna detection in the upper respiratory tract in asymptomatic pcr-positive person9 considering these points it would be reasonable to prepare more conservatively than the existing guidelines call for another point on which our preparations differed from the guidelines was the application of enhanced ppe which emphasizes full protection of the body surface with a hooded coverall during the outbreak in our hospital mers transmission events occurred among hcws who were equipped with standard ppe including n95 masks transmission may have occurred after possible contamination of uncovered head or face surfaces35 therefore if a patient with a mers contact history had mers-associated symptoms applying enhanced ppe either a n95 respirator or papr during surgery would be appropriate for hcws because numerous droplets and aerosols may be produced during airway interventions because the n95 may fit inadequately if worn for a long time or after movement during surgery wearing papr will be more beneficial however unlike hcws dealing with ebola virus impermeable and fluid-resistant gowns are not required because body fluids are not infectious as with ebola virus diseases9283536 our experience was limited in that as a mers outbreak outside the endemic country we did not have an opportunity to perform surgical procedures in actively virus-shedding mers-infected patients additionally our infection-prevention protocols would be too conservative to apply in mers-endemic situations however considering the potential risk of infected hcws preventing mers transmission is extremely important in the management of a mers outbreak importantly our experience can be generalized to other non-endemic countries for managing potential outbreaks of emerging respiratory diseases in the era of globalization a mers outbreak can occur in any country outside the middle east a very limited number of hospitals are equipped with negative-pressure operating rooms and therefore most hospitals are likely to experience a mers or other outbreak in an unprepared circumstance we hope that this report will help other hospitals in preparing for future mers outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions the study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and experimental protocols were revised and approved by irb at samsung medical center irb no smc 2016-08-156-002 irb at samsung medical center has approved the waiver of patient consent form because of the retrospective nature of this study patient confidentiality is maintained at all time in accordance with samsung medical center policies  management strategies for the burn ward during covid-19

includes the medical chief in hospital the nursing group leader the clinical and laboratory infection control specialist and the microbiology team each clinical diagnosis nursing and recovery procedures will be conducted under the guidance of chinese national health commission regarding covid-19 prevention and management along with class a nosocomial infection requirements in order to train medical staff in an effective way our ward establishes related knowledge and basic methods in prevention and control of covid-19 each one should complete online theory learning styles and update basis knowledge learning on a regular basis firstly the clinical skills such as hand hygiene wearing masks goggles protective face screen should be learned on line through video and practice repeatedly after that each staff should pass the theory knowledge test on line and the practical operation test to ensure all medical staff to deal with any situation proficiently 
 the management of access control shall be strengthened and the visitors shall be suspended in special cases visitors shall be monitored for temperature and screened for epidemiological history before entrance each staff needs to comply with strict hand hygiene to improve disinfection prevention the ward is sterilized and ventilated with the circulating air sterilizer 3 times a day more than 30 minutes for each time the wards avoid central air conditioning due to safety reasons use infrared burn treatment equipment for patients to keep warm and maintain good natural ventilation 1000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant or 75 alcohol are chosen for table disinfection wipe or soak disinfection method is confirmed the ground will use 1000 mgl chlorine-containing disinfectant to wipe or spray disinfection from the outside to indoor not less than 30 minutes for each time disinfection of public air should be done without people on sight acid peroxide and hydrogen peroxide will be used for ultra-low capacity spray disinfection and the disinfection frequency was also 3 times a day 5 6 7 each ward should to the new patients and their caregivers should be given basic education of epidemic prevention knowledge in each ward it is required that no any visitors from outside can enter into the ward and the caregivers are not allowed to leave the ward the food delivery system will deliver daily groceries and food to each individual only one caregiver in the ward is allowed to accompany each adult patient two for pediatric patient temperature and registration will be conducted to each caregiver basically caregivers are not allowed to go out of their rooms expect certain special conditions in case that caregivers should go out from their rooms the security and the nurses should be informed firstly and they should perform hand hygiene face hygiene when they come back to their room no visitors are allowed during the outbreak our ward delivers fully consistent remote video for visitors to reduce the emotional impact and minimize the risk of potential infection within family members 8 9 10 11 12 13 staff should monitor body temperature respiratory rhythm frequency and depth and blood oxygen saturation of the patients and their caregivers at the same time the consciousness and systemic symptoms such as systemic muscle pain fatigue loss of appetite etc should be observed and recorded importantly the respiratory symptoms including cough sputum cough chest tightness dyspnea and cyanosis should be payed much attention to for patients with assisted ventilation parameters such as inspiratory pressure expiratory pressureoxygen concentration and others should be adjusted according to the doctors advice according to the national new diagnosis criteria treatment of infection scheme version 5 of covid-19 the patient should be screened by clinical symptoms and epidemiological history for the suspected or confirmed patients the operations should be followed the consultation of infectious disease experts in time to prevent further possible transmission for the suspected patients it is recommend to accept lung ct scan and routine blood tests if it is necessary the confirmed patients should be transferred to the infection department as soon as possible the outpatients are not encouraged to back the ward for only rehabilitation treatment they can get consultation and instruction by using website wechat app even phone on line in addition each patient check-in online everyday and they can share his status and improvement of rehabilitation which reinforces the encouragement among patients if the recovered patients need to readmit to the ward due to disease condition they can be allowed to see their doctor and evaluated through outpatient appointment system with the related preventive measures mild burn victims always need dressing change regularly the patients are recommended to do that in nearby clinics avoiding the usage of public transportation the wound management team should follow up the patients wound repair on a regular basis for patients who really need to come to the hospital the medical staff and the patients should follow the instruction and regulation avoiding virus transmission the staffs are recommended not to take public transportation as far as possible everyone should monitor and report his health status day including fever cough shortness of breath and other abnormal conditions if he has any symptoms or signs related with covid-19 he should report to the epidemic prevention and control team as soon as possible meanwhile personal contact history was reported based on epidemiological history the staff with possible infection should be in home quarantine strictly and consult or see the fever clinic as required the staff in each ward should be assayed and record body temperatures twice a day with noncontact detector meanwhile the detail of the staffs transportation between his home and the ward should be recorded according to the situation of patients in ward flexible scheduling for the staffs should be implemented which requires who should stay at home and who should work in the ward to reduce maximally the risk of transmission all the personnel who went out of the city after january 23 will be quarantined at home for 14 days those who contacted with persons from hu bei province since january 1 will be required home quarantine meanwhile each ward should strengthen the arrangements for emergency personnel interns and trainees in accordance with the national protection plan 3 the layered protection method is adopted for medical personnel the medical staff in the ordinary outpatient emergency and ward of burns shall adopt primary protection secondary and tertiary protection should be applied for the staffs who contact with the suspected or confirmed cases researches demonstrated that endotracheal intubation tracheotomy mechanical ventilation and fiberoptic bronchoscopy increase the transmission risk of sars-cov and mers-cov 14 according to the medical institutions in suspected novel coronavirus infection prevention and control of provisional guidelines announced by who 15 medical staffs who perform tracheal intubation tracheostomy intubation airway lavage and bronchoscopy microscopic lavage operation need to act with double preventive standards which including hand hygiene personal protective equipment use respiratory health precautionary needle stab wounds the cleanness of medical supplies and medical waste treatment etc the suspected or confirmed cases of covid-19 should apply droplet isolation and contact isolation moreover air isolation is also necessary for medical operations producing aerosols in the management of specimen collection according to the doctors advice and under the implementation of standard preventive measures correct collection of patients respiratory secretions blood specimens wound specimens etc each time the staff should work with the microbiology group for specimens collection transferring and others we recommend stopping the selective surgery of burns before covid-19 is excluded completely only the necessary operation of the suspected or confirmed patients which may threat life or influence the prognosis significantly could be perform with the secondary and tertiary protection or staff could not be allowed to enter the ward and can stay in the lobby to handover the patients before or after the operation for the patients who need urgent surgery the necessary check including blood routine test lung ct scan and others should be done firstly for the suspected or confirmed cases ward should comply with strict emergency proposal to deal with the patient and be fully prepared in the perioperative period to prevent the transmission of the disease infection specialists should be consulted for the treatment plan for the suspected or confirmed patients if necessary they should be transferred to the infection department for further treatment 16 17 18 19 in case of the shortage of protection and disinfection supplies it is necessary for each ward to establish a registration and management system for obtaining and using various protection and disinfection materials the usage should be calculated in store room every day the staffs require to use the supply effectively the burn inpatients should be supply with high-calorie high-protein high -vitamin digestible diet and be encouraged to drink adequate amounts of water each day meanwhile the patients are not allowed to order delivery food from outside unless the restaurant is authorized patients isolated are prone to be fear anxiety anger lonely with sleep disorders and other problems especial the critical patients who can not be visited by family members with face to face in a certain period therefore it is necessary to correctly assess the psychological state and needs of patients according to the patients emotional reactions and behavioral changes intervention measures such as psychological adjustment were given to the patients medical staff also needs to supply the patients more emotional support and accurate information to reduce mental problems on the other hand supporting strategies should be set up for the quarantined medical staff the isolated staff at home should be given greeting and concerning to help them mental health summarily it is important to have a regulation to manage the burn ward to prevent and control the transmission of covid-19 the strategies should include administrational management environmental management personnel management and management of surgery protective supplies mental health and others none  animal models of mechanisms of sars-cov-2

carrington c lorena robaina cabrera mlia magnen mark looney r elaine gray clive page p  221 words the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 infections has led to substantial unmet need for treatments many of which will require testing in appropriate animal models of this disease vaccine trials are already underway but there remains an urgent need to find other therapeutic approaches to either target sars-cov-2 or the complications arising from viral infection particularly the dysregulated immune response and systemic complications which have been associated with progression to severe covid-19 at the time of writing in vivo studies of sars-cov-2 infection have been described using macaques cats ferrets hamsters and transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace2 these infection models have already been useful for studies of transmission and immunity but to date only partially model the mechanisms implicated in human severe covid-19 there is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe covid-19 these models need to recapitulate key mechanisms of covid-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and reproduce the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease here we review the current models of sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into covid-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments  animal models are necessary in the development of all drugs and therapeutics to demonstrate efficacy and safety as well as providing essential information on route of administration pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to identify key mechanisms driving pathology in vivo the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  the disease manifestation of sars-cov-2 infection has led to the rapid development of animal models of sars-cov-2 infection which have already provided insights into the natural history of the disease and together with data from previous studies have permitted identification of potential antiviral approaches identified in studies of other viral infections alexander et al 2020  notably at the time of writing late april 2020 studies using animal models have already provided some evidence that immunity might confer protection from reinfection bao et al 2020a  and that convalescent plasma might decrease viral burden  animal studies have also confirmed the susceptibility of domestic cats to infection  and have provided evidence of the importance of angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace2 enabling infection bao et al 2020b  these animal models are well suited for proof of concept studies into efficacy of potential vaccines or antivirals however each model system has its drawbacks and at the time of writing april 2020  no reported animal model of sars-cov-2 infection fully recapitulates every key feature of severe covid-19 table 1  figure   1  this deficit in preclinical modelling is important as until vaccines are widely available there is a particularly urgent need to identify potential treatments for this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved patients who already have established sars-cov-2 infection and who are at risk of progressing to severe covid-19 requiring hospitalisation and the need for respiratory support in a high dependency or intensive care unit the ideal evidence from preclinical efficacy studies of potential therapeutic interventions to prevent or promote resolution of severe covid-19 in patients who are already symptomatic will be meaningful improvements in clinically relevant endpoints in models which deterministically progress to severe disease following infection with sars-cov-2 interventions should also be applied at realistic time points in these models  figure   2  this ideal standard of evidence will of course have to be balanced with practical and ethical considerations sars-cov-2 has zoonotic origins andersen et al 2020  but several major factors complicate the study of this virus in model organisms these include lack of infectivity of clinical isolates of sars-cov-2 in some model species including mice and dogs bao et al 2020b shi et al 2020  and an absence of the persistent infection immunopathology severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic complications which characterise covid-19 clinically furthermore sars-cov-2 predominately causes severe covid-19 in older people with comorbidities  presenting a construct validity problem with attempted use of young and immunologically nave laboratory animals in covid-19 testing scientists developing animal models therefore face a challenging set of trade-offs as well as a sense of urgency despite the pressing needs for treatments design and implementation of preclinical studies for covid-19 should maintain quality to produce meaningful results avoid needless duplicity and avoid undue reduction in consideration of animal welfare issues london and kimmelman 2020  here we review the mechanisms involved in covid-19 development and reported approaches to model sars-cov-2 infection responses we then identify key areas in which studies using animal models might improve recapitulation of important characteristics of human covid-19 to better help in the identification and assessment of new therapeutic interventions new modelling approaches are needed to improve our understanding of sars-cov-2 and covid-19 because the virus has newly transitioned to infecting humans and because aspects of the disease are different to previously described syndromes developing as a result of viral infections including sars fortunately clinical and preclinical data related to the covid-19 pandemic have been disseminated at a never-before-seen rate sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna coronavirus thought to be the descendant from a bat coronavirus which spilled over to infecting humans after infecting an intermediate host potentially a pangolin andersen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b  the genome of sars-cov-2 is 79 homologous with that of sars-cov which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreaks in 2003 lu et al 2020  studies indicate that as with sars-cov the spike glycoprotein expressed by sars-cov-2 undergoes activating cleavage by host proteases on epithelial surfaces which permits high affinity interaction of spike

252 mammals based on conservation of 25 amino acids that are essential for interaction between ace2 and sars-cov-2 a scoring system that predicts the likelihood of infectivity was devised although experimental data would be required to substantiate the merit of this system this study does provide a rationale for choice of animal species to study the infectivity pathogenesis and treatment of covid 19 and suggested that species such as old world monkeys would be highly susceptible to infectivity while most rodents are less likely to be infected sars-cov-2 and sars-cov exhibit similar stability outside of the body van doremalen et al 2020  but differ in their incubation and transmission kinetics compared with sars-cov sars-cov-2 appears to replicate more rapidly in the upper respiratory tract zou et al 2020  where it achieves transmission in asymptomatic carriers  factors which likely contributed to the rapid global spread of covid-19 the reported clinical symptoms of covid-19 range from mild to critical  mild disease varies from no symptoms to mild pneumonia severe disease is characterised by moderate to severe pneumonia critical covid-19 involves diagnosis of ards septic shock andor multi-organ failure wu and mcgoogan 2020  risk factors including advanced age male sex obesity diabetes and immunodeficiency predispose towards development of severe or critical covid-19 sars-cov-2 appears to be less likely to cause severe disease than sars-cov  a factor which likely also enabled greater spread of sars-cov-2 and may also present an additional challenge for development of animal models pathology of covid-19 is centered around immunopathology with persistent lung infection leading to ards and clinical progression follows a time course characteristic of a dysregulated viral immune response gattinoni et al 2020 tian et al 2020 xu et al 2020b figure 1  it is clear however that critical cases of covid-19 involve damage to other systems in the body which may both be a result of ards and may also be causative of greater lung injury notably covid-19 has been associated with a coagulopathy driven by inflammation and characterised by elevated fibrinogen and d-dimer levels indicating increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis zhang et al 2020a  patients suffer from increased thrombotic risk against which standard prophylactic anticoagulants appear only partially effective llitjos et al 2020  and there is evidence that platelets autoantibodies and neutrophil extracellular traps may be involved in the pathogenesis barnes et al 2020 bikdeli et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c zuo et al 2020  the ards presentation within covid-19 is heterogenous and may involve both gas exchange and perfusion abnormalities pulmonary dead space to extents that differ between patients gattinoni et al 2020  additionally hyperactivation of inflammatory responses can result in a cytokine storm which may kill via exacerbation of multi-organ failure and lung inflammation or myositis blanco-melo et al 2020 sarzi-puttini et al 2020  recapitulation of these key processes driving severe pathology and mortality in covid-19 will validate animal models for severe covid-19 research non-human primates are close in phylogeny to humans which makes them particularly important for use in vaccine development at the time of writing nonhuman primate models of sars-cov-2 infection have been reported using rhesus macaques bao et al 2020a munster et al 2020 yu et al 2020  and cynomolgus macaques rockx et al 2020  for studies of sars-cov african green monkeys common marmosets squirrel monkeys and moustached tamarins have also been used gong and bao 2018  although non-human primate models can resemble human systems more closely than models which use more phylogenetically distant animals it is important to note that these studies frequently use limited numbers of animals in their experiments as low as 1 or 2 animals per group and so their results should be interpreted with due caution curtis et al 2018  investigators using these intelligent animals do however have limited numbers of non-human primates available for terminal proof of concept pathology studies especially as many of these animals will soon be needed for vaccine tests and so experimental designers are forced to make trade-offs between group sizes in early pathology studies versus those in later preclinical trials of therapeutics the most convincing demonstration of an animal model of covid-19 has been reported by munster et al 2020  rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally intratracheally by mouth and onto both eyes pulmonary infiltrates were observed radiologically and oedema was measured gravimetrically although superficial inspection found lesions to be focal and sporadic alveolar flooding with the presence of hyaline membranes which are rarely seen in other animal models of ards matute-bello et al 2011  were observed in lung histology this was accompanied by an irregular breathing pattern and increased respiratory rate in some animals suggestive of hypoxemia although this readout may also be a marker of pain or distress together these results suggest some degree of ards development however gas exchange impairment was not measured and serum cytokine analysis detected no consistent evidence of systemic inflammation as age is a major risk factor for severe covid-19 the response of aged rhesus macaques 15 years old to intratracheal inoculation with sars-cov-2 has also been compared with that of younger controls 3-5 years old  this report suggests that there are age-related increases in viral load 7 days after inoculation radiology and histology were indicative of mild interstitial infiltrates in younger animals with signs of more severe oedema including alveolar flooding in aged macaques although preliminary and largely qualitative this study suggests that aged macaque models may be useful for modelling more severe disease rhesus macaques have also been used to test whether seroconversion provides protective immunity against sars-cov-2 in one reported study two animals were inoculated intratracheally with sars-cov-2 and then challenged again 28 days later bao et al 2020a  lack of viral shedding after re-challenge in both macaques suggested development of protective immunity this study should not be overinterpreted however as other studies suggests low or even undetectable titres of neutralizing antibodies in previously infected patients  and the korean centre for disease control has reported reinfection of patients with previous covid-19 limited signs of lung inflammation and pneumonia were also demonstrated in this macaque study rockx et al rockx et al 2020  ferrets are useful in both studies of viral transmission and the pharmacology of the most frequently reported symptom of sars-cov-2 infection as unlike mice and rats they exhibit a cough reflex there are also ferret models used to study cystic fibrosis sun et al 2010  ferret studies also have potential veterinary and zoonotic relevance as an outbreak of sars-cov-2 infections with respiratory symptoms has this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved been reported in minks related to ferrets within the mustilidae family in two farms in the netherlands dutch parliament report 2020 following inoculation with sars-cov-2 ferrets have been shown to develop symptoms similar to those described in human covid-19 namely elevated body temperature suggestive of pyresis reduced activity and appetite and coughing between 2 and 12 days post infection kim et al 2020 shi et al 2020  histologically sars-cov-2 infected ferret lungs have exhibited severe pulmonary lymphoplasmacytic perivasculitis and vasculitis at 13 days post infection  transmission of sars-cov-2 was studied by placing nave ferrets in direct or indirect contact with inoculated ferrets kim et al 2020  it was observed that all nave ferrets placed in direct contact with infected ferrets displayed symptoms of infections elevations in body temperature and reduced activity 2-6 days post infection however ferrets placed in indirect contact with inoculated animals through separation with a partition that allowed air to move between enclosures did not show any symptoms although some tested positive for viral rna indicative of airborne transmission lung histology of inoculated ferrets in this study only showed mild signs of inflammation at 4 days post infection measurements of upper respiratory tract gene transcripts from nasal washes blanco-melo et al 2020  these studies showed a lower magnitude of upper airway immune responses relative to influenza a infection and the induction of a unique sars-cov-2 gene signature ontologically enriched for cell death and leukocyte activation-associated transcripts tracheal cell analysis also showed that sars-cov-2-unique transcripts were also associated with hematopoietic progenitors suggestive of extramedullary hematopoiesis at the infection site however importantly this study did not report any lower respiratory or systemic pathological findings and the lack of demonstrated pulmonary replication and edema in ferret sars-cov-2 infection models suggests a major limitation of ferrets in the study of lung pathology although cats are not widely used to study respiratory diseases the close association of humans and domestic cats means that investigation into sars-cov-2 infection and transmission in cats is important although the relationship of domestic cats with humans in turn complicates their use as laboratory animals it is notable here that domestic cats as well as zoo-housed tigers which are also in the felidae family have reportedly tested positive in the usa suggesting veterinary and zoonotic importance of feline sars-cov-2 studies center for disease control report 2020 to study transmission of sars-cov-2 two pairs one inoculated and one nave in each pair of sub adult aged 6-9 months and 3 pairs of juvenile cats aged 10-14 weeks were housed together with fecal samples analysed for the presence of viral rna to confirm successful infection in both the sub-adult and juvenile cats only one out of the three nave cats had viral rna detected in the fecal samples suggestive of some transmission albeit more limited than in ferrets it is notable here that the researchers were unable to perform nasal washes on the sub-adult cats due to the aggression of the cats also notable was the reported death of one of the inoculated juvenile cats at 3 days post infection during this study suggestive of the provocation of severe disease in a young animal lung histology on autopsy showed pronounced alveolar flooding suggesting pulmonary oedema development further study of whether severe disease can be reproduced in cats may be useful for severe covid-19 efficacy testing or for veterinary medicine development hamsters have been used for a range of medical research studies and importantly show a relatively high degree of homology with humans within the region of ace2 implicated in interaction with the ace2-binding domain of sars-cov-2 spike  chan et al 2020 inoculated golden syrian hamsters intranasally with sars-cov-2 viral replication occurred in the lungs of infected hamsters and lungs also developed marked lesions of pulmonary edema inflammation and cell death as assessed histologically inoculated hamsters lost weight showed an increased respiratory rate and could infect co-housed hamsters suggesting utility as a model for studying transmission the infected co-housed hamsters showed similar signs of lung pathology but did not lose weight suggesting that inoculated hamsters had greater severity due to a higher amount of virus delivered to lungs inflammation was also measured in this study using quantitative pcr on lung samples demonstrating an early interferon response and an elevation of il-6 together these data suggest that hamsters might be highly useful in modelling mechanisms of covid-19 however inflammation and lung pathology resolved by 14 days post infection suggesting that the hamster responses were reflective of a resolving inflammation and successful host defence as opposed to the dysregulated responses that are associated with severe covid-19 mice are widely used in studies of immunology and lung injury and have a highly characterized immune system rapid breeding cycle and can be used with a range of readily available research tools importantly the size and rapid breeding and growth of mice is useful for accelerating the completion of studies with group numbers high enough for statistical testing of efficacy of potential interventions however the spike proteins of sars-cov-2 and of its relative sars-cov are thought to have insufficient affinity for the murine ace2 entry receptor for infection of mice wan et al 2020  clinical isolates of sars-cov have therefore been adapted by serial passage in the respiratory tract of mice to produce related viruses ma15 and v2163 that can cause lung injury and mortality in wild-type mice roberts et al 2007 day et al 2009  with pathological exacerbation reported in aged or immunodeficient mice graham 2012 at the time of writing there are no reports of mouse-adapted sars-cov-2 and it is not known whether naturally occurring mutations in the sars-cov-2 spike ace2binding domain found in clinical isolates have altered pathogenicity in mice ou et al 2020  mouse adaptation of sars-cov-2 would be useful for the acceleration of mouse testing but may prove difficult as sars-cov-2 spike appears to have evolved high affinity for human ace2 at the expense of lower affinity for ace2 in other organisms wan et al 2020  initial studies published as preprints show that sars-cov-2 can also infect k18-hace2 mice in a transgene-dependent manner bao et al 2020b  in these mice inoculation with sars-cov-2 at 10 5 tcid50 caused weight loss antibody responses and both superficial and histological evidence of lung inflammation in a k18-hace2 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved transgene-dependent manner although lung injury was limited and not quantified bao 2020  in contrast to previous sars-cov experiments however no mortality was reported with sars-cov-2 infection in k18-hace2 mice perhaps related to the lower virulence of sars-cov-2 observed in humans although only one dose of virus was studied further adaptations of the experimental approach to infecting transgenic mice may be required to study lethal lung injury resulting from sars-cov-2 infection another issue for future studies is whether the tissue distribution and surface expression levels of hace2 in k18-hace2 mice faithful recapitulate those in humans as murine ace2 expression appears to be highly localised to bronchial epithelium in mice sodhi et al 2019 sun et al 2020  with ace2 perhaps more generally distributed in human lungs hamming et al 2004  and with transgenic hace2 expression mouse lungs bao et al 2020b  there are also species differences in distribution of ace2 expression outside the lungs which may have implications for systemic responses to sars-cov-2 infection additionally ace2 downregulation may play a role in disease progression kuba et al 2005  and k18-hace2 have both human and non-spike reactive murine ace2 and so may be resistant to ace2 downregulation related complications the targeted insertion of human ace2 into the endogenous mouse locus may therefore be useful in better modelling severe covid-19 sars-cov-2 likely originated from a coronavirus infecting bats andersen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b  although bats are not commonly used as model organisms they are of particular research interest because a they appear to be the originating species of many particularly deadly zoonotic viruses and b their immune systems have evolved to tolerate persistent infections with viruses with higher virulence in other species which possibly accelerates viral evolution brook et al 2020 rabi et al 2020  it is also notable that sars-cov-2 isolates have shown infectivity in rabbit and pig cells in vitro chu et al 2020  although in vitro tropism does not always mean infection can occur in vivo these model organisms may be useful for studies related to covid-19 as rabbits are well suited for longitudinal lung function studies and the organ systems of pigs more closely resemble the scale of those in humans which is useful for studies involving haemodynamic measurements the route or method used for viral inoculation can affect the severity of viral disease models and a range of inoculation routes have been used in reported animal studies table 1  intranasal delivery has been widely used as this delivery method is simple some inoculum can be aspirated into airways and because the intranasal route is potentially reflective of the real-world route of entry for viral droplets however this method can lead to limited and focal delivery of inoculum to lungs su et al 2004  and viral diseases affecting the lower respiratory tract such as covid-19 may result from inhalation of aerosols which can enter deeper into the lungs or from widespread deposition of virus in lungs due to high upper respiratory tract viral load and mucociliary escalator disruption aerosolised delivery of viral inoculum may therefore be useful in the induction of widespread lung injury which might be sufficient to provoke severe disease as well as in the standardisation of the dose of inoculum that reaches the lower airways and respiratory lungs evidence that aerosolized delivery can provoke injury resembling severe ards with elevated cytokine release has been produced in cynomolgus macaque models of h5n1 influenza wonderlich et al 2017  there have also been recent developments in the quantitative delivery of aerosols and powders to lungs of laboratory animals lexmond et al 2018  aerosolized or intratracheal administration approaches for controlled delivery of inoculum may be worthy of consideration in animal models for more severe covid-19 histological analysis superficial visual inspection and radiological imaging have been the predominate approaches used to assess the development of lung inflammation and injury following experimental sars-cov-2 infection however these pathological observations have so far often been reported in only some animals under study and only some regions of the lungs of those animals table   1  this is likely due to probabilistic provocation of injury and primary focus of where pulmonary oedema was measured consistently in infected animals using the index of lung weight as a percentage of body weight munster et al 2020  this simple method may prove to be a useful terminal approach for lung injury this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved assessment that is feasible in in most studies within constraints of bsl3 conditions and later requirement for lung homogenate for viral load readouts personnel time the personal protective equipment requirements in biosafety level bsl 3 laboratories and both the size of animals and consideration of their welfare can limit measurements that are feasible in sars-cov-2 infection studies however serial measurements of blood oxygen saturation or arterial blood gases would be highly valuable in definition of the time course of impairment of gas exchange if this occurs in animal models it is notable here that in covid-19 patients decreased arterial oxygen saturation has been reported prior to the dyspnoea and dramatically decreased saturation which leads to hospitalization and pao2fio2 can fluctuate during the course of clinical covid-19 progression and so as in the clinical setting serial close monitoring of oxygen saturation is ideal cascella et al 2020  these points are reminders that some degree of hypoxemia and pneumonia is indicative of some disease but not conclusive evidence of progression to severe covid-19-like ards where possible serial noninvasive imaging approaches as reported in some macaque studies table 1  are also useful for tracking the time course of pulmonary oedema development it is notable that some patients with covid-19 ards have more limited oedema with severe hypoxemia gattinoni et al 2020  and so additional measurements of lung perfusion pulmonary dead space fraction or ventilation perfusion scans in animals may also be useful for better understanding of this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved covid-19 as disease sub-phenotypes may be also be present within animal models carla et al 2020  planning of terminal measurements should involve consideration of how the maximum number of high-value measurements can be made if inoculations can affect the lungs widely and relatively evenly this can involve the use of different lobes for different potentially confounding measurements for example bronchoalveolar lavage is useful for simultaneously measurements of viruses inflammatory cells inflammatory mediators and protein deposits in the bronchoalveolar spaces but causes artifacts in histological analysis and prevents later measurement of pulmonary oedema likewise formalin inflation is useful for histological analysis which can be performed outside of bsl3 conditions but prevents the most direct and quantitative methods of measurement of viral load in lungs and pulmonary oedema lobes of lungs can therefore be sequentially tied off and sampled to permit functional and histological measurements related to ards as well as viral load in lungs experimental designs will of course require appropriate trade-offs between study complexity and welfare and safety of animals and laboratory workers the serious and potentially lethal nature of covid-19 means that bsl3 laboratories are required for experiments using sars-cov-2 however insights into mechanisms driving covid-19 may still be derived from non-infectious models one example directly related to sars-cov-2 is the effects of absence of ace2 function on enhancement of the pulmonary edema response which were established using a mouse acid inhalation model which to provoke rapid and severe pulmonary edema kuba et al 2005  this finding has led to ongoing trials to assess whether administration of recombinant ace2 may address infection-related deficiencies in lung barrier protective ace2-derived angiotensin ii generation in addition to potential action as a decoy preventing viral entry into cells some urgently needed studies of putative therapeutic agents for covid-19 particularly those targeting host responses may therefore be possible or supportive using other lung injury models with higher throughput influenza viruses have been adapted to infect mouse cells and can be used for viral induced lethal lung injury experiments in mice in more widely available bsl2 laboratories where the mechanisms under study might feasibly be shared in sars-cov-2 responses however immune responses to coronaviruses and influenza are not the same as for example knockout of complement component 3 in mice is detrimental in influenza h1n1 and h5n1 infection models obrien et al 2011  but beneficial in sars-cov infection models gralinski et al 2018  viral pseudotypes expressing sars-cov-2 spike may also be useful for in vivo non-bsl3 studies of antiviral efficacy hoffmann et al 2020  although these will not model the evasion mechanisms and immunopathology unique to sars-cov-2 or related coronaviruses there are many other models used for the study of ards in mice and other model organisms closer phylogenetically and anatomically to humans matute-bello et al 2008 aeffner et al 2015  of these lung injury caused by instillations of bacteria or endotoxins ventilation and antibodies may be particularly relevant to covid-19 complicated by secondary infections barotrauma and antibody reactions and associated dysregulated responses additionally there may be central mechanisms of ards progression and resolution meaning that non-viral models may have utility for rapid proof-of-concept studies outside of bsl3 conditions although it is likely that in many cases efficacy studies with sars-cov-2 infection will also be needed known risk factors for severe covid-19 offer opportunities to drive models towards pathological states figure 1  advanced age obesity and diabetes are additional risk factors associated with high case-fatality rates covid-19 onder et al 2020 petrilli et al 2020  these features may predispose towards severe disease through complicating medical treatment by hypoventilation as a result of low cardiorespiratory fitness and through dysregulated immunity with imbalance of inflammation and repair mechanisms as well as a propensity for underlying cardiovascular disease and changes to haemostasis that will influence progression of respiratory infection towards ards tzoran et al 2018 sattar et al 2020  use of aged animals might allow for modelling of the age risk factor it is encouraging in this light that early development of pre-clinical models of covid-19 includes the influence of age in rhesus macaques infection with sars-cov-2 reportedly led to heightened lung pathology and viral replication in older macaques 15 years old compared to younger animals 5 years old  additionally aged mice have previously demonstrated exacerbated inflammation and lung injury following sars-cov infection rockx et al 2009  animal models which require ageing over years may not permit the rapid testing of treatments which is required for the covid-19 pandemic models incorporating other risk factors such as induced obesity eg high fat diet-induced diabetes eg leptin receptor deficiency paul et al 2007  or impaired immune responses eg stat1 knockoutinhibition frieman et al 2010  might be made available more quickly additionally covid-19 may progress to severe disease status as a result of immune priming secondary infections or intravascular sequelae and so combining sars-cov-2 infection models with a first or second hit such as immune priming with lps or additional challenges such as the non-bsl3 approaches to cause lung injury described above ie inoculation with pathogenic bacteria or injections of injurious antibodies might be capable of driving host responses towards a pathological state as discussed above severe covid-19 is also associated with low blood platelet counts and thrombosis a consumptive coagulopathy and a hyperinflammatory state involving platelet activation release of nets and prolonged systemic elevations of cytokines such as il-6 and cxcl10 these pathological features associated with severe disease have not yet been demonstrated in animal models table 1  the degree of thrombocytopaenia has been reported as a potential biomarker for severe covid-19 lippi et al 2020  a large retrospective study revealed the degree of thrombocytopaenia to be dynamic after presentation to clinic with decreasing platelet numbers being predictive of mortality later on  furthermore a shift in platelet-lymphocyte ratio may indicate the occurrence of an acute inflammatory or thrombotic event and therefore have prognostic value qu et al 2020  thus thrombocytopaenia may reflect 1 alteration in thrombopoiesis due to the bone marrow or lungs and potentially spleen being inflamedreceiving inflammatory and trauma-related thrombopoietic cues 2 localized lung recruitment of platelets as a facet of their role in the immune response or alveolar coagulation 3 disseminated intravascular coagulation dic throughout the body xu et al 2020a  or 4 platelet-viral interaction although this remains hypothetical as an engagement of platelets with sars-cov-2 has not been described amgalan  othman 2020  evidence from other disease states with features of covid-19 pathology indicate potential causative roles of platelets in the worsening of the disease which might therefore provide opportunities for adaption of more severe mechanistic models of severe covid-19 reports on animal studies published to date have not included measurements of these pathological responses but their detection would be useful further evidence for successful modelling of mechanisms of severe disease results of studies in mice modelling influenza agree on the necessity for platelets in the immune response and inflammation but conflict as to whether this is beneficial guo et al 2017 campbell et al 2019  or detrimental boilard et al 2014 l et al 2015  additionally platelets have been shown to respond to influenza virus to increase complement availability and encourage the release of nets into blood and so platelets may be important integrators linking viral infection to neutrophil responses that are associated with coagulopathy and venous thrombosis koupenova et al 2019  furthermore platelets have a complex relationship with lung inflammation in that they can be both protective of the alveolar capillary-barrier or can promote excessive vascular leak weyrich and zimmerman 2013 middleton et al 2018  given the importance of platelets in coagulopathies dic and alveolar thrombi the innate immune response and hyperinflammation their influence on the patency of the alveolar-capillary unit and the association of low blood platelet counts with severe disease the manipulation of platelets might be a useful experimental tool to reciprocate these pathological events in animal models of sars-cov-2 infection our previous findings that experimental thrombocytopenia can convert a mild selfresolving bacterial lung infection to a more severe form of systemic infection with extra-pulmonary organ involvement and death amison et al 2018 suggest that the induction of severe experimental thrombocytopenia 95 depletion in animal models of sars-cov-2 may allow these infection models to demonstrate the progression from a mild to severe disease phenotype additionally pulmonary platelet retention can be induced by intravenous injections with anti-mhc class i antibodies which are also associated with thrombocytopenia and release of nets looney et al 2009 caudrillier et al 2012  use of these antibodies combined with infection models might be useful in modelling the contributions of platelets and nets to severe covid-19 associated with lung hypoperfusion release of nets and autoantibody production zhang et al 2020c  the involvement of fcriia in viral platelet responses suggests that transgenic expression of human fcriia on platelets may be useful in driving greater platelet responses in murine sars-cov-2 infection models as mice lack activating fc receptors on platelets boilard et al 2014  treatment with heparin or low molecular weight heparin has been associated with reduced mortality in clinical studies of covid-19 yin et al 2020  and nebulised delivery of heparin is associated with a reduced requirement for ventilation in patients hospitalised by other respiratory diseases such as severe copd dixon et al 2010 shute et al 2018 ashoor et al 2020  although heparin is classically used as an anticoagulant it has also been demonstrated to bind and reduce the activity of a range of cytokines implicated in the covid-19-associated cytokine storm mulloy et al 2015  and also interacts with the sars-cov-2 spike protein in a manner which causes structural alteration of the ace2-binding domain which is likely to reduce viral entry mycroft-west et al 2020  the potentially useful polypharmacy of heparin underlines the need for integrated in vivo sars-cov-2 infection models incorporating simultaneous and clinically relevant measurements of coagulation cytokines and viral load in addition to platelet number the severity of covid-19 disease progression also correlates closely with levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators such as cxcl10 interferon-inducible protein 10 and tnfalpha both associated with the pathology and progression associated with hyperinflammatory condition associated with ards tang et al 2005  bautista et al 2013 yang et al 2020  the amelioration of lps induced ards following cxcl10 neutralisation in rats and the proposition of anti-tnfalpha therapy in covid-19 patients therefore highlights the potential for combining sars-cov-2 infections with tnfalpha and cxcl10 challenge as a further method in the development of models with a more severe phenotype lang et al 2017 feldman et al 2020  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved persistence of infection and inflammation due to ineffective viral clearance is a key feature of severe covid-19 although maintenance of infection and systemic cytokine release has not yet been reported in animal models of sars-cov-2 infection a potential approach to model this feature of severe disease is the experimental disruption of important antiviral host defence pathways a key mediator of defensive signalling might be the transcription factor stat1 the genetic deletion of which can convert a mild sars-cov mouse infection model into one resulting in 100 mortality frieman et al 2010  pharmacologic inhibitors of stat1 are available miklossy et al 2013  and may be useful in the rapid development of animal models with deficiencies in protective antiviral responses without the requirement for multigenerational crosses or ageing out of laboratory animals dysregulated immune responses by myeloid leukocytes may also be important in pathogenesis of severe disease barnes et al 2020  although the impact of covid-19 on cystic fibrosis patients is still unclear colombo et al 2020  mouse models of cystic fibrosis mutations involve heightened platelet activation and a hyperinflammatory state with increased neutrophil responses so these models might be useful in driving increased severity of pathology ortiz-muoz et al 2020  efficacy studies using animal models of many disease processes have been criticised for over-use of the prophylactic application of interventions ie pretreatment when such approaches would not be realistic for clinical treatments denayer et al 2014  severe covid-19 has a characteristic time course which suggests that there are several windows where different treatment approaches might be useful figure 2  users of animal models for covid-19 research should wherever possible assess the time course of readouts in their models and consider the type of therapeutic being assessed the potential of risk to patients from any anticipated adverse effects and whether the intervention will likely need to take place in a hospital setting for example as viral replication increases likelihood of transmission and persistent infection mediates severe disease antivirals with low toxicity might be useful for all diagnosed cases and perhaps even prophylactically in high-risk populations some interventions such as nebulised heparin may be of benefit as anti-viral agents mycroft-west et al 2020 and in reducing the inflammatory response dixon et al 2010 mulloy et al 2015 and there may need to be dosed at different time points across the development of covid-19 once severe disease develops interventions which are aimed at resolving ards and systemic complications would be useful and robust preclinical testing might require models which include aspects of intensive care support such as invasive ventilation alexander et al 2020  careful model characterization will be required to identify analogous phases of pathology development in animal models for appropriate timing of interventions under study animal models have been rapidly mobilised to address the need for greater understanding of covid-19 and for testing of new therapeutic approaches for this pandemic while useful observations have already been shared it is important that animal studies are adapted to measure and report key readouts that are relevant to clinical covid-19 such as evidence of lung injury resembling ards physiological gas exchange impairment hyperinflammation platelet responses and coagulopathy study designs may need to incorporate additional risk factors or disease triggers to shift from modelling protective and self-resolving infection and inflammation to recapitulating severe disease with ards and multi-organ failure  table 3  development of models that reproduce these hallmarks of disease will permit better understanding of covid-19 pathogenesis

the hospital for suspected covid19 and further observation by day 6 of illness hospital day 2 he was requiring 6 l of oxygen by nasal cannula with increased shortness of breath and tachypnea with his respiratory rate 2528 breaths per minute he was placed on 15 l of oxygen by nonrebreather mask with improvement to oxygen saturation of 95 the intensive care team was alerted and advised to switch the patient back to 6 l of oxygen by nasal cannula nonrebreather to prevent further viral aerosolization an hour later he was urgently intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit a chest radiograph revealed diffuse patchy infiltrate bilaterally a chest computed tomography without contrast revealed extensive ground glassmosaic attenuation and consolidation opacification throughout bilateral lung fields highly concerning for changes secondary to viral pneumonia figure 2 he was initiated in an assist control mode of ventilation requiring fraction of inspired oxygen fio2 of 60 with positive endexpiratory pressure peep 14 cm h2o the infectious diseases id consultation team initiated hydroxychloroquine 400 mg enterally twiceday for 1 day followed by 200 mg enterally twiceday for 4 days additionally cefepime 2 g intravenously iv every 8 hours and azithromycin 500 mg iv every 24 hours were recommended for possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia a sputum culture was ordered as well as legionella urine antigen testing later that evening his covid19 test was confirmed as positive because of his acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and likely progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards the use of investigational remdesivir was discussed among the id team clinical pharmacist and the patients family following signed consent by the patients family for treatment the id physician contacted gilead via email to initiate the individual compassionate use process and approval was received early the following morning figures 3 and 4 on day 7 of illness hospital day 3 the patients oxygen requirements increased to an fio2 of 70 and a peep of 14 cm h2o furosemide as needed was initiated to maintain an even or slightly negative fluid balance he intermittently required fio2 to be titrated up to 95 and peep 16 cm h20 the fda was notified via phone of gileads approval for compassionate use by the id physician and the request was made for an emergency investigational new drug eind the institutions investigational review board was also notified for approval the id physician and clinical pharmacist were granted access to the medidata system to input the patients baseline testing and laboratory data later in the day the eind was received from the fda approving the use of remdesivir on day 8 of illness hospital day 4 ards treatment was initiated with prone positioning neuromuscular blockade and aggressive diuresis to achieve a fluid negative balance with maximum ventilator support achieved there was a discussion about extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo with a nearby hospital with capabilities later that afternoon however he tolerated a downward titration to fio2 of 35 with peep 16 cm h2o and methylprednisolone 100 mg ivday was added the fda eind fda form 3926 patient consent form and prescriber curriculum vitae and medical license information were emailed to gilead following the receipt of these documents the final steps in the process were awaiting the manufacturer to send a formal prescriber agreement for signature shipping instructions as well as the medication administration and handling instructions during the next 48 hours mechanical ventilator settings were stable although unable to be weaned down significantly he had been afebrile for 24 hours and sputum culture was reported complete with normal respiratory flora therefore the cefepime and azithromycin were discontinued hydroxychloroquine was also discontinued due to upward trending alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast at this time the id team was still awaiting the prescriber agreement paperwork and shipping instructions from gilead that were delayed due to drug supply issues and cessation of the compassionate use program on day 11 of illness hospital day 7 the id physician received the prescriber agreement from gilead this was returned via email and a letter of authorization was then sent from gilead to the fda to accompany the patientspecific eind additionally reference materials including the investigator brochure template protocol and pharmacy manual were received from the manufacturer throughout this period the patient continued to require aggressive mechanical ventilator support the id pharmacist was contacted by gilead with shipping instructions indicating medication delivery would occur within 24 hours at this time the medication and administration and handling instructions were built in the electronic medical record system to expedite drug compounding and delivery once the product arrived on day 13 of illness hospital day 9 remdesivir arrived and a 200 mg iv loading dose was administered to the patient this was followed by orders for a remdesivir 100 mg iv maintenance dose every 24 hours for the next 9 days during the following 48 hours the patient continued to progress he was able to tolerate aggressive mechanical ventilation weaning and his alt and ast were downtrending on day 16 of illness hospital day 12 he was extubated without incident his oxygen saturations remained stable requiring 23 l of oxygen by nasal cannula and were able to maintain his oxygenation saturation on room air by day 17 of illness hospital day 13 the patient continues to be in stable condition on room air and is progressing toward discharge remdesivir also known as gs5734 is a novel antiviral nucleotide prodrug created by gilead sciences for the treatment of the ebola virus outbreak in 2016

 although it did not demonstrate efficacy in human clinical trials for this disease it has shown efficacy against coronaviruses including sarscov1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus

13
 because of this remdesivir has garnered significant attention for its potential use as a treatment option for sarscov2 as an adenosine analog remdesivir was shown to incorporate into growing viral rna chains resulting in premature termination and a decrease in viral rna production
4
 due to a 96 structural similarity in its rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp compared with the virus causing sarscov1 remdesivir which targets the viral rdrp is postulated to be effective against sarscov2 as well
13
 previous literature showed significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function following remdesivir administration
11
 its favorable safety profile demonstrated in multiple case reports randomized trials of ebola virus disease as well as currently ongoing phase 3 randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled clinical trials in china further expand interest in this potentially lifesaving drug

 unfortunately the process to obtain remdesivir for compassionate use is both challenging and time consuming although the manufacturer cautions prescribers that the process to obtain the medication typically takes a minimum of 72 hours for our patient this process took more than double the estimated time expected this delay in obtaining medication is concerning because other antivirals such as oseltamivir for influenza or acyclovir for herpes viruses are effective only if given within a small window of time after symptom onset

15
 additionally many patients hospitalized with sarscov2 may have already been symptomatic for several days selfisolating while awaiting test results or until symptoms have worsened before presenting to the hospital further delaying time to therapy fortunately our patient made significant improvement in oxygenation and was able to be extubated less than 72 hours after starting remdesivir despite this delay in therapy thus administration of remdesivir regardless of time from symptom onset may still have clinical benefits for patients with sarscov2 another report detailing the first case of communitytransmitted sarscov2 in the united states demonstrated similar complications of delayed diagnosis and treatment with remdesivir was recently published similar to our case the authors observed clinical improvement after treatment with remdesivir initiated on day 11 of illness
16

 the rapid increase in critically ill covid19 cases reported across the country and subsequent demand for remdesivir has resulted in a supply shortage with the manufacturer halting the individual compassionate use process outside of patients who are pregnant or pediatric with severe disease manifestations at this time gilead is moving toward an expanded access program for future institutional use of remdesivir outside of clinical trials however details of that program are still forthcoming and the procedure is expected to be similarly cumbersome as the previous individual compassionate use process enrollment in ongoing clinical trials to obtain remdesivir may also be difficult for institutions especially community hospitals with less investigational research support this case highlights significant issues that must be addressed as a health care and regulatory system in the united states as the covid19 global pandemic continues to spread it is critical that access to potentially lifesaving treatments be quickly available to patients the fda and government regulatory agencies must be called on to take urgent action to work with drug manufacturers of promising investigational therapies to ensure adequate supply and rapidly evaluate safety and efficacy data changes to improve and accelerate the processes of drug manufacturing fda evaluation and approval during times of pandemic are paramount to expedite access to treatment for critically ill patients this report has limitations that must be considered our perspective comes from a single patient treated with remdesivir late in the course of disease this patient also received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for 5 days and although he did not initially show clinical improvement after the duration of these therapies this combination is also being investigated as potential therapy for sarscov2
17
 it is possible these medications may have impacted his clinical course he is also a younger patient with few comorbidities his most significant risk factor for mortality was obesity because the mortality rate in his demographic in the united states is less than 1 it is possible that he would have improved without remdesivir

18
 further study and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir are required to confirm its efficacy against covid19 including if efficacy differences exist between early and delayed administration late initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating sarscov2 unlike antivirals such as oseltamivir and acyclovir which are most effective when started as soon as possible following symptom onset this case highlights the urgent need for action by regulatory agencies to work with drug manufacturers to expedite the study and approval of investigational agents targeting sarscov2 as well as to meet manufacturing demands  decoding the global outbreak of covid-19 the nature is behind the scene piyanki das tathagata choudhuri   after so many years of the discovery of dnarna as the genetic base of organisms we are not capable to fully understand the newly emerging diseases based on the genetic study as the human population has been evolved it is exposed to new environmental conditions in terms of migration change in food habits and lifestyle pattern parallely they have interacted with wide range of new micro biome now in this hostpathogenic interaction both of them are in a track for winning a race to evolve and establish itself by creating immense selective pressure over each other here comes the role of the key player the nature or environment from the origin of life the nature ultimately selects the prevalence of the genetic makeup and decides the winner beyond the game of neucleotides the interplay between the environment and the genetic material actually creates new or evolved genetic variety and selects its existence both for pathogen and the host and decides who will dominate in the nature 2 17 this ancient story of natures selection rule has been observed for the development of novel diseases like small pox cholera tuberculosis and in recent past like aids different flus and the most related newly emerging sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle east respiratory syndrome outbreak 31 in the current global covid-19 outbreak which is the major health concern in the world it is very important to understand how this novel entity suddenly emerged and capable enough to create a global pandemic with its fetal form in this regard prevention in form of vaccination is the only way to combat the disease and genome study is the basic thing but beyond this  the effect of nature over it needs to be understood to evade the origin and evolution of the new genetic character and its virulent establishment in nature by population distribution it has been observed that 40 of the new emerging diseases is caused by virus and rna virus are too much progressive in this case thus how these rna based fetal pathogen with their upgraded genetic setup has been originated and selected by nature with its disease outcome must be analyzed well 5 31 covid-19 is a viral disease caused by human rna virus sars-cov-2 in this review we will focus on how the viral pathogen is evolved and potent enough to cause infection at pandemic level from natures point of view in case of infectious disease the hostpathogen interaction must be understood where the host environment attributes a major role in the establishment of disease in case of any pathogenic disease outcome both the host and the pathogen struggles with each other with their unique genetic setup but the gene function is not the only factor for disease establishment or the healthy body maintenance the environmental conditions during this struggle play influential role in the action of genome more specifically collective action of environment and genetic mutation affects the regulation and function of genes 5 moreover when we consider a virus it needs a living body to functionally active and thus we can say that the environment for the virus to work is its host body environment on the other hand the host body where the virus survives also needs the external environment as its survival resource during transmission now in the following discussion we will try to understand how these two kinds of environment interplay in the development of the virus causing current covid-19 outbreak to understand the root of the novel viral pathogen and role of environment for its development we need to explain it with the molecular basis of darwins theory of evolution and natural selection by the continuous process of genetic permutation and combination sars-cov-2 is associated with respiratory syndromes showing flue like symptoms if we recall the emergence of different other deadly viral flue pandemics specifically the sars and mers in past all of them are of similar kind with different version and originated by species spill over and zoonotic transfer which is occurred once in a while over a period all of these evidences indicate towards the origin of the pathogens from a common ancestral form which needs to be investigated the probable line of development for such pandemic outcomes happened by continuous evolutionary procedure within different species or host environment exposure by mutation during replication or genetic recombination between two different viral species and ultimate adaptation to a susceptible host by natural selection of the new version of the viable pathogen resulting infection 7 8 in case of these pandemics beyond the genetic mechanisms varied permissive host exposure intra or inter species spill overintermediate host seems an important determining factor for pathogenic evolution among human population 13 14 but the natural way of genetic adaptation of the current sars-cov-2 is not understood yet in this part based on its published sequence analysis we will try to figure out how the molecular genetic variation leads to viral adaptation to the human host body environment out of the corona virus society the sars-cov-2 can cause infection to humans like other human cov but we have to think about the fact that its infection severity is deadly enough compared to all the other human covid this fact can be explained by the unique disease causing genetic character of sars-cov-2 receptor recognition is the initial and important genetic determinant for a viral infection evidence shows that viral spike protein structural specificity decides the host range in human cov like sars and mers by exerting human cell receptor recognition 14 15 the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 both shows same binding affinity with the ace2 angiotension converting enzyme 2 receptor in human cells so it is important to understand the molecular genetic property of the spike protein receptor recognition site of sars-cov-2 which genetically isolates this variant from other corona virusand decides the human cell specificity and infection in more severe form the human cell receptor binding domain of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is mutated in 5-6 amino acid residues and shows high specific ace2 human cell receptor binding affinity the spike protein has two subunits s1 and s2 and at the junction there is a polybasic cleavage site present which allows furin or protease mediated cleavage and insertion of prolin like molecule which adds 0-linked glycan molecules resulting the flanking of the two cleavages 2 29 thus it is clear that the uniqueness of spike protein is crucial for the genetic isolation of sars-cov-2 and its high affinity binding to human cells but it has been observed from receptor homology study that the sars-cov-2 also has affinity to the ace2 receptor in other animals like the humans now the next question come in mind that how sars-cov-2 particularly becomes pandemic for human beings with high mortality rate compared to the other one for a specific host pathogen interaction and disease establishment except the receptor recognition by the unique spike protein domain of the virus the receptor variation of the host cell also is an important genetic character the human ace2 cell receptor is genetically identical from other animals for the recognition by the corona virus as observed for mers-dpp4 receptor binding property 8 moreover it has been observed that there are several ace2 receptor variants present in different human populations and several variant out of it may restrict or reduce the cov specific association with it from the recent genetic analysis of the sars-cov-2 ace2 human receptor variation in different population shows that the expression pattern of ace2 receptor is an important determining factor for the pathogen susceptibility for example among the asians specifically the chinese population dont have the natural resistant mutated gene against cov infection and express high level of ace2 receptors in tissue 3 so it is revealed that not only the genetic uniqueness of the spike protein of pathogen but also the receptor of host cell is equally important for the successful establishment of covid-19 outbreak now the next question is how this unique hostpathogen interactive characteristic has been developed under the influence of host environment from different recent research evidence based on phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequence of sars-c0v-2 shows indication of the evolution of a rapid diverse and sequential genome variability whichwe will analyze by molecular genetic perspective from four different angles first we will analyses the genome variability in terms of the diversity of the sars-cov-2 genome in different host species this is revealed that sars-cov-2 show overall 96 sequence similarity with the bat sars-cov like corona virus but the similarity differs in the spike protein receptor binding domain rbd 32 35 we got this kind of sequence similarity in other human corona virus where bat have been found as the common ancestral reservoir of the pathogen 10 on the other hand a similar kind of corona virus with sars-cov-2 has been identified in malayan pangolins which shows strong and almost identical similarity with sars-cov in the spike protein rbd thus these pangolins can be interpreted as the intermediate host for sars-cov-2 34 these evidences indicate toward the sequential evolution of the spike protein rbd by species spill over nature of the virus the variability of sars-cov-2 viral genome in different species confirms of its animal origin and subsequent evolution of by jumping species nature but none of the sequence similarity of sars-cov with bat or pangolins has been found based on the unique polybasic cleavage site which can be considered as next level of determining criteria for sars-cov-2 human cell receptor specificity and pathogenic severity as observed in case of mers an avian influenza virus 1 20 the insertion of unique poly basic furin cleavage site in sars-cov-2 is probably acquired during human to human transmission thus the second indication of molecular diversity and evolution will be analyzed in terms of different subtypes of the virus which has been found in different human population throughout the world most recent research work suggests three different genetically close sub types of the sars-cov-2 with small amino acid sequence variations which can also be linked with continental and ethnic specificity this research shows that the a subtype is considered as the ancient form of sars-cov-2 which shows close similarity with bat corona virus and generates the other two different subtypes the b and c the sub type b which is mainly profound in china and east asian continents is the genetic variant of the subtype a by two mutations synonymous and nonsynonymous and not found outside asia the b subtypes has been again mutated and generated a daughter subtype the c variant which dominates in europe and represented among american populations the c subtype differs from b by single nonsynonymous mutation 9 this evidence of sequential development of different sub types from a single variant among different human population in different continents indicates the continuous single lineage evolution of the virus during human to human species spill over moreover the different subtypes of sars-cov-2 can be linked with different genetic setup of the host population in the world now as previously described different sars-cov-2 infected population in the world shows genome variation and expression of ace2 receptor coding sequence which can affect the binding and susceptibility of the sars-cov-2 it can be predicted that this ace2 receptor variation created intense selective pressure to the circulating sars-cov-2 genome and as a result of this the virus adapted to establish infection with its different genetic variants in a pandemic form throughout the world 3 every disease when it becomes a pandemic it is revealed sequentially through several stages which also indicates toward the evolutionary nature of the pathogen with the host body so the third molecular genetic evolution of the covid-19 will be analysis based on the different phages of the pandemic if we categories the covid-19 outbreak into different stages it has been found that at the initial stage it is reported in some individuals in hunan market of wuhan in hubei province of china in the second phase it has started to found as clustered form in different regions of china then in the third stage the disease has been disseminated in different parts of europe america and other asian countries and resulted as a pandemic now this different phase of disease progression covid-19 outbreak till now can be linked with the evolutionary pattern of sars-cov-2 and its different subtypes as previously described the abc emerged in different population of the world the first emergence and case reports of sars-cov-2 is found in china which represents the b subtype genome setup and specific to this region only the b type is reported to be originated from the ancestral betacorona virus showing close sequence similarity the association of the virus to the live stock animal market in china supports this origin 35 now the pangolin theory as intermediate host for the development of the unique receptor binding site rbd in the sars-cov-2 can be linked with the report of sars corona virus in dead pangolins from guangdong wild life resource in china during the period of covid outbreak in china 34 this b subtype with the evolved genetic setup caused clustered infection in different parts of south asia soon after it infected a large population inside china later after a short lag period the virus is mutated and emerged as a pandemic in different parts outside asia with another variant the c subtype profound in european and american countries this step indicates another stage of variation with probable acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site under the influence of unique ace2 receptor specificity in these population thus it is clear that the viral lineage of sars-cov-2 is constantly associated with evolutionary process that leads to the generation of different subtypes of the same species which is gradually revealed through different phases of the disease and spreaded among different population of the world causing pandemic evidence form our fourth and last analysis it has been observed that mutation of the viral genome and genetic recombination is another process which confirms the molecular genetic variability of the pathogen several mutation and deletion of sars-cov-2 genome has been observed from different sars-cov-2 genome sequence references it has been observed that mutation has been occurred in the different structural and non-structural glycoproteins like 5 orflabpolyprotein envelop protein matrix protein and most important determining factor the viral spike surface glycoprotein in rbd domain on this note no such change has been observed in the envelope protein such type of mutation has been also observed in betacorona viruses not only genetic mutation or deletion events of genetic recombination has been observed  in case of origin of sars-cov-2 spike protein rbd genetic recombination events among bat pangolin and human corona virus confirms this 16 21 26 so it is clear from the above study that generation of new versions of viral diseases in humans is acquired due to the continuous molecular genetic operations inside host body by continuous species transmission this event can be supported by the evidence of acquisition of adapted character during repeated cell culture passagingof the sars-cov 23 but on this note it should be pointed that new disease may appear at any time in any places among any population which is unpredictable because evolution is a collective action of genetic operation and environmental effect in case of virus the host body is the key factor which actually gives this opportunity or favorable environment for these genetic operations to happen because the virus needs a host body as a resource to be functionally active it is the normal tendency of a microbial species to find a convincible way to transmit and adapt itself to new environment for evolution in case of virus more specifically for the rna virus the tendency is high where there is continuous circulation of the viral genome among different host species 28 during this period host environment creates intense selective pressure to the pathogen the host body environment is acting as an influential factor for the virus to take a do or die decissionwhen the virusis successfulit is naturally selected and adapted to establish its character by gettingthe control over the hosts genetic construction by exerting virulent effects when this process continuously goes on by exposure to new environments it can lead to an extent where it can cause a pandemic otherwise it is the end of line for the pathogen to evolve this is a gradual process when the virus accumulate the required genetic makeup or prepare itself and takes several attempt for the big jump during this preparatory phase the pathogen can generate mild infection or infection to a limited bunch of population or create silent carriers depending on the host body environment these carriers dont show any symptoms but the infectious pathogen with its new genetic makeup is maintained here and can be transmitted to different suitable host environment for disease establishment thus these carriers are very crucial and might be another strategy of the virus for the evolution of new genetic setup an evolved character is developed under environmental pressure 25 in this case the protective immune system of the host body environment helps the virus to evolve under selective pressure of infection rejection identification of several asymptomatic carriers for sars-cov-2 can be a result of the above fact thus virus is the player but its optimum molecular genetic fitness distribution and evolution are shaped by the host body environment 12 19 24 in case of sars-cov-2 its diverse genetic variability and evidence of its existence among different host species indicates towards its rapid jumping species nature which probably makes it extremely diverse and virulent the host body environment gave the virus the opportunity to prepare for the battle where both the genetic manipulation and the natural selection process plays major role for its adaptability resulting the current uncontrolled pandemic from another angle if we look over the two extremities of the origin and exposure of the sars-cov-2 they are bats and humans both of the host environments can be considered as large population bats is the reservoir of a large number of viral pathogens and inhabit in a giggling manner in a close contact thus enhances the chance of cross transmission and giving the pathogen a field to evolve similarly the modern human population is highly dynamic and exposed to various extreme environmental conditions the large co habitation and lifestyle pattern enhances the chance of cross transmission of virus and make a susceptible environment for emerging new viral disease after considering the impact of molecular genetic diversity and host body environment in the origin and development of a virulent strain we need to understand the role of the external environmental factors in the stability and survival of the virus outside the host body conditions during the process of evolution intra or inter species transmission among the susceptible host community external environment plays a critical role though in the external environment outside the host body the virus cannot multiply and cause infection but different factors are crucial in the stability of the virus outside its host environment for the process of its transmission specifically when we are dealing with a respiratory tract associated virus the role of environmental factors must be emphasized because the respiratory outputs are directly exposed to the environment through cough sneeze and sputum the role of different environmental factors like temperature salinity ph etc for viral stability in aerosol inert surface water etc needs to be discussed because external environment is the connecting media between various host species during the viral transmission in case of the other two common human corona virus super spread sars-cov-1 and mers air transmission is well reported in form of droplet and aerosol the evolutionary pattern of sars-cov-2 is associated with geographical continent specific subtype diversity with a tendency of rapid species spill over which indicate towards its huge external environmental adaptation moreover social distancing is emphasized for covid-19 spread due to its highly contagious nature thus understanding the role of external environmental factors in maintaining viral stability and capability to survive in different patient samples as well as certain inert or abiotic environmental substances the fomite by which it can spread needs to be  analyzed very well if we consider the clinical samples by which the virus is exposed to the environment research shows that sars-cov-2 may present in different types of patient samples high viral load is found mainly in the respiratory samples presence of virus in blood samples proves its systemic spread detection of live viral particle in feces indicates its fecaloral route of environmental exposure 6 30 after the virus is exposed to environment by these clinical samples sars-cov-2 shows various degree of fomite stability for different surfaces associated to those patient samples in case of steel surface the stability is maximum approximately 2-3 days it is also stable in polypropylene card board and copper show less degree of stability in aerosol the virus shows three hours of stability 27 in connection with the fecaloral route the stability and sustainability of sars-cov-2 has been found in waste and sanitary water in infected areais recently reported 18 the stability of virus in different contaminated surfaces and in different patient sample outputs depends on the action of temperature and relative humidity percentage it has been observed for corona virus that low temperature 4 degree and low humidity 20 is supportive for the viral stability where gradual increase of both the parameters inactivates the virus more rapidly it has been observed that lipid virus like covid can be inactivated by the interference of two mechanisms the air water interphase and desiccation process when the relative humidity is nearly 50 the virus is accumulated by the air water interphase then the desiccation process excretes water from the lipid layer by oxidation and simultaneously breaks the cross linking thus which effectively damage the lipid layer of the pathogen much rapidly 4 on this note it must be pointed that mucus acts as the first protective barrier for invading respiratory virus interaction of mucus layer glycoprotein with viral surface proteins have been well reported in influenza virus recent research shows that the saliva or mucus substance may act as a protective barrier for the virus when it is exposed to the external environment the aerosol also goes with the same flow where it helps the virus from the hazardous effect of varying external environment by retaining its infectivity 11 33 so temperature inactivation or the air water desiccation mechanism are not effective on the virus when the organic barriers acts as insulator thus in case of sars-c0v-2 it is received by the environment through different clinical sample outputs mainly the respiratory secretions from an infected person whether it is a susceptible host or carrier in form of droplets or aerosol and can survive in this form in various fomites after the virus is received in the external environment the patient sample itself protects it from adverse environmental conditions and helps it to survive or sustain for long time acting as maintaining media for the virus outside the host body this is the probable reason why sars-cov-2 shows high degree of external environment stability from the above analysis it is clear that the outside host environment acts as the intermediate player which receives maintains protects and transfers the pathogen using its various factors as weapon for covid-19 pandemic from the above study it is clear that rapid evolving nature and high environmental stability of sars-cov-2 is responsible for the current outbreak of covid-19 the evolutionary process of this new version of the virus indicates the synthetic theory of evolution or the neo-darwinism theory where the virus has gone through sequential multistep thorough process of molecular genetic variation which is shaped and established by the natural selection process in this review the role of both the host body environment and the external environment in disease establishment is discussed from different angle fig 1 the host body is the important factor for the covid-19 host-pathogenic interaction establishment where the molecular evolution happens the rapid host body changing pattern helps the virus to be continuously exposed to new environmental conditions which creates selective pressure to the virus in order to struggle for existence and infection establishment inside host body the virus undergo through several genetic manipulations and achieve its mutated characters then genetically close different subtypes of sars-cov-2 develops unique spike protein receptor binding domain with high degree of receptor binding property to human cells and adapt itself to fit the character inside the host body ultimately by the action of natural selection specific hostpathogen interaction happens where the virus can establish the infection the external environment acts as intermediate player in between one host to another by providing suitable environment for stability and survival for sars-cov-2 outside its host body resulting high viability and higher transmissibility compared to other corona virus it has been reported that the external environment also interacts with the host body environment and helps the stability of the virus inside the host body system and its infectivity changing temperature and relative humidity contributes to the degree of host susceptibility to a certain pathogen pathogen infiltration and survival inside the host body 22 thus the outcomes from the whole study will help to understand the sudden emergence of covid-19 pandemic and its character the findings emphasize to consider the interactive role of both of the two environments the host body environment and the external environment as the source of genetic evolution of emerging viral diseases and its control  severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in hong kong kenneth tsang w thomas mok y poon wong c gaik ooi c   since its recognition in february 2003 sars has drawn enormous attention and triggered fears worldwide especially in the asia pacific region sars is a new and probably previously unencountered severe and highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus known as sarscov

 since february 2003 sars has spread to 28 countries and has affected 8202 individuals resulting in 725 deaths worldwide
3
 most of these cases occurred in hong kong mainland china taiwan and singapore which totalled 1726 5316 585 and 206 cases respectively

 other regions in the asia pacific are also affected although the numbers remain low in malaysia five cases and thailand eight cases
3
 although canada has had the only major outbreak outside asia 148 cases and currently has largely contained sars there are still sporadic cases at the time of writing the economic impact to hong kong has been devastating although the morale of medical and other healthcare workers remains high despite the declining incidence of sars worldwide the possible emergence of future superspreaders should remind healthcare professionals and health authorities to stay vigilant as only one or two of these index patients could trigger another major outbreak

 while there is still gross deficiency in the understanding of the pathogenesis diagnostic management and prognostic aspects of sars altogether 647 articles have been published since february 2003 as listed in pubmed to date the initial hopes of a speedy delivery of a rapid and reliable diagnostic test for sars have failed to materialize consequently sars requires a clinical diagnosis at least in the initial but often critical stages of the illness

12
 treatment for sars is also controversial and prognosis for these patients is still unclear this article attempts to summarize some of the recent developments in this newly recognized condition while human metapneumovirus and chlamydia pneumoniae might have some role in the exacerbation of the disease in some sars patients it is now certain that sars is primarily caused by a novel coronavirus sarscov

 direct inoculation of two macaques with sarscov has resulted in the production of comparable disease to human sars reisolation of the virus and detection of a specific immune response thereby fulfilling kochs criteria
13
 this new virus is currently proposed to be of animal origin because the earliest cases in mainland china were chefs or handlers of wild game animals cooked as a delicacy although sarscov is likely to be predominantly transmitted by droplets it is also likely to infect others via contaminated items particularly as sarscov can live outside the body for several days

 a recent outbreak in amoy gardens a densely populated residential estate in hong kong also demonstrated that infected stools could transmit sarscov via defective sewage systems there are few histological studies into sars as initial fatal cases did not undergo autopsy for fear of disease transmission the prohibitory high infection risk to bronchoscopists also barred more widespread efforts at performing transbronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavages on sars patients nevertheless an electronically published article describing the autopsy results on six sars patients described diffuse alveolar damage macrophage infiltration and epithelial cell proliferation as the predominant features
15
 the earlier histological changes performed on a ventilated patient by using videoassisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy on day 5 of the illness also revealed mild to moderate diffuse alveolar damage manifesting as patchy hyaline membrane changes lining the alveolar ducts and some air spaces and alveolar septal infiltration by neutrophils and mononuclear cells
4
 there is therefore no diagnostic histological feature other than identification of sarscov by electron microscopy which would provide a definitive diagnosis nevertheless efforts should still be made with strictest safety precautions in mind to obtain histological or cytological samples from the lower respiratory tract of these patients not only to exclude other mimicking conditions but also to advance our understanding of this new disease although the pathogenesis is unclear it is generally accepted that sars is predominantly an atypical pneumonic illness the distribution of the pneumonic shadow is also predominantly in the lower lobes and peripherally distributed

 thus resembling bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and some other interstitial lung diseases

 the rapid appearance of these changes and their often remarkable and rapid clearance after corticosteroid therapy suggests that there is an element of virusinduced immune response which could be selfperpetuating leading to development of adult respiratory distress syndrome the clinical features of sars are summarized in table 1 the occurrence of upper respiratory tract symptoms is unusual although by no means exclusive to sars

 patients with diarrhoea could potentially be highly infectious particularly if debilitated and requiring nursing assistance after each episode
18
 it is of note that most patients in the asia pacific region with fever and chills without respiratory symptoms or fever with diarrhoea do not suffer from sars however healthcare workers must remain vigilant to minimize their chances of being infected

 haematological testing usually reveals a normal total leucocyte count occasionally thrombocytopenia and almost always lymphopenia

 liver function indices could be abnormal in about 50 of cases and usually show raised transaminases as well as lactate dehydrogenase from disease onset

 creatinine kinase has been reported to be elevated in some series when patients suffer from myositic symptoms
7
 as these patients usually have no sputum nasopharyngeal aspirate has been used for rapid viral identification especially for respiratory syncytial and influenza viruses and viral cultures collection of nasopharyngeal aspirate however has led to infection of nursing staff and thus in some centres has been replaced by nasopharyngeal swabs sputum culture is often nondiagnostic but should be performed to ensure adequate screening for infection by mycobacteria fungi and burkholderia pseudomallei especially in the presence of rapidly deteriorating pneumonia in the asia pacific region in suspected patients especially in the presence of severe lymphopenia and rapidly deteriorating community acquired pneumonia cap hiv infection has to be excluded serological testing for acute and convalescence antibodies against mycoplasma pneumoniae chlamydia pneumoniae and legionella pneumophilia is routinely performed in our centre although invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy can provide lower respiratory tract specimens or tissue for microbiological electron microscopic and histological examination bronchoscopy is definitely associated with staff infection as administration of nebulized 2agonist to a sars patient was attributed to be the cause of a major hospital outbreak such a mode for delivery of hypertonic saline to induce sputum production should be avoided

 radiological assessment is probably one of the most important investigations for suspected and confirmed sars patients

 daily cxr are performed for all suspected and probable sars patients in most centres in hong kong the most common early pattern is the presence of lower zone ground glass appearance and consolidation which could rapidly progress to other lobes of the lung within 24 h fig 1ab some patients also present initially with bilateral and fairly extensive consolidation despite clinically being not markedly dyspnoeic a very small proportion of patients display bilateral ground glass pattern on initial presentation and more rarely might even have nodular shadows over the background ground glass patterns fig 1c up to 10 of our cases develop spontaneous pneumomediastinum and this is often associated with the presence of fairly extensive disease and clinical deterioration fig 2 while there is no definite pattern most sars patients would show deterioration of cxr and unremitting fever despite antibiotic therapy highresolution ct scan fig 3 which should only be performed in doubtful cases and in cases not showing improvement characteristically shows subpleural airspace shadowing

 the diagnostic criteria issued by the world health organization who centers for disease control and prevention cdc usa and health authority head office of hong kong are summarized in 2 3 4

12
 it is of note that only suspected and probable but not confirmed sars are defined by the who and cdc the latter stipulates the presence of severe clinical respiratory illness and epidemiological contact as probable sars and moderate clinical respiratory illness and epidemiological contact as suspected sars
11
 the diagnosis of probable or suspected sars therefore requires the presence of fever and respiratory symptoms with or without radiographic evidence of consolidation the other important prerequisite is the presence of contact or travel history usually within the previous 10 days with a sars patient or to an area with known local transmission within the visit period
11
 none of these guidelines actually requires the presence of a positive identification of sarscov and thus the diagnosis of sars is ultimately based on clinical grounds these guidelines are also rather loose in defining the conditions and the clinical investigative and radiological features described above should also be considered before making a diagnosis several groups have reported the successful application of reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr in the detection of sarscov

 although clinical application of this technique still remains to be validated while serology of antisarscov igg appears to be specific and sensitive this only provides a retrospective diagnosis there is a delay in this seroconversion possibly secondary to the administration of high dose corticosteroid therapy and antisarscov igg positivity is less than 10 and 70 on days 14 and 21 respectively although this reaches almost 100 on day 30
18

 as nonsars cap is much more likely to be the cause of fever and radiographic consolidation than sars most of these cases in affected areas could potentially satisfy the diagnostic criteria for suspected sars cases potential sars patients must be strictly isolated and considerable infection control measures such as the use of appropriate protective devices eg n95 masks eye shields and gowns and stringent infection control measures eg negative pressure rooms have to be deployed in the absence of a reliable rapid diagnostic test adoption of these measures could rapidly paralyze the daily running of many if not most busy general hospitals in this region on the other hand if strict infection control and stringent isolation measures are not taken healthcare workers and fellow patients would be crossinfected this would result in community outbreaks of sars as exemplified by the recent experience in hong kong singapore and toronto

 the management consists of three parts these include strict isolation policy and preventive measures to minimize cross infection patients with fever and cap generally do not have sars and therefore should be treated with potent antibiotics and other measures to maximize their chances of rapid recovery specific antisars therapy should only be commenced in cases that display typical and persistent haematological biochemical and radiological features of sars who do not respond to antibiotics and with an epidemiological link in general we would meticulously observe the clinical course of a patient and would have to be convinced that the patient is not suffering from severe background pneumonia before we would commence antisars therapy fig 4  since the middle of march 2003 our institute has been admitting to our isolation wards all cases who have radiographic pneumonia with fever 38c or a history of such in the last 2 days the organization and logistics are as shown in fig 3 our policy is to rapidly isolate and closely observe these patients for radiographic changes as well as their clinical responses while waiting for the rtpcr results of nasopharyngeal swab and stool specimens most nonsars patients tend to become apyrexial after antibiotic therapy eg combination of a third generation cephalosporin and a macrolide as different areas within the asia pacific region have very different aetiological microbes for cap it is imperative that local experience and data are used properly to provide adequate antimicrobial cover sars is a very emotionally taxing condition both for the healthcare workers the patient and the patients family every effort must be made to communicate frequently and effectively with the patient and the patients family especially as we do not permit visitation throughout the entire hospitalization period the wards have security officers outside to ensure strict adherence to isolation policy we have a special phone set up for patients on each of the isolation wards but the hong kong patients generally prefer to use their personal mobile phone to communicate with the outside world all patients discharged from the isolation wards will still be managed with the same vigilance and are not permitted to have visitors with regular and empathetic communication and frequent contact with senior physicians our patients appear to understand their responsibility to help contain sars and we seldom encounter cases who are not willing to cooperate the cdc us stipulates that no specific treatment recommendations can be made at this time and suggests the use of empirical therapy directed against pathogens associated with cap including coverage of atypical organisms
21
 the who also makes a similar recommendation
22
 and clearly states the need to prevent aerosolization of respiratory secretions such as the use of nebulizer therapy chest physiotherapy bronchoscopy gastroscopy and any procedure or intervention that may cause irritation to the respiratory tract thereby resulting in coughing when these highrisk procedures have to be performed on sars patients very stringent personal protective equipment should be used for intubation of patients which carries an extremely high risk to the operator we use even more stringent measures standard protection for this procedure should at least consist of two full body neck to ankle length gowns outer waterproof and inner cotton surgical gown two surgical gloves n95 or n100 masks full face shield goggles two surgical hats and surgical theatre boots the physician and assistants minimal number are ushered to degown and shower as soon as the procedure is completed in sars numerous antibiotic therapies have been tried without any efficacy

 in hong kong ribavirin is used at a lower dosage 8 mgkg iv tid for the first 5 days followed by 1200 mg orally tid for a total of 1014 days and does not appear to cause such frequent or severe toxicities future use of ribavirin should be carefully scrutinized anecdotal experience from mainland china is very convincing on the benefit of administering highdose corticosteroid to some patients with severe sars naturally the use of such therapy stirs anxiety in clinicians who face an overwhelming infection respiratory physicians in hong kong have amassed experience in the recent outbreak and generally concur that the use of highdose corticosteroids is beneficial in sars patients who show radiographic deterioration needless to say repeated use of such therapy in the later stages of the disease could be associated with severe secondary sepsis notably fungal pneumonias n s zhong pers comm 2003 a number of regimens have been used in hong kong these include i hydrocortisone 2 mgkg qid or 4 mgkg tid iv followed by lowdose oral prednisolone ii methylprednisolone 2 mgkg qid or 4 mgkg tid iv followed by oral prednisolone and iii pulse methylprednisolone 500 mg iv daily for 5 days followed by maintenance oral prednisolone 50 mg bid reducing to 2030 mg daily on day 21

 a very small proportion of patients despite suffering from probable sars and displaying virological evidence of acute sarscov infection appear to have an indolent course of illness these patients could be treated initially with oral prednisolone 50 mg daily gradually tapering to maintenance at say 2030 mg daily over 21 days and oral ribavirin 1200 mg tid for 10 days with more experience our unit is increasingly more inclined to commence pulse methylprednisolone as the initial therapy for most patients who show progressive disease we would like to thank june sun colin ko and christina yan

oie 2015 notwithstanding the official designation as low-pathogenic h9n2 subtype can cause a broad range of signs varying from subclinical infection to 100 mortality in poultry farms nili et al 2013 and poultry industry of countries such as iran suffer huge economic losses via reduction of body weight gain vaccination costs and sometimes high mortality in poultry farms in order to reduce the risk and problems posed to both public health and poultry sector dissemination routes of this subtype need to be clarified insects wild birds humans other mammals and also inanimate objects like fomites are believed to be able to transmit ai virus brugh and johnson 1986 among them house fly has been considered as a vector of many pathogenic agents including bacteria viruses fungi protozoan parasitic oocysts and eggs wanaratana et al 2011 junqueira et al 2017 the predominance of optimal conditions for population growth of house flies made them the most important insect in poultry farms tyasasmaya et al 2016 in this study the possibility of acquisition and retention time period of this virus inon house fly were investigated the results revealed that lpaiv could accommodate at external body surface of house fly and its persistency period was up to 24 h pe these results are in accordance with those of wanaratana et al 2011 and nazni et al 2013 who respectively showed that h5n1 and h1n1 could be detectable up to 24 h on the outer body surface of house flies our findings appear to be well substantiated by three facts about house fly the habitat the behavior and the body structures house flies inhabit manure spoiled foods carcasses and synanthropic environments sawabe et al 2006 junqueira et al 2017 additionally surfaces are easily contaminated with virus particles due to fly foraging habits regurgitation and defecation sawabe et al 2009 depositing eggs calibeo-hayes et al 2003 and also grooming activities tan et al 1997 anatomically the flys body is covered with hairs the legs are bristled the foot pads adhesive and the proboscis are all well suited to being contaminated tyasasmaya et al 2016 junqueira et al 2017 our important finding was detection of h9-specific rna within house flies up to 96 h which was not detected any longer at 120 h after the exposure these results are consistent with those of wanaratana et al 2011 who observed the same length of time for positive rrt-pcr results of whole homogenate of house fly bodies pe to aiv h5n1 more recently in 2016 a viral exposure experiment also showed the existence of aiv h5n1 for at least 24 h in gastrointestinal tracts of house flies tyasasmaya et al 2016 in crop of house flies live newcastle disease virus ndv was detected up to 96 h after initial exposure to ndv while it remained viable only 24 h in midgut and hindgut watson et al 2007 however the h5n1 aiv was isolated from the feces of blowflies calliphora nigribarbis vollenhoven 1863 diptera calliphoridae at 48 h after exposure sawabe et al 2009 under experimental conditions sugar was used in feeding meal and high sugar concentration correlates with meal storage in crop even for several days greenberg 1973 thus dissemination of virus through defecation and specially regurgitation seems more feasible flies were not dissected in the current study however in order to elucidate different probable routes of virus transmission and spread by flies we are currently in the process of discovering virus retention sites in each dissected body fractures comparatively our result also showed that the outer surface of house fly during initial 24 h could carry less load of viral rnas than interior parts of flies which seems directly in line with the destructive effect of temperature and ultraviolet light on labile ai viruses chumpolbanchorn et al 2006 but the most important clinically relevant finding was the decline in concentration of viral rnas during the time after exposure to aiv h9n2 either outside or within house flies the virus did not replicate inside the house fly supporting the dominant paradigm of mechanical but not biological transmission of avian viruses rotavirus turkey coronavirus reticuloendotheliosis virus and ndv tan et al 1997 calibeo-hayes et al 2003 davidson and braverman 2005 barin et al 2010 although this is the first experimental study elucidating the dynamic of h9n2 aiv retention in flies it did not evaluate the viability of virus post-exposure but generally the rna load probably is a high estimate of the viable virus that could be present and that when the samples are negative for rna there should not be any viable virus present however particularly hpai h5n1 was shown to remain viable up to 72 h in a similar experiment wanaratana et al 2011 further works which take viability of the viruses into account is intended to be undertaken using subsequent inoculation to culture media or chickens the answer to the question if the number of viral particles suffice to be transmitted and to infect a chicken in different critical routes is deferred to our future work in controlled field conditions in summary the results of this study demonstrate the persistence of h9-specific rna up to 24 h on the surface and up to 96 h within the house fly post-experimental feeding of h9n2 aiv in endemic countries especially those with low quality of biosecurity practices flies might be involved in intrafarm or close transmission which needs practical implications like reducing flies population as well as boosting biosecurity measures  sequence of

international ff- 32p datp was used in the sequencing reactions and the products were analysed on 03 mm 6 polyacrylamide sequencing gels all sequencing gels were dried down onto silane-treated glass plates as described by garoff and ansorge 1981  sequence data were stored and analysed on an apple he microcomputer using the programs of larson and messing 1983  the hydrophilicity plot from these programs was used with the hydrophilicity values of kyte and doolittle 1982  results 1224 base pairs of dna sequence have been determined from two clones c5136 and 142 the positions of these two clones and of the region of sequence presented here are shown in fig 1  in fig 2a the arrows show the direction and amount of sequence information determined from individual restriction sites 97 of the sequence has been determined on both strands all restriction sites used for the sequencing have been sequenced through from other sites and a large section has been sequenced by both enzymatic and chemical methods fig 2a also shows restriction sites used in the sequencing sites marked above the line were used for maxam and gilbert sequencing directly from the clones sequencing from the alu i sites marked below the line was carried out on fragments recloned into puc9 see materials and methods also shown below the line are the ends of the clones from which sequencing was carried out after recloning into puc9 a search was made for initiation and termination codons in the three possible reading frames these initiation and termination signals are shown in fig 2b with the main open reading frames marked also shown is the 5 terminus of mrna b as determined by sl mapping brown and boursnell 1984  sl mapping of the 5 terminus of mrna c using clone 142 proved very difficult probably due to the small size of the protected fragment the lack of suitable restriction sites precluded the use of a procedure involving 5 end labelling the approximate position of the 5 terminus of mrna c was therefore determined by mrna length measurements on formaldehyde-agarose gels these measurements give an estimated iength of 3400 bases coronavirus mrnas have a 5 leader sequence which is fused to the body of the message during transcription lai et al 1983 baric et al 1983 spaan et al 1983  in the case of mrna c therefore the length of the ibv leader sequence approximately 60 bases brown and boursneli manuscript in preparation has been subtracted from the measured length of the mrna to give the length of the body of the message which is present on genomic rna the 1224 base pairs of sequence are shown in fig 3 with a translation of the largest open reading frame this open reading frame orf of 225 amino acids predicts a polypeptide of molecular weight 25 443 two smaller orfs 4 and 5 see fig 2b  which follow on directly from the large orf in the same reading frame predict polypeptides of 5896 and 3055 daltons respectively there are also two small orfs 2 and 3 present within the sequences of the largest orf the orf starting with the atg codon at position 1147 is the start of the putative 7500 dalton polypeptide encoded by mrna b brown and boursnell manuscript submitted  the organisation of the messenger rnas of coronaviruses and in vitro translation studies have led to the hypothesis that it is only the unique 5 sequences of each mrna which are translated stern and kennedy 1980b lai et al 1981  the sequence shown in fig 3 predicts a large open reading frame orf 1 of 225 amino acids if translated this would code for a protein of molecular weight 254k gel-purified mrna c translated in vitro gives a 23k polypeptide identical in size to the unglycosylated form of the membrane polypeptide stern et al 1982 stern and sefton 1984  hence the data is entirely consistent with this open reading frame being the codingsequence for the membrane polypeptide the sequence also predicts four other open reading frames orfs longer than 25 amino acids two of these orfs 2 and 3 of 32 and 45 amino acids respectively lie within the coding sequences for the membrane polypeptide examination of the sequences flanking the initiation codon for the membrane polypeptide gene shows that they conform to one of the sequences preferred for functional eucaryotic initiation codons kozak 1983  because of this and because initiation at anything other than the first aug codon is known to be very rare kozak 1983  it seems probable that the 254k product of the 225 amino acid open reading frame orf 1 is the only polypeptide produced from mrna c it is possible however that there are minor mrna species intermediate in size between mrnas b and c which would enable a product to be translated from one or both of the orfs which are present between the end of the membrane gene and mrna b 85 bases before the initiation codon for the membrane polypeptide gene is the sequence cttaacaa which also occurs 101 bases before the first open reading frame of mrna a probably the nucleocapsid gene and 28 bases before 75k open reading frame encoded by mrna b boursnell and brown manuscript submitted the point at which this sequence occurs is also known to mark the 5 termini of the bodies of mrnas a and b brown and boursnell 1984  thus it seems likely that this sequence also represents the 5 terminus of mrna c and its position relative to the estimated position of the end of the body of mrna c helps to confirm this it is interesting to note that there appears to be greater homology between the sequences present at the 5 termini of mrnas a and b than to that which we are postulating occurs at the end of mrna c see fig 4  there is however a 12-base homology aaaacttaacaa between the sequences at the 5 termini of mrnas b and c the amino acid sequence of the membrane polypeptide reveals several interesting features it is known that the carbohydrate side chains of the glycosylated forms of cl tatactatgtagaaacttacaiatccgqattaoaagcgtt - fig 4  nucleotide sequences at the 5 termini of mrnas a b and c some sequence homologies are underlined the 23k polypeptide are n-linked stern and sefton 1982b cavanagh 1983  there are only two sites asn-x-thr in the amino acid sequence at which n-linked glycosylation can occur hubbard and ivatt 1981  these are at the nh-terminus at amino acids 3 and 6 this agrees well with the data of stern et al 1982 who have shown that glycosylation of the 23k polypeptide occurs at the nh-terminus a hydropathicity profile fig 5a  which shows the local hydrophobic tendencies positive values or hydrophilic tendencies negative values of a polypeptide chain kyte and doolittle 1982 shows that there are several hydrophobic regions in the membrane polypeptide in particular there are three stretches where the mean hydrophobicities taken over 19 amino acids greatly exceed the lowest value generally associated with membrane-spanning polypeptides kyte and doolittle 1982  these regions which are underlined in fig 3  each consist of a contiguous length of at least 20 uncharged amino acids which are highly enriched in hydrophobic residues it is possible that each of these regions spans the membrane once with the short hydrophilic sections separating them being at the surfaces of the membrane however since these hydrophilic sections are only very short it may be that all the hydrophobic nh-terminal region is buried in the membrane with only the hydrophilic cooh-terminal exposed it is known that the membrane proteins of the 23k family do not undergo any major post-translational proteolytic processing stern and sefton 1982a  and indeed there is no apparent hydrophobic signal sequence at the nh-terminus which might be cleaved off however it is possible that one of the internal hydrophobic amino acid number regions acts as a signal sequence as may be the case for chicken ovalbumin lingappa et al 1979  treatment of the viral particle with the protease bromelain reduces the molecular weight of all the glycosylated forms of the membrane polypeptide to a single polypeptide whose molecular weight is approximately lk less than the size of the unglycosylated membrane polypeptide d cavanagh personal communication thus the protease appears to cleave at least the first six amino acids with their associated variable carbohydrate side chains from the nh-terminus of the membrane protein the fact that this is achieved by protease treatment of largely intact virus particles suggests that the carbohydrate side chains and hence the nhterminus are located on the outside of the viral membrane this would have been expected by analogy with the membrane el polypeptide of mhv and with other viral glycoproteins sturman and holmes 1977 rose and gallione 1981  the 75 or so amino acids of the cooh-terminal region of the polypeptide form a hydrophilic region which may protrude from the inner surface of the viral envelope for mhv-a59 sturman et al 1980 have shown that there is some interaction between the membrane el protein and the viral rna if this is also the case for ibv it is interesting to note that of the 18 basic residues in the membrane polypeptide 14 of them are in the cooh-terminal half of the molecule it is possible that these basic residues are involved in binding to the rna comparison of the sequence of the ibv membrane protein and the el protein of mhv-a59 peter rottier personal communication at the rna sequence level reveals essentially no homology however comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences fig 6 shows a remarkable degree of homology especially in the amino terminal half of the molecule in particular the sequence within the first two potential membrane-spanning regions seem to be highly conserved with 24 out of 44 ammo acids the same and most of the differences involving pairs of amino acids with similar properties a region of even greater homology occurs in the hydrophilic stretch of residues at position 104 fig 6  in which 15 out of 19 residues are the same these similarities at the amino acid levtsl are strikingly reflected in the hydropathicity profiles fig 5  this protein sequence conservation in the hydrophobic nh-terminal half of the polypeptide suggests a high degree of selective pressure for maintenance of the structure of the putative trans-membrane regions of coronavirus membrane proteins in conciusion then the sequence presented here shows good agreement with the observed and expected properties of the membrane polypeptide of infectious bronchitis virus we are grateful to penny gatter anne foulds ian foulds and

vijaya majumdar   the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-212345678910 with the recently analyzed mortality of 57 95 ci 55595 the initial reports of disease outbreak were reported in wuhan hubei province of china covid-19 followed by its worldwide expansion367 owing to the highly contagious nature of the virus in a meeting on january 30 2020 as per the international health regulations 2005 the who declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern as it has spread across 18 countries across the globe with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission8 phylogenetic analysis has indicated a zoonotic origin of sars-cov-26 with person-to-person transmissibility10 sars-cov-2 is a -cov with highly identical genome to bat cov pointing to bat as the natural host911 covs belong to a large family of single-stranded rna viruses  with a broad distribution across humans other mammals and birds and cause respiratory enteric hepatic and neurologic infections7 these rna viruses derive their name due to the crown-like or coronal appearance coronam is the latin term for crown given by the club-shaped glycoprotein spikes in the envelope importantly the past two decades have witnessed the emergence of three highly pathogenic novel zoonotic covs  sars-cov sars-cov now named sars-cov-1 discovered in november 2002 middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov mers-cov in june 2012 and sars-cov-2 identified in december 2019  and have been of global public health concerns27 these periodic emergencies occur due to frequent cross-species infections and increasing interfaces between humans and other animal interface712 these frequent emergences also derive from the high prevalence and wide distribution of covs their large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of their genomes12 sars-cov-2 causes a respiratory viral infection that represents the most prevalent and pathogenic forms of communicable infectious diseases613 in severe cases wherein there is a delay or absence of early and effective antiviral treatment the infection could manifest in a compromised systemic and local respiratory defense mechanisms leading to bacterial coinfection culminating into severe acute respiratory illness and occasionally into acute respiratory distress syndrome ards789 the current estimates indicate a basic reproduction number r0 of 22 implying that on an average each infected person spreads the infection to an additional two persons14 the latest updates suggest that the pandemic of covid-19 has entered a new stage with rapid spread in countries outside china indicating the need of practicing the measures for self-protection toward the prevention of transmission of the infection to others4 as of march 16 2020 a drastic escalation in the number of cases of covid-19 was observed outside china with a number of 143 affected countries states or territories reporting infections to the who15 the covid-19 outbreak is an indication of the prevailing challenge of the recurrent surfacing of the unprecedented pathogenic infections that demand regular monitoring and preparedness14 there is an urgent need of basic and clinical research efforts to aid in the understanding of the disease biology and development of robust combat measures14 sars-cov-2 primarily spreads by droplets and is postulated to have higher transmissibility as compared to seasonal influenza a major concern arises due to its likely spread via even asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals who may not seek any clinical evaluation16 as reported by huang et al patients with covid-19 primarily present with fever fatigue and dry cough17 most of the patients exhibit favorable prognosis however older patients and those with chronic underlying conditions may present with worse outcomes1718 in the early stages of infection patients could be afebrile represented with only chills and respiratory symptoms19 the clinical spectrum varies from asymptomatic or mild symptomatic forms to severe forms characterized by respiratory failure that necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit icu or multi-organ and systemic manifestations in terms of sepsis septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes8 effective prevention or treatment of covid-19 remains a top priority toward the curtailing of this pandemic implementation of several infection control measures eg social isolation distancing or quarantine of entire communities have been posited for control and prevention of the covid-19 outbreak420 the most important and effective challenge seems to establish preventive intervening strategies before the humanpathogen interface vaccination is the one of the most radical countermeasures to combat an infectious disease epidemic although substantial progress has been made toward characterization of the causative virus for covid-19 a time period of probably a least 1 year to 18 months has been speculated for substantial vaccine production21 in the early stage of the pandemic antiviral treatment is the most effective method very recently hydroxychloroquine has been reported to be apparently effective against the treatment of covid-19-associated pneumonia in clinical studies2223 however implementation of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis has several requirements in particular an adequate stockpile of drugs along with the safety of the treatment and cost-effectiveness24 most importantly the preventivecontrolling measures should be implemented in a judicious and cost-effective manner24 yoga an ancient mindbody technique is defined as samatvam balanceequipoisehomeostasis at both mind and body levels to be achieved through mastery over the modifications of the mind chittavrittinirodhah the available evidence indicates that yogameditation facilitates the coordination among the set of homeostatic responses involving the interaction among the nervous endocrine and immune systems25 hence the recent definition of yoga states it as a comprehensive skill set of synergistic process tools that aids in bidirectional feedback and modulation of autonomic nervous system outputs through integration between central nervous system cns and afferent and re-afferent inputs from interoceptive processes such as the somatosensory viscerosensory and chemosensory25 postures sanskrit asana breath regulation sanskrit pranayama and meditation along with the conceptual corrections comprise the integrative system of yoga techniques that could promote physical as well as mental well-being the postures or asanas are purported to have different effects some are stimulatory to the nervous and circulatory systems some develop coordination and concentration while others have a calming effect on the body some postures such as the corpse pose are used for elongated periods of relaxation clinically these therapeutic techniques of yoga have been reported to be beneficial against the management of acute stress as in posttraumatic stress disorder after tsunami26 or in chronically stressed people with depression or anxiety262728 and in many noncommunicable diseases such as asthma2930 hypertension3132 heart disease33 and diabetes3435363738 in particular yoga has been repeatedly reported to facilitate the attainment of glycemic control and mitigate the influence of other risk factors associated with the complications in patients with diabetes as compared to control conditions it has been proposed that the abdominal pressure created during exhalation in kapalabhati improves the efficiency of -cells of the pancreas35 it can be further viewed as modulated interoception or sensory modulation evoked by the vigorous practice of kapalabhati aids in the increased interoception of the abnormal glycemic control that is signaled through the sensory inputs of the cns that in turn modulates the autonomic outputs to the pancreas and other organs related to disease pathophysiology there is evidence for the beneficial effects of yoga as an add-on strategy for the management of communicable diseases including influenza3940 tuberculosis tb41 and human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection424344 wherein status of immune system is an important factor that determines the progression of the disease the results from the meditation or exercise for preventing acute respiratory illness trial mepari trial indicated that training in meditation evoked a larger reduction in global acute respiratory infection ari severity as compared to exercise or the wait-list control participants3940 the findings of the study were found to be in concordance with prior literature on beneficial effects of moderate-intensity exercise against immune system and reduction in the incidence of ari illness39 similarly a prospective randomized trial compared the efficacy of two programs yoga and breath awareness as an add-on to anti-tb treatment in sputum-positive cases in a sanatorium in bangalore41 a total of 1009 pulmonary tb patients were screened and 73 were alternately allocated to yoga n  36 or breath awareness n  37 groups at the end of 2 months the yoga group showed a significantly better reduction in symptom score and an increase in weight and lung capacity with an improved level of infection control and radiographic image as compared to the nonyoga group effect of 1 month of integrated yoga iy intervention has reported to significant improvement in the psychological states as well as in the viral loads in patients suffering from hiv-1 infection42 further yoga has also been reported to be an effective intervention for stress management and improvement in psychological health among hivaids patients424344 these findings indicate toward a potential complementary role for yoga in the management of communicable diseases the available evidence supports the potential of yoga as a complementary intervention for populations at risk or already suffering from diseases with an inflammatory component46 several evidences indicate that yoga might influence chronic inflammatory state and might optimize impaired immune function in stress-induced conditions46 the available evidence also uniformly supports that yoga practice could downregulate pro-inflammatory markers among its influence on pro-inflammatory markers significant decreases in interleukin-1 il-1 beta as well as indications for reductions in il-6 and tumor necrosis factor tnf-alpha have been indicated46 cytokine storm represented by increased cytokine levels il-6 il-10 and tnf- lymphopenia in cd4 and cd8 t-cells and decreased ifn- expression in cd4 t-cells is associated with severe covid-1957 these findings support the utility of yoga as a complementary intervention for populations at risk or already suffering from covid-19 duration of the yoga intervention could significantly influence the effects of yoga practice on inflammatory markers based on the findings of pullen et al33 in populations with a high risk of increased inflammation such as heart failure shorter course of interventions of only 8 weeks has been suggested to be sufficient to reduce inflammatory processes the authors have indicated that a reciprocal influence of duration of intervention required depends on the severity or deviation from normal physiology33 respiratory tract infections are highly prevalent in patients with diabetes as compared to those without diabetes58 extending on the same note prevalence of diabetes has also been reported to be one of the most distinctive comorbidities in patients with covid-19 in the study by xiaobo yang et al 22 of the non-survivor critically ill covid-19 patients were reported to have diabetes59 this highly prevalent association between diabetes and covid-19 could be attributed to the compromised immune function reduced t-cell response reduced neutrophil function and disorders of humoral immunity58 further the hyperglycemic environment in these patients could also increase the virulence of pathogens lower the production of interleukins in response to infection with reduced chemotaxis and phagocytic activity and immobilization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes58 as mentioned above fear uncertainty and stigmatization are psychological stress factors during public health emergencies such as covid-1948 the stress-induced activation of the hpa axis could also significantly contribute to poor glycemic control hyperglycemia35 thereby exacerbating the clinical symptoms the stress-reducing aspects of yoga through modulation of hpa axis in patients with aberrant glycemic control diabetes and prediabetes could aid in the attainment of glycemic control as has been frequently reported3435363738 the practice of yoga might aid in reducing the exacerbations and clearance of virus infection in covid-19 patients with diabetes through reducing the influence of systemic hyperglycemic and inflammatory milieu similarly hypertension is also a distinct comorbidity of covid-19 infection60 a study by guan et al on 1099 patients with confirmed covid-19 reported the high prevalence of comorbidities of hypertension 237 and diabetes mellitus 162 in 173 severe cases60 hypertension is typically treated with drug inhibitors that target the reninangiotensin system ras1861 these drugs are mainly the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs these ras inhibitors have been well established against the effective management of blood pressure bp as well as protection from disease-associated inflammation however ras inhibitors have been postulated to affect the expression of ace2 mrna and the activity of ace2 in tissues1861 ace2 is a key counterregulatory enzyme of ace that degrades angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17 thereby attenuating the effects on vasoconstriction sodium retention and fibrosis62 although there have been no definitive conclusions regarding the association of covid-19 with ras inhibitors ace2 has been proposed to be a likely cellular receptor of covid-1962 and in vitro findings have been reported that the receptor mediates the entry of covid-19 virus into hela cells63 further long-term use of aceis might suppress the adaptive immune response which is a key defense against viral infection61 yoga and meditation in particular slow deep breathing have been reported to decrease sympathetic nervous system activity and increase the baroreflex sensitivity in hypertensive patients thereby reducing their blood pressure values64 modulation of hpa axis and autonomic outputs including bp has also been reported to underlie its physiological effects of yoga64 however there has been a lack of evidence on specific targeting of ras or its effector components through yoga inflammatory systematic milieu in hypertensive patients with already altered autonomic regulations could exacerbate disease outcomes based on the anti-inflammatory potential of yoga in hyperinflammatory settings such as hypertension we further extend that yoga could reduce the clinical nonfavorable outcomes in hypertensive patients further a class ii-a level of evidence b recommendation for bp-lowering efficacy has been conferred on slow breathing65 hence yogaslow breathing techniques could provide a safe adjunctcomplementary approach for the management of hypertension in covid-19 patients with hypertension there is a plethora of evidence that breathing exercises have beneficial effects on the respiratory system66 pranayama a yoga-based respiratory exercise is a simple and cost-effective intervention that could be easily integrated in daily routine and has been proven beneficial in subjects across different age groups including the elderly67 yoga training has been reported to improve strength of expiratory as well as inspiratory muscles68 joshi et al reported beneficial effects of a 6-week course of pranayama on ventilatory lung functions69 the authors reported improved ventilatory functions with respect to lowered respiratory rate rr and increased forced vital capacity fvc forced expiratory volume at the end of 1st s fev1 maximum voluntary ventilation mvv peak expiratory flow rate pefr and prolongation of breath-holding time69 repeated practice of pranayama has been shown to strengthen cardiorespiratory coupling and increases in the parasympathetic activity in healthy individuals64 the breathing practice called kapalabhati is comprised of powerful strokes of exhalations accompanied with the contraction of abdominal and diaphragmatic muscles followed by passive inhalations70 kapalabhati aids in appropriate training and toning of diaphragm and abdominal muscles it also helps in removal of secretions from bronchial tree cleansing up respiratory passages and the alveoli70 a combination of yogic breathing techniques improved the pulmonary functions in competitive swimmers71 there have been several reports of clinical trials that suggest an overall effect of yoga training toward improved pulmonary function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd727374757677 an important cause of morbidity and mortality and poses a major public health problem when meta-analyzed a significant clinical effect of yoga in copd patients with respect to fev1 was observed72 in addition the studies reported training effects of yoga on improved exercise capacity lung function decline quality of life and dyspnea in patients with copd72 several mechanistic factors have proposed to underlie the beneficial effects seen in the patients undergoing yoga such as increasing respiratory stamina relaxing chest muscles expanding the lungs raising energy levels and calming the body72 however due to the lack of adequate data and insufficient clinical evidence provided by these studies the clinical relevance of these findings needs further thorough robust experimental evaluations72 breathing exercises using the concepts of yoga could also be adopted to help during states of acute respiratory distress we have previously taught an eight-stepped yoga breathing procedure consisting of very simple neck muscle relaxation movements and asanas with breathing exercises using the support of a chair during 110 episodes of acute airway obstruction in 86 bronchial asthma patients there was a significant improvement in their pefr by 20 within 30 min of the practice with successful relief from the episode the patients reported reduction in panic and anxiety element cutting the vicious cycle of aggravating bronchial obstruction based on the above discussed several beneficial aspects of yoga on the immune and respiratory systems against varied clinical settings including that of infectious diseases we postulate a therapeutic potential of yoga towards covid-19 prevention and management figure 1 we have evolved age-specific sets of yoga modules tables 1 and 2 based on our extensive experience of over past 35 years on clinical research on yoga the modules have been made available for public use on our website httpssvyasaeduin to this end a pilot study was conducted on request

arabindoo  just around the time when the british prime minister boris johnson announced in a bleary-eyed video conference that he had tested positive for covid-19 indian news and social media platforms were broadcasting images of their able-bodied prime minister narendra modi promoting yoga nidra to remain stress-free during the unfolding epidemic as containment and lockdown became literally an universal order of the day the rhetorical power of the emergence of emerging infectious diseases notwithstanding lynteris 2016 with localized outbreaks of covid-19 being recast as a global pandemic a form of vigilante governance beyond the existing system of syndromic surveillance and sentinel watching has been necessitated triggering notorious regimes of intervention including quarantining large sections of the population as lockdowns came to be mimicked and reproduced by sovereign states all over there seems to be a common script outlining these responses that would thrill to no end global health proponents and their penchant for norms and standards however as a possible object of mimesis we need to look beyond its inevitability as well as a temptation to signify it with neo-imperial markings knowing that there is a difference that is almost the same but not  2 quite bhabha 1984  lockdowns to put it simply will look different in all of its locales its actuality being blurrier messier and uncertain thus while in most cases it has been projected as the inscrutable science of social distancing in the indian context the possibility of a virus spillover gets embedded in a complex array of localized metaphors and meanings where its contemporary risks are historicized through particular metonyms requiring different modes of making the unfolding panic intelligible the uncharacteristic appeal from prime minister narendra modi for a 14-hour janata curfew or peoples curfew on sunday 22 nd march is therefore not surprising there was however too much left unexplained in terms of the need for social distance as everyone was instructed to stay inside and not venture outside an unreliable spate of oral information circulated as a result painting a nefarious picture of the outside where the killer virus lurks in the public transmitting more rapidly through the interstices of rumour which threatened to become the new idiom of control more

the re-emergence of the crowd in a locked-down city or its persistent presence is not a sign of a violation but a reflex that is precognitive rather than rational or conscious guided by a compulsive routine of certain social practices that cannot be done away with as an absolute lockdown encounters the ambivalence of everyday life in the city it becomes equivocal open to interpretation and negotiation here the defiant presence of the crowd despite the lockdown is not due to their inevitability but because it is contingent limited to impossible choices with few alternatives there is an

re-naturalised city this is perhaps the challenge of any critical reflection on pandemic futures while no longer speculative in the next few years we will all be busy thinking teaching and writing about this pandemic to various audiences mostly ourselves one clear gauntlet is how we write about a global pandemic from here to elsewhere even as scientists will be occupied with harnessing elusive trends and patterns and reworking models as well as algorithms could we build a narrative of some significance out of the smaller-scale oneoff trends without invoking that much-harassed excuse of cultural distinctiveness do we need to provincialize it if so how would it be enough if we signpost the particular and the singular to expose its global fault lines while investing it with an ethnographic ethos seems to be one obvious way could we attempt to construct a pandemic palimpsest of particular places it will involve building an historiography of the present beyond a linear temporal framing one that will no doubt disrupt the narratives we tend to come up with delivering the royal historical society lecture in 2018 on the centennial anniversary of the 1918-19 influenza

of preliminary screening and diagnosis clinical characteristics of 33 mild patients with sars-cov-2 infection in hunan china sheng yin yizhi peng yaping ren min hu lingli tang zhongyuan xiang xianping li min wang wenlong wang   in december 2019 a series of acute respiratory diseases occurred in wuhan hubei province china now are called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1 the disease has rapidly spread from wuhan to other regions as of february 25 2020 a total of 77785 covid-19 cases have been confirmed in china a new type of coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in wuhan city and then it confirmed as the pathogen of covid-19 a new type of coronavirus sars-cov-2 which was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in wuhan city was confirmed as the cause of covid-192 now the virus is renamed sars-cov-2 by who3 whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis indicate that sars-cov-2 is a unique clade of  -coronal viruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers2 like other  coronaviruses the genome of sars-cov-2 has a long orf1ab polyprotein at the 5 end followed by four major structural proteins including the spike surface glycoprotein small envelope protein matrix protein and nucleocapsid protein4 sars-cov-2 is very similar to coronavirus in bats which are presumed to be the main source5 although the origin of sars-cov-2 is still under investigation current evidence suggests that it spread to humans through wild animals sold illegally in the south china huang et al first reported 41 covid-19 cases most of whom had a history of exposure to the south china seafood wholesale market the patients clinical manifestations include fever dry cough dyspnea myalgia fatigue normal or decreased white blood cell count and imaging evidence of pneumonia7 however no difference in clinical characteristics have been reported between wuhan and other cities in china case reports confirm human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2
8 currently there is no effective first screening and diagnosis guide for covid-19 in non-wuhan areas therefore if the hunan hospital adopts clinical covid-19 diagnosis measures similar to hubei area it will often lead to a higher misdiagnosis rate because of the lighter early clinical symptoms slighter respiratory damage and the lower positive rate of imaging results the purpose of this case series is to describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with sars-cov-2 infection in hunan china then compared with wuhans this study was approved by the hospital ethics committee and all study participants were informed the study population consisted of 33 covid-19 patients at the second xiangya hospital of central south university hunan province china between to january to february 2020 aged 20 to 70 years all the patients were diagnosed by two experienced doctors we only show the patients who are positive for in viral nucleotide testing the samples from the participants were obtained before clinical intensive treatment participants received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded respiratory and stool samples were collected with the consent of all patients unless otherwise stated patients were sampled without gender or age bias swabs and stool were stored at -20 until use whenever a commercial kit is used the manufacturers instructions should be followed without modification nucleic acids were extracted by ssnp-2000a automatic nucleic acid extraction instrument and nucleic acid extraction kits sansure biotech china 20 l extracted nucleic acid sample was added into a pcr amplification tube which contains 30 l of the prepared pcr-mixed solution detected through fluorescence quantitative pcr using a fluorescent pcr instrument amplification was performed as follows 50 for 30 minutes 95 for 60 seconds and then 40 cycles including 95 for 15 seconds 60 for 30 seconds the primer and probe sequences9 orf1b gene 5-tggggytttacrggtaacct-3 forward 5-aacrcgcttaacaaagcactc-3 reverse n gene 5-taatcagacaaggaactgatta-3 forward 5-cgaaggtgtgacttccatg-3 reverse we reviewed the care records laboratory test results and chest x-rays and ct reports of laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infected patients admission data for these patients were from january 9 2020 to february 9 2020 the two researchers also independently reviewed data collection forms to confirm repeatedly continuous variables are expressed as median iqr and compared using the mann-whitney u test categorical variables are expressed as numbers  and compared by chi-square test or fishers exact test a two-sided  of less than 005 was considered statistically significant spss version 250 software spss inc chicago il usa was used to analyse the datas by feb 9 2020 33 admitted hospital patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection in hunan the patients infected with sars-cov-2 were aged from 27 to 78 and the median age of the patients was 46 years iqr 315-65 as of feb 9 in our cohort of 33 patients no child was infected and no gender distribution in infected patients table 1
 the clinical and laboratory data of patients in wuhan area originated from the article of huang c et al7 19 58 patients had hubei travel or residence history while 14 42 patients had contacted hubei personnel the most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever 23 70 of 33 patients cough 13 39 and myalgia or fatigue 14 30 less common symptoms were sputum production 5 15 of 33 headache 2 6 of 33 and diarrhoea 5 15 of 33 most of patients had chest tightness 5 15 or shortness of breath 6 18 however few patients 0 0 of 33 developed dyspnoea by comparing the hunans data with wuhans the area with the most severe outbreak of covid-19 in china we found that the clinical symptoms of patients with sars-cov-2 infection in hunan were significantly different from those in wuhan the fever rate of newly diagnosed patients in hunan area is lower and the temperature of most patients is below 39  94 most patients with sars-cov-2 did not cough in the early stages of infection it is worth noting that patients with sars-cov-2 in hunan rarely have difficulty breathing at first diagnosis only with slight shortness of breath or chest tightness however more than half of patients 55 in wuhan suffer from dyspnea table 2

 the blood counts of patients on admission showed lymphopenia lymphocyte count less than 1  10l 17 61 of 28 patients while the white blood cell count was usually normal 523  10l 195-2668 the level of d-dimer in hunans median d-dimer level 092 mgl 08-111 was higher than that in wuhans median d-dimer level 05 mgl 0313 levels of alanine amino transferase 2885 ul 2268-4125 and aspartate amino transferase 3095 ul 227-4253 in hunan showed no statistical significance with wuhans total bilirubin 7315 mmoll 7222-7918 was increased substantially in hunan patients uric acid 3489 mmoll 2688-4596 and blood urea nitrogen 413 moll 31-498 were dramatically changed in different patients the creatine kinase of hunan patients 1205ul 821-16575 manifested a smaller change compared to wuhan 1325 ul 6202190 and lactate dehydrogenase 2543 ul 21825-3158 was increased in the most patients these reminded the function of liver heart and kidney will be slightly damaged the serum levels of procalcitonin on admission of most patients is normal 0074 ngml 00445-009025 however patients usually manifested higher c-reactive protein 523 mgl 195-2668 mycoplasma pneumoniae igm did not rise in all patients and we also did not find cases of co-infection between influenza ab virus and sars-cov-2 cycle threshold of respiratory tract ct  3277 263369 and stool ct  3464 2859360 were below the reference value ct  37 table 2 on admission abnormalities in chest ct images were detected among most patients the report of ct results of covid-19 patients in wuhan area originated from pan y et al10 of the 19 patients in hunan 6 316 did not show obvious abnormalities the typical findings of chest ct images of patients 6 316 were patchypunctate ground glass opacities fig 2
b only two patients ct images performed ground glass opacity patchy consolidation and fibrous stripes 105 fig 2a compared with patients in wuhan the pathological changes in the lungs of hunan patients were milder in ct 694 and chest radiographs 625 table 3
 many patients with covid-19 in hunan region showed significant symptoms of diarrhea by testing nucleic acid levels in stool of these patients we found that the virus was present in both the respiratory tract and the stool of eight patients of these patients there is no statistical difference between cycle threshold of respiratory tract and stool p  0893 the expression amount of nucleic acid is not related to diarrhea p  0285 table 4
 however by testing nucleic acid levels in tears we found the virus in 6 patients respiratory tract while their tears were negative table 5
 within weeks after the outbreak of the covid-19 china quickly developed a nucleic acid detection protocol for this virus this is the first time we have proposed a preliminary screening program for covid-19 patients in hunan we detected sars-cov-2 in oral swabs and stools because infected patients may release this pathogen through the respiratory tract feces or body fluids the white blood cell counts of most newly diagnosed patients with covid-19 in hunan area were normal even so he will be accompanied by significant decrease in lymphocyte counts and electrolyte disturbances some patients have impaired in cardiac renal and liver functions diagnostic value of x-ray and ct for patients in hunan was lower on account of no significant pathological changes in the lungs of most early covid-19 patients10 most patients presented with fever but hardly accompanied with dyspneamost patients are accompanied by fever instead of the symptoms of dyspnea which is significantly different from the clinical symptoms of patients in wuhan this may be rare related to the second-generation infection of the virus outside wuhan in an early report in wuhan china 2-10 of covid-19 patients developed symptoms of diarrhea such patients are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit icu and there are related studies showing that transmission of sars-cov-2 may be faecal-oral in our study it was found that patients outside hubei may have up to 15 of their first symptoms as diarrhea it is worth mentioning that more patients in hunan suffer from the diarrhea and the stool nucleic acid positive rate is higher all of the above phenomenon may be related to regional differences therefore every doctor needs to be alert to such a phenomenon whether to perform sars-cov-2 nucleic acid detection on diarrhea patients instead of only those patients with flu symptoms such findings have more positive significance for the global prevention and control of covid-19 all covid-19 patients are negative in influenza ab virus nucleic acid and this phenomenon suggesting there may be interference between viruses when two viruses infect the same cell or body the phenomenon that one virus inhibits the replication of another virus is called interference11 and the specific mechanism needs further research due to various factors such as specimen type collection method transportation and performance limitations of the kit the positive rate of rt-pcr screening for new coronary pneumonia is not ideal the total positive rate of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid detection is about 60 which sometimes cannot meet the clinical requirements however the specificity of chest ct diagnosis of covid-19 is only 25 as the disease progresses the specificity of ct will be lower and it is difficult to distinguish covid-19 from general pneumonia the rate of missed diagnosis of nucleic acid detection is high and there are many patients in wuhan at this point ct screening showed its advantages it can help detect patients as soon as possible and then the patients will be isolated and treated as soon as possible it is affordable to combining ct screening and nucleic acid detection because of the fewer patients in hunan and other places during the initial screening process a comprehensive analysis of the patients epidemiological history symptoms and laboratory tests is required if necessary further chest ct or combination with nucleic acid testing is performed the laboratory nucleic acid test is a crucial tool for detecting viral pneumonia anytime if the hunan area hospitals adopt clinical covid-19 diagnosis measures similar to hubei area it will often lead to a higher misdiagnosis rate during the epidemic period the lower lymphocyte count of the test results is more suggestive pharyngeal swabs and stool simultaneous nucleic acid testing are still the first choices for early diagnosis of patients with sars-cov-2 in hunan interestingly we also found that four patients were diagnosed with covid-19 without clinical symptoms all of them have a history of wuhan sojourn or contact with relevant people therefore suspected-infected patients without clinical symptoms still need to be excluded via nucleic acid testing screening of crowd who contacts of confirmed covid-19 patients is currently recommended whats more systematic screening of crowd outside of health care facilities and avoiding cluster activities should be encouraged12 sheng yin and yizhi peng have the same contribution min wang and wenlong wang have the same contribution and are

hafedh ben hassen nadia ayari belgacem hamdi   the world is witnessing the wide spread of the new coronavirus covid-19 as many countries have had thousands of infected cases and deaths due to the epidemic such as italy and spain which recorded the largest number of deaths up to march 2020 people can become infected with covid-19 disease by other people who have the virus as this virus spreads by direct contact it may spread through respiratory droplets when the person coughs or sneezes it may also spread if a person touches a surface on which the virus is present and then touches his mouth nose or eyes 1 this virus poses a major risk especially for the elderly and people with chronic diseases such as high blood pressure heart disease and diabetes 2 as a result of the outbreak of the new coronavirus most hospitals around the world are experiencing problems to tolerate a large number of infected people as this virus has started to spread among the medical and paramedical teams of these hospitals and this can cause a great risk to the health of patients staying in hospitals in addition to the spread of this virus the world is also witnessing a significant increase in the number of elderly people where according to the world aging and health report 2015 of the world health organization the number of people aged 60 and over will increase from 900 million to about 2 billion between 2015 and 2050 this significant increase in the number of elderly people increases patient dependency chronic diseases and disability 3 in addition to the large financial burdens that will be incurred by the economies of the countries concerned as spending on hospital accommodation will increase 4 given this significant increase in the number of elderly people who often suffer from chronic diseases and who often need hospitalization and the rapid spreading of the new coronavirus covid-19 we believe that home hospitalization must be adopted by governments to limit the spread of this virus and maintain the health of patients who require a hospital stay home hospitalization is a smart and pioneering model of health care and is one of the most promising health services that aim to alleviate the suffering of patients especially the elderly by avoiding the trouble of moving to hospital institutions for treatment and allowing them to receive continuous care in the comfort of their homes 5 6 7 8 this hospitalization aims to alleviate the burden of the disease in two ways one of which is medical and human given that receiving treatment in the family environment is of great importance and positively affects the benefit of medicines the second aspect is the economic aspect especially since the cost at hospitals has witnessed a significant increase whereas home hospitalization greatly reduces the cost of health care for the success of the home hospitalization process the patient must adhere to the doctors recommendations and his or her health also must be monitored periodically for medical intervention in case of health turbidity likewise the environmental factors of the hospitalization room must be monitored since these environmental factors can hinder the patients recovery process and also can cause a risk to health among these environmental factors that must be monitored is the temperature whose high or low rise can lead to many risks and significantly for the elderly it can affect the brain heart cardiovascular and respiratory systems and it can also lead to death in some cases 9 humidity also can cause health problems for patients suffering from respiratory diseases such as asthma or allergies 10 not to forget the dangers of smoking to the patient and human health in general as well as gas leaks that have health effects on the eyes and respiratory system and can cause deaths nowadays with the great evolution in the iot area it is expected that many smart objects and devices will have a tremendous ability to gather and share information between them 11 the iot has been relied upon in many applications and its use has seen wide acceptance in almost all fields including the field of health care where it is extensively applied in monitoring patient health remotely 1213 and its different technology provides a solid approach to improving safety health and the wellbeing of humanity 1415 cloud computing in recent years has provided many of the resources that are supported to take advantage of the iot in terms of processing ubiquitous computation and storage and to share these resources in easy and simple ways 16 many cloud and iot-based solutions have been suggested in the literature 1718 which add to the many benefits of cloud computing to support ever-increasing data volumes however moving to the iot cannot be considered a simple application of cloud computing recently a new concept of computing has emerged that is attracting much attention as compared to cloud computing because of its ability to meet requirements that have not yet been addressed through cloud computing it is termed fog computing 19 fog computing extends the computing resources of the cloud to the network edge of the iot allowing many connected devices to offer services such as storing and processing data to their users its structure also provides support for real-time data analysis for all geographically distributed devices with limited capacity for data storage and processing thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged between devices and the cloud 20 this paper aims to contribute to finding new and innovative solutions to develop the healthcare systems in light of the problems experienced by most healthcare institutions during this period like the congestion and the lack of resources as a result of the rapid spreading of the new coronavirus covid-19 through the development of a low-cost reliable and safe home hospitalization system based on important modern technologies that is the iot fog computing and cloud computing this system enables patients to recover and receive treatment in their homes and between their families and avoids them the risk of infection with the new coronavirus especially for elderly people who often suffer from chronic diseases and weak immunity and find it difficult to move to hospitals the main contributions of this paper areproposing a home hospitalization system

 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents related works to the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper a detailed description of the proposed system is presented in section 3 while section 4 explains the implementation and results finally the conclusion and future works are presented in section 5 this paper proposes a home hospitalization system in which patient vital signs and environmental factors of hospitalization rooms are monitored using the iot fog computing and cloud computing this section presents the most important works based on these technologies which offer systems and solutions to monitor patient health and environmental factors in recent years the iot fog computing and cloud computing have been utilized to monitor patient health as described in many research works due to the ability of these technologies to provide quick safe and low-cost solutions 21 22 23 at 24 for example an iot-based smart healthcare system is designed that collects patient information from different sensors and allows a doctor to monitor patient physiological parameters remotely and diagnose diseases quickly and also provides alerts to both the guardian and the doctor by sending sms or emails in a timely manner in refs 25 an e-health system for elderlys health monitoring based on iot and fog computing was proposed where this system periodically collected physiological and public health parameters of the elderly using the mysignals hw v2 platform and an android application that plays the role of fog server and enables the elderly and their families to monitor their health and communicate with health care providers an iot-based application has been proposed that explains the benefits of the concept of fog computing 26 this application aims to provide reliable accurate and immediate heart rate monitoring via embedded wearable devices mobile edge devices and cloud services in recent years the use of smartphones and tablets has increased in health monitoring applications where they are used as mobile computing devices and as fog servers that process data and send it to the cloud 27 28 29 30 a mobile application was used at 31 to monitor the patients heart in real time as an application through the pulse rate sensor which measures the patients pulse and then sends it to storage in a remote database this application also sends notifications to the doctor if a problem is discovered in the heartbeat a mobile application was also used to develop a system for monitoring vital signs at work 32 as for monitoring environmental factors it has been discussed in many studies at 33 for example guidance was provided on how to use technology for environmental monitoring at 34 a complex event processing engine cep was introduced to monitor the environment based on iot that detects anomalies in real-time in ref 35 is offered a smart system for monitoring and internal environmental management based on environmental sensors and cloud computing where this system collects data related to internal gases and then it stores and processes environmental data in the cloud and this system enables users to monitor the environment and receive warnings if air quality exceeds the legal limit through a web-based monitoring platform at 36 an environmental monitoring system for internal thermal comfort has been proposed to explore the thermal comfort of people in indoor environments depending on the iot as we have seen in this section there are many studies done based on the iot fog computing and cloud computing to monitor patient health and monitor environmental factors but we did not find works that merged monitoring patients health and monitoring environmental factors in one system despite the significant impact of environmental factors on patient health also most of these systems rely mainly on the internet to send data to the cloud and when the internet is interrupted these systems become useless and for this we believe that these systems will not be implemented and accepted in most developing countries because these countries do not have a good infrastructure for the internet in all regions in the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper we will merge monitoring the health status of patients and monitoring environmental factors in one system as this system will allow patients to recover in their homes and avoid the difficulties and risks of moving to health institutions the problem of the internet outage will be overcome also by relying on fog computing along with cloud computing in hospitals the environmental factors are often suitable for the hospitalization process but in the home hospitalization process these factors can be outside the limits of ideal values and therefore adversely can affect the hospitalization process and can also represent a risk to the patients health and for this we consider that environmental monitoring of the hospitalization room is necessary for the home hospitalization process as shown in fig 1 the proposed architecture of the hospitalization rooms environmental monitoring is mainly based on the environmental sensing unit and a mobile application installed on a tablet device that plays the role of a fog server the proposed environmental sensing unit is composed of three modules for the detection of environmental factors the modules used are the temperature and humidity detection module dht11 sensor the gas leak detection module mq5 sensor and the smoke detection module mq2 sensor these three detection modules are connected to the nodemcu v3 board which collects the values of environmental factors and then sends them to the fog server via the wifi periodically the temperature and humidity detection module dht 11 returns numerical values and for this it is directly connected to the nodemcu v3 board however the gas leak detection module mq5 sensor and the smoke detection module mq2 sensor return analog values and for that we use an analogdigital converter adc to convert the values of these modules table 1
presents the components of the proposed environmental sensing unit in detail the fog server receives the data sent by the environmental sensing unit and then displays it in real time it also analyzes this data if it is within the limits of ideal values or not if this data is outside the limits of ideal values the fog server sends an alert to all actors in this system in real time otherwise it stores this data locally and processes it and then sends it to the cloud via the internet through the rest api for permanent storage and further processing and analysis in the hospitalization process in hospitals patient health is continuously monitored with a nurse visiting the patient to monitor and record vital signs and compare them with previously captured data the frequency of visits is related to the suggested schedule from the patients doctor electronic instruments are generally used to measure patient vital signs these instruments are generally large and are not easily transmitted vital signs are usually recorded in the form of a graph which doctors often see daily during their visits in the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper the patients health is monitored almost the same way as the patients health is monitored in hospitals where the nurse visits the patient according to the appointment schedule provided by the supervising doctor during these visits the nurse verifies the patients health measures vital signs and prepares a medical report that is sent to the doctor for every visit made the process of measuring patient vital signs is carried out through the sensing unit and a mobile application installed on a tablet that plays the role of fog server as shown in fig 1 the vital signs sensing unit of this system is the mysignals hw v2 platform which is a development platform for medical devices and e-health applications the mysignals hw v2 platform is the most complete on the market as it supports many biomedical sensors to measure biometric parameters such as ecg signals blood pressure blood oxygen pulse respiratory rate and body temperature it is small in size and can be carried easily to the patients home to measure vital signs the mysignals hw v2 platform relies on the atmega 328 arduino uno microcontroller to manage various sensors and also allows tablets and smartphones to communicate with it via built-in wifi and ble modules the process of measuring vital signs is done by the patients wearing the vital signs sensors to be measured then the mobile application installed on the tablet plays the role of fog server and communicates with the mysignals hw v2 platform via wifi to measure these vital signs where it sends a request to the mysignals hw v2 platform to measure the required vital signs mysignals hw v2 measures these vital signs and then sends the measurements to the mobile application the mobile application analyzes these measurements and displays and stores them locally based on the results of the measurements and some oral questions that the nurse asks the patient and his relatives the nurse writes a medical report through the mobile application and then sends the measurements and the report to the cloud for permanent storage and further analysis via rest api through these measurements and medical reports stored in the cloud the supervising doctor can through a mobile application monitor the patients health status and provide recommendations and instructions to the nurse and the patient and his relatives to ensure a good hospitalization process and timely intervention if there is a risk to the patients health cloud hosting represents a radical change of the traditional hosting options such as shared hosting and dedicated hosting where it has many advantages that improve it as compared with traditional hosting 43 cloud hosting has a strong and flexible infrastructure that allows expanding the used resources easily and also ensures the availability of data permanently in addition to providing a high level of protection it is also a low-cost hosting where the cost of hosting is calculated against the amount of use of the cloud resources unlike the traditional hosting whose cost often exceeds the cost of resources used the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper relies on cloud computing to host the rest api and data storage where the microsoft azure cloud platform will be used which is one of the most prominent cloud computing platforms 44 fig 2
shows the cloud computing architecture proposed in this system the microsoft azure cloud platform is a provider of cloud services that include infrastructure as a service iaas platform as a service paas and software as a service saas created by microsoft using its network of data centers that it is constantly expanding all over the world as it provides a variety of cloud computing storage and application services for all types of users from the business sector and institutions it allows the creation of applications and services examination management and dissemination over a huge global network using the unique tools and frameworks it provides security and privacy are also included on the azure platform the microsoft azure cloud platform provides the ability to store data securely with ready access while providing the possibility to increase the storage space at any time depending on the users business activity as in the case of cloud computing services the cost is only based on the space consumed and the total cost is calculated depending on the hours of access and data usage it also provides the possibility to create applications with ease and publish compatible applications globally on all web platforms and mobile phones spread and be able to develop and respond very quickly with the ability to manage web applications and examine and publish them widely with ease for data storage in this proposed system we have relied on azure cosmos db which is a globally distributed and multi-model database service of microsoft that provides flexible storage and fast data access with implementation of wire protocols for common nosql databases including azure tables storage gremlin cassandra and mongodb mongodb was chosen as a data storage system which is a system of databases of the category called nosql or more accurately the non-relational database management system and it utilizes bson binary json files likewise mongodb considers schema-less as it does not adhere to a specific schema so the content of files may vary from time to time mongodb is also considered a scalable system as it can cope with thousands of requests simultaneously without affecting the speed of performance 45 as in mysql which consists of tables mongodb is also composed of collections which in turn contain documents so that the size of the collection depends on the number of documents contained within it we can say that one of the most important differences between mongodb and mysql is that the file structure does not adhere to certain rules as we find that the rows components are the same in one table they must be subject to the schema rules that have been defined as mongodb does not support any scheme and therefore the file structure can change from time to time within the same collection 46 nodejs was chosen to develop the rest api due to its superiority over other web development technologies such as phpnginx in computational performance and its great use in real-time and high-speed applications 4748 nodejs is a free software platform in javascript oriented towards highly competitive event network applications that must be able to scale up it uses the v8 virtual machine the libuv library for its event loop and implements the commonjs specifications under the mit license among the native modules of nodejs there is http which allows the development of http server it is therefore possible to do without web servers such as nginx or apache when deploying websites and web applications developed with nodejs concretely nodejs is a low-level environment for executing server-side javascript nodejs is used in particular as a web server platform it is used by linkedin microsoft yahoo and paypal rest api connects between the proposed systems applications and the database where the applications can store retrieve and manage data through web services using http requests and json data model 49 to develop the rest api will use the expressjs framework which is a helpful web application framework for nodejs released as a free and open-source program designed to build web applications and apis 50 in addition to the mongoose library an object data modeling odm for mongodb and nodejs it is used to manage the relationships between the expressjs framework and the mongodb database 51 monitoring the environmental factors of the hospitalization room is very important in the home hospitalization process given the impact of these factors on the patients health to monitor these environmental factors we have developed an environmental sensing unit based on the nodemcu v3 board that senses environmental factors and an android application that plays the role of the fog server where this application communicates with the nodemcu v3 board and collects the sensed data of the environmental factors and then processes analyzes displays them in real-time and stores them locally and sends the information to the cloud for permanent storage and further analysis fig 3
shows the environmental sensing unit and the home interface of the android application developed to monitor the environmental factors of the hospitalization room the environmental sensing unit senses the temperature and humidity via the dht11 sensor the smoke via the mq2 sensor and the lpg gas via the mq5 sensor the mq2 sensor and mq5 sensor are analog sensors the nodemcu v3 board contains only one analog input pin so we used the mcp3008-ip analog-digital converter to connect these analog sensors to the nodemcu v3 board whereas the dht11 sensor is a digital sensor so we connected it directly to the nodemcu v3 board that has 10 gpio pins which can be used for digital input and output operations to sense these environmental factors and communicate with the android application we have programmed a c script using the arduino ide this script makes the nodemcu v3 board work as an http server using wifi access point mode for making the android application installed on the tablet communicate with the nodemcu v3 board via wifi without having to connect to a router in this script we have developed an ssid name and password are assigned to access the nodemcu v3 board as well as to install its ip address with this ip address the nodemcu v3 board can deliver web pages and web services to all connected devices within its network this script returns the environmental factors that are sensed in json format consumed by the android application where the android application sends http requests to the nodemcu v3 board the nodemcu v3 board senses the environmental factors and then returns the sensed data to the android application in json format this is of course after the tablet device on which the android application is installed has connected to the nodemcu wifi access point by entering the ssid name and password and doing the necessary settings the android application periodically collects environmental factors and displays them in real-time it also stores these environmental factors locally and processes and analyzes them for example if these factors are outside the scope of health factors such as recording a gas leak or sensing smoke in the room or a significant increase or decrease in the degree of humidity or room temperature the android application gives a sound alert and also sends an alert to the relatives of the patient the supervising doctor and the system administrators this alert is a notification sent to each of them arriving via their applications in addition to an sms message that arrives in real time to intervene to save the patient if these factors represent a real risk to patient health the android application also sends the sensed environmental data to the cloud for permanent storage and further analysis and this data is also stored locally for a specified period to be displayed if the application is not able to send the data to the cloud initially our idea was for the nodemcu v3 board was to send the sensed data directly to the cloud via the internet and through mobile applications this data would be accessed but we retreated on this idea because it will increase system cost as we will need a router to connect the nodemcu v3 board to the internet in addition to that in many regions especially in developing countries there is no internet connection and even when present internet speed is often low so that we chose to rely on an android application installed on a tablet device that plays the role of a fog server to collect this data and send it to the cloud via 3g4g even if the android application is unable to send this data to the cloud it stores the data locally and alerts the patient if environmental factors represent a danger to him or her through this application and the patients supervisors are then alerted via sms 
fig 3a shows the android application interfaces dedicated to the settings where the environmental sensing unit id is determined the ideal ranges for environmental factors and the phone numbers of the patients supervisors are also imported fig 3b shows the android application interfaces dedicated to displaying measurements of the hospitalization rooms environmental factors the patients health monitoring in this proposed system is carried out by the nurse who periodically visits the patient according to the schedule set by the supervising doctor to measure vital signs and prepare a medical report that is sent to the doctor on every visit made the process of measuring patient vital signs and writing the medical report is done through an android application installed on a tablet device 
fig 4
illustrates some interfaces of this application where the nurse can after logging in by entering the login and password see the schedule of visits for all the patients to be visited after that the nurse chooses the relevant visit to perform the health monitoring process measuring the patients vital signs and preparing the medical report the nurse can also view the reports of previous visits the recommendations of the supervising doctor and the patient profile the patients vital signs are measured through this android application that plays the role of the fog server and the vital signs sensing unit which is the mysignals hw v2 platform in this system in this system spo2 heart rate body temperature and electrocardiogram ecg are measured this system can be expanded to measure other patient data such as airflow blood pressure blood sugar galvanic skin response and electromyography emg a c script is programmed using the integrated development environment arduino ide to make the mysignals hw v3 platform able to measure these vital signs and send them to the android application via wifi connection 
fig 5
a shows the process of measuring spo2 and heart rate where the sensor is placed on the index finger of the patient and through the android application a request for measuring spo2 and heart rate is sent to the mysignals hw v2 platform this platform measures spo2 and heart rate and then sends the measurements to the android application to store locally before sending to the cloud regarding the patients body temperature measurement the sensor is placed on the index finger or on the part where the temperature is measured and through the android application a request for measuring the body temperature is sent to the mysignals hw v2 platform this platform measures the body temperature and then sends the measurements to the android application to store locally before sending to the cloud as shown in fig 5b as for the electrocardiogram ecg fig 6
shows its measurement process where the sensors are connected to the patients chest and through the android application an ecg measurement request is sent to the mysignals hw v2 platform this platform measures the ecg and visualizes the data in real time on its screen and through the android application is done to evaluate the obtained ecg measurements results after performing the patient vital signs measurement process the nurse prepares and saves the medical report as shown in fig 7
 after saving the medical report this android application deletes this visit from the nurses visit list and encrypts the measurements and the medical report and sends them to the cloud for permanent storage and more analysis through the rest api via the internet if there is no internet connection this data will be stored locally and sent to the cloud automatically at the first internet connection in the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper there are four groups of actors which are the doctors the nurses the patients and their relatives and the system administrators each of them plays a specific role in this system through its android application in the previous subsection we presented the nurses android application that allows them to measure the patients vital signs and prepare the medical reports in this subsection we will present the android applications for the doctors the patients and their relatives and the system administrators react native has been used to develop the various applications of this system it is an open-source mobile application framework created by facebook that is used to develop android and ios applications using reactjs and it allows developers to use all the native functionality of these platforms 52 
fig 8
illustrates some android application interfaces for the doctors where after logging in each doctor can view the profiles of patients and follow the environmental condition of the hospitalization rooms fig 8a and the health status of patients by viewing the measurements and medical report for each patient fig 8b through this android application the doctor also manages each patients medications determining the time to take each type of medicine in addition to providing recommendations to patients and their relatives to ensure a good hospitalization process this android application also provides notifications to the doctors when adding any medical report for one of the patients or when the environmental condition of any hospitalization room poses a risk to the patients health 
fig 9
a shows some android application interfaces for patients and their relatives where the patient or a member of his relatives after logging in can view the list of visits that the nurse will make to the patient to follow his or her health in addition to viewing the list of the patients medications and the time to take each type of them the recommendations of the supervising doctor and the environmental condition of the hospitalization room this android application also provides notifications when the nurses visit is approaching the date of taking the medications is approaching when the supervising doctor sends a recommendation or when the environmental condition of the hospitalization room poses a risk to the patients health 
fig 9b illustrates some android application interfaces for system administrators where this android application enables them to manage the patient and their relatives accounts manage doctors accounts and manage nurses accounts in addition to managing the home hospitalization process the start and end date of each hospitalization process are determined for each patient and scheduling the visits of the nurses to the patients and the management of the environmental sensing units for each hospitalization room are done by adding an id and code pin for each environmental sensing unit and linking it with the patients account and determining the ideal values for each environmental factor this android application also allows for following the environmental factors of each hospitalization room and receiving notifications when the environmental condition of a specific room poses a risk to the patients health the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper represents a paradigm shift for smart healthcare systems this system allows patients to recover and receive treatment in their homes and between their families and avoids for them the difficulties of moving to hospitals and the risk of infection with the new coronavirus which is especially important for the elderly who often suffer from chronic diseases and weak immunity this system also addresses the problems of congestion and lack of resources suffered by most health institutions and hospitals during this period through this system the health of the patients and the environmental condition of the hospitalization rooms are monitored remotely and periodically throughout the hospitalization period which allows doctors to follow the processes of hospitalization and supervise the patients remotely this proposed system is distinguished from other smart health care systems proposed in the literature as it is easy to apply of low cost reliable and safe and it also integrates monitoring the health of patients and the environmental factors of the hospitalization rooms in one system which allows doctors to diagnose the state of their patients furthermore it can be applied in rich and developed countries as in poor and developing countries most of the smart healthcare systems proposed in recent years primarily monitor patients health remotely using sensors and electronic devices connected to the internet that send patients vital signs measurements to doctors in real time at 24 for example a smart iot-based healthcare system is designed to allow measuring viewing and monitoring the patients vitals using a set of sensors this system also sends an alert to the doctor and the patients family whenever the vitals reach or exceeds a certain limit the data recorded in the form of an excel sheet is also collected in google drive for future analysis as it can be viewed through a web application and a mobile application in ref 25 an e-health system was also proposed to monitor the health of the elderly based on iot and fog computing this system allows the collection of physiological and public health parameters for the elderly periodically it uses the mysignals hw v2 platform and an android application that plays the role of fog server and enables the elderly and their families to monitor the health state and communicate with healthcare providers the problem with these two proposed systems is that they are based primarily on the internet and since in many regions especially in developing countries there is no connection to the internet and even if it exists the speed of the internet is low we believe that such systems will not be implemented and accepted in most developing countries they do not have good infrastructure for the internet in all regions due to limited financial capabilities to provide smart sensors to monitor patient health remotely for all patients unlike the developed and rich countries that can overcome these obstacles concerning the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper we believe that it can be easily implemented and accepted in developing countries and developed countries alike due to its solution to the internet infrastructure problem and its low cost in this proposed system we will not need a vital signs sensing device for each patient to monitor its health but we will need one device vital signs sensing unit for each nurse and a mobile application that plays the role of fog server communicating with the vital signs sensing unit through which the nurse measures the vital signs of patients and prepares medical reports at each visit this application solves the internet connection problem wherein case the internet coverage does not reach the patients home this application will store data locally and send it to the cloud at the first internet connection the environmental sensing unit is also distinguished by its low cost as the cost of making its prototype is just a few dollars this unit is installed in the hospitalization room at the start of each home hospitalization process and at the end of the hospitalization process it is used for another patient hospitalization process this of course reduces the cost of this system this unit collects environmental factors data for the hospitalization room and sends it to the cloud via the internet through a mobile application installed on a tablet device that plays the role of fog server the data is stored also locally in this application the patient is alerted if these environmental factors represent a danger to him or her through this application fog server without the need to connect to the internet and all supervisors of the patient are alerted via sms alerts are sent to their mobile applications via the fog server if there is an internet connection for data storage cloud computing platforms provide reliable storage that maintains data security and with low cost this is why we chose the microsoft azure cloud platform for data storage and the hosting of the applications of the proposed system to evaluate the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper we have used the system usability scale sus as this scale provides a fast and reliable tool for measuring ease of use 5354 and allows the evaluation of a variety of services and products including mobile devices mobile applications and websites to detect most usability problems it is acceptable to evaluate with five users as described in ref 55 based on this five hospitalized patients between the ages of 45 and 61 years and five doctors were selected to conduct usability testing to evaluate the proposed home hospitalization system the system model was explained and a demonstration was made of its various applications for both patients and doctors after which they were asked to complete the sus questionnaire the questionnaire is composed of 10 questions to assess system usability where each of the questions is classified based on the amount of agreement from one strongly disagree to five strongly agree as shown in fig 10
a after patients and doctors have finished answering questions the sus scores are calculated as shown in fig 10b 
table 2
displays the values of the sus questionnaires provided by each patient the sus value per patient and the average sus calculated for all patients table 3
shows the values of the sus questionnaires provided by each doctor the sus value per doctor and the average sus calculated for all doctors the evaluation score obtained in the sus evaluation for patients is 910 while for doctors it is 930 according to theory 53 and as shown in fig 10c the usability is excellent because we need to score above 808 to get a degree a which is the higher degree in usability as seen in the evaluation the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper was very well accepted by patients and doctors alike but we believe this system must be improved and some adjustments made for it to be applied to coronavirus patients safely among these changes and improvements the patient was made to measure vital signs by him or herself and video communication was added between patients and doctors however for these changes and improvements we believe that poor and developing countries will not be able to implement the system due to the cost increase and the lack of good internet coverage in all regions in this paper a home hospitalization system based on the iot fog computing and cloud computing have been proposed this system allows patients to recover and receive treatment in their homes and among their families where the patients health and the environmental factors of the hospitalization rooms are monitored periodically through a vital signs sensing unit and environmental sensing units that are installed in the hospitalization rooms and mobile applications developed for this purpose this system also enables doctors patients and their family members to manage and monitor hospitalization operations through their mobile applications the home hospitalization system proposed in this paper is distinguished by its low cost reliability and safety in addition to its ability to solve the problems currently witnessed in hospitals as it can substantially reduce the burden on them this system has received very good acceptance by patients and doctors alike according to the results of the usability evaluation as future work changes will be made to this system to make it more appropriate to the quarantine operations of coronavirus patients as we will develop the patients mobile application to enable them to measure vital signs by themselves and we will add video communication between the patients and their supervising doctors via this application we will develop also a smart bracelet that the coronavirus patients will wear this bracelet measures the patients temperature and pulse in real time and sends them to the cloud for storage and analysis to rescue the patient quickly in case his or her health condition is disturbed this bracelet also sends the coordinates of the patients location via gps to the cloud in real time to interfere if the patient violates the quarantine this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors 
hafedh ben hassen conceptualization methodology software investigation writing - original draft nadia ayari software investigation validation writing - review  editing belgacem hamdi methodology validation project administration writing - review  editing the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  h1n1 is not a chinese virus the racialization of people and viruses in post-sars china katherine mason a   during the early days of the h1n1 pandemic those working on disease control in tianmai along with the local media took pains to emphasize the virus non-chinese genetic genealogy palsson 2007 health education videos and posters featured cartoon pigs and birds combining viral material in north america that then skipped across the ocean to china several informants told me that the apparent increased virulence of the virus among those infected in mexico and the failure of the virus to spread quickly to china could be directly attributed to racial-genetic differences between chinese and mexicans renzhong bu yiyang as well as to the genetic origins and characteristics of the virus itself a microbiologist for example explained to melook at how many cases there are in the us i think its because the virus genes have been found to be of euro-american originsso it is more virulent in people with those genes in the us and mexico and europeit passes more easily between people because they are better adapted to these genes but in china it doesnt pass very easilyits because our genes are different so although it keeps spreading in the us after a few generations here it gets weakthats why all our cases are imported
 said a leader in tianmais influenza control departmentthe virus genes are euro-american genes so its easier for americans to catchit needs to mutate to suit our genes more closely before it can infect chinese people on large scale so after it gradually circulates here and develops chinese genes maybe it will adapt to infect us but right now it is not going to spread quickly you can see that in asian countries it is not spreading i dont think it is adapted to infect asians
 the genetic immunity to h1n1 that chinese in general supposedly enjoyed was contrasted with genetic compatibility between chinese bodies and the sars coronavirus explained one middle-aged infectious disease specialist h1n1 hasnt really spread to asiaits been almost all foreigners sars was the opposite it didnt really get to europe or north america right when i reminded her that there was a major outbreak of sars in toronto she continued right but there it was mostly huaren people of chinese descent right i think it has something to do with race renzhong because in sars it was all asians and few europeans and now its the opposite during the sars outbreak according to most of my interlocutors chinese people who immigrated to toronto 30 years prior to the appearance of sars were still genetically chinese and thus were vulnerable to a virus incubated in china in a way that white canadians were not if not quite as vulnerable as those who had never left china conversely when h1n1 appeared in mexico and then spread to the usa it might travel to tianmai and infect mexican and american expatriates but because of its origins in north america chinese people would at least initially be mostly immune mexicansmembers of a race that most chinese had previously thought little aboutwere during the h1n1 outbreak both grouped with other north americans as euro-american and at the same time singled out as unique one lab biologist upon assigning a euro-american and then a mexican race to the new virus paused to reflect on this classification decision before asking what race are mexicans anyway moxigeren daodi shi shenme renzhong a young epidemiologist from shanghai who was training in tianmai told me that as soon as h1n1 had spread to nearby hong kong and threatened to cross the border into tianmai the mayor of tianmai called her infectious disease team and insisted that they track down all the mexicans living in tianmai and test them for h1n1 regardless of whether they had recently been to mexico their mexicanness automatically made them suspect victims of their inherent compatibility with a mexican-born virus thus for all that global pandemic preparedness rhetoric emphasized the universal vulnerability of humanity to emerging infectious diseases chan 2007 king 2002 lakoff 2008 h1n1 and sars were for chinese public health professionals remarkably discriminating this is one reason why early in the initial h1n1 outbreak my informants displayed great confidence that h1n1 in fact could be both kept out of china and quickly brought under control for them the preferential infection of bodies associated with a virus home region assured that though a virus may leave its originating space the harm it could inflict on foreign spaces would be limited sars spread around the world and it went to toronto but it remained chinese through its genetic makeup and ability to target chinese genes and so when h1n1 came it was this tendency to travel with a racial group that my informants imagined would protect them while discursive connections between infection geography and race have broad historical and global echoes the particular racialization process that i describe here contrasts sharply with present-day epidemiological and immunological understandings of infectious disease these biomedical understandings generally hold that those native to a place where a virus emerges and circulates are less rather than more likely to be infected because long-term exposure allows the body to adapt and learn how to defend itself by repeatedly being exposed to local pathogens natives of a particular place build up partial immunity to those pathogens insofar as genetics may be involved the same principle applies sharing a common geographic ancestry with a pathogen allows for genetic adaptation over time the gene for sickle cell anemia for example which also provides some protection against malaria is thought to be more common in populations that have historically been exposed to malarial parasites exposure to this pathogen over time the story goes selected for a genetic adaptation that protected against malaria infection but had the unfortunate side effect of causing another debilitating disease thus populations labeled as black in the usa are categorized as more at risk for sickle cell anemia than caucasian populations due to an assumed link between blackness and genetic african ancestry see fullwiley 2007 2011 wailoo 2001 as with h1n1 and sars in the case of genetic malaria protection shared geographical origins link an infection to a genetic population through the language of race the difference in the case of the former is that shared geographic ancestry with a pathogen implied adaptive susceptibility to that pathogen rather than protection from a biomedical standpoint then tianmais epidemiologists might seem very confused indeed according to immunological principles h1n1 and sars hadnt circulated nearly long enough to effect a genetic adaptation in any particular human population insofar as general immunological adaptation might occur the longer h1n1 circulated in north america and not in asia the less susceptible those living in north america should become relative to asiansand this should apply to asian americans and white americans alike so how was it that public health professionals with degrees in epidemiology microbiology and genetics all espoused views of infectious disease spread that seemed so contrary to epidemiological teachings one way of understanding this disconnect is to look at it as a sort of epidemiological bilingualism akin to the medical bilingualism common among chinese biomedical practitioners and laypeople scheid 2002 that is my informants subscribed to standard epidemiological explanations of infectious disease spread at the same time that they subscribed to the views described in the previous section as volker scheid 2002 has shown most chinese patients and doctors move fluidly between western and traditional chinese medicine tcm explanations for disease and modern chinese medicine has not only mapped the chinese body onto the western anatomical body but has also mapped western diseases onto the chinese body kuriyama 1999 a similar type of fluid movement between languages and interpretations was evident in my conversations with tianmais public health professionals in the same conversations in which they warned me that i had to exercise more caution than they did when interacting with h1n1 contact cases because as a white american i was more susceptible than they were to catching the virus they would also trot out the latest epidemiological models from who and cdc to show me how the disease was moving from continent to continent the racialization of viruses and people in china fed at least two deep anxieties on the part of many of tianmais public health professionals anxiety about the instability of chinas positioning as a modern developed nation and anxiety about their own unstable place in that nascent chinese modernity the 2003 sars epidemic made clear that an infectious epidemic could threaten chinas goals of becoming modern xiandai and developed fazhantwo tropes that the central chinese government had been heavily promoting since the communist revolution and had explicitly made the cornerstone and raison detre of nearly all of its economic and social reforms since the death of chairman mao in 1976 cf greenhalgh and winckler 2005 solinger 1999 it is difficult to overstate the extent to which these twin goals of development and modernitysupported by a third goal of building a stable wending and harmonious hexie societywere central to chinese politics in the 2000s when i was doing my fieldwork this was not just empty rhetoric espoused by the central government spurred by memories of what they referred to as the chaotic luan and backward luohou mao years the professionals who worked in local public health institutions like other members of chinas newly emergent middle class both publicly and privately articulated fierce commitments to creating a prosperous nation that would adhere to accepted norms of modernity and would not be plagued by the kinds of instability that characterized its past sars threatened all of this on one level it endangered chinas burgeoning modernity on a symbolic level by blaming chinese consumers insufficient grasp of modern norms for the launch and spread of the sars virus scientists both inside and outside of china blamed the zoonotic emergence of the sars virusthat is the virus leap from animals to humanson chinese consumption of civets a raccoon-like mammal sold as a delicacy in some local wet markets in the pearl river delta region kan et al 2005 lau et al 2005 brookes 20055 although scientists later cleared civets of culpabilityfinding that humans infected civets rather than the other way around janies et al 2008a western presumption of chinese culpability in starting the sars epidemic through the production sale and consumption of strange animals that do not belong on modern dinner tables never quite disappeared as mei zhan points out in her 2005 analysis of sars the story of zoonotic animal origin did not blame nature itself for the sars outbreak what went wrong was the chinese peoples uncanny affinity with the nonhuman and the wild zhan 2005 p 37 as charles briggs points out the american media sensationalized this so-called exotic consumption such that visual images powerfully link racialized bodies with descriptions of the disease  featuring images of cooks cutting up animals not found on us plates and customers selecting live seemingly exotic animals for their meal briggs 2005 p 276 in a widely cited article in the new york times published at the height of the epidemic in may 2003 for example keith bradsher and lawrence altman wrote of exotic animals being sold as delicacies in filthy crowded markets in guangdong province civets bradsher and altman said were trapped in the wild for chinese kitchenssetting up an implicit comparison with non-chinese kitchens where such abominations would never enter 2003 p 1 the sale of civets inside crowded chinese cities represented matter deeply out of place as mary douglas would put it 2002 live animals including strange exotic animals not usually consumed by modern urbanites were being sold in some of chinas most modern cities see also wald 2008 and yet the relatively widespread sale and consumption of civets was a product of the same modernity that it seemed to threaten civets are not cheap despite the association of civet consumption with traditionalism markets offering wild animals as culinary fare have proliferated only recently and primarily only in southern china as a result of increasing affluence among largely south chinese consumers peiris et al 2004 p s89 in other words the consumption of civetsand therefore the purported origin of sarswas a paradoxical product of both traditional food choices and of recent modern monetary means to more frequently make those choices beyond this powerful symbolism of a corrupted modernity sars also threatened chinas place as a political and economic powerhouse in the modern world economy racism against chinese-looking people and the restaurants they owned led to losses during the epidemic of up to 60  in new york citys chinatown asiasource 2003 the more significant economic impact was felt in china itself at the height of the epidemic people panicked trade and tourism nearly ground to a halt and both the local and central chinese governments suffered debilitating losses of face under a torrent of international criticism for their early mishandling of the crisis the epidemiological mobility of a virus and its resultant racialization had shut down the productive mobility of chinas economic machine in this way the sars epidemic of 2003 frightened tianmais public health professionals more in its capacity for economic and political destruction than in its biological virulence my informants expressed these fears through the redirection of racial blame to enemies both internal and foreign several public health professionals theorized that foreign forces had exploited the predilection of sars for chinese bodies for evil purposes following popular conspiracy theories that circulated widely during the sars outbreak others told me that sars was actually a biological weapon constructed for the purposes of harming the chinese nation-state via a targeted biological assault on chinese bodies many people dont like china and want to attack us one such informant explained they dont want us to be strong wen-ching sung 2010 notes that a best-selling book published in 2003 entitled the last line of defense suggested that sars was an american invention that was designed to recognize chinese genes zhongguoren jiyin in order to specifically target the chinese race zhongguo renzhong in addition to preferentially killing off chinese some saw the stigma and discrimination against chinese abroad that became associated with sars as further evidence of a racial-biological attack with the intended consequence of holding back the success of biologically chinese people no matter where they lived6 racially specific biological weapons in this imaginary were impressively powerful by casting viral dna as racially specific my informants gave biological weapons the crucial power that has so far at least according to mainstream theories prevented them from being used widely the ability to distinguish between self and enemy within the same space to infect the bad guy and keep the attacker safe a few interlocutors surmised that h1n1 like sars also resulted from a bioterrorist attackbut that this time the attack was directed toward the former aggressor they pointed to the timing of the origins of the disease in mexico with president obamas trip there in april 2009 as evidence that terrorists had perhaps released the virus in a failed attempt to assassinate the president though it was targeted at obamas mixed black and white genes however h1n1s mexican origins ended up making it more deadly to mexican natives they told me h1n1 was a euroamerican virus but also a specifically mexican virus due to its origins in a mexican environment it could have infected obama but it was unsurprising that it infected local mexicans more effectively sars too had a dual genetic identity it was a chinese virus that those both inside and outside of the public health world widely believed was adapted to infect members of the han chinese race but it was also a specifically cantonese virus due to its origins in guangdong provincehome to tens of millions of cantonese a racialized subpopulation of the han a common thread that runs through both biomedical and tcm origin stories of the sars outbreak provided a basis for the diversion of racial blame to the cantonese microbiologists and epidemiologists associated the emergence and spread of the sars virus not just with chinese people as a general category but more specifically with the cultural practices and urban environments associated with southern chinese people especially cantonese-speaking people from guangdong province similarly practitioners of tcm blamed the sars outbreak on the peculiar geography culture and type of body that tcm teachings also associate with southern china both origin stories promoted the view that the region of south china in which sars originated fostered the development and the spread of infectious diseases and both implied that these diseases might preferentially attach to south chinese bodies the resonance between these two origin stories promoted a logic of like-infects-like with the originating continental and regional environments of both virus and carrier being the critical risk factors for infection thus the internal racialization of chinese subpopulations became a key component of the racialization of both chinese and foreign viruses chinese revolutionaries first began promoting the concept of a unified chinese han race as part of their opposition to the qing dynasty which fell in 1911 ending thousands of years of imperial rule the leaders of the revolution considered the qing to be outsiders due to their identity as members of the manchu an ethnic group concentrated in northeastern china anti-manchu revolutionaries promoted han nationalism as a way to define china in opposition to this hated imperial power as well as in opposition to japanese and western colonial powers that vied for control of a weakened chinese state han identity quickly became rooted in the presumption of a shared biological ancestry leibold argues that anti-manchu revolutionaries in the late qing transformed earlier dissidents ideas about a non-manchu han ethnicity into a new hard boundary of blood cast around the unsullied descendants of the yellow emperor qingqing baibai huangdi zhi 2011 p 352 see also dikotter 1992 the problem with a biologically rooted han-based nationalism as some reformers soon realized was that the idea that china belonged only to an immutable han race threatened to alienate minority groups building upon the ideal of an inclusive chinese nationality zhonghua minzu republican era leaders in the 1930s thus declared china to be a republic of five peoples wuzu gonghe han manchu mongolian tibetan and hui chinese muslim mullaney 2011 leibold 2011 supporters of this approach described china as a single nation minzu with both racial zhongzu and ethnic minzu diversity the nationalist gmd and communist ccp parties which were fighting for control of china in the 1930s and 1940s promoted different concepts of chinese racial unity and diversitythe gmd promoting strict monogenic similarity as mullaney puts it 2011 p 54 with the ccp promoting polygenic diversity in 1943 the gmd published a political manifesto chinas destiny in which according to leibold all non-han minorities were recast as lineage branches zongzuzhizu of a single consanguineous zhonghua minzu chinese nationalityrace 2011 p 360 this unified chinese race was in turn the most significant member of an even more inclusive yellow race huangzhong common to all of asia thus han tibetans manchus and others all became racially chinese and asian at the same time while also maintaining some elements of intra-chinese ancestral uniqueness the yellow race was described in opposition to other continentally based races including black hei and white bai when the ccp won control of china in 1949 however internal diversity became the focus of chinese ancestry studies and the language of race blended into the language of nationality minzu sometimes translated as ethnicity seeking to bolster the concept of china as a unified multiethnic nation-state tongyi de duo minzu guojia researchers set to work classifying the nationalities or ethnic groups living within the new republic as mullaney describes however the communists unwittingly stumbled upon a remarkably complex problem if china was home to multiple minzu who were they 2011 p 56 teams of social scientists spent decades trying to answer this question eventually completing a list of 56 officially recognized minzu of these 55 were shaoshu minzu minority nationalities in contrast to a han majority notably the cantonese were categorized as an integral part of the han population and were not considered for minzu status carrico 2012 steve harrell has argued that hanness is like whiteness in the united states it is an unmarked characteristic that can be delineated only in contrast to an ethnic other 2001 p 295 as karin brodkin describes for jews in the usa 1998 cantonese blended into the dominant han population even as they recognized themselves and were recognized by others as both culturally and biologically distinct though the minzu categories quickly took on racial connotations with those claiming han status frequently citing differences in physical features and bio-genetic ancestry as indicative of membership in different minzu groups see sung 2010 researchers at the time did not turn to biology or physiology in categorizing the 56 nationalities instead they drew upon stalins model of the four commonalities common language territory mode of economic production and psychology mullaney 2011 the importance of common territory formed the basis for the establishment of five autonomous regions in the western part of china where single minority groups were concentrated in high proportions tibet tibetan or zang xinjiang uyghur ningxia hui guangxi zhuang and inner mongolia mongol or meng the establishment of the autonomous regions helped to reinforce a spatial and geographical dichotomy of center and peripherythe center being the han symbolically and physically located in chinas major population centers the periphery being the other 55 nationalities symbolically and physically located in the peripheral parts of the nation-state at the same time the naturalization of the 56 number became a means of permanently tying the periphery to the center if tibetans are one of the 56 that make up china that made tibet an inalienable part of a multi-ethnic whole and a greater chinese race litzinger 2000 harrell 2001 mullaney 2011 the minzu categorization process immobilized most racial-ethnic minority groups in china keeping them along with their diseases securely in their proper places sandra hyde for example describes how the hiv virus in china was imagined as residing specifically in certain regions of china considered the periphery and attaching to shaoshu minzu bodies the unique environments of southwestern china combined with the exoticized and sexualized behaviors and dispositions attributed to minority peoples were jointly associated with the emergence and spread of hiv the virus seemed to preferentially infect these not-quite-chinese bodies living in their not-quite-chinese home locales hyde 2007 on the other hand the shaoshu minzu rarely emerged as particularly at-risk populations in tianmai most migrants to tianmai were han and most minorities that did live in tianmai had the ability to pass thus rendering their minority status somewhat invisible see harrell 2001 their minzu identities placed them on the frontier their frontier status assured that they would stay put and when they did not abide by this for the most part shaoshu minzu migrants ceased to be identifiable as minorities at all thus for public health professionals in tianmai the official 55 minority groups were relatively inconsequential to local disease spread or control far more significant were two populations that were officially members of the han majority southern or more specifically cantonese populations and rural-to-urban migrant workers wen-ching sung describes how scientists working on the human genome diversity project in china in addition to documenting genetic differences among minzu groups also reported a clear genetic distinction between southern and northern chinese populations 2010 p 277 see also reardon 2004 leibold 2011 noted that while a group of chinese geneticists now argue that y chromosome and mitochondrial mtdna data have demonstrated a coherent genetic structure of all han chinese this structure still exhibits a distinct pattern of variation among northern and southern han people and gladney 2004 points out that most people in china distinguish physiologically between northern and southern chinese and especially between northerners and cantonese public health professionals hailing from both southern and northern regions frequently spoke of racialized differences in facial features and stature between northern and southern chinese the latter especially the cantonese being described generally as darker shorter and less beautiful than their northern brethren but also more clever congming and historically more mobile gladney points out that these attributes are given racial-genetic significance despite official assertions that the han is racially homogenous 2004 p 433 according to carrico some cantonese have embraced this claim of genetic difference asserting that they have a separate ancestry from ordinary han and even declaring themselves to be an independent race 2012 p 39 these kinds of racialized distinctions between southern and northern chinese also applied to the diseases from which they suffered for example traditional chinese medicine has long linked so-called warm diseases wenbingwhich include acute upper respiratory infections like sarswith southern china and in particular with southern chinese bodies hanson 2011 southern bodies were thought to be constitutionally weak and soft and southern people were described in tcm texts as tending toward indulgence and excessiveness foreigners and those from outside the south chinese region did not become ill with wenbing as easily because their constitutions were not as well adapted to local disease patterns wenbing was a southern chinese disease historian marta hanson details how given this background tcm practitioners explained the emergence of sars in these terms in southern china a warm damp climate keeps the defensive and constructive qi vital energy of the local population at the surface 2010 p 245 but because of a cold snap that occurred in the spring of 2003 the warm constitutions of the southern especially cantonese population was out of step with the unusually cold environment rendering them more susceptible to the entrance of heat-wind refeng which could bring on flu-like symptoms hanson explains according to some tcm physicians this susceptibility was increased by the allegedly sedentary habits and rich diet of guangdongs modern urbanites 2010 p 242 the congruence of southern chinese bodies habits environments and climates together created the disease that became known as sars hansons account resonates with biomedical understandings of sars origins together the two accounts reinforced a racialized narrative of blame that centered around the deficient behavior and bodies of cantonese people who ate strange animals racial distinctions within china were in an international context usually erased by the more easily observable racial distinctions between chinese and non-chinese because foreign media rarely differentiated between chinese bodies in general and cantonese bodies in particular the supposed sins of the cantonese quickly spread to anyone who looked chinese leading to discrimination against chinese and chinese-looking people in the usa and elsewhere kleinman and lee 2006 p 181 however the cantonese-ness of sars was very important to those of my informants who were not themselves cantonese tianmais non-cantonese public health professionals acknowledged that sars was chinese but insisted that it was also cantonese its origins could be found not in ordinary chinese behavior but rather in the practices of a racialized subgroup that they both admired and reviled cantonese consumers more so than most other chinese had enough money to enjoy a middle-class lifestylea valued aspect of developed societies it was how they chose to pursue this lifestyle that did not sit well with normative western concepts of what developed societies should act likenorms that many chinese were trying to attain at the same time in keeping with tcm explanations for sars the decadent practices of cantonese people rendered them more likely to spark spread and suffer from local pestilences kevin carrico notes that instances of scapegoating cantonese hedonism occurred throughout china during the sars epidemic with one commentator referring to the sars outbreak as the revenge of the heavens for the cantonese peoples decadent lifestyles 2012 p 35 because they were weak and indulgent cantonese people both ate civets and fell victim to them unsurprisingly the public health professionals i knew who had cantonese origins tended to ignore or underplay this specificity and instead emphasized the unity of chinese as common victims in keeping with these patterns of blame some of tianmais non-cantonese public health professionals attributed the relative resistance of their entire city to sars to its status as a city of immigrants yimin chengshi though surrounded on all sides by cantonese communities tianmai was not a cantonese city while it had its share of cantonese residents a large majority of the population had migrated to the region from other parts of china according to some of my informants its migrant status helped to keep the city resistant to sars non-cantonese simply were not very susceptible to a cantonese disease thus the leaders of tianmais public health institutions most of whom were not cantonese boasted that tianmai despite being what one leader called the filling in the cookie between guangzhou canton city and hong kong was the only one of the three cities to have had no deaths and only 56 cases during the sars epidemiccompared with at least 1000 cases each in guangzhou and hong kong along with many deaths some of my informants applied the same logic to h1n1 as h1n1 infections began appearing inside tianmai in june 2009 some of the epidemiologists and flu virologists i knew asserted that all of the cases in tianmai were shuruxing bingli or imported cases which they opposed to the community outbreaks that nearby cities were experiencing by that time drawing upon the legacy of sars they told me that tianmais immigrant identity would at least in part protect the city though the h1n1 virus was labeled as north american once it began circulating inside china some still saw it as having a stronger affinity for cantonese bodies than for other chinese bodiesthus explaining why guangzhou had homegrown cases while tianmai did not a few of the northern public health professionals i interviewed vaguely blamed the emergence of h1n1 on the same type of dangerous cantonese predilections that had given birth to sars even while insisting that it was a north american disease for example dr gong a public health professional from shandong province in northern china who headed a small department in one of tianmais disease control institutes told me soon after h1n1 arrived in china this new virus is a result of nature getting angry with us and us not treating animals right having them be too cooped up and we eat too many of themi mean cantonese people eat everythingis that really necessary she went on to emphasize again that h1n1 was spreading within guangzhou and not tianmai here gong picks up on a theme from the sars epidemic in which the overindulgent cantonese consumer launches an epidemic through his unnatural appetites in this case however she extends the logic of cantonese culpability to viruses that everyone agreed cantonese behaviors did not create for gong h1n1 was a north american virus but it still somehow adhered more readily to cantonese people than to other chinese due to a common origin story in the mistreatment of animals and nature gong also used this story to place herselfshe may be living in a cantonese region but she was not cantonese instead like other transplants that migrated to tianmai from the north she carried with her more civilized customs and more sanitary cuisine this time mobility protected rather than exposed in racializing herself through her own mobility gong allowed place to travel through space with her protecting her from infection through a set of northern genes that were perhaps a bit less compatible with the diseases of animals as the case of tianmai shows the hypermobility of bodies things and microbes that has accompanied chinas rapid development and rapid integration into global flows meant that the geographical distinctiveness of racialized groupsas implied by the racial categories of euroamerican and chinese as well as northern and southernwas highly tenuous sars may have arisen in a cantonese region  but cantonese people might live anywhere in china or even anywhere in the worldtransforming geographical spaces that might have once seemed safe from cantonese diseases into places at risk in the epidemiological imaginary mobility was by definition infectious where mobile people moved and stayed they brought the viruses that had attached to them at first their racial compatibility might contain the virus but eventually if they stayed long enough new diseases might take hold and circulate in places they did not originally belong northerners might well begin to suffer from hot winds the cantonese brought sars out of canton their racialization both emerging from their mobility and serving as a tool with which to symbolically hold them in place but it was another mobile subgroup of han that seemed most capable of allowing the 2009 h1n1 virus to take hold inside tianmai and to eventually transform into a chinese virus the citys floating population of rural-to-urban migrant workers of tianmais estimated 20 million population 60 to 80  are considered part of the floating population liudong renkou of rural-to-urban migrant workers who began flooding chinas large cities in the 1990s and 2000s looking for economic opportunity mason 2012 the hukou system of household registration established in the 1950s as a means for the communist government to control the mobility of chinese citizens impeded the floating populations ability to migrate permanently effectively creating a class of illegal internal immigrants within all of chinas major cities violating ones hukou to move to the cities without a proper permit could until very recently  subject a rural migrant to deportation back to the countryside7
 in addition to the floating population tianmai also had a sizable population of permanent middle-class hukou-holding migrants many of whom came from the same parts of china from which the floating population came and many of whom also had rural backgrounds it was this latter group that included most of the public health professionals i knew in tianmai however as migrants themselves who had only recently escaped poverty into the middle class many of those who worked in public health in tianmai felt that their own identities as modern and developed urban citizensstatuses they had obtained through a combination of education skills connections and luckwere frighteningly unstable the large numbers of rural migrants who filled their clinics and crowded into tenement housing seemed chaotic unruly and backwards they represented both that which they had fled and that which they feared they still in a sense were tianmais public health professionals reactively maligned this backward threat as dirty dangerous and backwards see mason 2012 even as floating migrants contributed much of the labor crucial to the chinese development project and were officially included in this projects vision lee 2014 they also were cast as that projects achilles heel the piece capable of bringing the whole structure tumbling down tianmai thus became a site where boundaries between good modern migrants like public health professionals and bad backward migrants like the floating population were widely drawn and carefully guarded mason 2012 infectious change reinventing chinese public health after an epidemic unpublished one of the ways that middle class tianmai citizens like my informants guarded these boundaries was through a process of racialization my own introduction to the racialization of floating migrants came when i was teaching english at a university in guangzhou in 2001 a student who resided in tianmai invited me to tour a china folk culture village zhongguo minsu wenhua cun in her hometown we boarded a bus mostly full of what i only several years later was able to identify as rural migrant workers bound for the city as we approached the city limits two police officers boarded the bus checked my passport and checked everyone elses identification cards two dark-skinned men with short stature carrying battered plastic plaid tote bags were quietly escorted off the bus i was young i was not yet an anthropologist and i did not think about why these men were headed to tianmai what they might plan to do there or why their id cards were scrutinized so thoroughly dong han argues that the racial profiling of han migrant workers that i observed on the bus that day is common to many chinese cities in which poor migrants have become the most visible racial other a stand-in for all that is threatening to the chinese middle class han writes by relying on bodily features to identify subjects of hukou enforcement policing sets up direct links between physical appearance and particular social economic and political status 2010 p 603 as brodkin has argued in the case of the usa the construction of race among immigrant populations goes hand and hand with the construction of class such that differentiating by color or appearance provides a means of justifying the oppression of a working underclass 1998 see also omi and winant 1994 smaller and darker on average than urban chinese due to a history of outdoor labor and poor nutrition and cast as dirty and low quality suzhi di the rural han trying to circulate into and out of chinese cities formed a massive racial underclass that was paradoxically composed of members of the dominant han race see han 2010 solinger 1999 at the china folk culture village however this massive underclass was nowhere to be seen instead all 55 of chinas ethnic minorities were on proud view here as small children pointed excitedly the way they might point at elephants in a zoo young women declaring themselves to be miao yi and hui dressed in colorful traditional costumes danced and played instruments chio 2014 as we watched the spectacle my student leaned over and whispered that all of the performers were likely really han in tianmai there were very few miao yi or hui people to play the parts she explained there were however many millions of han migrants like the ones who were taken off of the bus looking for work the rural-to-urban migrants dressed in minority costumes illustrated how officially recognized racial or ethnic categories often diverged from and at the same time merged with the categories that took on the most significance in practice here two different kinds of racialized others merged into each other the mundane but highly mobile other coming to stand-in for the exotic that never quite managed to leave home the racialized mobility that characterized the floating population seemed to my tianmai informants to be putting their city at risk while good migrants provided resistance to cantonese infections the floating migrants in their failure to become permanent residents or to embody modern citizenship carried susceptibility due to their huge numbers harsh working and living conditions and the inability of government officials to control their mobility cantonese and non-cantonese public health professionals alike saw the members of the floating population as out-of-control viral vectors capable of spreading even foreign diseases to tianmais permanent legal population of middle-class migrants what was most unsettling to some of my informants was that unlike the shaoshu minzu or even the cantonese the true home of the floating migrants was exceptionally difficult to identify because they were a mix of han from all over china the floating populations racialization explicitly did not translate to a coherent genetic or ancestral difference it also did not necessarily translate to a difference in geographical location the floating population was officially rural but it also made up a large proportion of the populations of most major urban centers in china whats more its members often hailed from the same areas of rural china from which my now-middle-class informantsboth cantonese and non-cantoneseonce migrated this was especially the case for older public health professionals almost all of whom had experienced deep rural poverty during their childhood and young adult years and thus shared more with the migrants than they cared to admit thus the racialization of the floating migrants remained incomplete other than the very fact of their continued mobility it was difficult to differentiate between us and them when us and them came from the same places and were thought to share the same genes the low quality lack of education and poor living and working conditions of the floating population made rural-to-urban migrants seem more susceptible to h1n1 than even the cantonese at the same time presumed racial-genetic and ancestral similarities between floating migrants and middle-class migrants to tianmai allowed for the transfer of foreign germs from bad migrants to good the floating population was like an inverted trojan horseother on the outside but on the inside dangerously the same i was told over and over again during this time period that because rural-to-urban migrants were uniquely capable of spreading h1n1 widely inside tianmai containment efforts had to be focused on keeping the virus out of this population said one epidemiologistthe migrants are a really special problem hereeveryone is terrified of them because there is no way to keep track of them no one has any idea where they are and if there is really a pandemic then were in big trouble their wenhua cultural level is low a lot are from the countryside they dont understand basic biological facts and they dont have any responsibility no sense of that at all and so if we come looking for them to check up if we think they have flu theyll just think youre trying to do what and theyll run away to some other place and go find work there
 another epidemiologist in tianmai who himself had grown up in a poor rural village told me if the virus got into that population we would never be able to control it so we have to work hard to keep the disease out of the floating population you know we are still quite backwards emphasis added the floating population represented the backwardness within on two levels the backwardness within a modern china and the backwardness within my informants own modern selves tianmais public health professionals feared that with the arrival of h1n1 both might come to subvert and destabilize chinas modernization project the racialization of humans and viruses in china inscribed relative geographical place onto racialized groups and in the process served to partially immobilize mobile infectious threats most racial others could not infect the han majority because their similarly racialized viruses had never quite left the place that it was imagined made them other in the first place the shared geographical origins of virus and carrier not only provided both with racial identities but also tethered them both to a common racial home through deep biological ties that transcended physical space infectiousness thus became a test of racial purity and vice versa foreign viruses could cross geopolitical borders inside the bodies of mobile others but in the chinese public health imaginary they were least likely to cross into the bodies of those who truly belonged but this immunity of dissimilitude was partial and it was time-limited chinese public health professionals many of them having earned degrees in epidemiology from western institutions knew that viruses spread and that they adapted if they were not careful if they did not take great care to stop carriers of the newest foreign virus from spreading the disease inside chinas borders and from replicating inside the hybrid bodies of those han-who-were-not-quite-han it would only be a matter of time before h1n1 did transform into a chinese virus when h1n1 finally landed in tianmai it arrived in the lungs of two chinese american tourists who had come to china for the first time to visit relatives in a nearby city my informants referred to the girls as american chinese meiguo huaren who had caught the virus by virtue of their americanness and now stood to spread it to tianmai by virtue of their chineseness as mobile bodies with a cantonese heritage that had nevertheless adapted to a foreign virus they were uniquely well-positioned to transform the h1n1 virus from a foreign into a chinese pathogen their bodies serving as figurative and literal bridges between america and china genetically and physiologically han they were geographically and culturally foreign they were raced as chinese and yet their bodies had known only north american terrain and only north american virusesrepresenting a radical divergence of genetics and geography as cantonese who were foreign to china as mobile people twice over they were an especially dangerous form of hybrid faced with the arrival of h1n1 at their doorstep tianmais public health professionals threw themselves into the containment of h1n1 to a degree that few others in china or elsewhere were willing to do all other disease control work ground to a halt young public health workers were sent to the border with hong kong and to the receiving hospital where they lived in dormitories and remained on-call to interview suspect cases all night long contacts of suspect cases were placed in quarantine and workers were assigned to long shifts at these facilities as well even after the virus began spreading inside tianmai public health professionals spent long weekends calling up every person who had crossed the border from hong kong and listed tianmai as their destination just to make sure that he or she wasnt feeling sick all of these measures together created the impression of an overreaction to what in the end the world health organization characterized as a relatively minor pandemic international organizations and foreign governments criticized china for quarantining people unnecessarily and subjecting travelers to unnecessary tests and harassment and yet in the end though h1n1 did eventually spread inside china and though it did infect and kill people from all regions of china it killed fewer people overall and wrought less damage than in many other parts of the world wong 2009 lurie 2009 though chinas modernity was again briefly questioned under a barrage of criticism about the use of nineteenth century quarantining techniques mason 2010 it would seem that perhaps thanks to the efforts of tianmais public health professionals h1n1 never did become a chinese virus this virus is no sars a tianmai epidemiologist explained to me as the pandemic wound down and life began to return to normal it is nothing for us chinese to be afraid of  corona virus covid-19 infodemic and emerging issues through a data lens the case of china jinling hua rajib shaw   coronavirus covid-19 started spreading in december 2019 and was noticed in early january 2020 it started spreading in china in mid- to late-january among the different types of confusion and information challenges we need to recognize that covid-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge 1 as of 24 march 2020 the virus has caused the death of over 16600 people worldwide with more than 380000 people are confirmed as infected by it of which more than 10000 are serious as many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine the impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic socio-psychological issues as well as international relations  were not just fighting an epidemic were fighting an infodemic said who directorgeneral tedros adhanom ghebreyesus at the munich security conference on 15 february 2020 who information network for epidemics epi-win was launched as a new information platform after who declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern pheic the goal was to share customized information with specific target groups 2 finally on 11th march who declared it this as a pandemic  we know that every outbreak will be accompanied by a kind of tsunami of information but also within this information you always have misinformation rumors etc we know that even in the middle ages there was this phenomenon but the difference now with social media is that this phenomenon is amplified it goes faster and further like the viruses that travel with people and go faster and further so it is a new challenge and the challenge is the timing because you need to be faster if you want to fill the voidwhat is at stake during an outbreak is making sure people will do the right thing to control the disease or to mitigate its impact so it is not only information to make sure people are informed it is also making sure people are informed to act appropriately said sylvie briand director of infectious hazards management at whos health emergencies program and architect of whos strategy to counter the infodemic risk this poses the real challenge of mitigating the risk occurring from coronavirus  one of the key issues of the invisible disaster is obtaining correct information in 2011 japan had a triple disaster caused by an earthquake-induced tsunami which caused a nuclear meltdown a that time there was a severe panic in and around japan about the level of radiation which was also an invisible disaster however radiation could be measured whereas the level of penetration of the virus is not measurable therefore providing the right information from a reliable source is the key issue in this type of pandemic keeping this infodemic challenge in mind this paper tries to analyze three months of happenings in china from december 2019 to february 2020 drawing and analyzing data from different chinese websites social media and research institutes the value addition of this paper lies in the fact that original data were collected and analyzed in chinese and from chinese social media although a characteristic information censorship exists in china there were several positive and negative things that happened in the last three months this paper is a narrative of those events and provides an original analysis there are three characteristicsimpacts of the paper 1 this is possibly the first analytical paper which uses firsthand social media and internet data and information from china to describe the time-series narrative in wuhan and china with a focus on key policy decision 2 it also uses original survey raw data to understand the types of media people used to get information and 3 the reliance of different types of online services at different phases of the lockdown of course the paper has its own limitation since due to the evolving nature of the pandemic the paper analyzes the spread in the original hotspot although as of late march 2020 the hotspot has shifted to europe which was wuhan and the hubei province of china however the key findings which are described in section 5 are useful to other parts of the world which is currently suffering the impacts of covid-19 as well as in future pandemic responses the data on coronavirus are changing on daily basis and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected recovered and casualties however based on some initial studies a few characteristics are emerging for this virus it is reported that the case-fatality-rate cfr for coronavirus was 23 initially however the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8 cfr and cfr is 146 for those more than 80 years old 3 this means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population the other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading when dr zhong nan shan made a public announcement of this virus in cctv on the 20th of january the virus had already spread in different provinces in china as well as outside china every day some new countries are added to the list which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions it took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of china the early cases may have been spread from the wuhan seafood market while later cases were spread from person to person the speed of which surprised the health workers in wuhan city and hubei province the epidemic curve shown in 4 as well as presented later in this paper shows that the second to the third week of january was the most crucial time when the spread was very high  there are some similarities and differences among covid-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome 20022003 sars and middle east respiratory syndrome 2012-ongoing mars sars also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in guangdong province china it is said that covid-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets similarly mers was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus likely from bats via dromedary camels in saudi arabia all three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease however sars has a higher cfr of 96 while mars is even higher at a rate of 344 despite much higher cfrs for sars and mers covid-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to coronavirus spread 1 the global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic four major transmission complexes ie china east asia middle east europe are now active while the us is already at a tipping point the analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a 0307 reduction in 2020 global gdp growth the impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1822 instead of the 25 growth envisioned at the start of the year sectors are impacted differently certain sectors eg aviation tourism hospitality see lower demand for a longer duration for others eg consumer goods demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly the report also argues that 24th of february 2020 was a turning point when the cases outside chine exceeded in-china cases for the first time south korea italy iran japan and singapore are the top five countries outside china which have reported a maximum number of cases with iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside china  to focus on the key word information which is crucial for any invisible disaster a series of different types of data were analyzed primary data sources include  1 sina weibos chinese social media hot search list in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours 5 2 corona virus timeline data in china which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like sina tiki-toki caixin baidu tencent and provincial and municipal government data 6789101112131415161718192021 3 csm media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information 2223 and 4 mob-tech research institute data of use of internet during the corona virus spread 2425  four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sourcesatimeline narrative number of affected people and public concern the timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country and important measures taken which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns weibos data 2020 have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic depends on the daily variation over a period of three months from 1 december 2019 to 1 march 2020 24 tiki-tokis data 9 is the chinese government big data platform and provides information on different government measures news policies and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic here coronavirus-related topics sinas data was on 1 the number of affected people confirmed cases recovery and death at both the country level and in hubei province 2 sina weibo data to analyze social media information figure 1ab show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in hubei province and the whole of china which is referred to in a later section figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers any significant policy actions taken and any significant incidence positive or negative reported on social media or a website social mediawebsite information both government official sites as well private sites were used to draw the timeseries narrative word cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media as well as to understand citizens agonybmedia use duringafter coronavirus spread and information types this is mainly derived from the analysis of 23 on february 2021 2020 with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in china to understand the use of media to acquire information related to corona virus the analysis used the data of csm survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretationcpositive impact on certain online industries the data from 24 are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 january 2020 to 6 february 2020 these data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others which is correlated to peoples interest in different topics available online as per the available statistics the earliest case was reported on 1 december 2019 in wuhan and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through december especially in the later part of the month the first case was reported in a paper 26 on 1st of december 2019 the health commission of wuhan municipality reported the first case of coronavirus at the time an unusual disease these were unusual cases which took the local physicians by surprise and it was dr li wen liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in wechat social media on 30th of december 2019  this phase was characterized by a crackdown by local government and detailed investigation huanan seafood market in wuhan city was closed on 1st of january the city government and its health commission investigated the cases in december and called dr li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of december 2019 three teams of experts from beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st december to 4th january 816 january and 1819 january it was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic which had not been reported earlier this was announced on 20th of january by a major and well-known doctor dr zhong nan shan in a cctv online interview  this was a critical period when the disease spread was intensified and a relatively large number of casualties was observed figure 1a shows the number of people affected recovered and dead in china and hubei province and figure 1b shows the new confirmed and recovered cases in china and hubei province at an early part of this phase a few critical and wise decisions were made  22nd january hubei province announced a level ii public emergency 23rd of january wuhan city was closed and all the entries and exits to the city were restricted the decision to construct huoshenshan hospital new hospital for corona virus cases was announced on this day 23rd january followed the decision to construct leishenshan hospital another new hospital decision on 25th january ten hospitals in wuhan city appealed for a supply of medical and other emergency goods from all over the country 24th january hubei province followed the suit and the whole province was closed for entrance and exit hubei beijing shanghai and eight other provinces declared a public emergency 25th january the supreme court provided instruction on fake news and the negative consequences of this tencent which is the parent company of wechat established a website called rumors exposed website as a platform to reduce rumors 26th of january the first emergency supply arrived from sichuan to wuhan along with medical and healthcare staff 28th january president xi xinping met who dg dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus and discussed the situation china media administration instructed all tv channels to reduce entertainment programs and to increase broadcasting information and programs on coronavirus and related news 29th january a countrywide emergency was declared 30th january the emergency committee on the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov under the international health regulations ihr 2005 was reconvened by the world health organization directorgeneral dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus on 30th january geneva time and a public health emergency of international concern pheic was declared 31st january peoples daily the major chinese newspaper official account published fake news on a possible medicine named shuang huang lian a chinese antibiotic of which online orders and users have drastically increased for coronavirus by mistake which caused the panic-buying of the medicine by the public  the next phase was a phase of panic criticism agony and sad news the following events took place that explain this phase 31st january public criticism started on chinese social media regarding the outbreak of the virus 1st february peoples daily corrected their mistake regarding the fake news a major media site caixin data analysis showed that public agony had increased and people were growing worried about the future spread of the virus 2nd february the new hospital was prepared and handed over to the army to take control 3rd february sanitization of public spaces started school entrance examinations were cancelled and another new hospital was ready 46th february this was a time of control where a few major control measures were taken like a lockdown of villages towns and cities earlier this was restricted to urban areas only a new policy of no one will be spared was started this enabled the government to enter peoples house and check for virus symptoms dou ban a major media group was shut down overseas news especially the spread of coronavirus in a cruise ship in japan diamond princess was broadcast in china through different media 7th february the first whistleblower from wuhan dr li passed away and this caused severe public criticism in social media this was followed by a depression phase where several suicides by the infected people were observed to save their respective family members 9th february the center of disease control cdc head gave an online interview with caixin and announced that the virus is a totally new type of which not much is known yet  there were several incidences of sacking senior administration people the china news head was sacked for spreading wrong information 12th february and wuhans mayor was replaced 13th february holidays school as well as offices were extended  the following phase was a time of positive prevention and curative planning several new initiatives were taken through media to address public criticism as well as to lessen public agony 15th february a diary of public life in wuhan was broadcast and shared through social media 18th february a touching story of female nurses cutting their hair to cope with the continuous work with protective suits was broadcast in the mass media as well as on social media dead bodies post-mortem had started to identify the key medical factors and impacts on the body on the 18th of february a unique approach of using a qr code was adopted in wuhan and then spread to other parts of hubei province using mobility and safety of the person in terms of effect of corona virus this qr code was used for public transport entering public areas using big data in mobile phones three color coding were used figure 3 green safe yellow need to be cautious and red cannot enter printed qr codes were used for the people who did not have mobile phones like elderly people or children on 19th of february the no one will be spared policy was ended  20th february a newlywed young doctor passed away which also created negative sentiment in social media the issues of vulnerable people like the aged population 11 of them died in an old peoples home in wuhan along with the caregiver which came out in the news on 20th february physically and mentally challenged people and their caregivers received attention in the media 21st and 22nd february data management and its authentication was re-ensured on jingzhou city and goods distribution was re-investigated to ensure a balanced distribution after a tiktok video which pointed out the imbalance in some areas punitive measures were taken for the two leaders of hubei province for hiding information 22nd february 23rd february the last half of this phase was marked by mixed measures ensuring the free flow of emergency goods and food and punishing those prohibited them 23rd february and the death of two additional health professionals 23rd february 26th february new infection due to the return of overseas chinese people in some selected provinces 28th february the unfortunate incidence of drinking sanitization tablet by mistake by some rural people caused health issues and there was another unfortunate incidence of suicide of a junior high school kid who did not have a mobile phone to undertake online classes provided by schools  as mentioned above an analysis was done by csm media research with 1500 residents all over china on the mobile they use to access different sites figure 4 shows different media usage on four different aspects increased usage after coronavirus spread same use as before less use than before and do not use it for 6 months analysis shows that wechat and tv played a strong role in acquiring information after coronavirus spread the amount of applications has also increased compared to other media usage since it provides real-time information  the survey also pointed out that 44 people sought to proactively secure information followed the news and put in their favorites a total of 33 viewed the information proactively but did not put it into their favorite news items a total of 19 people saw the information if it was in the news or media 2 of people did not bother to take any additional actions for information gathering while another 2 did not want to hear the negative news on coronavirus  figure 5 shows the types of information accessed by different users through online platforms it shows that the maximum access was to get information on medicines followed by a set of other information like fooddrink online education in-house sports business information and entertainment and leisure goods this shows the lifestyle requirements when people were isolated in their home for a long period of time  as seen in figure 5 medicine food supply and online education were the top searched items online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million with an increase of 1060 million in delivery capacity by volume when comparing the data of online food shopping of january 2019 with that of january 2020 a significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years from 279 january 2019 to 451 january 2020 specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old from 72  of january 2019 to 252  in january 2020 the available data show that four major online food supply companies have increased their delivery capacity by a significant percentage they are as follows hema fresh up by 50 compared to before the virus spread miss fresh up by 321 compared to january 2019 dingdong maicai up by 300 from december 2019 and jing dong daojia up by 470 compared to january 2019 all the companies are struggling with a lack of human resources and shared their employees to help each other which delayed delivery in several cases  online education has also seen significant changes on 27 january 2020 the central government education ministry has declared to postpone the start of classes until after the spring vacation there was an instant rise in online education xueersi online internet school after that which saw a drastic increase by twenty-fold from 052 million to 1154 million users within a period of one week 28 january to 6 february 2020  through the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir model and ai 27 found that the epidemic of china should peak by late february showing a gradual decline by the end of april a five-day delay in implementation would have increased the epidemic size in mainland china three-fold lifting the hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in hubei province in mid-march and extend the epidemic to late april a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction who in a recent joint study with chinese colleagues has summarized four specific key lessons as follows 3china has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history although initially quite aggressive gradually a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor its implementationachieving chinas exceptional coverage with adherence to these containment measures has only been possible due to the deep commitment of the chinese people to collective action in the face of this common threat at a community level this is reflected in the remarkable solidarity of provinces and cities in support of the most vulnerable populations and communitieschinas bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemicchina is already and rightfully working to bolster its economy reopen its schools and return to a more normal semblance of its society even as it works to contain the remaining chains of covid-19 transmission from our own analysis it was observed that the success of chinas efforts in controlling the disease was a combination of strong governance strict regulation and spontaneous communitycitizen participation although it was a late response in terms of the local and provincial government at the initial stage once the disease was confirmed as a new one collective responses at the community ward city province and national levels were significant to keep this large a number of people confined in their homes for almost two months was not an easy decision in terms of both economic and socio-psychological aspects chinas mobile network and big data system was able to create the qr code-screening of people which can be considered a significant achievement as mentioned in the earlier part of this paper who dg has termed this virus spread as infodemic having the right information was key to the success of mitigation measures at an early stage the supreme courts directives on fake news were a very good step in this regard to reduce the spread of confusion and panic the rumors exposed website created by tencent the parent company of wechat helped to share information on fake news and rumors effectively whenever there was fake news published or some mismanagement happened with the emergency goods and food supplies quick corrective measures were taken by the authorities at the village level local communities and volunteers worked hard to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures to reduce the spread as well as to report confirmed or suspected cases at an early stage data management was an issue but once the virus was confirmed and declared by the government strict data management measures were put into place in this case strict corrective measures were ensured for the mismanagement of data the current case needs a science based solutions with local action 28 these lessons are also reflected in the who research roadmap 29 where eight specific research issues have been identified with a balance of medical diagnosis and community use it also emphasized social science research in the outbreak response where the who will establish a team that will be integrated within multidisciplinary research and operational platforms and will connect with existing and expanded global networks of social sciences as per 30 governments will not be able to minimize deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and the economic impact of viral spread keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals hence governments must put measures in place to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn in our view covid-19 has developed into a pandemic with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries such as italy iran south korea and japan most countries are likely to have a spread of covid-19 at least in the early stages before any mitigation measures have an impact 30  as we started the paper with two key words humanitarian challenge and infodemic we would like to once again highlight that basic humanitarian principles need to be followed in this type of emergency of course there are geo-political economic and social consequences which also need to be looked at however humanitarian issues need to prevail over other priorities the second point is that coronavirus is a non-measurable disaster unlike other invisible disasters like radioactive emission therefore having correct and timely information is crucial for stopping its spread as well as in the curative prevention of this disease these two factors along with good governance and citizen participation will hold the key to success in combatting coronavirus in future  world health organization declares global emergency a review of the 2019 novel coronavirus covid-19 catrin sohrabi zaid alsafi niamh oneill mehdi khan ahmed kerwan ahmed al-jabir christos iosifidis riaz agha   on 30th january 2020 the who declared the chinese outbreak of covid-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern posing a high risk to countries with vulnerable health systems the emergency committee have stated that the spread of covid-19 may be interrupted by early detection isolation prompt treatment and the implementation of a robust system to trace contacts 5 other strategic objectives include a means of ascertaining clinical severity the extent of transmission and optimising treatment options a key goal is to minimise the economic impact of the virus and to counter misinformation on a global scale 5 in light of this various bodies have committed to making articles pertaining to covid-19 immediately available via open access to support a unified global response 6 efforts aimed at deciphering the pathophysiology of covid-19 have led to the eu mobilising a 10000000 research fund to contribute to more efficient clinical management of patients infected with the virus as well as public health preparedness and response 7 regarding diagnostic testing us-based companies such as co-diagnostics and the novacyts molecular diagnostics division primerdesign have launched covid-2019 testing kits for use in the research setting 89 the united kingdom uk government have also invested 20000000 to help develop a covid-19 vaccine 10 additionally the united states us have suspended all entry of immigrants and non-immigrants having travelled to high-risk zones with the intention of halting further viral spread 11 hong kong has also suspended several public transport services across the border and many hospital workers and civil servants are currently on strike strikers are demanding that the border to mainland china be closed completely to prevent further covid-19 transmission however hong kong authorities have resisted these requests stating that closing the border would go against advice from the who 12 in addition growing fears regarding chinas economy has led the chinese central bank to invest 150 billion to support the stability of the currency market 13 as of 4th march 2020 a total of 16659 tests for covid-19 have been conducted across the uk to date 85 individuals have tested positive resulting in the uk public health risk for viral infection being raised from low to moderate 14 to prevent transmission the uk government are following direct guidelines from the department of health doh for encountering overseas travellers with respiratory infections particularly for those who have travelled to wuhan 15 16 17 the uk national health service nhs have stressed the importance of using personal protective equipment ppe taking a thorough travel history and escalating suspected cases immediately with a view to isolating patients any detected cases of covid-19 should be transferred to an airborne high consequence infectious diseases hcid centre including the two principal centres in england the royal free hospital in london and the newcastle royal victoria infirmary the doh and uk chief medical officers have also advised individuals having visited wuhan and the hubei province in the last 14 days to remain indoors and to call nhs 111 this advice also applies to individuals having visited mainland china thailand japan republic of korea hong kong taiwan singapore malaysia and macau the british foreign and commonwealth office have advised british citizens to avoid all travels to the hubei province and to avoid unnecessary travel to mainland china 18 more recently 200 british citizens were quarantined following an evacuation flight from wuhan on the 30 january 2020 all other flights arriving to the uk from hubei province have since been suspended 19 however in keeping with who recommendations no travel restrictions have been placed on individuals having travelled to china within the last two weeks and are free to enter the uk there are currently few studies that define the pathophysiological characteristics of covid-19 and there is great uncertainty regarding its mechanism of spread current knowledge is largely derived from similar coronaviruses which are transmitted from human-to-human through respiratory fomites 20 typically respiratory viruses are most contagious when a patient is symptomatic however there is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that human-to-human transmission may be occurring during the asymptomatic incubation period of covid-19 which has been estimated to be between 2 and 10 days 20 21 22 as of 3rd march 2020 90870 cases of covid-19 have been confirmed 80304 of which are confined to china of the chinese cases 67217 were confirmed in the hubei province with the remainder being reported in 34 provinces regions and cities in china fig 1
 23 the remaining 10566 cases were identified in 72 countries including japan the us and australia 166 of these cases were fatal the philippines japan korea italy france iran australia thailand and the us it is important to note that these figures are likely to be an underestimate since the data presented depicts laboratory-confirmed diagnoses only various bodies including the who and us centers for disease control and prevention cdc have issued advice on preventing further spread of covid-19 2024 they recommend avoiding travel to high-risk areas contact with individuals who are symptomatic and the consumption of meat from regions with known covid-19 outbreak basic hand hygiene measures are also recommended including frequent hand washing and the use of ppe such as face masks japanese-based company bespoke inc has also launched an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot bebot that provides up-to-date information regarding the coronavirus outbreak preventative measures that can be taken as well as a symptom checker 25 clinical features of covid-19 include dry cough fever diarrhoea vomiting and myalgia individuals with multiple comorbidities are prone to severe infection and may also present with acute kidney injury aki and features of ards 326 the who and cdc have both issued guidance on key clinical and epidemiological findings suggestive of a covid-19 infection table 1
 27 extensive laboratory tests should be requested for patients with suspected infection patients may present with an elevated c-reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate lactate dehydrogenase creatinine and a prolonged prothrombin time 4 full genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis on fluid from bronchoalveolar lavage can confirm covid-2019 infection 29 investigations for other respiratory pathogens should also be performed at present no effective antiviral treatment or vaccine is available for covid-19 however a randomized multicentre controlled clinical trial is currently underway to assess the efficacy and safety of abidole in patients with covid-19 chictr2000029573 first-line treatment for fevers include antipyretic therapy such as paracetamol whilst expectorants such as guaifenesin may be used for a non-productive cough 4 patients with severe acute respiratory infection respiratory distress hypoxaemia or shock require the administration of immediate oxygen therapy this should be at 5 lmin to reach spo2 targets of 90 in non-pregnant adults and children and 9295 in pregnant women 30 31 32 in the absence of shock intravenous fluids should be carefully administered 33 renal replacement therapy rrt should be initiated for patients with an aki renal function and fluid balance should be used to identify patients that may require rrt 4 broad spectrum antibiotic therapy should also be administered within 1 hour of initial assessment for sepsis 34 it is important to note that patients can develop further bacterial and fungal infections during the middle and latter stages of the disease therefore conservative and rational antibiotic regimens must still be followed 35 the national health commission of the peoples republic of china recommends the use of ifn- and lopinavirritonavir this advice is based on prior research showing that these medications lower mortality rates in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 36 oseltamivir a neurominidase inhibitor is currently being used by medical staff in china for suspected infections despite the lack of any conclusive evidence regarding its effectiveness on covid-19 glucocorticoids may also be considered for patients with severe immune reactions in children methylprednisolone should be limited to 12 mgkgday for a maximum of 5 days 435 as of 3rd march 2020 a total of 3112 deaths have been reported worldwide outside of china 166 of these deaths have been reported in the philippines japan korea italy france iran australia thailand and the us 23 however the number of positive cases and deaths continues to rise the current reported mortality for covid-19 is approximately 34 compared with 96 for sars 37 and 344 for middle east respiratory syndrome mers 38 the clinical features of covid-19 versus its distance relative sars are summarised in table 2
 to date covid-19 has been shown to have a mean incubation period of 52 days and a median duration from the onset of symptoms to death of 14 days 2239 which is comparable to that of mers 40 patients 70 years of age have a shorter median duration from the onset of initial symptoms to death of 115 days highlighting the vulnerability of this particular patient cohort the epicentre in wuhan is comprised of an urban area spanning 1528 km2 and exceeds 11 million residents this area was quarantined on 23rd january 2020 subsequent viral spread led to the imposition of a cordon sanitaire restricting movement across hubei province in 16 cities affecting 50 million people 42 all forms of public transportation including long-distance bus routes metros express railways and aviation were uncompromisingly sealed off  a process facilitated by chinas mega city-region infrastructure 43 in addition chinese new year celebrations were subdued amid an unprecedented national lockdown to prevent the amplification of viral spread 44 despite the implementation of restrictions on trade and trading routes representing an effective method of curbing viral spread 45 who recommendations continue to advise against the enforcement of restrictions to travel and trade 46 to halt further viral spread a 1 billion fund from chinas finance ministry was used to facilitate the construction of two new hospitals in under two weeks in wuhan 47 outside of china aviation restrictions are being employed in europe the czech republic greece and italy have recently suspended visa issuance and all air traffic from mainland china 48 us airlines have also suspended flights until early spring 49 local exit screening conducted by healthcare professionals at airports is currently recommended by who 46 and multiple countries australia thailand south korea japan india italy and singapore have initiated temperature and symptom screening protocols 50 several countries uk us and australia are also quarantining citizens having recently been evacuated from wuhan 51 52 53 notably significant concerns are currently focused towards africa which may be least prepared should an outbreak ensue 46 evidently an exponential increase in case count may dampen concerted containment efforts covid-19 is caused by sars-cov-2 a betacoronavirus it is comprised of a single-stranded ribonucleic acid rna structure that belongs to the coronavirinae subfamily part of the coronaviridae family sequence analysis of sars-cov-2 has shown a structure typical to that of other coronaviruses fig 2
 and its genome has been likened to a previously identified coronavirus strain that caused the sars outbreak in 2003 54 structurally the sars coronavirus sars-cov has a well-defined composition comprising 14 binding residues that directly interact with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 of these amino acids 8 have been conserved in sars-cov-2 55 in humans coronaviruses were thought to cause mild respiratory infections until the identification of sars-cov and mers coronavirus mers-cov although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the emergence of sars-cov-2 are unknown due to pending laboratory trials genomic similarities to sars-cov could help to explain the resulting inflammatory response that may lead to the onset of severe pneumonia 55 until these laboratory trials are initiated the precise mechanism of sars-cov-2 remains hypothetical china is integral to nearly every sector of the global economy as the worlds most populous nation china has already battled with viral epidemics including the outbreak of sars in 2003 at the time however chinas gross domestic production was 4 of the global total  it is now 17 57 the recent outbreak of the covid-19 has already challenged an economy strained by trade wars with the us national growth hit a 30-year low in 2019 58 provinces responsible for over 90 of chinese exports have since ordered their factories to stay closed or to run at low capacity 59 moreover chinas position as the worlds largest manufacturer 60 and importer of crude oil 61 has caused economists to nudge down their forecasts for full-year global growth the key difference between covid-19 and sars however is the complexity of supply chains that china is now enmeshed in there exists little historical evidence to provide guidance for the disruption of such supply chains as global reliance on them is a relatively new phenomenon the international response to covid-19 has been more transparent and efficient when compared to the sars outbreak however several learning points should be taken away from covid-19 in the event of future outbreaks table 3
 of particular note it has been suggested that the chinese central government may have issued viral response guidelines 13 days before the public were informed 62 this may have delayed the implementation of containment strategies that could have dampened viral spread such as reporting suspected cases in public and the work place the recent covid-19 outbreak has been deemed a global health emergency internationally the number of confirmed reports has continued to rise and is currently placed at 90870 laboratory-confirmed cases with over 3000 deaths it is perhaps clear that quarantine alone may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid-19 and the global impact of this viral infection is one of heightening concern further research is undoubtedly required to help define the exact mechanism of human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission to facilitate the development of a virus-specific vaccine evidently the pandemic potential of covid-19 demands rigorous surveillance and on-going monitoring to accurately track and potentially predict its future host adaptation evolution transmissibility and pathogenicity these factors will ultimately influence mortality rates and prognosis however the rapidly evolving nature of the covid-2019 epidemic ever changing statistics and constant unravelling of new research findings represents a major limitation to the present review nevertheless as a surgical community it is also our responsibility to be aware of the aforementioned signs and symptoms and to promptly escalate suspected cases not commissioned externally peer-reviewed the data in this review is not sensitive in nature and is accessible in the public domain the data is therefore available and not of a confidential nature no ethical approval required no funding received cs za no conceptualization data curation resources writing original draft editing drafts approval of final article mk ak aa ci ra conceptualization data curation resources writing original draft approval of final article not relevant niamh oneill  corresponding author niamhijspgcom riaz agha  senior author mailriazaghacom no conflicts of interest to declare  human coronaviruses and other respiratory infections in young adults on a university campus prevalence symptoms and shedding brian davis m betsy foxman arnold monto s ralph baric s emily martin t amra uzicanin jeanette rainey j allison aiello e   as demonstrated by the 2012 discovery of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov in saudi arabia1 human coronaviruses continue to emerge and may become significant public health problems merscov followed closely on the 2003 identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov2 both viruses originated from animal reservoirs and cause significant mortality2 3 4 by contrast 4 other human coronaviruses hcovs 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 already circulate globally but generally have low fatality rates5 6 7 8 9 10 these 4 hcovs also are believed to be derived from zoonotic sources including bats nl63 229e dromedary camels 299e or cattle oc43 although the origins of hku1 remain uncertain11 12 13 14

 our current understanding of the epidemiology of hcov229e hcovhku1 hcovnl63 and hcovoc43 outside of clinics is extremely limited the prevalence severity and cooccurrence of hcovs with other respiratory viruses are not yet established4 data are primarily from outbreak reports case studies and clinical studies focusing predominantly on children5 6 8 15 18 here we begin to address this gap by estimating the prevalence shedding duration symptom progression and codetection with other respiratory viruses of hcov229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 among a cohort of collegeaged students once an ari case was identified through our online screening survey an email was automatically sent out to the individuals network contacts inviting presumed healthy social contacts to provide a specimen the social network was identified through a list of contacts that each enrollee generated over the course of the study social contacts were eligible if i they had recent facetoface contact within the previous calendar week with an ari participant and ii were not an ari participant during the previous 2 weeks social contacts that elected to provide specimens were scheduled for up to 3 specimen collections although healthy social contacts were not experiencing ari when they were asked to provide a specimen some of the social contacts reported symptoms of illness such as cough or sneezing at the time of specimen collection changes in symptoms among social contacts were calculated as the time from the first specimen collection to illness onset any social contact symptomatic on any one or more of the specimen collection days was defined as a social contact with symptoms any social contact remaining healthy on specimen collection days 0 3 and 6 was defined as an asymptomatic social contact the university of michigans institutional review board irb hum00054432 approved the study protocol and the centers for disease control and preventions human subjects research office reviewed and approved deferral to the university of michigans irb all participants providing specimens reported information on 13 acute symptoms abdominal pain body aches chills cough diarrhea earache feverishness headache nasal congestion runny nose sneezing sore throat and vomiting symptoms were collected using a standardized questionnaire administered by trained staff during the sample collection visit and severity was reported as follows not present mild moderate or severe

 if a social contact reported symptoms consistent with our ari definition either through the online screening survey or during specimen collection they were considered an ari participant and their next scheduled specimen was considered a day 0 ari specimen the collection of any combination of day 0 day 3 and day 6 specimens for any participant was defined as a set of specimens trained staff collected specimens at each participants residence swabs were taken from 2 locations the anterior nares and along the uvula both specimens were placed in copan universal transport media copan murrieta california and then stored at 70c prior to testing all specimens were tested for 13 respiratory viruses coronaviruses 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 adenovirus human metapneumovirus hmpv influenza a and b parainfluenza 1 2 and 3 rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus rsv for all viruses except influenza ab aliquots from the throat and nasal swab were combined prior to testing influenza ab testing was performed separately on throat and nasal swabs and participants were considered positive for influenza if either swab tested positive the number of specimens collected per episode ranged from 1 to 3 per set for each illness episode participants and each of their social contacts received an incentive of 15 for their first specimen 20 for their second and 25 for their third specimen within a collection period tests for all respiratory viruses were performed in the laboratory using realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rtpcr primers and probes were developed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and obtained from the division of viral disease gastroenteritis and respiratory viruses and the influenza division additional information about the rtpcr process and rnadna extraction can be found elsewhere24 we assessed the type and number of viral pathogens in each of the day 0 3 and 6 specimens a participant was considered positive for a particular virus or viruses if at least one of the 3 specimens within an illness episode had a positive rtpcr result we used fishers exact tests and t tests to compare demographic differences between study participants providing and not providing specimens as well as the virus prevalence between 3 groups i ari participants ii social contacts with symptoms and iii healthy social contacts symptoms were analyzed as present or absent except for cough which as a required symptom for the ari case definition was defined as absentmild compared to moderatesevere to assess changes in symptoms over time we compared the proportion of participants who reported each symptom on day 0 3 and 6 for each illness episode testing for trends by virus with the cochranarmitage test we assessed the change in illness symptoms over the 6day period separately for ari participants with a defined symptomonset date and social contacts with symptoms with no defined symptomonset date due to sample size constraints the 4 human coronaviruses were combined for symptom analysis all statistical analyses were calculated using sas 101 cary nc just over half 127250 508 of the specimen sets were from ari participants 78 312

asymptomatic social contacts p  001 the most common virus identified was hcovnl63 100 25250 followed by rhinovirus 76 19250 influenza a 64 16250 and rsv 32 8250 influenza a was the only virus that appeared statistically significantly more frequent in ari cases than social contacts with symptoms or asymptomatic social contacts ari participants 102 vs social contact with symptoms 26 p  05 though not between ari participants and asymptomatic social contacts 22 p  12 no specimens tested positive for parainfluenza 2 table 2 the overall prevalence of codetection ie detection of 1 virus per

occurred most frequently as a codetected agent 8 of 12 specimens 667 while hcovnl63 was present in 50 of the codetected specimens 612 the viral positive counts in any one group were too small to draw conclusions about the statistical associations between codetection and clinical symptoms among ari participants the prevalence of all viruses detected decreased from time of symptom onset to followup influenza a 169 was the most frequently detected virus on the day of illness onset followed by hcovnl63 153 human coronavirus nl63 was the most frequent virus detected 6 days following illness onset 89 followed by rhinovirus 67 parainfluenza viruses 1 and 2 were not detected in any specimens collected from ari participants table 4 of the 127 participants with ari 56 provided a specimen on day 0

figure 2b among ari participants with rhinovirus and multiple specimens n  9 nasal congestion was present in all participants at all 3 collection times runny nose was the second most common symptom decreasing over the illness period from 100 on day 0 to 714 6 days after symptom onset there were no significant changes in the prevalence of symptoms over time among ari participants with rhinovirus figure 2c symptoms among social contacts were compared at day 0 3 and 6 for hcov n  9 participants as this was the most prevalent type of virus identified in this group moderatesevere cough nasal congestion and sore throat were the most frequent symptoms on day 0 and day 3 of specimen collection six days after the initial specimen collection nasal congestion 375 38 was the most common symptom followed by sore throat 25 28 among hcovpositive social contacts with symptoms there were no symptoms with significant changes in the prevalence over time among hcovpositive social contacts with symptoms figure 3a there are few prospective nonclinicbased studies describing the epidemiology of human coronaviruses 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 and the changes in symptoms over time among the otherwise healthy young adults with ari symptoms and a sample of their social contacts participating in this study during a single season winter season the prevalence of the 4 hcovs combined was 197 among specimens from participants with ari 141 among social contacts with symptoms and 67 among asymptomatic social contacts codetection of viruses was found in 12 specimens collected during the study period including one triple codetection with hcovhku1 influenza a and rhinovirus influenza a was the most commonly detected virus among specimens collected from ari participants while hcovnl63 was the most frequent virus detected 6 days following illness onset we found that moderatesevere cough chills and headache decreased in frequency over the 6day period among students with hcov infections while runny nose increased in frequency over the 6day period no similar frequency trends were observed among symptomatic social contacts with hcov while statistically significant differences were observed between patients providing specimens and participants not providing specimens in age and parental education the significantly higher portion of patients not providing specimens with a seasonal influenza vaccination status is likely of concern for interpretation the differences potentially suggest that receiving a vaccination decreased the likelihood of providing a specimen during our study an area to note for future studies with a voluntary specimen collection component our prevalence estimates are higher than estimates for a previously conducted study examining these 4 hcovs in adult and asymptomatic populations potentially due to the close contact within the residence halls in addition our focus on ari participants and their social contacts did not include individuals living in residence halls that did not have contact with an ari participant as such our reported prevalence estimates among social contacts of ari cases only are likely higher than they would be among a similar population without known ari contact in that retrospective study conducted over 9 years in so paulo brazil the prevalence of hcovs tested by rtpcr was 8 among 50 adults living in the community with influenzalike illness25 an additional 50 asymptomatic adults were tested and no positive hcov specimens were detected by contrast we found that 67 of our asymptomatic contacts were positive for hcovs a household study that used similar rtpcr methods conducted over the same period as our study in southeast michigan found a prevalence of 16 of hcovs among individuals with ari but they did not examine the prevalence among nonari contacts24
 the high prevalence of hcov compared to the 12 other viruses in our testing panel could be attributed to the timing of our study human coronaviruses are most frequently found during december through may and longterm cohort studies suggest a cyclical pattern in the presence of the 4 hcovs over multiple years26 however without multiyear data we are unable to determine whether the high prevalence of the hcovs found was due to the cyclical nature of the virus or a result of testing ill individuals in close quarters unpublished data from a pilot study conducted among an independent sample of 574 students followed from february to april 2011 resulted in few patients with ari providing specimens 25 but we found a similar prevalence for hcovs 16 425 in a similar young adult population unpublished data available from corresponding author upon request further longterm annual studies of hcovs in this community are needed to determine whether there is a seasonal effect or whether there is consistently higher prevalence among young adults in the university setting a total of 48 12250 of specimens were positive with more than one virus and coronaviruses were found in 44 of the detected codetection due to the small sample size we were unable to assess which characteristics contributed to codetection including the one individual with 3 detected viruses other clinicbased studies predominantly among children have reported the occurrence of codetected viruses6 8 27 28 however studies outside of the clinical setting are rare a study of healthy preschoolaged children in australia reported twice the prevalence of codetection 56 but their sample size was smaller n  18 and young children tend to have higher rates of respiratory illness than young adults29 these studies suggest that viral codetection is frequent in children in contrast to these studies our study designed allowed for multiple samples taken from the same participant potentially increasing the likelihood that we would find individuals positive for multiple viruses overall coviral infection appears to be less commons among university students compared to younger age individuals more research is needed on adults to determine risk factors for coinfections among relatively healthy individuals with developed immune systems human coronavirusnl63 and rhinovirus had the highest proportion of specimens positive after illness onset a study examining the viral load of hcov in children in a daycare setting found an average shedding duration of 64 days with a range of 28101 days30 while a previous rhinovirus challenge study reported patients shedding for at least 4 days suggesting our findings are not unusual31 however unlike challenge studies we were unable to definitely determine the date of infection or adequately sample among patients without symptoms as such the interpretation of symptoms over time and detection of virus over time are different for this communitybased study rather than a controlled setting these findings could influence infection control practices in schools as well as elsewhere in the community however unlike challenge studies we were unable to definitely determine the precise date of infection or sample every participant without symptoms as such the interpretation of symptoms over time and detection of virus over time are different for this communitybased study rather than a controlled setting our findings of persistently high prevalence of runny nose over the 6day period in ari cases with hcov corresponds with common symptoms found in historical challenge studies of these viruses26 however we were unable to find any other studies presenting a change in symptoms observed over time for the 4 globally circulating hcovs outside of human challenge trials the statistically significant decrease in cough chills and headache and increase in runny nose over the 6day period for the hcov observed in our study suggest that symptoms change significantly over the course of natural infection making it difficult to delineate between viral etiologies associated with common ari the similarity of our findings with those of another study conducted in the region during the same season24 suggests that university students were under similar regional viral pressure due to the low level of severe illness screening for these viruses in a university setting does not seem necessary however it does seem likely that increased testing in the university setting even among those with mild symptoms would result in a high number of viruses detected future studies would help to confirm the results of this study over multiple seasons to assess longterm trends that were not observed during the current study conducted over a single season because we used a chain referral methodology for enrollment our study population was not randomly recruited it is unlikely that this would bias the estimates of viral prevalence among those with ari however it is possible that the estimates for viral prevalence from healthy contacts may be elevated compared to the prevalence found in the general population additionally prevalence estimates include samples that were taken at up to 3 time points within the first 6 days of illness providing a greater opportunity to identify viruspositive samples compared to other study designs further our testing for viruses was not exhaustive the 13 viruses included were selected for their frequency of appearance as upper respiratory viruses in the population as well as their clinical importance however additional respiratory viruses may have been present as a result the number of codetected viruses identified in this study is likely underestimated finally seasonality may have influenced our findings by recruiting and testing patients januaryapril of 2012 we were more likely to see respiratory viruses compared to other circulating viruses32
 human coronaviruses are common even among those without respiratory symptoms and specific symptoms may change over the course of an illness that can mirror symptoms ranging from influenza to rhinovirus larger studies in the community setting are needed to better understand the epidemiological and clinical significance of codetection these studies may help to uncover important transmission

local residents of wuhan or had lived in wuhan within 14 days before the onset 8 cases were from hubei area outside wuhan 14 had a history of direct contact with personnel from hubei and another 6 cases did not have a clear epidemiological history the proportion of severe cases of patients directly from wuhan was lower than that of non-severe cases p0028 but the proportion of severe cases of patients who had no clear epidemiological history was higher p0023 this coincides with the possibility of multiple origins of the new coronavirus clinical symptoms found in these covid-19 patients were fever shortness of breath cough diarrhea loss of appetite hemoptysis fatigue nasal congestion runny nose chest tightness and sputum hemoptysis was a distinctive symptoms of severe patients 269 vs

creatine kinase urea nitrogen was low  30 table2 in these patients the abnormal of glutamic oxalacetic transaminase lactic dehydrogenase and creatine kinase mb tend to occur in severe covid-19 patients p005 table2 for the above indicators with significant differences in covid-19 we are more concerned about their changes in the course of disease especially for the prediction of severe disease lymphocyte count crp d-dimer bnp albumin and potassium were abnormal throughout most of the course of the severe covid-19 patients  figure 1  it suggested that abnormalities in these indicators can early predict the progression of the severe disease lymphocyte and crp recovery were slow in severe patients  figure 1  so it must be attention to the balance between early immune response and lateral inflammatory reaction especially during the first 2 weeks of the course of the disease the level of d-dimer and bnp gradually increased during the first week of the course of the disease and reached the peak at day 8-9 of the course of the disease and then slowly decreased which suggested that the risk of secondary thrombosis and myocardial injury should be paid attention to during the peak period the recovery of hypoalbuminemia was still slow in the case of continuous supplementation 20g-40g albumin per day lasting the whole course of severe patients which also suggested that the consumption and loss of albumin may persist hypokalemia was also more obvious in severe patients but it can be basically maintained in the normal range after active potassium supplementationthe overall course of the disease in severe patients lasted about three weeks before most indicators return to normal levels figure 1  as shown in table3covid-19 patients were

oxygenation index   viral contagion and anti-terrorism notes on medical emergency legality and diplomacy w  the dominant imagery in current international relations seems to betray the emergence of an imperialist imaginary that differs markedly from an earlier one this paper traces the main outlines of this emerging imaginary that has left notions of empire as spheres of integrative production firmly behind and is now geared towards imagining empire as a complete organic body of free-but-organicand-therefore-orderly flows that however needs to be kept intact by means of epidemiological interventions aimed at excluding or neutralizing viral entities dealing with terrorism or invading states that allegedly breed them in this imaginary is first and foremost a matter of medical necessity and urgency the legal and diplomatic logic of un resolutions resolution 1441 for example in this imaginary space can only be imagined as being of secondary importance cooperation and cosmopolitan negotiation as alternatives disappear in this imaginary that projects an imperialist globalism of epidemiological purity we need a new metaphor and though i generally do not like medical metaphors to describe conflict the image of a virus comes to mind because of its ability to enter unperceived flow with a system and harm it from within jean paul lederach shortly after 911 1  shortly after the end of the war in or on iraq the british prime minister was invited to address the us congress at which occasion he would also be given the congressional gold medal a few seconds into his address delivered on july 17 2003 blair stresses how in the past five decades or so nations have grown ever closer because of technology communication trade and travel he continues with a few lines that are worth quoting here in full we are bound together as never before this coming together provides us with unprecedented opportunity but also makes us uniquely vulnerable the threat comes because in another part of the globe there is shadow and darkness where not all the world is free where many millions suffer under brutal dictatorship where a third of our planet lives in poverty beyond anything even the poorest in our societies can imagine and where a fanatical strain of religious extremism has arisen that is a mutation of the true and peaceful faith of islam and because in the combination of these afflictions a new and deadly virus has emerged the virus is terrorism whose intent to inflict destruction is unconstrained by human feeling    2  in this essay we hope to be able to demonstrate how the imagery in this quotation is indicative of a newly emerging imaginary of empire empire here appears as the body of freedom-loving nations bound together whose health always vulnerable is threatened by afflictions and strains of viruses that are unconstrained and because of their being devoid of any human feeling and because of their status as unconstrained viruses firmly belong outside this benign empire ie outside the body of real humanity that in recent years had been growing together it is worthwhile to note here that this healthy body of empire is one that combines both the freedom of flows and the order of an assemblage bound together this empire is basically one of assembled technologies -technology communication trade and travel says blair -where freedom flows orderly the gaps in-between these assembled technologies is where disorderly viral fanaticism can and will slip within we will get back to the prime ministers speech later it may suffice for our purposes here to underline the importance of this newly emerging imaginary its particular medical imagery seems to betray a new vision of empire ie one that on the one hand is moving beyond notions of empire as productive achievement and one that on the other hand is gradually abandoning both legality and diplomacy as the main tools of empire-building although this particular medical imaginary in our view already began to crystallise during the early 1990s ie shortly after the fall of the berlin wall and with it the cold war it could be argued that in the aftermath of september 11 and in the months prior to the latest iraq war events catalysed this medical imaginary and refined it by the time of blairs congressional address it emerged fully fledged we will attempt to reconstruct this process of catalysis and refinement but before we do that we need to explore some imaginaries of empire old and new empire used to be considered as productive process empire was something to be achieved to be accomplished it was a goal and as such it was strived for empire was not just there it was not given it had to be made it had to be produced and it had in turn to be made productive forces had to be marshalled populations had to be subdued and mobilised crops had to be cultivated peoples had to be disciplined and civilised landscapes had to be changed goods had to be transported networks and dependencies had to be established and ultimately something like imperial integration or better inclusion had to be accomplished they had to be part of us and sometimes this accomplishment of empire seemed to have implied that they must be like us or with us or under us referring to victorian writers such as ruskin and lord macaulay this is how ian baucom recently read the british empire a factory for the production of english identity 3 let us be clear and not overstate our case here and let us at least qualify this claim empire it should be stressed was simultaneously and inevitably also exclusive it aimed at best at disciplinary normalization of subdued populations that sometimes went under the heading of civilization and at worst at sheer repression even genocide if they would not be part of us if they would refuse to be like us or be disciplined to be with us or under us then the options of repression and destruction were opened up but this is not the issue of this paper the issue here is to realise how empire used to be imagined and practiced first and foremost as something that had to be made that had to be produced as something that had to be assembled out of fragments incoherence and disunity empire had to be produced so unnatural an enterprise this empire in the words of rudyard kipling the colonialist par excellence was literally the white mans burden 4 and all this required tremendous productive effort 5 as well as discipline one could hope that at the end of this productive effort empire would emerge if ever it did emerge the production of empire did seem to be a never-ending process of construction mobilisation inclusion discipline and integration however repressive it may at times have been empire never seemed to be fully accomplished it required constant and unrelenting productive attention in this empire theres no room for complacency as a factory empire seemed to be an ongoing productive process its decline threatened every minute of the day from within as well as from without outside was the location of other empires this 19th century notion of empire as an unrelenting process of productive inclusion or integration of some sort coincided with the consolidation of european nation-states and the emergence of nationalism nation-states too were not given they too had to be built they had to be produced they had to be fashioned out of fragments incoherence and disunity they too were the result of productive inclusion and discipline they too were the result of tremendous effort of particular arrangements that kept populations and landscapes together they too were the result of factories and of labour they too had to be made productive in turn however in both cases ie the production of nation-states on the one hand and the production of empire on the other legality and diplomacy were crucial law and diplomacy were important technologies however repressive at times by which nation-states as well as empires were held together or indeed by which they were produced or maintained and by which they were made to be productive this imaginary -ie empire is the result of a productive process of inclusion -has since about the fall of the berlin wall been replaced by another this new imaginary we hope to be able to demonstrate below unfolded gradually throughout the 1990s at first notions such as production productivity and inclusion gradually disappeared from the imaginary of empire later after the events of september 11 and the latest iraq war a newly emerged imaginary of empire ie empire as an exclusive given was medicalised let us reconstruct this first phase here the second phase ie the phase of medicalisation will be dealt with in the next section empire does not have to be produced or maintained anymore it is accomplished its just there today empire is a given nothing needs to be included anymore empire is global universal complete and is as such immutable 6 it may as hardt and negri recently argued 7 be a multicentric empire driven and fuelled by what they call the multitude of desires and hopes it may not have a clear and obvious centre anymore but it is hardt and negri argue global and complete and it seems to have reached a point of no return indeed prior to september 11 it looked as if the global and globalizing multitude and their multicentric controls ie empire in hardts and negris view at least were there or here to stay such an empire does not need to be produced or maintained it produces and maintains itself it doesnt have to be made productive its productivity is determined by this multitude of desires and controls there is no imperial centre that arranges for particular inclusions or that works towards integration there is a multitude of desires and controls that interact with each other or resist each other this empire is complete now this is how two radicals have imagined empire in the 1990s one does not have to agree with them of course according to peter fitzpatrick for example although this new imperialism assumed something like a complete givenness something like the naturalism or the implanted truth and the inevitability of the neo-liberal order while it assures itself that it has encompassed its own limit achieved completeness and marked the end of history it also retained and continues to retain severely disciplinary features such as structural adjustment plans and other contractual devices whereby states are forced to collaborate towards their own disciplined subordination to global capital fitzpatrick also amply demonstrates how the new imperialism of the 1990s tended to be imagined as that particularly western but highly pretentious universalism that hides under words like human rights and this entailed massive exclusion as of course those who do not behave in accordance with or aspire to human rights must not be human 8 one might however agree with the claim that the imaginary of empire after the fall of the berlin wall say roughly from president bush srs new world order onwards has arguably undergone marked changes empire seems to have lost much of its productive and inclusive connotations however repressive at times such production and inclusion may have been if anything todays imagined empire seems to be in need of exclusions in the imaginary of bush srs new world order for example there was no room for rogue states those should be kept at bay or neutralised or embargoed or just contained this imaginary empire ie an almost natural given of free-flowing forces and desires freeflowing but orderly new-world-orderly that is only needs to reproduce itself by excluding rogue states rogue-but-unfree that is or at least by keeping them in check this is its imaginary legality this is what its imaginary diplomacy is about the exclusion or at least the policing with the us as the worlds policeman of rogue elements from a given state -a given empire -of natural freedom and natural order this shift in the imaginary of empire again coincided with a similar shift that could be detected in the imaginary of the nationstate in an age when as habermas once noted 9 life and governance are marked by an exhaustion of utopian energies the project of the nation-state or any project for that matter habermas himself wrote about the welfare state in particular tends to be imagined and practiced much more as a negative complex of exclusions rather than a focused positive indeed utopian project of inclusion or in a somewhat different vein and borrowing from deleuze discipline gradually made way for control 10 during the past few decades the legality of national projects often expressed itself in images such as fight and enemy or stranger and risk the fight against crime for example or the stranger at the border or the prevention and containment of risk all did begin to weigh heavily upon the imaginary of nation however in both cases ie empire as well as the nation-state legality and diplomacy remained fully part of their respective imaginary space policing rogue states fighting crime and criminals and keeping strangers out did remain a matter of legality 8 see note 5 at 208-216 this emerging imaginary of empire ie empire as a natural selfsufficient complete given of orderly freedom and exclusion of rogue elements we will argue got medicalised and this medicalization also catalysed the imaginary of empire towards a higher level of coherence now this medicalization of the imaginary of empire one could argue was already on its way before september 11 11 indeed the first gulf war 1990 1991  the first test of bush srs new world order if you wish already saw imagery like surgical strikes surge to the surface the then us government administration may have regarded themselves as the worlds policeman operating within the bounds of legality and diplomacy however repressive at times they nevertheless saw no problem in using the scalpel when cutting out rogue elements with surgical precision we shall demonstrate how this embryonic medicalization further evolved passing an oncological stage and ending in a final epidemiological one again this trend of medicalisation could also be seen on an intra-national level where as nikolas rose has shown crime control in todays biological culture seems to adopt genetically informed risk prevention strategies that aim to identify treat and control individuals predisposed to impulsive or aggressive conduct and that should be implemented against and this is important those whose conduct seems to show wanton disregard for the moral constraints on the conduct of free individuals in a liberal society 12 before we explore the medicalised imaginary of empire in more detail below let us just emphasise here how in this imaginary particularly in the oncological and epidemiological stages see below empire appears as a full self-sufficient given as a naturally given body as a naturally ordered body of freedom-cum-constraint whose undoubted health should be maintained in and through the exclusion of anything -indeed anything inhuman -that does not belong there at this point preoccupations with legality and diplomacy give way to a different logic of empire to 11 one could add here that medical imagery as such eg the use of words such as health to describe the state of the nation has 19th century origins as many criminologists know louis pasteurs work in bacteriology made sure that late 19th century criminologies did tend to define crime in terms of bacterial infection 12 rose n the biology of culpability pathological identity and crime control in a biological culture theoretical criminology 1 2000 5-34 at 5 italics rl viral contagion and anti-terrorism a different logic of imperial intervention if you wish this is the point where imperial intervention comes to be imagined as an instance of medical urgency in a medicalised imaginary of empire its the logic of medical urgency and medical necessity that is likely to start determining and structuring imperial interventions such as pharmacotic wars on terrorism 13 3 15 the image of terrorism as a cancer that needs to be fought gill himself somewhat ironically understands this fighting to consist of longterm understanding would prove to be rather resilient president bushs national security adviser condoleeza rice eg about a month after the september attacks and 10 days into operation enduring freedom in afghanistan admits to a cnn journalist that what we want to do is to work with every government in which there is a substantial al-qaeda presence to figure out a strategy for rooting it out  because its like cutting out a cancer  16 although it moves towards further medicalization -oncologization to be precise -rices imaginary remains a somewhat uneasy hybrid cutting out cancers does not sit nicely and squarely within an apparently tenaciously persisting legal and diplomatic framework which implies working together with governments to figure out strategies particularly at a time when a severe military campaign is going on the image of terrorism as cancer as such was unable to capture both the conditions and the particulars of what happened on september 11 cancer tends to grow inside bodies yes like evil it knows no boundaries president bush during his trip to china 17 and it often grows and spreads through metastases but it is localised and moreover it appears to come from within and as such has something human about it -its just human cells running wild its humanity running wild but the image did persist and surfaced on a few occasions one as late as march 2003 during a press conference on the eve of the invasion of iraq when president bush referring to regime change talked about replacing this cancer inside of iraq 18 viral imagery however would prove to be more appropriate to capture the events of september 11 and the conditions that led to it viruses -at least some viruses -tend to be both outside and within they come form outside the body but somehow and unpredictably so like evil manage to penetrate boundaries slipping within viruses also need cultures where they are able to grow and multiply incessantly this notion of cultures is worth dwelling on for a moment fitzpatrick for example critically examines the use made by proponents of human rights of phrases such as cultural absolutism to denominate culture-bound closed exclusionary traditional authoritarian status-ridden static pure and inviolable community 19 ie those rigid and automaton-like elements devoid of the capacity for moral and therefore human deliberations in a strange and ironic twist these cultures of absolutism prove to be highly flexible and mobile on a global scale and possibly more so than the allegedly culturally universal particulars that go under the name human rights indeed and most importantly viruses -at least some of them -tend to be airborne just like the images of the twin towers that circulated through cnns ether spreading fear and terror contagiously as the head of a fascist terrorist conspiracy tells us in the hollywood production the sum of all fears which was released in 2002 whilst enjoying the apparent inability of both us and russian protagonists to move beyond cold war thinking and whilst planning a nuclear attack on baltimore our virus is airborne a french judge in a televised programme likened al-qaeda to the aids virus  this virus is totally mutant 20 viruses are not human a virus is a fremdkorper an alien inhuman entity that does not belong within and that has no place without either viruses ought to be tracked down in their cultures and destroyed without further ado 21 this is a matter of medical or more precisely of epidemiological necessity and urgency the image of terrorism as viral contagion surfaced fairly shortly after the september attacks particularly in academic milieux a few days after the attacks arthur and marilouise kroker the canadian editors of the pomo-zine par excellence ctheory published an essay under the heading terrorism of viral power the attacks on 19 see note 5 at 209 20 the third world war al-qaeda bbc two television tuesday 10th february 2004 9 pm 21 the virus metaphor of course had been used before in his 1947 statement before the house of un-american activities committee j edgar hoover fbi director spoke of the virus of communism epidemiological destruction of internal communism however still had a seriously legal tinge about it in hoovers statement i do favor unrelenting prosecution wherever they are found to be violating our countrys laws as americans our most effective defense is a workable democracy that guarantees and preserves our cherished freedoms taken from httpeditioncnncomspecialscoldwarepisodes06documentshoover the twin towers the krokers tell us have taught us that when confronted with the contagious logic of viral power particularly with a suicidal viral logic dissuasion is inoperative diplomacy and legality in other words are inoperative when dealing with sickness and contagion and how else to define suicidal mania that spreads like wildfire in fundamentalist cultures and in rigid communities of machine-like automatons epidemiological logic has to take over viral power adopts the strategy of the attacking parasite the krokers continue invading the body of the host the american homeland bleeding its tactical intelligence those flight schools in florida circulating in its commercial bloodstream american airlines and imploding in a violent fatal metastasis that has as its aim the infiltration of the mediascape through its apocalyptic effects 22 it should come as no surprise that such imagery emerged very quickly in postmodern academia baudrillard of course had been preparing for this for years hatred a viral passion claimed baudrillard in 1996 is also a vital passion against the perfection of the system hatred is a last vital reaction 23 against the pretended self-sufficiency of a naturally given perfect human and healthy empire against this new world order hatred is a viral reaction terrorism as viral contagion gradually replaced oncological imagery in official statements and documents the when it became already clear that a number of nato member states were likely to formally object to any invasion of iraq before the complete exhaustion of legal and diplomatic possibilities a temporary compromise would be found in and offered by un resolution 1441 a few weeks later in november 2002 25 the image of terrorism as viral contagion appeared throughout 2003 in a host of publications and addresses such as bruce hoffmans rand paper on al-qaeda 26 or terrorism expert magnus ranstorps statement to the us national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states which conjures up an image of al-qaeda as an incontrollable virus or a disease that aims to strike at the heart of the wests strength -the interconnectivity of their economies 27 in his statement ranstorp seems to combine both the krokers and blairs imaginaries when he argues for making suicide-bombings a crime against humanity ie a crime committed by elements with a suicidal mindset becoming airborne missiles or machine-like fanaticism against this healthy body of global interconnectivity or orderly freedom here is a passage taken from the presidents state of the union delivered in january 2003 at a time when preparations for the large scale epidemiological expedition into iraqs viral culture were in full swing before september the 11th many in the world believed that saddam hussein could be contained but chemical agents lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained 28 it could be noted here how in this quotation terrorists are placed on the same line as their weapons indeed terrorists in particular the alien inhuman suicidal machine-like types that have placed themselves beyond legality and diplomacy -dissuasion however repressive is inoperativeare like their weapons they are like noxious chemicals or contagious viruses as viruses they dont need moral reform or social rehabilitation they dont need punishment they dont need mere containment they need to be destroyed that is ultimately a matter of medical necessity that needs to be dealt with urgently and swiftly by medical experts and its the latter ie the experts that will decide on this urgency and necessity in a curious way bushs state of the union is replete with medical images and imagery virological and epidemiological ones in particular the president for example announces a massive budget increase aimed at strengthening medicare the nations healthy body asks for a strategic budget to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax botulinum toxin ebola and plague and promises developing countries substantial help in their struggle against the hivaids virus as suggested above one could argue that this epidemiological imaginary helped refine a space where medical necessity and medical urgency provided the natural logic for imperial intervention thereby gradually replacing the unnatural logic of legality and diplomacy the authoritarianism that is crystallizing in todays healthy body of empire global post-fordism claims steinmetz seems to be of a medical nature empires permanent state of emergency feels like an epidemiological one 29 one could wonder why this imaginary has formed as and when it did and whether there was a clear and conscious strategy behind it but that is an issue we cannot hope to resolve here what we can say here is that terrorism as viral contagion seems to have facilitated a number of imperial interventions or to weaken down this claim a little it seems to have coincided with a number of issues and subsequent interventions which it may have provided a facilitating imaginary space for one of these issues and interventions came with the capture of al-qaeda and taliban fighters the first of whom were imprisoned in guantanamo bay in january 2002 on a site that was aptly named camp x-ray naming those fighters criminals would have triggered a whole body of international human rights charters and domestic due process provisions naming those fighters and alleged terrorists soldiers or warriors would have turned them into prisoners of war and that would at least have made the geneva convention applicable a medical or viral problem a clear and present problem of inhumanity on the other hand can and should be dealt with outside ie outside americas healthy body or the worlds for that matter and outside the bounds of humane -or simply human -legality and diplomacy the natural body of empire is in no need for unnatural legality or diplomacy precisely because it is a given natural body it needs medical attention and intervention instead there is no need to build or rebuild the body of empire once freed from the virus it will emerge healthy naturally there is no need for the productive negotiations of a cosmopolitan globalism either to use mikkel rasmussens words 30  nor for reconciliatory efforts one does not reconcile with viruses the sanitary exclusion of viral contagion will suffice to keep the body of todays imperial new world order healthy another issue and subsequent intervention that at least to some extent however minor seems to have been facilitated by this epidemiological imaginary was the invasion of iraq invading an alleged or potential culture of viral and therefore contagious terrorism is first and foremost a matter of medical necessity and urgency the legal and diplomatic logic of un resolutions resolution 1441 in particular in this imaginary can only be of secondary importance furthermore epidemiological interventions allow empire to deal with contagious terrorists and their cultures the rogue states of yore simultaneously in one cleansing sterilising sweep it allows for a move beyond both the unnatural legal strictures of criminal procedure and the unnatural diplomatic constraints of international law empire after the end of the cold war is imagined ever more as the medical practice of exclusion rather than a legal and diplomatic however repressive at times project of inclusion against the given naturally ordered healthy body of empire the image of the inhuman machinic disorderly virally chaotic fremdkorper looms darkly in shadow and darkness said blair in his july 2003 congressional address somewhere outside the healthy body of humanity the events of september 11 and their aftermath in our view have catalysed this shift in the imaginary of empire however it remains to be seen whether empire is now on a course that will take it beyond any regard for legality and diplomacy in his address tony blair is unclear about it freedom he says in his address democracy and the rule of law are not western values but the universal values of the human spirit and anywhere and anytime ordinary people are given the chance to choose if left on its own the healthy body of empire of freedom-cum-rule of law will emerge naturally and orderly indeed like a body what therefore needs to be done is to make sure it is left on its own what is needed in michael ignatieffs words is an empire lite 31 and once the virus removed there will be no real need to start reconstructing the rule of law or indeed there will be no need to start reconstructing anything at all the healthy body of empire ie freedom-cum-order will emerge or re-emerge naturally and organically blair continues our new world rests on order the danger is disorder and in todays world it now spreads like contagion through fundamentalist terrorism whose weapon is chaos this contagion needs to be dealt with the natural rule of law must be protected swiftly if necessary -and it is necessary says george w bush as there are no rules 32 -this must be done beyond an unnatural logic of legality and diplomacy let us say one thing if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that at its least is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering that is something i am confident history will forgive but if our critics are wrong if we are right as i believe with every fibre of instinct and conviction i have that we are and we do not act then we will have hesitated in face of this menace when we should have given leadership that is something history will not forgive 33 this is the new logic of empire   the relationship between covid-19 infection and risk perception knowledge attitude as well as four non-pharmaceutical interventions npis

survey methodology enabled us to complete our study in a critical period and cost-effective manner our study also has several limitations first our study sample have disproportionately more female well-educated and less smokers reflecting a typically young and healthy cohort in similar surveys thus the frequencies of desirable knowledge levels and health behaviours may be over-estimated while less desirable outcomes such as lower family monthly income may be under-estimated however the modelling results may be less susceptible to these potential biases second our study results were from a particular period of the outbreak and most of the respondents were from outside hubei province the generalization of the results to other settings and countries may be limited third our study was a cross-sectional population survey and the association found between the predictors and outcomes should be interpreted with caution and further intervention studies are needed in confirming our findings fourth despite the relatively large sample size the total cases of covid-19 infection were still small so that the relationship between npis and the covid-19 infection should be confirmed by other larger epidemiological studies fifth the potential risk compensating effects of mask wearing against other npis should be considered as being of a hypothesis-generating in nature given

represent the most significant public health emergency that the world has faced in a century understanding the modes of transmission of emerging infectious disease is a key factor in protecting healthcare workers and implementing effective public health measures the lack of evidence on sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics has led to shifting isolation guidelines 5 between airborne and droplet isolation precautions by the who us cdc and other public health authorities other emerging coronaviruses eg sars and mers have been suggested to have airborne transmission potential 5 6 in addition to more direct contact and droplet transmission at least one study suggests that mers-cov has the possibility of transmission from mildly ill or asymptomatic individuals 7  surface samples taken in patient care areas for 10 mers and sars have shown positive pcr results 6  however experts question the possibility of transmission through contact with surfaces that have been contaminated by an infected person either by the direct contact of the infected person or the settling of virus-laden particles onto the surface 8  nonetheless coronaviruses have been implicated in nosocomial outbreaks with reports of transmission related to environmental contamination 9 10  nosocomial transmission 15 of sars-cov-2 has been reported but the role of aerosol transmission and environmental

when mildly ill or asymptomatic individuals infected with sars-cov-2 were housed in their 35 rooms for five to nine days samples were obtained in the nbu on day 10 when patients 1 and 2 had been admitted for ten days additional samples were obtained in the nbu on day 18 after patient 3 had been admitted to the unit for four days three types of samples were taken during this survey surface

were those items considered to be handled routinely by individuals in isolation and included cellular phones exercise equipment television remotes and medical equipment room surfaces were areas such as ventilation grates tabletops and window ledges toilet samples were taken to evaluate the potential for viral shedding during toileting air samples were collected both in isolation rooms and in the hallways of the nbu and nqu during 45 sampling activities air samples were collected in the room while patients were present air samples were taken in the hallways during sampling activities and samplers were placed on the floor adjacent to rooms where sampling activities were taking place personal air samplers were worn by sampling personnel on two occasions during sampling activities once during sampling at the nqu when 6 individual rooms were sampled and once in the hospital nbu when one room was sampled it is important to note that all individuals in nqu isolation had mild illness such as 5 low fever cough or body aches had been advised to maintain a 6-foot distance from staff members who entered their room as well as wear a procedure mask when interacting with these personnel individuals in isolation were instructed that they could remove the mask during air sampling activities however many individuals were uncomfortable removing their mask and therefore the impact of infected individuals wearing masks can neither be assessed in this study 10 nor can its impacts be removed surface and aerosol samples were analyzed by rt-pcr targeting the e gene of sars-cov-2 13 of the 163 samples collected in this study 126 773 had a positive pcr result for sars-cov-2 due to the need to cause minimal disruption to individuals in isolation and undergoing hospital 15 care the precise surface area sampled in this study was not uniform so results are presented as concentration of gene copies present in the recovered liquid sample copiesl viral gene copy concentrations recovered from each sample type were generally low and highly variable from sample to sample ranging from 0 to 175 copiesl  figure 1a and 2 with the highest concentration recovered from an air handling grate in the nbu since both the sampling time and 20 flow rate were known for all aerosol samples collected in this study the airborne concentration was calculated for all air samples copiesl of air figure 2  overall 765 of all personal items sampled were determined to be positive for sars-cov-2 by pcr  figure 1b air samples both in the rooms and in the hallway spaces  figure 1b and 2 provide information about airborne viral shedding in these facilities in room air samples were 632 positive by rt-40 pcr mean concentration 286 copiesl of air in the nqu samplers were placed either on the bedside table or a desk wherever there was space no attempt was made to ensure the sampler was placed a specific distance from the individual in the room so while distance between sampler and individual was neither defined nor consistent individuals in the room did not directly interact with the sampler in the nbu for the first two sampling events performed on day 10 the sampler was 45 placed on the window ledge away from the patient nbu room a occupied by patient 1 was positive for viral rna table 1 376 copiesl of air during the sampling event on day 16 in nbu room b occupied by patient 3 one sampler was placed near the patient and one was placed near the door greater than 6ft from the patients bed while the patient was receiving oxygen 1l via nasal cannula both samples were positive by pcr with the one closest to the patient indicating a higher airborne concentration of rna 407 as compared to 248 copiesl of air samples taken 5 outside the rooms in the hallways were 667 positive  figure 1b and 2b with a mean concentration of 259 copiesl of air both personal air samplers from sampling personnel in the nqu showed positive pcr results after 122 minutes of sampling activity  figure 2b  and both air samplers from nbu sampling indicated the presence of viral rna after only 20 minutes of sampling activity  figure 2b  the highest airborne concentrations were recorded by personal 10 samplers in nbu while a patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula 1917 and 4821 copiesl neither individuals in the nqu or patients in the nbu were observed to cough while sampling personnel were in the room wearing samplers during these events air samples that were positive for viral rna by rt-pcr were examined for viral propagation in vero e6 cells cytopathic effect was not observed in any sample to date and immunofluorescence 15 and western blot analysis have not so far indicated the presence of viral antigens suggesting viral replication however the low concentrations of virus recovered from these samples makes finding infectious virus in these samples difficult further experiments are ongoing to determine viral activity in these samples during the sampling individuals in isolation were recording symptoms and oral temperatures 20 twice a day reports of symptoms for the 3 days preceding each sample collection were provided the maximum temperature during that period was recorded as was the presence of any symptoms for the 3 days preceding each sampling event 579 of patients recorded a temperature greater than 990 f and 158 had a temperature greater than 100f independent of temperature 579 of patients reported other symptoms primarily cough because sampling 25 personnel were allowed to use judgement and feedback from patients when collecting samples between 5 and 16 samples were collected from each room with a mean of 735 samples per room and a mode of 6 samples per room percentage of positive samples from each room ranged between 50 and 100  figure 1b and 2a  a pearson product moment correlation of percent positive samples and total number of samples for each room had an r 2 value of 001 indicating that there 30 was no relationship between the number of samples taken and the percent of positive samples observed when the percent of positive samples taken was compared to the maximum reported oral temperature of the patient for the previous three days a pearsons r 2 of 001 indicated no relationship between elevated body temperature and shedding of virus in the environment further recorded oral temperature was compared with the gene copy concentration for each in-room 35 sample type figure 2a  these r 2 values ranged from 000 cell phones and remotes to 022 bedside tables indicating small to no significant relationship between body temperature and environmental contamination with bedside tables having the strongest correlation followed by toilets r 2  020 and windowsills r 2  019 taken together these data indicate significant environmental contamination in rooms where 40 patients infected with sars-cov-2 are housed and cared for regardless of the degree of symptoms or acuity of illness in addition the recovery of culturable virus from air samples taken outside of the doorway of a patient room strongly suggests aerosol dissemination of virus contamination exists in all types of samples high and low-volume air samples as well as surface samples including personal items room surfaces and toilets samples of patient toilets that tested positive for viral rna are consistent with other reports of viral shedding in stool 14  the presence of contamination on personal items is also reasonably expected particularly those items that are routinely handled by individuals in isolation such as cell phones and remote controls as well as medical equipment that is in near constant contact with the patient 5 the variability in the degree of environmental contamination as measured by the percentage of positive samples room to room is of interest on average a higher percentage of positive samples were detected in the nbu where patients were hospitalized for inpatient care with both hospital nbu rooms sampled on day 10 and 18 having the highest percentage of positive samples 856 over 3 rooms however samples of the residential nqu rooms from the first pass of sampling 10 days 5 to 7 had a similar average 846 over 8 rooms it is interesting to note that the average percentage of positive samples per room dropped to 649 over the same 8 rooms and individuals and one additional room during the second sampling period days 8 to 9  this may indicate a reduction in viral shedding by these individuals the lack of any statistically defensible relationship between the evidence of environmental contamination and body temperature indicates 15 that infected individuals may shed viral rna to their environment without clearly identifiable symptoms such as fever at least in convalescence it is interesting to note the presence of viral rna on the floor under the bed of the patients and on the window ledges which were not obviously used by the patient in the hospital nbu airflow in nbu suites enters from the top center of the room and exits at grates near the head of the 20 patients bed on either side of the room airflow modelling 15 has suggested that turbulent eddies may form under the patients bed which may cause the observed contamination under the bed while the dominant airflow likely carries particles away from the patients bed towards the edges of the room likely passing by the windows resulting in some deposition there although this study did not employ any size-fractionation techniques in order to determine the size 25 range of sars-cov-2 droplets and particles the data is suggestive that viral aerosol particles are produced by individuals that have the covid-19 disease even in the absence of cough first in the few instances where the distance between individuals in isolation and air sampling could be confidently maintained at greater than 6 ft 2 of the 3 air samples were positive for viral rna second 667 of hallway air samples indicate that virus-containing particles were being 30 transported from the rooms to the hallway during sampling activities it is likely that the positive air samples in the hallway were cause by viral aerosol particles transported by personnel exiting the room 1617  finally personal air samplers worn by sampling personnel were all positive for sars-cov-2 despite the absence of cough by most patients while sampling personnel were present 35 recent literature investigating human expired aerosol indicates that a significant fraction of human expired aerosol is less than 10 m in diameter across all types of activity eg breathing talking and coughing 18 and that upper respiratory illness increases production of aerosol particles less than 10 m 19 taken together these results suggest that virus expelled from infected individuals including from those who are only mildly ill may be transported by aerosol processes in their local 40 environment potentially even in the absence of cough or aerosol generating procedures further a recent study of sars-cov-2 in aerosol and deposited on surfaces indicates infectious aerosol may persist for several hours and on surfaces for as long as 2 days 20 despite wide-spread environmental and limited sars-cov-2 aerosol contamination associated with hospitalized and mildly ill individuals effective implementation of airborne isolation precautions including n95 45 filtering facepiece respirators and powered air purifying respirator use adequately protected health care workers in the nqu and nbu facilities preventing health care worker infections health care workers were closely monitored and screened for covid-19 suggesting the value in implementing ipc protocols that maintain airborne isolation standards including respiratory protection and include routine systematic environmental cleaning and disinfection of patient care  surface and personal items were collected using 3x3 sterile gauze pads prewetted with 3 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs large area surface samples were collected by wiping in an s pattern in 2 directions to cover as much of the available surface as possible smaller items eg cellular phones remote controls were wiped in one direction on every available surface 40 following collection samples were packed in 50 ml conical tubes hand hygiene and glove changes were performed between the collection of every sample several categories of personal items were sampled consistently between all quarantine rooms and assayed for evidence of viral contamination cellular phones and television remote controls in addition individuals were asked about what items they used or handled frequently and several additional samples were collected based on those responses exercise equipment pots used to heat water a nasal cannula and a spirometer in addition both the rim and seat of the toilet were 5 sampled together several surfaces were sampled in each room for rooms in the national quarantine unit both the windowsill and the bedside table were sampled for rooms in the nebraska biocontainment unit samples were taken on the windowsill the bed rail or bedside table under the patients bed 10 and on the air conditioning return grate nearest the door several types of air samples were collected both in patient rooms on personnel performing sampling and in the hallways outside of patient rooms stationary air samples both inside and outside of patient rooms were collected using a sartorius airport md8 air sampler operating at in order to quantify the number of viral gene copies present in each sample from the measured ct values a standard curve was developed using synthetic dna a 6-log standard curve was run in duplicate beginning at a concentration of 1x10 3 copiesl the data was fit with the exponential function where ct is the cycle time where amplification is definitive the equation was then used to convert all measured ct values from all samples into gene copy concentrations the average and standard deviation concentrations were calculated from the triplicate values for each sample the primers and probe used in this study below are based on a previously published assay 13 5 targeting the e gene of sars-cov-2 which produces the envelope small membrane protein the gene was used as a target based on its similarity to previously identified coronavirus including sars-cov strain frankfurt and two bat sars-related cov genbank acc no mg7729331 and nc014470  the positive control consisted of ssdna targeting the e and n gene below in a 11 mixture at 10 3 copiesl ssdna was based on the 2019-ncov genome 10 sequence published in genbank 21 the minimum concentration detected by this assay was between 1e-1 and 1e-2 copiesl in the case where no data was obtained the patient had been transferred from another facility less than 24 hours prior to sampling   epidemiological characteristics and incubation period of 7015 confirmed cases with coronavirus disease 2019 outside hubei province in china xiuquan nie lieyang fan ge mu qiyou tan mengyi wang yujia xie limin cao min zhou zhuang zhang weihong chen  chen weihong  since the implementation of strict traffic restrictions in hubei province on january 23 the proportion of imported cases outside hubei province has gradually decreased and the incubation period of imported cases has increased over time background disease caused by sars-cov-2 broke out in wuhan in december 2019 we utilized confirmed cases outside hubei province to analyze epidemiologic characteristics and evaluate the effect of traffic restrictions implemented in hubei in all provinces outside hubei was collected from the national and local health commissions in china incubation period and interval times were calculated using dates of the following events contact with an infected person onset first visit and diagnosis we evaluated changes in incubation period and interval times the average age of all cases was 4424 years old the median incubation period was 5 days and extended from 2 days on january 23 to 15 days on february 8 the proportion of imported cases decreased from 8571 to 3319 after january 23 in addition the lengths of the intervals between onset and diagnosis onset and first visit and first visit and diagnosis decreased over time rapidly transmitting covid-19 has a short incubation period the onset mainly occurs among young to middle-aged adults traffic restrictions played an important role in the decreased number of imported cases outside hubei  m a n u s c r i p t 4  in december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan of hubei province chinas central transportation hub 1  the viral data were rapidly determined through highthroughput sequencing on january 7 and identified as having homology with human severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the zoonosis originating from wild animals 2 3  the most reported initial pneumonia cases were geographically linked with the huanan seafood market which also sells wild animals in wuhan 4  to prevent widespread epidemic outbreaks the government implemented isolation in wuhan with traffic-blocking measures on january 23 2020 and hubei province finished blocking trafficon january 26 2 5  however millions of people had left wuhan before isolation due to the high mobility of the population during the spring festival a traditional festival in china when families are reunited which contributed to the spread of sars-cov-2 on january 30 2020 the epidemic was listed as a public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health organization who and was later officially named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 6 7  as of february 8 2020 a total of 27100 cases were confirmed in hubei province and a total of 10098 cases were confirmed in other parts of china 8 9  a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 5 human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in early epidemiological analyses of covid-19 5  since sars-cov-2 could be transmitted via respiratory droplets and close contact 10 more evidence emerged to show positive pcr detection of the virus in various clinical specimens such as blood sputum feces urine and nasal samples 11 12  the live virus has even been detected in feces 12  implying the possibility of fecal-oral spread in recent studies the basic reproduction number r0 was calculated as 220377 higher than those of sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 3 5  due to the large number of cases of infection in hubei province the details of the cases were not released so we collected information on cases confirmed to be from outside of hubei province in this study our objectives were to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases and the length of the interval between contact with infected patients to the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis study population and source of data this retrospective study was conducted with 7015 covid-19 cases from january 19 to february 8 2020 in all provinces of china outside hubei province the information of all participants was collected from the website of the national health commission of the peoples republic of china nhcprc and health commission website of each province or city detailed data included age gender residence history of contact confirmed cases or persons from a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 6 hubei province travel history initial symptoms information on family clusters and several crucial dates such as onset date first visit date diagnosis date hospitalization date and isolation date we indicated the amount or number of cases using in the analysis when part of the information unable to be collected a total of 3294 cases with detailed clinical performance information were included in the analyses of clinical symptoms and 2907 cases with contact history and date of onset or diagnosis were analyzed for incubation period in this study to compare the characteristics of confirmed cases with that of the domestic population latest demographic data sex- the prognosis of disease cure or death was also collected a cured case was defined as a case with body temperature that had returned to normal markedly improved respiratory symptoms significant inflammatory absorption shown in lung ct and two consecutive nucleic acid detections that were negative according to the we extracted the last contact date to estimate the incubation period collected contact history information through individual epidemiological questionnaire surveys by public health physician the questionnaire information includes four types of contact 1 contact with confirmed cases 2 contact with suspicious cases or fever 3 contact with people come from hubei 4 the travel or residence history of hubei province by comparing the date of each type of contact the last date of contact was extracted if there was only one the time was the last contact date incubation period was defined as the duration between the last contact date and the onset date the onset date was defined as the first day when symptoms developed such as fever and cough in addition to evaluate the relationship among exposure onset and diagnosis we to study the distribution of covid-19 cases we presented the case number by gender age and province considering the variable distribution age was presented as the mean and standard deviation and the incubation period and time intervals mentioned above were presented as the median 25q 75q the difference between imported cases and nonimported cases was tested using the t-test or wilcoxon rank-sum test the chi-square test was used to compare the numerical difference between imported cases and nonimported cases all analyses were performed using r software version 362 or excel microsoft a two-sided p005 was statistically significant the distribution of 7015 confirmed covid-19 cases 3695 males 5412 is shown in table 1  henan province 1017 and guangdong province 852 reported more cases than other provinces did table s1  the average age for all cases was 4424 years with a range from two months to 97 years old over 60 of confirmed cases were between 30 and 59 years old 2181 for 30-39 years old 2107 for 40-49 years old 1924 for 50-59 years old by comparing with the age-specific proportion of the national population we found the proportion of cases under 20 years old 20826 per 10 6  is much lower than that of other age groups 56189 per 10 6  up to 6150 3802 of all cases were imported cases and 3756 1428 of them came directly from wuhan  table 2  the proportion of imported cases in adjacent a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 9 provinces of hubei was 5577 1411 cases and in non-adjacent provinces was 6547 2391 cases table 3  among 3294 confirmed cases 5394 male with an average age of 4471 years old the most common symptoms were fever 8300 and cough 3361 fatigue 996 and pharyngalgia 668 were common as well a few cases also reported digestive tract symptoms such as diarrhea nausea or vomiting compared with 533 cured cases 21 deaths occurred among patients who were much older 719 vs 399 years old and a much higher proportion of these deaths occurred among patients with other diseases 714 vs 09 we analyzed the variation in the age gender and proportion of imported cases by diagnosis date figure 1  the average age of the cases was 66 years old on january 19 and 5621 years old on january 20 and the average age gradually decreased to 4373 years old on january 23 after january 23 the average age for confirmed cases remained near 4418  1628 years old the proportion of imported cases gradually decreased with later dates of diagnosis especially after january 23 before january 23 the proportion of imported cases was approximately 8571 to 100 and the proportion decreased to 3319 on february 8 we did not observe any difference in the age or gender distribution between cases from provinces adjacent to hubei province and those from other provinces with the time of diagnosis the median incubation period for 2907 covid-19 cases was 5 days 2 days 8 days and the longest incubation period was 24 days for 1 case the incubation period m a n u s c r i p t 10 for more than 95 of the covid-19 cases was less than 13 days we did not observe a significant difference in incubation period among males 5 days 2 8  and females 4 days 2 8  p022 the incubation period in imported cases was 5 days while it was 4 days in nonimported cases with no significant difference p023 interestingly we observed that the median incubation period gradually extended over time figure 2 and figure 3  we further analyzed the change in the incubation period between imported and nonimported cases figure 4  the extension of the incubation period was observed in imported cases but no significant change was observed among nonimported cases the median time from disease onset to diagnosis disease onset to first visit first visit to diagnosis and disease onset to censoring was 4 0 2 and 12 days respectively we collect data in the early stages of the epidemic so the outcome of many cases has not yet occurred we used february 8 as censored time for confirmed cases the cured time for cured cases and the death time for death cases the time between disease onset and diagnosis for imported cases 4 days 2-7days was significantly shorter p001 than for nonimported cases 5 days 2-8days  table 2  the median time from disease onset to diagnosis was decreased to zero over the onset time figure 3 decreased rapidly before january 23 and then stabilized to 0 days and 2 days respectively after january 23 we did not observe a significant difference in the length of time from disease onset to the first visit or the length of time from the first visit to diagnosis between imported cases and nonimported cases in this study we collected information on 7015 confirmed covid-19 cases over 50 male average age of 4424 years old the most common symptoms were fever and cough we observed a decreasing trend in the proportion of imported cases in provinces outside hubei province and decreasing trends in the time intervals between onset and diagnosis onset and first visit and first visit and diagnosis from january 19 to february 8 based on 2907 confirmed cases the median incubation period of covid-19 was 5 days and more than 95 of cases had an incubation period of less than 13 days an increasing trend in the incubation period with the time of diagnosis or onset was observed in this study especially among imported cases we found that the median incubation period was slightly longer than that found in the 1099-case report by wei-jie guan 5 and was supported by a reported family clustering case in which five family members experienced the onset of symptoms 3-6 days after exposure 16  moreover the longest incubation period a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 12 was 24 days in this study which is consistent with the longest incubation period reported by wei-jie guan et al 11  it should be noted that we extracted the date of last contact with infected persons as the date of contact to calculate the incubation period when actual contact was earlier than this date it may lead to an underestimation of the incubation period in addition it would appear equally likely that infection might have occurred through contact with some other infected but unidentified person at some time after contact with the known infected person resulting in an overestimate of the incubation period since the outbreak of the covid-19 mandatory traffic restrictions have been adopted across china to prevent further spread of the epidemic for example wuhan stopped all traffic inside and outside the city on january 23 and no residents could leave wuhan unless they had very special circumstances in the following days january 24 to january 26 transportation in other cities and surrounding counties in hubei province also stopped our study showed that from january 23 the incubation period among imported confirmed cases outside hubei province showed a gradual upward trend but this trend was not obvious in nonimported cases we also observed that the proportion of imported cases decreased from 100 on january 19 to 3319 on february 8 this situation suggested that imported cases started to decrease after traffic restrictions were imposed after the closure of hubei province new imported cases would no longer increase and cases that had been imported into other provinces outside hubei province gradually developed thus prolonging the incubation period on the other hand the main transmission routes of covid-19 that have been a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 13 confirmed thus far are respiratory droplets and contact transmission 5 11 16 17  while other possible transmission routes such as aerosol and digestive tract transmission have not been confirmed 10 15  therefore the opportunities for infection with 2019-ncov did not change which might partly explain the relatively stable incubation period among nonimported cases in the present study we observed that the median time from disease onset to diagnosis decreased very rapidly from 16 days on january 19 to 4 days on and after january 23 this phenomenon should be attributed to the gradual recognition of covid-19 and the rapid application of nucleic acid antibody detection our results also found that the time between disease onset and diagnosis for imported cases was significantly shorter than that for nonimported cases this indicated that physicians were more likely to consider the possibility of covid-19 among pneumonia cases from wuhan or hubei province in addition the rapidly decreasing time interval from onset to the first visit and from the first visit to diagnosis especially after january 23 also illustrated the effectiveness of the traffic restriction measures in hubei province and the improvement in diagnostic capacities in summary our analysis provided evidence that the various policies and isolation measures taken by hubei province have been effective since the outbreak of covid-19 imported cases started to decrease after traffic restrictions were imposed and the incubation period gradually increased  all authors declare no competing interests   the first confirmed case of covid-19 in tanzania recommendations based on lesson learned from china clifford tarimo silver jian wu   to the editor since the coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30 january 2020 and yet the pandemic disease its epidemiology has been reported to change rapidly as pointing to over 118000 cases in over 110 countries 13 for the first time since the onset of symptoms of the first identified case of covid-19 on 8 december 2019 there has been a 13-fold increase in cases reported from countries outside china 4 5 as of 16 march 2020 1000 am cet there were 81077 confirmed cases and 3218 deaths in china while the authorities outside chinas borders had reported 86434 confirmed cases 3388 deaths in 151 countries and thousands more fighting for their lives in hospitals 5 the statistics tells us that even countries with advanced health systems are still struggling to cope with this epidemic as the number of cases continues to rise outside china moving to low-income countries we should be deeply concerned about the impact it can pose to such population which for decades is characterized by high hiv prevalence 6 chronic non-communicable diseases 7 and malnourished individuals 8 i think it is high time to report newly recorded incidences and provide clear recommendations while reflecting on chinas experience on 16 march 2020 the ministry of health of tanzania announced the first case of covid-19 the victim happened to be a female traveler aged 46 years who departed the country on 3 march 2020 to belgium and had visited denmark and sweden between the dates 5 and 13 march 2020 on the 15 march 2020 the lady flew back to tanzania from belgium and arrived at the kilimanjaro international airport kia at 1600 hours using the rwandan airplane as of other countries tanzania had also prepared for the reception of travelers from abroad in terms of diagnostics and trained health care providers and much more a victim was effectively screened for the symptoms of covid-19 at the airport and showed none she took a cab all the way to the hotel located about 28 miles away from the airport on the 16 march 2020 she felt unwell and decided to surrender herself to medical tests on the same day just to find out that she was infected with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 she came to put it clear to the authorities that the reason behind staying at the hotel overnight instead of going home directly was a need for self-quarantine she further uncovered that back in belgium she was accommodated by her female friend whose husband had acquired the infection an important thing to learn from this brief story is there is a questionable strategy for screening for this disease as it can obviously miss the truly affected individuals in addition body temperature assessment might not be an adequate or sufficient attribute for the screening of covid-19 9 the situation might also mean tanzania may have a number of imported cases currently large posing a huge threat to public health in this regard i thought it is imperative to bring forth some few recommendations
ias the ministry of health of tanzania suggests there is no need to panic in this period when most countries worldwide are taking measures to prevent the importation of the virus the government of tanzania should improve in monitoring the disease epidemiology by improving strategies for identification diagnosis management of cases contact tracing and implementation of strict measures for returning travelersiias travelers coming from risky countries are quarantined for the recommended time not less than 14 days while undergoing symptoms based as well as laboratory tests the government should make a significant improvement in establishing more resources and equipment for quarantine and isolation if this approach is effectively applied it can dramatically slow down the spread as it was appreciated in china where strict restrictions were put in place to quarantine nearly 60 million people in hubei province that led to a tremendous decline of new cases from nearly 1600 cases each day to less than 40 cases 10iiithe government should build capacity to the existing healthcare centers to diagnose the infection instead of depending on the national laboratory located in dar es salaamin addition as the cases are still accumulating one of the cost-effective approaches may be to transform some of the existing structures such as malls or exhibition centers and prepare them to receive covid-19 patients establishment of safe rooms for negative-pressure rooms contagious respiratory disease isolation to accommodate patients who might require more sophisticated medical attention should also be consideredivin case of symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory illness before during or after travel the travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share travel history with their health care providers in addition public health authorities of tanzania should provide to travelers information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via health practitioners travel health clinics travel agencies conveyance operators and at points of entryvas panic still prevails in tanzania and the rest of african countries we should all beware of infodemic which may hamper the efforts to fight against the virus currently there have been a lot of misinformation and contradicting facts that are posted especially through the social media networks in tanzania the citizens of tanzania should be encouraged to rely only on the trusted and reliable sources such as the ministry of health center of disease control and prevention cdc and the world health organization who as it is in chinavithis letter calls upon the government of tanzania to immediately suspend not only schools and colleges as it has been successfully done but also all religious and any other social gatherings in china all unnecessary or non-essential large-scale public gatherings were stopped as early as 25 january 2020 11 the application of this approach can provide significant contribution towards flattening the epidemic curvevii as it has been shown by who and well-practiced in china during the epidemic the use of banknotes should be banned 12 i advise the ministry of finance of tanzania to encourage citizens to use contactless payment such as mobile applications and electronic bank transactions by ensuring ease of its use security and privacy despite the announcement from the bank of tanzania that the banknotes cannot harbor the virus 13 cdc has acknowledged that banknotes in circulation can hold virus and bacteria and hence recommends rigorously that people wash their hands after handling money 12 in addition a study conducted in 2017 revealed a list of things including dna from pets traces of drugs bacteria and viruses found on banknotes 14viii in response to covid-19 epidemic the central government of china imposed a lockdown in the epicenter wuhan city of hubei province however this lockdown model might not work in low- and middle-income settings like tanzania this has been proven in other east african countries like kenya where there have been episodes of civil unrest as citizens are enforced to stay home in this regard the government of tanzania is called to come up with the african-based lockdown and social distancing model that will specifically suit the citizen this is mainly because a significant proportion of tanzanians have to work daily in the streets to earn a livingixsince this crisis is proving to be more difficult and longer-lasting than any of us had expected there is a need for tanzania to formulate a rapid network with chinese doctors and health care providers that will ensure a rapid sharing of information and how to effectively and timely diagnose the viral infection and track cases by joint cooperation we are more than capable of containing the virus  pulmonary embolism in hospitalised patients with covid-19 martin whyte b philip kelly a elisa gonzalez roopen arya lara roberts n

admitted to intensive care unit icu 6 7 8 9 despite the use of thromboprophylaxis elevated d-dimer values were reported in up to 43 of patients with covid-19 10 with higher values seen in patients with more severe disease 1112 therefore in the context of covid-19 infection identifying who to investigate for co-morbid pulmonary embolism pe is highly challenging d-dimer is a continuous variable reflecting increasing risk for pe 13 and is used to further risk stratify patients with low pre-test probability - with imaging not required in those with negative d-dimer 1415 patients with pe and significantly raised d-dimers have been shown to be more often hypotensive tachycardic andor hypoxemic 16 the radiographic burden of pulmonary thrombotic disease may also be greater with high d-dimer values 1718 we therefore examined the clinical and radiographic characteristics of patients with covid-19 who underwent pulmonary imaging for possible thrombotic disease we report the incidence of pe and looked at the utility of d-dimer and wells score in this patient cohort this was a retrospective analysis of adult inpatients with suspected covid-19 having imaging to co-diagnose pe at kings college hospital london uk with a high regional numbers of covid-19 cases 19 data collection was from 3rd march 2020 and concluded on 7th may 2020 at our institution patients with suspected pe undergo a two-level pe wells score with mandatory recording of all components of the wells score in the electronic request for pe imaging imaging is not undertaken for those considered pe unlikely by the wells rule score 4 in conjunction with a d-dimer result below 500 ngml hospitalised patients were categorised as icu patients or ward patients if they were not transferred to icu during hospitalisation weight based thromboprophylaxis was standard of care for all patients admitted with covid-19 in the absence of contraindication patients with weight 50 kg receive enoxaparin 20 mg once daily weight 50-100 kg enoxaparin 40 mg od 100-150 kg enoxaparin 80 mg once daily and 150 kg enoxaparin 120 mg once daily this was also the case in patients admitted to icu with egfr30 mlmin with unfractionated heparin 5000 units twice daily given to those 100 kg increasing to three times daily in higher body weight from 24th april intermediate dosing was utilised in icu only see supplementary table 1 d-dimer was measured by a latex photometric immunoassay with sta-liatest values over 500 ngml are considered positive the intraassay cv at this value is 10 the upper limit of reporting of d-dimer assay is 8000 ngml we obtained raw values for this study where available fibrinogen was measured by the clauss method with sta-fibrinogen prothrombin time pt was measured by coagulation-based assay with sta neoptimal all reagents were obtained from diagnostica stago asnires france with assays performed on the automated analyzer sta-r evolution as per manufacturers instruction diagnostica stago detection of covid-19 was from viral rna isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rtpcr computed tomography pulmonary angiogram ctpa was performed using a ge discovery ct750hd chicago il usa the interval between d-dimer and ctpa was less than 48 h using the electronic patient records epr allscripts sunrise chicago il we collected data for vital signs including the national early warning score 2 news2 20 components of wells score from the clinical notes not the completed imaging request form basic demographic data laboratory values and imaging results ctpa and venous ultrasonography if performed pe is most or equally likely was considered present in patients with a sudden unexplained clinical deterioration eg without new changes on chest x-ray if there was no documentation for a component of the wells score it was considered absent in cases with no documentation in the epr a wells score was not calculated ct scans were requested by the treating clinician for suspected pe the free text of epr was reviewed for clinician entry stating whether covid-19 was suspected covid-19 swab results were obtained from epr the date and time of ctpa request was extracted from the epr all laboratory and clinical variables were taken as the last values recorded before ctpa request the wells score was calculated post hoc by the authors 2122 using only data available in the clinical record at the time of ctpa request pe was considered most or equally likely where there was an unexplained deterioration in clinical status normality was determined by kolmogorov-smirnov test parametric and non-parametric distributed quantitative variables were compared using the students t-test and the mannwhitney u test respectively categorical variables including gender or presence of a venous thromboembolism vte risk factor were compared using the chi-squared test two-tailed contingency tables were constructed to evaluate the accuracy of using the d-dimer level to diagnose pe with ctpa as the gold standard receiver operating characteristics roc curve analysis was performed and area under the curve auc calculated the results are given as the mean  standard error of mean sem median interquartile range or number percentage wherever appropriate a p value of 005 was considered statistically significant data analysis was made using spss statistics for windows version 26 ibm corp armonk new york usa this was a service evaluation based upon the health research authority hra decision tool 23 and ethics approval was not required as agreed by the kings college hospital research and innovation department of the 214 scans n  80 37 confirmed pe therefore from 1477 patients admitted with covid-19 54 were diagnosed with pe the demographic and clinical features of those with and without pe are in table 1
 at the time of manuscript preparation of n  214 n  36 patients were still receiving hospital treatment and 31 patients had died in hospital thirty-two patients had ctpa during a hospital readmission readmitted within 90 days of discharge median time to readmission 185 days iqr 746 days of these 32 ctpa nine were positive for pe thirty-four patients 16 were receiving invasive positive pressure ventilation ippv in the intensive care unit icu at the time that ctpa was requested sixteen of whom showed presence of pe however a further n  44 of the cohort subsequently received icu care 20 with pe making a total of 78 icu-treated patients table 1 thus the proportion of icu patients with pe was 162 there were no differences in the distribution of age gender or body weight between groups the median news2 score was 5 iqr 39 in those with pe compared to news2 of 4 iqr 27 in those without p  0133 the incidence of pe in patients with ward-based care was 35 of 1255 admissions to the ward level care eighty-two scans 38 were performed within 24-h of admission of which n  31 showed pe 26 scans 14 n  4 showed pe were performed at 2472 h the range of imaging was 0120 days one patient having been admitted for over 2-months prior to the first case of covid-19 recorded median duration from admission to imaging was 2 days of all admissions 21 were diagnosed with pe within 24 h of admission of the patients scanned after 24-h of admission 124 were receiving anticoagulation predominantly weight based thromboprophylaxis n  95 from admission nine commenced therapeutic anticoagulation whilst awaiting imaging 9 patients were on an unfractionated heparin infusion to maintain haemofilter patency and 11 continued therapeutic anticoagulation for pre-existing comorbidities eg atrial fibrillation four patients did not receive any anticoagulant prophylaxis due to a contraindication active bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia data were unavailable for four patients for whom a paper prescription record was in use the wells score was no different between those with and without pe table 1 the numbers and proportions with wells score of 4 pe likely was 33134 25 without pe vs 2080 25 with pe p  0951 the most frequent wells score items present were immobilisation n  112 heart rate 100min n  84 and alternative diagnosis less likely n  47 four patients had recent surgery and were suspected to have covid co-infection none had a recent long-haul flight no patients had a history of thrombophilia lower limb venous ultrasonography was performed in 19 patients dvt was confirmed in 11 patients n  7 with confirmed pe the frequency of all components of the wells score are in table 1 in total 161 752 patients had d-dimer results recorded of these n  158 981 were positive and n  3 patients negative with values of 205 270 and 490 ngml the range of blood d-dimer levels were between 270 and 19450 ngml d-dimer values were significantly higher in those with confirmed pe table 1 with higher values seen in those with pe in both the low and high pre-test probability groups fig 2

 the area under the curve auc was 0772 95 confidence interval ci 06970847 the youden index was 054 at a d-dimer value of 4800 ngml this cut-point had a sensitivity of 075 and specificity of 078 without knowledge of the background prevalence of pe in covid-19 the ppv and npv should be considered indicative but our data suggest that the d-dimer values at this threshold 4800 ngml had a positive predictive value ppv of 722 95 ci of 633 to 797 and negative predictive value npv of 809 95 ci 734 to 867 combining this d-dimer threshold with low wells pre-test probability did not improve the npv 824 95 ci 739 to 885 fibrinogen was measured in n  13 and was elevated 6 gdl in n  9 of those with a confirmed pe n  80 the ctpa showed massive saddle embolus in n  3 and bilateral pe in 34 cases of unilateral cases the thrombus was segmental n  28 and subsegmental n  13 one patient had unilateral pe extending from the pulmonary artery and one patient had unilateral lobar thrombus right ventricular strain was evident on ct in n  9 one of the cases of pe was treated with thrombolysis of the positive cases all but one end of life care received therapeutic anticoagulation this was with enoxaparin in n  36 rivaroxaban n  15 apixaban n  8 edoxaban n  7 unfractionated heparin infusion n  13 this study of hospitalised patients showed that in patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 and clinical suspicion for pe more than one-third of ctpa studies were positive for pe this compares to the yield of ctpa of inpatients prior to the covid-19 epidemic of 12 to 17 24 25 26 and 18 in an icu environment 25 most literature on the use of ctpa centres on over-utilisation particularly if yields fall below 10 24 25 26 the high-yield from ctpa in our series raises the possibility of relative under-diagnosis of pe in patients with covid-19 neither the wells score nor news2 a marker of general illness severity differentiated between positive and negative studies of wells score components only the presence of symptoms or signs of dvt were significantly greater in pe although only evident in just over a tenth of cases our data suggest that the d-dimer has a positive predictive value for thrombotic events of approximately 70 when values approach 5000 ngml no d-dimer threshold had an adequate npv to eliminate the need for diagnostic imaging we found the overall proportion of patients with pe to be 54 increasing to 162 in icu patients pe was diagnosed in 35 patients receiving ward-based care similar to that reported in italy and the netherlands 66 and 33 respectively 89 the higher rate of pe in icu patients is consistent with previous reports 16747 albeit at the lower end this may partly be explained by imaging requested on clinical suspicion compared to some centres incorporating screening imaging 6 7 8 9 the use of epr means that data capture of requests and results was very high however as with any retrospective dataset evaluation selection bias is likely ctpa request would more likely be made after high d-dimer results making assessment of the performance of d-dimer challenging we used the d-dimer value closest to the request for ctpa evolution of d-dimer values may occur during illness and evaluation of serial measurement would be of interest in covid-19 patients retrospective calculation of the wells score based on author evaluation of the notes up to the time of imaging request relies on accurate recording of comorbidities and clinical features within the notes we adopted this approach as previous audit has demonstrated the wells recorded is not consistently recorded with accuracy in the imaging request 21 in our series very few individuals had fibrinogen measured outside of icu and we are therefore unable to determine the presence of dic for most of the cohort tang et al 12 highlighted that the majority of covid-19 patients who died during hospital stay fulfilled the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation 716 vs 06 in survivors although overall numbers were low 15 of 21 non-survivors total cohort n  182 of note other markers of dic were not prevalent in our cohort seven patients with platelets 100  109l and 11 with pt prolonged 3 s apart from d-dimer coagulation markers were not significantly associated with pe there is debate as to whether the pe seen in covid-19 represents true thrombus embolisation or whether this may be localised immunothrombosis 2728 51 of cases in our cohort were limited to unilateral segmentalsubsegmental vasculature a minority of patients 9 had dvt imaging performed with dvt confirmed in 1119 scans including seven patients with confirmed pe of note the majority of events were proximal dvt n  8 of patients with both dvt and pe only 1 had pe limited to the segmental vasculature with all others demonstrating more proximal thrombosis we did not collect data on whether segmentalsubsegmental pe were co-localised to areas with lung parenchymal disease all patients diagnosed with pe during hospitalisation had received at least weight-based thromboprophylaxis beforehand whilst this may raise concern regarding the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis it should be noted that the overall only 54 of patients hospitalised with covid-19 were diagnosed with pe furthermore in our series over half of all imaging occurred within the first 72 h of admission 43 of positives suggesting pe may develop earlier in the disease prior to hospitalisation we therefore caution against intensified thromboprophylaxis strategies outside icu without further evaluation in randomised controlled trials in summary we have found that the diagnostic yield of ctpa for pe in patients with confirmed or suspected covid-19 is high a high index of clinical suspicion for pe in patients with covid-19 is warranted an optimal d-dimer threshold to exclude pe without imaging was not identified further studies to optimise risk stratification of patients for pe imaging are welcomed randomised controlled trials to evaluate intensified thromboprophylaxis strategies are urgently needed the following is the supplementary data related to this
