   this contribution starts in section 2 with a rather elementary reconciliation of the standard sir model for epidemics featuring the central notions like basic reproduction number herd immunity threshold and doubling time together with some critical remarks on their abuse in the media experts can skip over this completely readers interested in the predictions should jump right away to section 5 section 3 describes the johns hopkins data source with its limitations and flaws and then presents a variation of a sir model that can be applied directly to the data it allows to estimate basic parameters including the basic reproduction number but does not work for predictions of peaks of epidemics to achieve the latter goal section 4 combines the data-compatible model of section 3 with a sir model dealing with the unknown susceptibles and the unregistered infectious this needs two extra parameters that should be extracted from the literature the first is the infection fatality rate as provided eg by 11 10  combined with the case fatality rate that can be deduced from the johns hopkins 3 pointing out certain abuses of these notions this will not work without calculus but things were kept as simple as possible readers should take the opportunity to brush up their calculus knowledge experts should go over to section 3 the simplest standard sir model of epidemics eg 4 and easily retrievable in the wikipedia 12  deals with three variables 1 susceptible s 2 infectious i and 3 removed r the removed cannot infect anybody anymore being either dead or immune this is the viewpoint of bacteria of viruses the difference between death and immunity of subjects is totally irrelevant for them they cannot proliferate anymore in both cases the sir model cannot say anything about death rates of persons the susceptible are not yet infected and not immune while the infectious can infect susceptibles the three classes s i and r are disjoint and add up to a fixed total population count n  s  i  r all of these are ideally assumed to be smooth functions of time t and satisfy the differential equation s   s n i where the dot stands for the time derivative and where  and  are positive parameters the product s n i models the probability that an infectious meets a susceptible note that the removed of the sir model are not the recovered of the johns hopkins data that we treat later and the sir model does not account for the confirmed counted there since     0 the equation n  s  i  r is kept valid at all times the term  s n i moves susceptibles to infectious while i moves infectious to removed thus  represents an infection rate while the removal rate  accounts 4 for either healing or fatality after infection ie immunity political decisions about reducing contact probabilities will affect   while  resembles the balance between the medical aggressivity of the infection and the quality of the health care system as long as the infectious i are positive the susceptibles s are decreasing while the removed r are increasing excluding the trivial case of zero infectious from now on the removed and the susceptible will be strictly monotonic qualitatively the system is not really dependent on n because one can multiply n r i and s by arbitrary factors without changing the system as an aside one can also go over to relative quantities with the two differential equations d dt figure 1 shows some simple examples that will be explained in some detail below we start by looking at the initial conditions since everything is invariant under an additive time shift we can start at time 0 and conside i0   s0 n i0  i0 and see that the infectious decrease right from the start if and this keeps going on since s must decrease an there is no outbreak in this case because there are not enough susceptibles at start time the case s0  n means that there is no infection at all and we ignore it though it is a solution to the system with i  r  0 s  n throughout  if there is a time instance t i maybe t i  0 above where the infectious are positive and do not change we have 0 t i    st i  n it i   it i  if    holds this situation cannot occur and i must be decreasing all the time ie the infection dies out this is what everybody wants there is no outbreak in case of    we go back to the initial situation of the previous section and see that there is no outbreak due to s0n  1 if there is an infection at all the interesting case is    then the first part of 3 shows that as soon as t is larger than the peak time t i  the infectious will decrease due to 4  therefore the zero of must be a maximum ie a peak and it is unique the infectious go to zero even in the peak situation it is one of the most important practical problems in the beginning of an epidemic to predict  whether there will be a peak at all  when the possible peak will come and  how many infectious will be at the peak this can be answered if one has good estimates for  and  and we shall deal with this problem in the major part of this paper in real life it is highly important to avoid the peak situation and this can only be done by administrative measures that change  and  to the situation    this is what management of epidemics is all about provided that an epidemic follows the sir model we shall see how countries perform the quotient is called the basic reproduction number if it is not larger than one there is no outbreak whatever the initial conditions are if it is larger than one there is an outbreak provided that holds in that case there is a time t i where i reaches a maximum and 4 holds there when we discuss an outbreak in what follows we always assume r 0  1 and 5 if we later let r 0 tend to 1 from above we also require that s0 tends to n from below in order to stay in the outbreak situation both  and  change under a change of time scale but the basic reproduction number is invariant physically  and  have the dimension time 1  but r 0    is dimensionless figure 1 shows a series of test runs with s0  n  0999 and r0  0 with fixed   01 and  varying from 002 to 03 such that r 0 varies from 15 to 3 due to the realistically small i0 being 0001 of the population one cannot see the decaying cases near startup but the tails of the blue i curves are decaying examples by starting value due to st n     1r 0 when started at time t decreasing r 0 flattens the blue curves for i one can observe that i always dies out while s and r tend to fixed positive levels we shall prove this below from the system one can also infer that r has an inflection point where i has its maximum since  if only r would be observable one could locate the peak of i via the inflection point of r figure 2 shows an artifical case with a large starting value i0  n2 fixed   01 and  varying from 0005 to 03 letting r 0 vary from 005 to 3 in contrast to figure 1  this example shows cases with small r 0 properly the essence is that the infectious go down whether they have a peak or not and there will always be a portion of susceptibles again we shall prove this below 2 classical sir modeling 8  this is a number related to the basic reproduction number r 0 by following a special scenario if a population is threatened by an infection with basic reproduction number r 0  what is the number of immune persons needed to prevent an outbreak right from the start we can read this off equation 2 in the ideal situation that i0  0 and s0  r0  n namely r 0 as the threshold between outbreak and decay this does not refer to a whole epidemic scenario nor to an epidemic outbreak it is a condition to be checked before anything happens and useless within a developing epidemic whatever the media say in the peak situation of 4 the fraction of the non-susceptible at the peak t i of i is exactly the herd immunity threshold thus it is correct to say that if the immune of a population are below the herd immunity threshold at startup and if the basic reproduction number is larger than one the sum of the immune and the infectious will rise up to the herd immunity threshold and then the infectious will decay this is often stated imprecisely in the media furthermore the herd immunity threshold has nothing to do with the important long-term ratio of susceptibles to removed we shall address this ratio in section 211 9 the most interesting questions during an outbreak with r 0  1 are  at which time t i will we reach the maximum of the infectious and  what is it i  ie how many people will maximally be infectious at that time it will turn out that there are no easy direct answers from 4 we see that at the maximum of i the susceptibles s have the value ie the portion 1r 0 of the population is susceptible from that time on the infectious decrease in terms of r and i the value of the non-susceptibles marks the peak of the infectious at the herd immunity threshold flattening the curve as often mentioned in the media is intended to mean making the maximum of i smaller but this is not exactly what happens since the maximum is described by the penultimate equation concerning the susceptibles while for it i  we only know yielding that the left-hand side gets smaller if r 0 gets closer to one politically this requires either making  smaller via reducing contact probabilities or making  larger by improving the health system or both anyway flattening the curve works by letting r 0 tend to 1 from above but the basic reproduction number does not directly determine the time t i of the maximum or the value there we shall improve the above analysis in section 213 in the beginning of the outbreak sn is near to one and therefor i   i  i models an exponential outbreak with exponent     0 with a solution if this is done in discrete time steps t one has the severity of the outbreak is not controlled by r 0    but rather via    publishing single values it does not give any information about    better is the ratio of two subsequent values and if this gets smaller over time the outbreak gets less dramatic because    gets smaller really useful information about an outbreak does not consist of values and not of increments but of increments of increments ie some second derivative information this is what the media rarely provided during the outbreak another information used by media during the outbreak is the doubling time ie how many days it takes until daily values double this is the number n in ie it is inversely proportional to    if political action doubles the doubling time if halves    if politicians do this repeatedly they never reach    and they never escape an exponential outbreak if they do this any finite number of times extending the doubling time will never prevent a peak it only postpones it and hopefully flattens it when presenting a doubling time media should always point out that this makes only sense during an exponential outbreak and it is not related to the basic reproduction number r 0    but rather to the difference    media often say that the basic reproduction number r 0 gives the number of persons an average infectious infects while being infectious this is a rather mystical statement that needs underpinning the quantity is a value that has the physical dimension of time it describes the ratio between current infectious and current newly removed and thus can be seen as the average time needed for an infectious to get removed ie it is the average time that an infectious can infect others correspondingly are the newly infected and therefore can be seen as the time it needs for an average infectious to generate a new infectious the ratio   s n then gives how many new infectious can be generated by an infectious while being infected but this is only close to r 0 if s  n ie at the start of an outbreak a correct statement is that r 0 is the average number of infections an infectious generates while being infectious but within an unlimited supply of susceptibles besides the peak in case r 0  1 it is interesting to know the portions of the population that get either removed by death or immunity or get never in contact to the infection this concerns the long-term behavior of the removed and the susceptibles figures 1 and 2 if we are at a time t d behind the possible peak at t i  or in a decay situation enforced by starting value like in 2 we know that i must decrease exponentially to zero this follows from showing that log i must decrease linearly or i must decrease exponentially thus we get rid of the infectious in the long run keeping only susceptibles and removed surprisingly this happens independent of how large r 0 is dividing the first equation in 1 by the third leads to and when setting   sn and   rn we get when assuming r0  0 at startup since  is increasing it has a limit 0     1 for t   and in this limit holds together with the condition         1 because there are no more infectious the equation has a unique solution in 0 1 dependent on  0  1 and r 0    see qualitatively we can use 8 or 9 in the form to see that the ratio of removed to susceptibles increases with r 0  but there is a logarithm involved all of this has some serious implications if the model is correct for an epidemic situation first the infectious always go to zero but susceptibles always remain this means that a new infection can always arise whenever some infected person enters the sanitized population the outbreak risk is dependent on the portion    1    of the susceptibles this illustrates the importance of vaccination eg against measles or influenza the above analysis shows that large values of r 0 lead to large relative values of removed to susceptible in the limit the consequence is that systems with large r 0 have a dramatic outbreak and lead to a large portion of removed this is good news in case that the rate of fatalities within the removed is low but very bad news otherwise when politicians try to flatten the curve by bringing r 0 below 1 from some time on this will automatically decrease the asymptotic rate of removed and increase the asymptotic rate of susceptibles in the population this is particularly important if the rate of fatalities within the removed is high but by the previous argument the risk of re-infection rises due to the larger portion of susceptibles the decay situation 7 implies that therefore the final rate of the removed is not smaller than the herd immunity threshold this is good news for possible re-infections but only if the death rate among the removed is small enough in a decay situation like in 7 we get figure 3  solving for   for fixed c0  09 and varying r 0 to see that the exponential decay is not ruled by    as in the outbreak case with r 0  1 but rather by       this also holds for large r 0    because   counteracts the bell shapes of the peaked i curves are not symmetric with respect to the peak if we go back to analyzing the peak of i at t i for r 0  1 we know and get leading to for standard infections that have starting values  0  s0n very close to one the maximal ratio of infectious is figure 4 shows the behaviour of the function and this is what flattening the curve is all about a value of r 0  4 gets a maximum of more than 40 of the population infectious at a single time if 5 need hospital care this implies that a country needs hospital beds for 2 of the population the dotted line leaves the log term out ie is marks the rate of the susceptibles at the peak and by 6 the difference is the rate rt i n of the recovered at the peak to analyze the peak time t i  we us to get an upper bound for the exponential outbreak that implies a lower bound for t i of the form this needs improvement to get a quantitative result about flattening the curve we first evaluate the integral assuming r0  0 and set it equal to an integral over the constant value at the maximum ie we squeeze the area under the curve into a rectangle of length b a under the maximal value ie and if we flatten the curve by letting r 0 tend to 1 from above we see that the length b  a of the above rectangle goes to infinity like r 0 1  r 0  because   tends to 1 if there is no peak eg if r 0    is below 1 either at the beginning or after some political intervention one can repeat the above argument starting with the infectious at some time t looking at the area under i from t to infinity this needs improvement as well here is a detour that is well-known in the sir literature the sir system can be written as and in a new time variable  with d  i n dt one gets the system  the beauty of this is that the roles of  and  are perfectly split like the roles of  and  in the new timescale  increases linearly and  decreases exponentially the basic reproduction number then describes the fixed ratio 10 and the result 9 of section 211 comes back as for the case 0  0 this approach has the disadvantage to conceal the peak within the new timescale and is useless for peak prediction if data for the sir model were fully available one could solve for and we shall use this in section 33 the validity of a sir model can be tested by checking whether the right-hand sides for    and r 0 are roughly constant if data are sampled locally eg before or after a peak the above technique should determine the parameters for the global epidemic ie be useful for either prediction or backward testing however in pandemics like covid-19 the parameters  and  change over time by administrative action this means that they should be considered as functions in the above equations and then their changes may be used for conclusions about the influence of such actions this is intended when media say that r 0 has changed from this viewpoint one can go back to the sir model and consider  and  as control functions that just describe the relation between the variables but the main argument against using 11 is that the data are hardly available this is the concern of the next section now we want to confront the modelling of the previous section with available data this is crucial for maneuvering countries through the epidemics 13 2  in this text we work with the covid-19 data from the cssegisanddata repository of the johns hopkins university 7  they are the only source that provides comparable data on a worldwide scale the numbers there are as cumulative integer valued time series in days from jan 22nd 2020 all these values are absolute numbers not relative to a total population note that the unconfirmed cases are not accessible at all while the confirmed contain the dead and the recovered of earlier days at this point we do not question the integrity of the data but there are many wellknown flaws in particular the values for specific days are partly belonging to previous days due to delays in the chains of data transmission in different countries this is why at some points we shall apply some conservative smoothing of the data finally there are inconsistencies that possibly need data changes for an example consider that usually covid-19 cases lead to recovery or death within a rather fixed period eg k  15  21 days but some johns hopkins data have less new infectioned at day n than the sum of recovered and dead at day n  k and there are countries like germany who deliver data of recovered in a very questionable way the law in germany did not enforce authorities to collect data of recovered and the united kingdom did not report numbers of dead and recovered from places outside the national health system eg from seniors retirement homes both strategies have changed somewhat in the meantime as of early may but the data still keep these flaws we might assume that the dead plus the recovered of the johns hopkins data are the removed of the sir model and that the infectious i  c  r  d of the johns hopkins data are the infectious of the sir model but this is not strictly valid because registration or confirmation come in the way on the other hand one can take the radical viewpoint that facts are not interesting if they do not show up in the johns hopkins data except for the united kingdom the important figures concern covid-19 casualties that are actually registered as such others do not count and serious cases needing hospitalization or leading to death should not go unregistered if they do in certain countries using such data will not be of any help unless other data sources are available if sir modelling does not work for the johns hopkins data it is time to modify the sir technique appropriately and this will be tried in this section an important point for what follows is that the data come as daily values to make this compatible with differential equations we shall replace derivatives by differences to get a first impression about the johns hopkins data figure 5 shows raw data up to day 109 may 10 th  as of this writing the presentation is logarithmic because then linearly increasing or decreasing parts correspond to exponentially increasing or decreasing numbers in the real data many presentations in the media are nonlogarithmic and then all exponential outbreaks look similar the real interesting data are the infectious i  c  r  d in black that show a peak or not the other curves are cumulative the data for other countries tell similar stories and are suppressed the media in particular german tv present covid-19 data in a rather debatable way when mentioning johns hopkins data they provide c d and r separately without stating the most important figures namely i  c  d  r their change and the change of their change when mentioning data of the infectious from the robert koch institute alongside they do not say precisely that these are noncumulative and should be compared to the i  c rd data of the johns hopkins university and in most cases during the outbreak they did not mention the change of the change quite like all other media one can see in figure 5 that germany and south korea have passed the peak of the infectious while france is roughly at the peak and the united states are still in an exponential outbreak the early figures below day 40 are rather useless but then an exponential outbreak is visible in all cases this outbreak changes its slope due to political actions and we shall analyze this later see 3 for a detailed early analysis of slope changes there are strange anomalies in the recovered green france seems not to have delivered any data between days 40 and 58 germany changed the data delivery policy between days 62 and 63 and the uk data for the recovered are a mess it should be noted that the available medical results on the covid-19 disease often state that confirmed will die or survive after a more or less fixed number of days roughly 14 to 21 this would imply that the red curves for the dead and the green curves for the recovered should roughly follow the blue curves for the confirmed with a fixed but measurable delay this is partially observable but much less accurately for the recovered the idea is to define a model that works exclusively with the johns hopkins data but comes close to a sir model without being able to use s since the sir model does not distinguish between recoveries and deaths we set r sir  d jh  r jh and let the infectious be comparable ie and we completely omit the susceptibles from now on we shall omit the subscript jh when we use the johns hopkins data but we shall use sir when we go back to the sir model  defining time series  n and b n that model  and b    s sir n without knowing s sir  this is equivalent to the model c n1 c n  b n i n  i n1  i n  b n i n   n i n  r  d n1  r  d n    n i n that maintains c  i  r  d and we may call it a johns hopkins data model it is very close to a sir model if the time series b n is not considered to be constant but just an approximation of   s sir n by brute force one can consider as a data-driven substitute for   then there is a rather simple observation if r n is smaller than one the infectious decrease it follows from but this is visible in the data anyway and not of much help since r n models r 0 s sir n  it always underestimates r 0  this underestimation gets dramatic when it must be assumed that s sir gets seriously smaller than n at this point it is not intended to forecast the epidemics the focus is on extracting parameters from the johns hopkins data that relate to a background sir-type model figure 6 shows r 0 s sir n estimates via r n for the last four weeks before day 109 ie march 10 th  except for the united states all countries were more or less successful in pressing r 0 below one in all cases s sir n is too close to one to have any influence the variation in r n is not due to the decrease in s sir n but should rather be attributed to political action as mentioned above the estimates for r 0 by r n are always too optimistic for the figure the raw johns hopkins data were smoothed by a double action of a 14 12 14 filter on the logarithms of the data this smoother keeps constants and linear sections of the logarithm invariant ie it does not change local exponential behavior this smoothing was not applied to figure 5  it was by far not strong enough to eliminate the apparent 7-day oscillations that are frequently in the johns hopkins data see the figure data from the robert koch institute in germany have even stronger 7-day variations as long as r n is roughly constant the above approach will always model an exponential outbreak or decay but never a peak because the difference equations are linear it can only help the user to tell if there is a peak ahead or behind depending on r n  r 0 being larger or smaller than 1 if r n is kept below one the confirmed infectious will not increase causing no new threats to the health system then the sn factor will not decrease substantially and a full sir model is not necessary on the other hand if a country manages to keep r n smaller than some r  b   1 it is clear that it takes as long as countries keep the r n clearly below one eg below 12 this would mean that r 0  r n n s sir stays below one if s sir  n2 ie as long as the majority of the population has not been in contact with the sars-cov-2 virus this is good news but observing a small r n can conceal a situation with a large r 0 if s sir n is small this is one reason why countries need to get a grip on the susceptibles nationwide it is tempting to use the above technique for prediction in such a way that the b n and the  n are fitted to a constant or a linear function and using the values of the fit for running the system into the future this is very close to extending the logarithmic plots of figure 5 by lines using pencil and ruler and thus hardly interesting so far the above argument cannot replace a sir model it only interprets the available data however monitoring the johns hopkins data in the above way will be very useful when it comes to evaluate the effectivity of certain measures taken by politicians it will be highly interesting to see how the data of figure 6 continue in particular when countries relax their contact restrictions for cases where one still has to expect r 0  1 eg uk us and sweden around day 90 see figure 6  the challenge remains to predict a possible peak using the estimates from the previous section is questionable because they concern the subpopulation of confirmed and are systematically underestimating r 0  the real sir model will have different parameters and it needs the susceptibles to model a peak or to make the r n estimates realistic so far the johns hopkins data work in a range where sn is still close to one and the susceptibles are considered to be abundant but the bad news for countries with r n  1 is that r n underestimates r 0  anyway if one trusts the above time series as approximations to  and  one can run a sir model provided one is in the case r 0  1 and has reasonable starting values but these are a problem because the unconfirmed infectious and the unconfirmed recovered are not known even if for simplicity one assumes that there are no unconfirmed covid-19 deaths for an unrealistic scenario consider total registration ie all infected are automatically confirmed then the susceptibles in the johns hopkins model would be s n  n c n  n  i n  r n  d n  now the estimate for r 0 must be corrected to r n n s n  r n n n c n  r n 1  c n n c n but this change will not be serious during the outbreak one gets a crude prediction of the peak in case r 0     1 figure 7 shows results for two cases the top shows the case for the united states using data from day 109 may 10 th  and estimating  and  from the data one week before the peak is predicted at day 472 with a total rate of 33 infectious to see how crude the technique is the second plot shows the case of germany using data up to day 75 ie before the peak and the peak is predicted at day 230 with about 16 infected at day 75 r 0 was estimated at 201 but a few days later the estimate went below 1  figure 6  by political intervention changing b n considerably see figure 12 for a much better prediction using data only up to day 67 to get closer to what actually happens one should combine the data-oriented johns hopkins data model with a sir model that accounts for what happens outside of the confirmed we introduce the time series this implies that all deaths occur within the confirmed though this is a highly debatable issue it assumes that persons with serious symptoms get confirmed and nobody dies of covid-19 without prior confirmation the removed from the viewpoint of a global sir model including h and m are h c and thus the sir model is to run this hidden model with constant n  s  m  h  c one needs initial values and good estimates for  and  which are not the ones of the johns hopkins data model of section 33 the johns hopkins variables d and r are linked to the hidden model via c  i  r  d they follow an observable model with instantaneous case death and recovery rates  icd and  icr for the confirmed infectious these rates can be estimated separately from the available johns hopkins data and we shall do this below we call thes rates instantaneous because they artificially attribute the new deaths or recoveries at day n  1 to the previous day not to earlier days in this sense they are rather artificial and we shall address this question they are case rates because they concern the confirmed the observable model is coupled to the hidden model only by c n  any datadriven c n from the observable model can be used to enter the h  c variable of the hidden model but in an unknown ratio conversely any version of the hidden model produces h  c values that do not determine the c part summarizing there is no way to fit the hidden model to the data without additional assumptions various possibilites were tried to connect the hidden to the observable two will be presented now recall that the parameter  icd in the observable model 14 relates case fatalities to the confirmed infectious of the previous day in contrast to this the infection fatality rate in the standard literature denoted by  if here is relating to the infection directly independent of the confirmation and gives the probability to die of covid-19 after infection with the sars-cov-2 virus it is  if  056 by 1 and 066 by 11  but specialized for china recent data from the heinsberg study by streeck et al 10 gives a value of 037 for the heinsberg population in germany the idea to use the infection fatality rate for information about the hidden system comes from 2  the way to use it will depend on how to handle delays and it turned out to be difficult to use these rates in a stable way let us focus on probabilities to die either after an infection or after confirmation of an infection the first is the infection fatality rate given in the literature but what is the comparable case fatality rate  cf when using the johns hopkins data it is clearly not the  icd in 14 giving the ratio of new deaths at day n  1 as a fraction of the confirmed infectious at day n it makes much more sense to use the fact that covid-19 diseases end after k days from confirmation with either death or recovery let us call this the k-day rule suggested values for k range between 14 and 21 following 9  one can estimate the probability p i to die on day i after confirmation and this works in a stable way per country based only on c and d not on the unstable r data in 9 this approach was used to produce r values that comply with the k-day rule but here we use it for estimating the case fatality the technique of 9 performs a fit ie it assigns all new deaths at day n to previous new infections on previous days in a hopefully consistent way minimizing the error in the above formula under variation of the probabilities p i  if the p i are known for days 1 to k the case fatality rate is this argument can also be seen the other way round the new confirmed c n c n1 at day 1 enter into d n1  d n with probability q 1  p 1  into d n2  d n1 with probability q 2  p 2 1  p 1  and so on the rest enters into the new recovered at day n  k with probability q k1 if we set p k1  0 thus the case fatality rate can be expressed as 1  q k1 like above at this point there is a hidden assumption persons that are new to the confirmed at day n are not dead and not recovered the change c n1 c n to the confirmed is therefore understood as the number of new registered infections otherwise one might replace c ni c ni1 by i ni  i ni1 in 15 but this would connect a cumulative function to a non-cumulative function furthermore this would use the unsafe data of the recovered in fact equation 15 is unexpectedly reliable provided one looks at the sum of the probabilities p i  this follows from series of experiments that we do not document fully here in 9  data for 2k days backwards were used for the estimation and results did not change much when more or less data were used or when k was modified here the range 7  k  21 was tested and backlogs of up to 50 days from day 109 as of this writing see figure 8 below for an example larger k lead to somewhat larger fatality rates because the method has more leeway to assign deaths to confirmations but the increase is rather small when k is increased beyond 14 it is remarkable that k  7 suffices for a rather good fit for us uk sweden and italy in contrast to other countries this means that 7 days after confirmation are enough to assign deaths consistently to previous confirmations indicating that a large portion of confirmations concern rather serious cases in general the fit gets better when the backlog is not too large avoiding use of outdated data and the resulting rate does not change much when backlogs are shortened roughly the rule of a backlog of 2k days works well together with k  21 to allow enough leeway to ensure a small fitting error note that all variations of k and the backlog data have a rather small effect on the sum of the p i  while the p i will vary strongly see the first column of table 1 for estimates of case fatality rates for different countries calculated on day 109 may 10 th  these depend strongly on the strategy for confirmation in particular they are high when only serious cases are confirmed eg cases that need hospital care if many more people are tested confirmations will contain plenty of much less serious cases and then the case fatality rates are low the values were entered manually after inspection of a plot of the rates as functions of k and the backlog see figure 8 for how the value 0143 for italy was determined the instantaneous case death rate  icd of 14 for the johns hopkins data comes out around 0004 for germany by direct inspection of the data via table 1 is about 0045 the deaths have to be attributed to different days using the k-day rule they cannot easily be assigned to the previous day without making the rate smaller if the case fatality rates  cf of table 1 are used with the infection fatality rate of  if  0006 one should obtain an estimate of the total infectious if the formula 15 is written as in terms of the previous new infections s ni1  s ni with infection fatality probabilitiesq i  one should maintain and this works by setting in general without using the unstable p i  the quotient  if  cf can be called the detection rate stating the fraction of infectious that is entering confirmation see the second column of table 1  note that all of this is dependent on good estimates of the infection fatality rate and the new value by 10 will roughly double the detection rate for germany all of this is comparable to the findings of 2 and uses the basic idea from there but is executed with a somewhat different technique a simple way to understand the quotient  if  cf as a detection rate is to ask for the probability pc for confirmation if the probability to die after confirmation is  cf  and if there are no deaths outside confirmation then and it is tempting to replace s by m in 17 but this would make m cumulative under political changes of the parameters  and  the estimation of the case fatality rate should be made locally not globally using the experience of 9 and section 431 we shall do this using a fixed k  21 for the k-day rule and data for a fixed backlog of 2k days we need another parameter to make the model work there are many choices and after some failures we selected the constant  iir in a model equation following what was mentioned about instantaneous rates in section 42 this is an instantaneous infection recovery rate relating the new unregistered recovered to the unregistered infections the day before a good value of  iir can come out of an experiment that produces a time series for m and h ie for unregistered infectious and unregistered recovered then the instantaneous infection recovery rate  iir can be obtained directly by the infection recovery rate  ir  1   if does not help much because we need an instantaneous rate that has no interpretation as a probability without additional input we can look at the instantaneous case recovery rate that is available from the johns hopkins data and comes out experimentally to be rather stable the rate  iir must be larger because we now are not in the subpopulation of the confirmed and nobody can die without going first into the population of the confirmed as long as no better data are available we use the formula that accounts for two things 1 the value  icr is increased by the ratio of recovered probabilities for the infected and the confirmed 2 the value  ir is multiplied by a factor for transition to immediate rates and this factor is the transition factor for the confirmed recovered the above strategy is debatable and may be the weakest point of this approach however others turned out to be worse mainly due to instability of results  in 19 the rate  ir is fixed and the rate  cr is determined locally via section 434 the rate  icr follows from the time series r n1  r n i n   icr as in 14 this works for countries that provide useful data for the recovered in that case and in others to follow below we can take the time series itself as long as we have data for prediction we estimate the constant from the time series using a fixed backlog of m days from the current day since many data have a weekly oscillation due to data being not properly delivered during weekends the backlog should not be less than 7 but for certain countries like the united kingdom the data for the recovered are useless in such cases we employ the technique of 9 to estimate the recovered using the k-day rule and a backlog of 2k days like in section 434 for the case fatality rates we now have everything to run the hidden model but we do it first for days that have available johns hopkins data this leads to estimations of s m and h from the observed data of the johns hopkins source with the parameters from above we use the new relations the first equation is a priori and determines s one could run it over the whole range of available data if the parameter  cf were fixed like  ci  but since we estimate it via section 43 that resulted in table 1  we should use section 434 to calculate  cf locally the second is a posteriori and lets h follow from m but we postpone it the third model equation in 13 will be handled defining  n by brute force via we then set up the second model equation for m as that can be solved if an initial value is prescribed the first model equation in 13 is used to define  n by the model is run by executing 22  since the populations are large the starting values for s are not important the starting value for h is irrelevant for h itself because only differences enter but it determines the starting value for m due to the balance equation anyway it turns out experimentally that the starting values do not matter if the model is started early the hidden model 13 depends much more strongly on c than on the starting values see figure 12 for an example along with the calculation of s m and h we run the calculation of the time series  n and  n using 23 and 21 these yield estimates for the parameters of the full sir model that replace the earlier time series from the johns hopkins data model in section 33 the figures to follow in section 52 show the original johns hopkins data together with the hidden variables s m and h that are calculated by the above technique note that the only ingredients beside the johns hopkins data are the number k for the k-day rule the infection fatality rate  if from the literature and the backlog m for estimation of constants from time series to let the combined model predict the future or to check what it would have predicted if used at an earlier day we take the completed model of the previous sections up to a day n and use the values s n  m n  h n  c n  i n  r n and d n for starting the prediction with the variable hc  h c we use the recursion this needs fixed values of  and  that we estimate from the time series for  n and  n by using a backlog of m days following section 452 the instantaneous rates  icr and  icd can be calculated via their time series as in 18 and 16 using the same backlog we do this at the starting point of the prediction and then the model runs in what can be called a no political change mode examples will follow in section 52 the first part of the full model 24 runs as a standard sir model for the variables s m and h c and inherits the properties of these as described in section 2 it does not use the  iir parameter of the second equation in 20 and it uses the first the other way round now determining c from s not s from c  the bracket is positive if which is enough for practical purposes figure 9 shows predictions on day 109 may 10th for germany sweden us and uk from the top the plots for countries behind their peak are rather similar to the one for germany the other three countries are selected because they still have to face their peak if no action is taken to change the parameters the estimated r 0 values are 059 137 334 and 120 respectively note that these are not directly comparable to figure 6  because they are the fitted constant to the backlog of a week and using 21 and 23 instead of 12  the black and magenta curves are the estimated m and h values while the s values are hardly visible on the top the hidden m and h in black and magenta follow roughly the observable i and c in blue and cyan but with a factor due to the detection rate that is different between countries see table 1  to evaluate the predictions one should go back and start the predictions for earlier days to compare with what happened later figure 11 shows overplots of predictions for days 81 95 and 109 each a fortnight apart the starting points of the predictions are marked by asterisks again now each prediction has slightly different estimates for s m and h due to different available data recall that the determination of these variables is done while there are johns hopkins data available following section 45 and will be dependent on the data-driven estimations described there in particular the case fatality rates and detection rates of table 1 change with the starting point of the prediction and they determine s m and h backwards see the figure for sweden all test runs were made for the infection fatality rate  if  0005 the delay k  21 for estimating case fatalities and a backlog of 7 days when estimating constants out of recent values of time series the choice  if  0005 is somewhat between 056 from 1  066 from 11  and 037 from 10  new information on infection fatality rates should be included as soon as they are available the johns hopkins data were smoothed by a double application of the 14 12 14 filter on the logarithms like for figure 6  for uk and sweden the data for the confirmed recovered r were replaced by the 21-day rule estimation via 9 and a backlog of 42 days the original data were too messy to be useful unfortunately for an early case in germany figure 12 shows the prediction based on data of day 67 march 27 th  on the side the figure contains a wide variation of the starting value h  n  s  c at the starting point by multipliers between 132 and 32 this has hardly any effect on the results the peak of about 20 million infected is predicted on day 111 may 12 th  with roughly a million confirmed and about 20000 casualties at the peak and about 100000 finally note that the real death count is about 7500 on may 11 th  and the prediction of the day in figure 9  targets a final count of below 10000 the parameter changes by political measures turned out to be rather effective like in many countries that applied similar strategies but since parts of the population want to go back to their previous lifestyle all of this is endangered and the figures should be monitored carefully of course all of this makes sense only under the assumption that reality follows the model in spite of all attempts to design a model that follows reality so far the model presented here seems to be useful combining theory and practically available data it is data-driven to a very large extent using only the infection fatality rate from outside for prediction and the approximation 19 for calibration on the downside there is quite a number of shortcomings latest data but it needs changes as soon as new information on the hidden infections come in  there may be better ways of estimating the hidden part of the epidemics however it will be easy to adapt the model to other parameter choices if time series for the unknown variables get available the model can easily be adapted to being data-driven by the new data  the treatment of delays is unsatisfactory in particular infected persons get infected immediately and the k-day rule is not followed at all places in the model but the rule is violated as well in the data 9   there is no stochastics involved except for simple things like estimating constants by least squares or for certain probabilistic arguments on the side eg in section 431 but it is not at all clear whether there are enough data to do a proper probabilistic analysis  as long as there is no probabilistic analysis there should be more simulations under perturbations of the data and the parameters a few were included eg for section 431 and figures 8 and 12  but a large number was performed in the background when preparing the paper making sure that results are stable but there are never too many test simulations  other models were not considered eg the classical ones with delays 5 6   under certain circumstances epidemics do not show an exponential outbreak in particular if they hit only locally and a prepared population see figure 13 for the covid-19 cases in gttingen and vicinity  estimates for the peak time in section 213 need improvement  same for the underpinning of flattening the curve in section 214 matlab programs are available on request   utilitarianism and the pandemic accepted article julian savulescu ingmar persson dominic wilkinson  professor    john radcliffe hospital  there are no egalitarians in a pandemic the scale of the challenge for health systems and public policy means that there is an ineluctable need to prioritise the needs of the many it is impossible to treat all citizens equally and a failure to carefully consider the consequences of actions could lead to massive preventable loss of life in a pandemic there is a strong ethical need to consider how to do most good overall utilitarianism is an influential moral theory which states that the right action is the action which is expected to produce the greatest good it offers clear operationalizable principles in this paper we provide a summary of how utilitarianism could inform two challenging questions that have been important in the early phase of the pandemic 1 triage which patients should receive access to a ventilator if there is overwhelming demand outstripping supply 2 lockdown how should countries decide when to implement stringent social restrictions balancing preventing deaths from covid-19 with causing deaths and reducing in wellbeing from other causes our aim is not to argue that utilitarianism is the only relevant ethical theory or in favour of a purely utilitarian approach however clearly considering which options will do the most good overall will help societies identify and consider the necessary cost of other values societies may choose either to embrace or not to embrace the utilitarian course but with a clear understanding of the values involved and the price they are willing to pay  when individuals demand a scarce resource for themselves or their family members this also brings us to the issue of whether the principle of beneficence should be impartial and accord the same moral weight to the good of all other individuals or whether it should allow greater weight to the good of those who are close to us and to human over non-human beings for the purpose of discussing what policies societies should adopt to deal with pandemics it is reasonable to assume impartiality a further issue is what constitutes goodness and badness for individuals according to the most familiar theory hedonism what is intrinsically good consists in various positive experiences of pleasure and happiness what is intrinsically bad consists in negative experiences of pain and unhappiness hedonism is however frequently criticized for being too narrow in not recognizing that what we are not aware of can be good or bad for us eg that our partners deceive us or that the state surveys our behaviour so cleverly that we never notice it for such reasons a wider conception of what is intrinsically good or bad for us than hedonism will be assumed here though to determine its precise import would take us too far afield this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved some moral theories imply that there is a stronger or more stringent moral reason to omit doing harm than to benefit thus they imply that there is a stronger reason to avoid making things worse for somebody by killing them causing them injury or pain than to benefit them by preventing them from being killed injured etc with respect to pandemics considerable moral weight has been attached to harms such as death and disease which can be prevented by various constraints therefore for the present discussion it is better to proceed on the assumption that there is no significant moral difference between harming and omitting to benefit utilitarianism typically accepts that instances of goodness and badness can be aggregated in a quantitative fashion thus consider a very mild pain which is caused by a physical stimulus of one unit and which lasts for ten minutes now compare one hundred instances of such a pain either spread out over 100 lives or over one life lasting many decades with a single instance of excruciating pain caused by 75 units of the physical stimulus according to a standard utilitarian calculus the former outcome is worse than the latter but this seems implausible most of us would prefer 100 instances of mild pain dispersed over our lives than ten minutes of excruciating pain it might be thought that this issue is crucial in the present context since we will have to balance the deaths of a smaller number of people against the smaller burdens for much larger number of people we will however see that what is morally relevant from a utilitarian perspective isnt death in itself but rather the length and quality of life the deceased would have had if they hadnt died all rather than what action is expected to maximize what is good for all but our best guide to what will actually happen is what is expected to happen on the best available evidence so when we decide what to do we have to go by what is predicted to be best this is true in most situations although in some special cases we know that what is expected to be best is not what will actually be best 4  the expected utility of an action is the sum of the products of the probability and value of each of the possible outcomes of that action there are two broad schools of utilitarianism according to act utilitarianism the right act is the act which produces the best consequences according to rule utilitarianism the right rule is the rule which produces the best consequences the law is often an instantiation of rule utilitarianism laws are chosen because they bring about the best consequences these versions of utilitarianism can come apart sometimes an act will clearly have better consequences or no adverse consequences but a rule proscribes that act principles or laws around non-discrimination are examples of this not considering a persons advanced age or severe disability eg severe dementia in the allocation of resources including ventilators might mean that another person is unable to access that resources who would have gained greater benefit from it against act utilitariansim yet the rule might still overall have better consequences if the non-discrimination rule has over-riding benefits the two different schools of utilitarianism can be combined the father of modern utilitarianism richard hare argued that moral thinking occurs at two levels intuitive and critical and that we should move between these depending on the circumstances 5 at the intuitive level we have many rough rules of thumb that can be rapidly deployed without protracted and demanding reflection dont kill dont steal be honest etc these enable us to act efficiently in everyday life during a pandemic doctors and other decision makers require rules of thumb for example when faced with multiple simultaneous patients in the emergency department it is important to have a way of reaching a decision quickly about which patient to attend to first triage rules are potentially justified by a form of rule utilitarianism that enable rapid intuitive decisions critical level utilitarianism requires choosing the action which will maximize the good when we are thinking in the cool calm hour as butler put it with all the facts at hand hare imagined a decision-maker who had perfect knowledge of the outcomes of all available options he called them a utilitarian archangel in complex situations where there is time to do so we must try to rise to the more reflective and deliberative critical level and ask what action we should endorse what really is the right answer hare argues that in such situations we should employ act utilitarianism this corresponds to system 1 and 2 thinking in psychology 6  we will explore some of the implications of critical level utilitarianism for the current covid-19 pandemic we will also describe plausible rules of thumb that would tend to maximize utility and would be useful in emergency and urgent situations box 1 illustrates two questions that have been prominent in the early phase of this pandemic the lockdown question how should we balance preventing deaths from covid-19 with causing deaths and reducing in wellbeing from other causes there are several rules of thumb which can guide rapid decision making about these kinds of cases one utilitarian rule of thumb is to save the greatest number other things being equal this rule could be applied to the lockdown question by assessing how many lives would be lost if lockdown is applied or not applied it could also be used for the triage question in practice this would mean considering the following variables if jason has a 90 chance of recovery and alessandro has a 10 chance other things being equal you should use your ventilator for jason indeed if you treat people like jason rather than people like alessandro you will save 9 people instead of 1 for every 10 treated that is why probability is a relevant consideration 8 pandemic clemens t popham f boyle p 2015  what is the effect of unemployment on allcause mortality a cohort study using propensity score matching  in a setting of scarcity duration of time on a ventilator has implications for the numbers of lives saved the longer one person will be on a ventilator the more people who potentially die because they cannot get access to breathing support if alessandro needs a ventilator for 4 weeks and 4 others including jason need it for one week the choice is between saving one person or 4 people so doctors should take duration of use into account when resources are limited resources equate to numbers of lives the more resources a treatment or a person use the fewer are available for others imagine that alessandro and jason had identical chances of survival but alessandro needed a treatment that required 3 staff to administer the treatment eg ecmo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation -essentially cardiac bypass and jason needed a treatment that required only one staff member eg mechanical ventilation we can potentially save 3 people with ventilation for every patient who we save with ecmo ecmo should be a lower priority than ventilation according to utilitarianism how long a benefit will be enjoyed matters -it affects the amount of good produced thus for life saving treatment treatment which saves peoples lives for longer is to be preferred over treatments which save life for shorter periods according to this criterion priority should be given to the younger jason rather than the older alessandro because alessandro is expected to live less long if successfully treated if it were jason who was expected to die sooner utilitarianism would support treating alessandro even though he is older age is thus a de facto measure of length because older people tend to die sooner than younger people utilitarianism tends to favour saving the lives of the younger however age itself does this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved not matter it is the expected length of the benefit this is why utilitarianism is not unfairly discriminatory and not ageist in an ethically problematic sense we will discuss discrimination further below length of life is also relevant for the lockdown question it is the length of life extended that matters this has implication for evaluation of current policy in the uk the decision to implement national lockdown at the end of march was influenced by modelling at imperial college figure 1  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved the uk government opted to try to reduce deaths to 20 000 but it was not clear from the modelling figure of 500 000 how many of these people would have died anyway from other causes 10 or relatively soon after not contracting covid-19 every year more than 600 000 people die in the uk for utilitarians the numbers of lives saved is irrelevant -it is how long these lives would be prolonged by the intervention they estimated that such a package would cost between 75000-650000 per qaly 12 reduce covid-19 mortality and healthcare demand httpsdoiorg102556177482 retrieved from httpswwwimperialacukmediaimperial-collegemedicinesphidegidafellowshipsimperial-college-covid19-npi-modelling-16-03-2020pdf  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved the us government subsequently approved a 2tn stimulus package that suggests that such measures are unlikely to be cost effective according to the usual thresholds applied to the costs of medical interventions to save lives for example the upper limit for cost effectiveness of an intervention in the us is often taken to be about 100 000 per year of life saved 13 there are two points to make about such an analysis the first is that assessing the utilitarian answer to the lockdown question is highly dependent on the specific factual answers-the harm averted by acting the harm caused by acting it is exceedingly difficult to determine which course while interventions to prevent covid-19 may be cost effective though this seems perhaps unlikely they are unlikely to be the most cost-effective actions that we could take there are likely to be better investments for utilitarians as an example the gates foundation has estimated that global eradication of malaria by the year 2040 would cost up to 120billion 14 such an initiative costing only 115 th as much as the us pandemic stimulus package 15  would potentially save 11 million lives  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved utilitarians consider not just how long someone will live after treatment but how well they will live they consider quality of life important this could be relevant to the triage question as suggested in the quote from the office for civil rights at the start of this paper consider an extreme example the end point of dementia is unconsciousness imagine that of our two patients with respiratory failure alessandro is still working in possession of all of his faculties jason by contrast in this version of the case has end stage dementia according to utilitarians we should treat alessandro if we cannot treat both jason would derive zero benefit from being kept alive in an unconscious state indeed this would apply potentially even if jason with dementia had a higher chance of survival or were going to survive for longer what about lesser degrees of cognitive impairment or other disabilities according to utilitarians these would also be considered in making allocation decisions if they affect the persons wellbeing however comparisons of overall wellbeing between individuals are not straightforward it is not necessarily the case that someone with a disability would have lower wellbeing than someone with a disability probably the most profound question in ethics is what makes a persons life good or constitutes well-being philosophers have debated this question for thousands of years answers include happiness desire fulfilment or flourishing as human animals which includes having deep relationships with others and being autonomous amongst other things 16 as a heuristic for triage it may be that in developed countries a threshold is set at a level where overall well-being is certain to be low 17 one practical cut off would be unconsciousness or severe disorders of consciousness such as minimally conscious state it is highly unlikely to be  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved cost effective to provide intensive care fo a patient who is permanently minimally conscious 18 lines could be drawn where there is more uncertainty  and may need to be in countries with more limited resources or if the demand were much greater for example the threshold might be set at the ability to recognise and respond meaningfully with other people so on this approach cognitive impairments which reduced the capacity to have minimal human relationships would reduce priority for treatment as a proxy for believed reduced wellbeing 19  quality of life may also be relevant to the lockdown question if the life years saved by lockdown were likely to be of reduced quality that would influence how much benefit overall is gained and therefore what economic cost would be worth incurring for utilitarians how an outcome arises is morally irrelevant it makes no difference if it is the result of an act or an omission doctors patients and families however hold that there is a moral difference between acts and omissions many people hold a causal account of responsibility they tend to think that we are responsible for the consequences of our acts but not for our omissions thus people tend to believe that withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment is morally worse than withholding lifesustaining treatment this folk commitment to a causal sense of responsibility and the actsomission distinction has a number of bad consequences it means that there is considerable attention in pandemic guidelines to decisions about initiation of treatment the triage question is largely or entirely focused on whether to start treatment  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved withholding of treatment from patients with poorer prognosis is thought to be ethically acceptable however some poor prognosis patients will do well and a trial of treatment might provide more accurate prognostic information thus under conditions of uncertainty a trial of treatment with the possibility of withdrawal would be preferable to withholding treatment 20 utilitarianism would reject the idea of employing any form of first come first served to decide about treatment the timing of when a patient arrives needing treatment is morally irrelevant to whether or not they should receive treatment this is a principle that we have elsewhere labelled the principle of temporal neutrality according to utilitarianism doctors should be prepared to withdraw treatment from poor prognosis patients in order to enable the treatment of better prognosis patients if they arrive later consideration of acts and omissions is also relevant to wider social questions raised by the pandemic failing to implement a good policy is equivalent to actively implementing a bad policy when the outcome of the two decisions is the same so utilitarians hold policy makers responsible not only for what they do but for what they fail to do failing to implement other policies which result in avoidable foreseeable deaths is equivalent to killing for utilitarians this means that policy makers are just as blameworthy for failing to eradicate malaria as they would have been if they had failed to act in response to coronavirus according to utilitarianism all the consequences of actions both short and long term direct and indirect are relevant to decisions thus it may be relevant to consider not only the benefit to the person directly affected by an action for example by being placed on a ventilator but also others this can be called social benefit or social worth in pandemics one rule of thumb likely to maximize utility would be to give priority to health care workers those providing key services and others who are necessary to provide essential benefits to others this has been applied in many countries including the uk to testing for coronavirus however it might also apply to access to ventilators or other medical treatments a reason given for this is that it will potentially mean that they can also return to work sooner 21 what about the social worth of others should criminals have a lower priority in accessing limited resources what about scientists working on a vaccine related to social benefits is the issue of dependents should pregnant women and parents of dependent children be given greater priority for health care developing rules of thumb for assessing social worth is ethically and epistemically complex liable to abuse and difficult to enforce fairly critical level utilitarianism would likely not endorse such priority rules perhaps beyond prioritising critical essential services workers which is relatively clear cut and easy to enforce and has wide social acceptance utilitarianism is sensitive to the potential for abuse to its operationalised principles if there is a risk that a principle will be abused this should be taken into account in operationalising it or not for example social worth is easily abused by the powerful to claim privilege and priority for utilitarians we are morally responsible to the extent that the effects of our acts or omissions are foreseeable and we have control over them this implies that failing to take a course of action which would bring about more good or avert more harm is equivalent to intentionally causing that harm the moral responsibility for choosing an inferior policy is high for utilitarians and actions are subsequently blameworthy utilitarianism is a very demanding theory in several ways whenever we fail to foreseeably and avoidably bring about the best state of affairs we are morally responsible and blameworthy if bringing about the best policy requires more research we are responsible for the deaths which occur because that research was not done another issue in resource allocation is responsibility for illness many people have the intuition that responsibility for illness should be taken into account in the allocation of limited resources smokers should receive lower priority for lung transplants drinkers for liver transplants the uk government has also encouraged the public to take responsibility for their health 22 in the case of covid-19 people with various comorbidities have worse prognoses for example type ii diabetes sometimes described as a lifestyle disease is one such comorbidity there are numerous problems with trying to use responsibility for illness in the allocation of  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved responsibility or the disposition to behaviour that led to ill health is only relevant for utilitarians insofar as it affects probability length or quality of survival this is in line with how responsibility is generally used in the nhs 24 utilitarianism seeks to avoid biases emotions intuitions or heuristics that prevent the most good being realised for example humans are insensitive or numb to large numbers 25 they are also more moved by a single identifiable individual suffering than by large numbers of anonymous individuals suffering each to the same extent this is the so-called rule of rescue 26  thus they will be motivated to alleviate the suffering of a single highly publicised individual rather than taking action that prevents a larger amount of suffering to unknown or unidentifiable individuals to some extent national responses to covid-19 might represent a massive form of the rule of rescue probably most relevant to political decision-making is bias towards the near future the desire to avoid deaths now is stronger than the desire to avoid deaths in the future it is psychologically easier to impose severe lockdown now in the name of saving lives threatened now even if the toll of loss of life would be greater in the future there is some evidence that the lockdown and related factors such as reduced access to medical care is leading to additional deaths from causes other than coronavirus 27 it might be anticipated that there will be large numbers of future deaths caused by the economic downturn induced by the pandemic after the 2008 financial crash it is estimated that 250 000 excess cancer deaths just in oecd countries these future and non-identifiable deaths might be greater than or less than those prevented by lockdown they are hard to predict which is one reason that they are difficult to take into account however they are just as ethically relevant as the deaths caused by coronavirus we should not ignore them because they are less psychologically real and motivating utilitarianism aims to the maximize the good impartially conceived statistical lives matter as much as identifiable lives another bias is to ones family and friends according to utilitarianism we should give equal weight to the lives of strangers even those in other countries the effects on the pandemic in africa are yet to be documented or manifest given that there are fewer advanced life support systems the mortality is likely to be greater utilitarianism would favour diverting resources there if the effects would be greater much of ordinary decision-making is driven by emotion biases and heuristics thus much of utilitarianism will strike ordinary people as counterintuitive the above rules of thumb could be assembled into an algorithm for allocation of ventilators  the algorithm divides decision-making into stages and prioritises on the basis of different criteria depending on the availability of resources for example it starts by giving highest priority to those with the highest chance of surviving and needing the lowest duration of treatment this would maximise the numbers of lives saved if there are sufficient ventilators to treat all patients with at least a moderate chance of surviving there would be no need to invoke other criteria thus for example health care systems with ample pre-existing intensive care capacity or who have been able to expand their capacity acutely might have no need to ration on the basis of life expectancy or quality of life if there are insufficient ventilators additional principles might be invoked as noted utilitarianism does not necessarily seek to save most lives but would aim to achieve the most well-being overall including elements of both length of life and quality of life at a second level triage might assess both of these factors for patients in need of treatment in practice however estimation of predicted quality adjusted life years for individual patients is highly complex and may be uncertain it would be quicker to set a threshold of length and quality of life worth saving as an example we have suggested that a health system under severe pressure might elect to only provide mechanical ventilation to patients predicted to survive for at least 5 years with normal quality of life but the specific threshold used will depend on the level of resource availability and on the demand while the triage question lends itself to heuristics and the development of a rule that might generate the best outcome overall it is difficult to know what intuitive-level response would be best for the lockdown question because of the scale of the impact of the pandemic there is a danger that rapid rule-based responses might go badly wrong and lead to much worse outcome overall instead this is a question that would be better answered by drawing on critical level utilitarianism in large part because of uncertainty there are different views about which strategy for entering or leaving lockdown would generate the best outcome overall for example this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved there remains debate about whether the approach in sweden avoiding a national lockdown is better or worse than the approach of swedens scandinavian neighbour norway which it might be that conditions all over sweden will soon be worse than in norway and denmark because of the absence of a national lockdown however it is possible that norway and denmarks approach might lead to more deaths at a later stage either because of further surges of the virus when lockdown is relaxed more importantly as we have argued the number of deaths from covid-19 at a given point in time is not decisive the question is which strategy will prevent the most deaths from any cause and more importantly preserve the most years of life in full heath we must keep in mind the prospect of wider harms to the community as a result of lockdown and the economic consequences it is difficult to know what overall strategy would be best there are several clear points though about how utilitarianism would inform a policy response to the lockdown question utilitarianism is highly dependent on accurate information about the world it requires good evidence without good evidence it is less likely that we would choose means that will bring about the most good utilitarianism is thus complementary to science-it requires science thus utilitarianism will urge more research to get better estimates of consequences and probabilities from a wide range of possible courses of action utilitarianism invites scientific inquiry the swedish approach to lockdown has been informed by epidemiological models of the impact of coronavirus that were lower and less dramatic than some of the models used elsewhere for example in the uk 29 any modelling or data that is used to inform decision-making should be openly available and subject to peer review if the evidence changes or the modelling needs to be revised policy should also change this means that countries might need to change their policy that could mean relaxing lockdown or implementing stricter lockdown the uk government changed tack in its response to coronavirus in late march in response to revised modelling 30 that does necessarily mean that the previous policy was mistaken as noted utilitarianism directs decisions on the basis of expected utility where our expectations change decisions should change too for example in order to get better estimates of true mortality utilitarianism would support random population testing to see the incidence of covid-19 in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic community members sometimes the opportunity costs of gathering more information or evidence will be prohibitive when urgent action is needed in these cases it is important that beliefs are as rational as possible they should result from wide expert dialogue embracing the possibility of dissensus 31 critical level utilitarianism requires impartial and equal consideration of the well-being of all sentient creatures in this case it requires consideration of people now and in the future as well as people without coronavirus who might be affected by lockdown it includes the wellbeing of all people old and young sick and well in ones own country and internationally this means that it is critical to assess both the wellbeing costs of covid-19 and the wellbeing costs of lockdown there is currently huge attention to quantifying the numbers of cases of covid-19 infection and the number of consequent deaths however there is much less attention to the possible consequences of lockdown measures for people without coronavirus recent figures at the end of april suggest that the uk has had a large increase in all-cause mortalitythe highest in europe and that this rate has not been decreasing even as reported deaths from 30 stewart h boseley s walker p  elliott l 2020 pm tells britons to avoid non-essential travel and contact the guardian retrieved from

wellbeing from all causes in order to inform decisions deaths or illness from covid-19 might be greater in number than other causes or they might not but they are not ethically more important than those from other causes lockdown measures themselves will have direct morbidity and mortality through denial of medical treatment as well as indirect effects through economic recession one estimate is that 25 million jobs will be lost world wide 33 with associated loss of wellbeing and death according to utilitarianism the right policy is the one which maximises well-being overall across all people across all countries utilitarianism embraces radical impartial equality -all well-being and deaths are equal other things being equal the cause of loss of well-being does not matter thus a utilitarian policy will only invest in preventing loss of life from covid-19 provided it is the most efficient way of saving all lives we have noted already that other global health priorities might be considerably more cost-  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved own already well resourced health care systems would yield much greater benefit for lmic that might include making ventilators available poor countries have been outbid by wealthy countries in the scramble to purchase ventilators 35 it might include providing lmic with less costly but potentially effective ways of averting the crisis for example vietnam has been cited as an exemplar using mass testing and contact tracing to prevent spread and reporting zero covid-19 deaths at the end of april 36  policy makers in lmic may benefit from some of the modelling and scientific expertise available in other countries to support their decision-making it has been questioned whether isolation will work in africa or whether it will kill more young people through its economic effects and subsequent malnutrition 37 for utilitarians policy will need to be sensitive to context and facts about individuals and local communities the policy which is best for one country may be worst for another utilitarianism is a theory with no national boundaries for utilitarianism well-being is all that matters liberty and rights are only important insofar as they secure well-being thus a utilitarian approach to the lockdown question may be prepared to override the right to privacy or liberty to protect well-being march

protected by copyright all rights reserved vietnam singapore taiwan and china have used methods such as tracing contacts and enforcing self-isolation using mobile phone data with severe penalties for failure to comply in singapore it is up to 6 months gaol 38  these countries have been highly effective at containing covid-19 more so than liberal western countries with greater emphasis on rights and liberties utilitarians support the east asian approach of constraining liberty and privacy to promote security and wellbeing this approach also appears cost-effective while delayed response may not be one recent suggestion has been an app which facilitates contract tracing 39  however participation in the program is meant to be voluntary people would need to agree to share information about their whereabouts and health status utilitarianism would favour a more coercive approach if this is more effective those who favour such voluntary programmes give greater weight to consent and privacy than well-being and life this is a value choice it prioritises individual rights matter more than overall benefit of course countries are free to pursue individual freedom but if the liberty based approach is less effective it will necessarily come at the cost of additional cases of covid-19 and additional deaths importantly the extent of the liberty restriction or rights violation should be commensurate with the effect on well-being utilitarianism would support isolating certain groups if the benefit to them was greater or the benefit to others was greater thus a utilitarian approach to lockdown might favour selective isolation of the elderly and other vulnerable groups if that was the most cost-effective way to to securing overall well-being an exception to this would be when the restriction of liberty of low risk groups is necessary to secure large collective benefits this justifies for example vaccinating children who are at low risk of flu complications to protect elderly who cant mount effective immune responses and are at more risk 40  it would also support challenge studies being performed voluntarily on low risk populations for a covid-19 vaccine eg young people it is often objected that utilitarianism leads to discrimination against those in protected categories 41 such as the elderly disabled women ethic minority groups etc  42 for example in covid-19 the elderly men people with obesity and black and minority ethnic individuals have a worse prognosis than other groups utilitarians it is argued will give lower priority to these groups for access to limited resources and a higher priority to isolating them which is discrimination the first issue at hand is the accuracy of the information for example apparent differences in mortality may be due to faster spread amongst different groups in the community meaning there is uneven distribution of cases in the first place we still do not know the true number of cases due to testing shortages in nearly all countries the presence or absence of different groups in high-risk occupations in addition to uneven distribution of cases there may be a dosedependent effect of the viral load on the severity of illness making some workers more vulnerable existing co-morbidities that are correlated with different groups but unrelated to them and should be considered separately or poorer care due to bias or lack of access moreover there may be alternate measures utilitarianism fails if it is applied unscientifically and without fine-grained information if the evidence associated a group of people with higher mortality is indeed accurate and predictive of a higher mortality the association of suffient strength and the proposed policy required and effective then assigning resources or burdens such as lockdown selectively is no more discriminatory than policies such as the isolation of people on the basis of risk of infection such as those who have travelled to high-risk areas or been in contact with someone who has covid-19 this was the early strategy 43  nevertheless there are still reasons to reject policies that give lower priorities to these groups in particular these groups with the exception of males have already been disadvantaged and indeed this disadvantage may even be the direct cause of their vulnerability to covid-19 justice requires that they not be further disadvantaged accepting the validity of justice need not mean rejecting utilitarianism utilitarians must consider all the effects of their policies and actions if some policy will perpetuate or exacerbate discrimination or injustice with concomitant effects on well-being these must be considered loss of short term utility is justified by the larger long term gains of a more just society in any case as we outlined at the beginning of this paper utilitarianism is not necessarily a complete answer one can sacrifice utility for other values thus there might be straightforwardly utilitarian reasons for treating different groups in the same way the resulting fractures in society would ultimately cause a greater loss of well-being or there might be pure justice reasons upholding central values such as justice is more important than the net difference in expected health outcomes a key aspect of the law on discrimination is proportionality in a pandemic very large numbers of lives are at stake equality even for those opposed to utilitarianism is only one value amongst others discrimination may be proportionate if the stakes are high enough and alternative measures are not available 44  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved one prominent objection to utilitarianism is that it fails to respect the separateness of persons 45  one instantiation of this problem which is relevant to pandemic management is that utilitarianism can favour very small risk reductions over very large numbers of persons rather than the saving of one long life small goods can be summed to outweigh one large good insofar as this is a problem it can be avoided in practice by only comparing and summing comparable goods for example lives for example one could count only the saving of lives or the saving of a life for a sufficiently long period of time say one year as a minimum good to be counted this vice can also be a virtue the significant misery that a large number of people experience during lockdown unemployment depression being victims of domestic violence etc should not be ignored and must be recognised as an ethical cost if that wellbeing loss is great enough it could outweigh the spectacular and publicised loss of a few years of life of relative few utilitarianism is a demanding and counterintuitive theory why should we consider it if the utilitarian course of action is not adopted someone often many people will suffer or die avoidably there may be good reasons such as the preservation of liberty to sacrifice well-being or lives but such choices need to be made transparently and in full awareness of their ethical cost one must have good reasons to deliberately choose a course of action that will be worst overall policy is often driven by politics or popular opinion not ethics this is morally wrong much of ethics in the public sphere involves social signalling moralism and sometimes wishful thinking for example trying to wish away difficult ethical dilemmas careful consideration of the consequences of our actions requires us to face the facts and our values a utilitarian approach is not simple or easy it requires that we choose the course of action that will benefit most people to the greatest degree however difficult or counterintuitive that is there is some support for utilitarianism in one survey investigating the publics views on how to allocate intensive care beds among critically ill infants we found the general public widely supported utilitarian allocations 46  they supported allocating the intensive care bed to save the infant with a greater chance of survival who would have a longer life or less disability they also supported saving the greater number this suggests that there may be public support for the algorithm that we have proposed for the triage question when people understand that there is an unavoidable need to choose between patients they appear to recognise that securing the most benefit overall is both logical and ethical one of the psychological biases which dominates decision making is loss aversion losses loom larger than gains and when we evaluate a policy we are liable to focus on the negatives rather than the positives thus a government such as east asian governments who radically curtail liberty and protect health and security are criticized for being overly authoritarian liberal governments that protect liberty and incur greater infection risks such as the uk and australia are criticised for failing to protect the vulnerable and secure public health there is no win the in the court of public opinion that is why we need in the cool calm hour to set our policy objectives and priorities utilitarianism gives a clear framework for that and it gives criteria to judge success the universal common ethical currency is well-being what matters to each of us is how well our lives go this is the very heart and basis of utilitarianism it takes an impartial approach to   covid-19 wait for a novel drug or act with the age old drug - do we have a choice pugazhenthan thangaraju meenalotchini guruthalingam prakash sajitha venkatesan eswaran thangaraju   letter to editor with the limited options available countries like india completely rely upon the world health organization who guidelines and supportive management in treating the sarscov2 infectioncovid-19 1 the premier research institute of india the indian council for medical research icmr has rolled out its protocol or the standard operating procedure sop for the collection and testing of the samples of suspected cases of sars-cov2 2 in a recent notification the icmr has confirmed the isolation of 11 isolates from the patients of sars-cov2 3 they have commented that it will take another one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine against the novel coronavirus which will require the mandatory field trials in a recent scientific report the scientists from china the epicenter of covid-19 have tried their hands on the age-old antimalarial drug chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 4 recently the doctors from one of the best medical college hospitals in rajasthan india have treated a covid-19 patient a tourist from italy with 3 groups of drugs the anti-hiv drugs ritonavir and lopinavir the anti-influenza drug oseltamivir and the anti-malarial drug the chloroquine 5 according to the doctors the patient has been tested negative after the treatment with their protocol the patients husband who also tested positive for coronavirus is under non-invasive ventilatory support is also being treated with the same regimen and he is stable according to the treating physicians the delay in the recovery of this patient was suspected to be due to the already existing lung pathology the government of india is taking all the efforts in keeping the situation under control by spreading awareness on covid-19 through mass communication to the public the government is also keen on finding out an effective treatment modality to treat the covid-19 patients hence the option of using the already available drugs like lopinavir ritonavir oseltamivir and chloroquine would be the best choice on 13th march 2020 the icmr has released a protocol for public health emergency which includes lopinavir and ritonavir 6 they have given a set of inclusion criteria to whom this regimen can be used the inclusion criteria include high-risk patients such as patients who are 60 years of age patients with hypertension diabetes mellitus renal failure chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons these high-risk patients have been included in the inclusion criteria as these are the patients who may succumb to the covid-19 due to their co-morbid conditions we also know the fact that this regimen cannot be generalized to treat all the patients of covid-19 without proper scientific evidence the antiviral properties of ritonavir lopinavir oseltamivir and chloroquine are already known with scientific evidences the antiviral properties are proved in vitro from many studies starting long back from 1969 to till recent times 7 8 9 10 11 chloroquine the age-old anti-malarial drug possesses anti-viral properties many in-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown various mechanisms by which chloroquine exerts antiviral activity on various viruses like the zika virus avian leucosis virus the hiv-1 h5n1 virus by changing the endosomal ph inhibiting the viral gene expression changing the glycosylation pattern of hiv-1 hiv-1 gp120 envelope and inhibit the replication of the hiv virus in cd 4  t cells inhibiting the autophagy and reducing the alveolar epithelial damage in the lungs of avian influenza h5n1 mice inhibiting the zika virus-induced autophagy animal experiments have shown that the vertical transmission of zika virus from the mother to the fetus can be cut off by chloroquine in a study conducted by keyaerts et al in 2004 7 it was observed that chloroquine inhibits the replication of sars-cov in vero e6 cells in a recent study by xu et al in january 2020 12 it was observed that the sars-cov2 and the sars-cov shared an identical structural identity and similar van der waals and electrostatic properties vincent mj et al 200513 stresses that chloroquine can even be considered as prophylaxis for people traveling to the affected area due to the easy availability and cost-effectiveness of chloroquine and may be considered to treat and prevent coronavirus infection in addition to the anti-viral activity chloroquine also possesses an anti-inflammatory property which can be used to reduce the virus-induced inflammation 14 more than 10 clinical trials are registered and are underway in china and other parts of world to prove the efficacy of chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 15 a recent study in china that included more than 100 patients demonstrated that chloroquine was superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving the lung imaging findings promoting a virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course 16 chloroquine has certain advantages to itself being an age-old drug first and foremost is that it is almost available everywhere in the world making it easy to acquire secondly it is very cost-effective thirdly the adverse drug reaction profile of the drug is well known so that the drug-drug interactions or drug-disease other co-morbid conditions interactions may be avoided another drug hydroxychloroquine a 4 aminoquinoline has also given promising results in the treatment of covid-19 the us-fda has issued an emergency use authorisation eua on march 28 2020 according to the eua chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are to be donated to the strategic national stockpile sns to be distributed to hospitals where they can be used to treat certain covid19 patients 17 in a non-randomized study conducted by gautret p et al a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has caused a significant reduction or disappearance of the viral load in covid 19 patients 18 another prospective study from china with 30 patients randomly allocated to hydroxychloroquine with 400 mg daily for 5 days in addition to other supportive care injection interferon beta and available antivirals vs standard care alone even though there was no statistical difference in virologic clearance a trend was seen in hydroxychloroquine with support with 867 vs 933 viral clearance 19 more than 50 clinical trials are registered and are underway in china and other parts of world to prove the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 and its complication 20 the icmr has rolled out a protocol for using hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis in the health care workers hcw and the close contacts of the suspected or covid 19 positive patients 21 to conclude with the daily increase in the number of newly detected covid 19 cases and the number of deaths increasing at a faster pace waiting for the newer drug with questionable efficacy in different races seems to be unethical drugs with known efficacy and toxicity profile will be a good strategy in developing countries so a combination of antiviral antimalarial and anti-flu drugs will be a good strategy until the newer drugs are developed todays off label maybe tomorrows alternate drug of choice thes drugs the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not without their own adverse effects hence vigilance should be mandatory in using this drug for treatment purposes of confirmed cases of covid-19 misuse as a prophylactic drug will create massive failure of these drugs for their respective indication they have been introduced especially for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine  covid19 in context why do people die in emergencies its probably not because of collective psychology john drury stephen reicher clifford stott   notions of psychological frailty  weaknesses of reason or weaknesses of morality  have been evident in many of the comments on public responses to the covid19 crisis some of these have informed policy for example part of the reason for delay in introducing stricter distancing measures in the united kingdom was the authorities assumption that the public would soon fatigue and stop observing them1
httpsmindhackscom20200320dowesufferbehaviouralfatigueforpandemicpreventionmeasures
 as ever though such frailty is said to be magnified by the collective thus back in the early days of covid19 many commentators argued that collective panic would potentially be more disastrous than the pandemic itself through its effects on markets availability of goods2

 panic  meaning selfish thoughtless behaviour and overreaction  was said to be as contagious as the virus itself5
httpsblogsbmjcombmj20200221robertpeckhamcovid19outbreakneedstrategiesmanagepanicepidemics
 such collective psychology would therefore turn an emergency into a disaster but is this really the case exactly the same claim about the role of public panic has historically been made in relation to many other kinds of emergencies including fires terrorist attacks sinking ships and crowd crushes was it really selfishness overreaction and general bad behaviour that caused so many deaths in these cases or was it something else take the sinking of the mv estonia in 1994 for example over 800 people died prima facie the greater survival rates of men over women and crew over passengers might suggest that the strongest individuals selfishly neglected others in order to save themselves but analysis of the survivorship records and eyewitness testimonies illustrates the danger of psychologizing physical constraints cornwell et al 2001 the extreme listing of the ship was very sudden there were attempts among passengers to help each other but most did not have the strength to get to the exits themselves let alone assist others examining the evidence in emergencies suggests three main reasons why there are avoidable fatalities 1 underreaction to threat 2 systemic factors and 3 mismanagement here we briefly describe these alternative explanations for deaths in disasters we then examine how far they help us understand what has happened in the case of covid19 in the uk context before discussing the real collective psychology of emergencies rather than overreaction the first factor that turns an emergency into a disaster is underreaction people often underestimate risk and disregard possible signals of danger tierney lindell  perry 2001 during 911 people inside the world trade center who saw objects falling from the sky outside did not initially recognize these as pieces of the plane that had struck their building slowness to comprehend the threat means delay in attempts to escape some people even took time to close down their computers before they sought to leave the building the second reason for deaths in emergencies is systemic disasters do not affect everyone in the same way those already disadvantaged suffer disproportionately6

 in the grenfell tower fire  the worst fire in the united kingdom since the second world war  neglect and costsaving by the authorities and manufacturers were behind the fatal decision to clad the block in flammable material poorer sections of society also have fewer resources to help them cope when disaster strikes and less power to demand adequate aftercare a third reason why emergencies often end so badly is mismanagement the cocoanut grove nightclub fire of 1942 in which 492 people died has been presented in psychology textbooks as an embodiment of the received wisdom that most deaths in nightclub fires are due to crowd panic chertkoff and kushigians 1999 detailed reanalysis of events suggests instead failure of management of two types first there was mismanagement of space the emergency exit door was locked the windows were also nailed shut to prevent people leaving without paying their tab second there were failures of communication there were no exit signs or training in emergency evacuation so when staff tried to help lead survivors out they could not find the fire exit in the official investigation the major causes of the loss of life were said to be the locked doors the unfamiliarity and inaccessibility of normal exits and the jamming of the revolving door there was no implication that crowd behaviour caused the deaths the management was subsequently prosecuted for manslaughter and neglect of building laws a similar story of mismanagement of space can be found in the literature on fatal crowd crushes sometimes  usually erroneously  called stampedes panic explanations once dominated but a recent systematic review cites as the most common causes of fatalities not collective psychology but overcrowding closure of exits congestion at bottlenecks deficiencies in safety barriers and lack of coordination with local authorities de almeida  von schreeb 2019 notoriously the fatal crush at hillsborough in 1989 was initially explained by some in terms of the disorderly behaviour of fans but it was later demonstrated that disproportionate concern among authorities with preventing football hooliganism led to neglect of crowd safety  including the disastrous decision to let fans into an already overcrowded terrace7
httpswwwtheguardiancomfootball2016apr26hillsboroughdisasterdeadlymistakesandliesthatlasteddecades
 in short hillsborough like cocoanut grove did not happen because of failings at the level of collective psychology in relation to failures of communication changes to information and communication practices have often improved safety and saved lives when the world trade center was subject to a terrorist attack in 1993 the evacuation was relatively slow aguirre wenger  vigo 1998 subsequently regular drills were introduced so that people became familiar with the locations of emergency exits this measure helped make the 911 evacuation so successful8

 in the case of mass casualty decontamination following a chemical incident failure of responders to communicate effectively has led to reduced public compliance with the procedure increasing risk of fatalities carter et al 2015 the solution has been to train responders with the skills to communicate to the public both why decontamination is needed and how to carry it out drury et al 2019 unlike fires earthquakes floods and bombings which tend to be shortterm events which occur in one place the effects of the current pandemic are dispersed in time and space yet like these other emergencies there is a mortal threat which creates collective fear and when we examine some of the major problems in response and outcomes9

 in the covid19 crisis prima facie our threefold classification above fits better than explanations in terms of public selfishness thoughtlessness and overreaction first underreaction while some members of the public have not taken the pandemic seriously the uk data show that the vast majority adhered to the social distancing and stay at home regulations10
httpsnewsskycomstorycoronavirustripstotheshopsfallby85sinceoutbreakaccordingtogoogledata11968171
 yet there is evidence of highly consequential political underreaction in the united kingdom a criticism has been that that the government did not prepare or respond in time11
httpsarchiveis20200418182037httpswwwthetimescoukeditionnewscoronavirus38dayswhenbritainsleepwalkedintodisasterhq3b9tlgh
 importantly the official advice on social distancing was only given on 16 march 2020 and the instruction to stay at home only on the 23rd the result of this underreaction is a death rate proportionately higher than most other countries  with over 30000 hospital and community deaths recorded by 12 may 2020 scally jacobson  abbasi 2020 some of this failure to prepare in time may be straightforward mismanagement but some of it may also be due to underestimating risk by those in authority the world health organization warned about the risk of humantohuman transmission of covid19 as early as 10 january 2020 and urged precautions the first department of health and social care press release on covid19 on 22 january stated that the risk to the uk population was low12
httpswwwgovukgovernmentnewsdhscandphestatementoncoronavirus
 two days later the lancet published the first article showing evidence that covid19 was transmittable to humans the authors recommended careful surveillance rigorous testing respirators and greater use of personal protective equipment13
httpswwwthelancetcomjournalslancetarticlepiis0140673620301835fulltext
 but on the same day the uk chief medical officer still maintained that the risk to the uk public was low the first documented transmission within the united kingdom as opposed to from travellers from abroad appeared on 28 february yet the uk risk level was not raised to high till 12 march in relation to our second factor one example where systemic factors were evident but a discourse of public bad behaviour was mobilized was in the case of socalled panic buying14the use of the term panic in this case illustrates why it is seen as an unhelpful concept by disaster researchers chertkoff  kushigian 1999 the judgement about whether a behaviour is an overreaction is either subjective since criteria are unclear how much shopping does one really need or post hoc and therefore not explanatory the rapid emptying of supermarket shelves was an effect of the vulnerability of justintime supply chains to just a small uptick in consumer spending and purchasing evidence suggests that in fact only a small proportion of the population was stockpiling in response to the expectations of lockdown and shortages15
httpswwwwarccomnewsandopinionopinionwhystockpilingisnotthecrazyselfishbehaviourthatitseems3483
 nevertheless government ministers chided some of the public for their selfishness psychologizing the problem this representation of the public as selfish is highly consequential where others in the community are seen as competitors this can create the very individualism that is being condemned undermining the sense of collectivity needed in these times van bavel et al 2020 systemic factors have been crucial in another sense poorer and less powerful sections of society had fewer choices about how to behave during the first phase of lockdown despite media campaigns to vilify some people as selfish and thoughtless covidiots the evidence on reasons for nonadherence shows that much of it was practical rather than psychological many people had to cram into tube trains to go to work because they needed money to survive and government support schemes were insufficient people were told they could go out to exercise but those in urban areas had limited public space and some employers failed to provide the support for social distancing and hygiene16

 those with less income and wealth also live in more crowded homes17
httpswwwcitylabcomequity202004coronavirusspreadmapcityurbandensitysuburbsruraldata609394

 the outcomes of these systematic inequalities are predictable poorer people have repeatedly been shown to be more vulnerable to infection and more likely to die18
httpswwwhealthorguknewsandcommentnewsdeathsfromcovid19inthemostdeprivedareas
 these inequalities have persisted into the second phase of lockdown from may 2020 with lower income people being less able to work from home and more likely to be in jobs that bring them into contact with others finally there is evidence of a specific mismanagement in the form of failure of communication in the uk response one thing we observed to have changed and which might therefore indicate recognition of an earlier error was the way the public were addressed in the official messaging initial government communications stressed the risk to oneself as an individual for exampleas per the current advice the most important thing individuals can do to protect themselves remains washing their hands more often for at least 20 seconds with soap and water19
httpswwwgovukgovernmentnewscovid19governmentannouncesmovingoutofcontainphaseandintodelay
 emphasis added
 the message some people therefore picked up from this was about the risk to themselves personally such individualfocused messaging can lead people to discount the risk especially if they consider themselves young and healthy20
httpsthepsychologistbpsorgukdontpersonalisecollectivise
 later there was a shift to the rationale being to protect the nhs protect others and a change from you the potential victim to you the spreader eg act like youve got it which seems to have been more persuasive21the uk governments new slogan  stay alert  unveiled in early may 2020 abandoned the collectivization implicit in the previous successful messaging with the consequence that only three in ten brits think that they know what the new slogan  is asking them to do httpsyougovcouktopicshealtharticlesreports20200511britssplitchangescoronaviruslockdownmeasures

 this last example makes the point that indeed psychology is heavily involved in the public response to covid19 however it is not a psychology of fixed behavioural tendencies since the self and hence selfinterest the motivations for and boundaries of concern varies with contextual factors in this case political leadership which failed initially to communicate in collectivist terms so of course psychology matters in what happens in emergencies but for reasons other than inevitable collective selfishness thoughtlessness and overreaction lets consider first the conditions under which behaviour is competitive vs cooperative in emergencies there have been many reports of mutual social support by members of the public during the covid19 crisis22
httpswwwtheguardiancomworld2020may03nhscoronaviruscrisisvolunteersfrustratedatlackoftaskscmpshareiosappother
 reviews suggest that cooperation among survivors is very common in emergencies and that members of the public save more lives than professional responders drury et al 2019 but in some emergencies people compete push and even trample each other what are the conditions for this to occur chertkoff and kushigians 1999 comparison of different evacuations found that there was more competition when exits were narrow and unfamiliar we also know that people compete more and coordinate less in evacuations when they are positioned psychologically as individuals rather than as group members as mintz 1951 shows when an evacuating crowd blocks the exit this can be explained in terms of the prevalence of individual competition in a collective setting rather than in terms of excessive emotion in these cases then the emergency ends badly due to the absence of collective psychology ie lack of coordination and cooperation cooperating and giving support can also carry risks which need to be acknowledged in mass evacuations the larger the group the slower the egress because speed is reduced through people interacting with each other aguirre et al 1998 and the motivation to give support to other survivors can lead some to take risks with their personal safety so what is good for the collective in emergency is not always good for particular individuals drury cocking  reicher 200923this is one of the main reasons why debates around rationality and irrationality in behaviour in emergencies are dead ends in the case of covid19 the risk to the individual from supporting the group is clear where that supportive behaviour involves physical proximity whether delivering food or giving emotional support facetoface what about public underreaction  why does this occur underestimation of risk has sometimes been characterized as an optimistic bias kinsey gwynne kuligowski  kinateder 2019 but in a context where emergency events are rare ie most of the time it is reasonable to assume that it wont happen to us this assumption can reverse when emergency events become more common  for example in 2017 after a spate of terrorist attacks in london hundreds of people in oxford street fled from a noise that turned out to be harmless in general then the extent to which information concerning a threat is seen as plausible is a function of the broad social context of dangers expectations of danger are raised and the readiness to flee or take other action is greater in a context of recent incidents relevant to our social group how do perceptions of risk become collective people respond not only to direct signals of risk but to other peoples responses to that signal bruder fischer  manstead 2014 we suggest that the extent to which the response of others to the possible threat is seen as conveying information is dependent on the selfrelevance of these others in a particular context which in turn is often a function of shared identity based on what we know about social influence processes in other contexts bruder et al 2014 in the case of covid19 it is plausible to suppose that the sight of others in our community routinely observing or ignoring social distancing regulations for example is likely to send a strong signal to us around the safety of doing the same  particularly where we identify with the community or see these exemplars as prototypes psychological factors can interact with management failures to help explain why some emergency events end so badly fearing public panic leads the authorities to withhold information about the emergency drury et al 2019 but lack of information in an emergency increases public anxiety and when the public perceives that information is being withheld from them this damages their relationship with the authority carter et al 2015 consequently when the authorities do release correct information the public may mistrust and fail to act upon it in the case of covid19 the need to treat the public with respect in order to build trust has been part of the advice given by behavioural scientists to the uk government24

 we do not deny that in emergencies some people behave selfishly and thoughtlessly or that some may overreact indeed as explained research suggests some of the conditions for competition to prevail over cooperation what we are questioning here is the notion that such public reactions are a default or are a major cause of problems in the covid19 crisis the existing literature on disasters does not support this view and prima facie major problems in the covid19 response and outcomes can be better understood otherwise  in terms of political underreaction systemic issues and mismanagement collective panic is referred to as a disaster myth in the literature on disasters drury et al 2019 rather than a neutral description of how people actually behave it is best understood as part of a particular discourse or cultural representation one which psychologizes  and indeed pathologizes  public responses in emergencies and disasters given what is known about underreaction systemic factors and mismanagement in emergencies to emphasize instead the role of collective bad behaviour has clear ideological functions in naturalizing fatalities it distracts from the real causes and thus from who might be held responsible for mismanagement instead blaming the victims the irony of course is that far from being the problem collective psychology in emergencies  the solidarity and cooperation so commonly witnessed among community members and strangers  is usually the solution collective psychology therefore can and should be harnessed more effectively in policy and practice in the covid19 response elcheroth  drury 2020  through framing both the threat and the solution in collective terms and through emphasizing shared norms around collective wellbeing and safety drury et al 2019 why do people die in emergencies it is probably not because of collective psychology all authors declare no conflict of interest john drury conceptualization writing  original draft writing  review  editing

the history of the genus homo and the dozen human species we know of today through archaeological excavation was determined by the fight against infectious diseases it is likely that the species that are no longer around today are largely extinct due to the spread of infectious diseases 1 we should be happy that we no longer live in the times of great epidemics and pandemics that once decimated our species a huge number of people died during their childhood or youth 1 the most severe mediaeval infections killed up to every third person before the discovery of the microscope people could not even know why it was happening to them no one thought that tiny invisible living microbes could cause these diseases people assumed that some heavenly punishment for their sins had come upon them we should therefore be grateful that we are living in the age of this advancement of science and medicine 1 since 1940 many bacterial diseases have begun to be controlled by antibiotics and since 1960 many viral and bacterial diseases have had vaccines developed for them 1 unfortunately we do not have a vaccine for all infectious diseases as we see in the example of this pandemic new viruses continue to transfer from other species to us because history has not ended with the advent of our generation instead it just continues but this pandemic certainly does not look like it will decimate us it could have because this is already the seventh coronavirus to try to make itself at home within the human population 2 it is trying to adapt to us and use us as its reservoir specifically we exist together with this virus on a small blue-brown planet in a vast dark universe we share it with tens of millions of other species they all strive to barely survive more than 99of all species that have ever existed on earth have failed to survive to this day 1 that is why viruses constantly transfer themselves to new species and thus expand their reservoirs they must choose the winning species because they cannot reproduce on their own their survival depends on the survival of the species that is their reservoir 3 humans are currently an interesting potential viral reservoir we are expanding rapidly in population size  from about a billion-and-a-half individuals we have grown to about seven-and-a-half-billion in the last 130 years alone 1 in doing so we are conquering new territories clearing forests draining wetlands hunting for pleasure and reducing overall biodiversity 1 this is making it increasingly difficult for others to survive while there are more and more of us fortunately for us all the first four human-adapted coronaviruses were merely the cause of common colds 2 no-one considered the four of them a serious threat to public health sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle eastern acute respiratory syndrome were a real surprise for scientists and experts these were further respiratory viruses from the coronavirus family the fifth and sixth that managed to infect humans surprisingly instead of colds they were able to cause very severe fatal pneumonia 2 in addition the death rate among those infected with both diseases was truly frightening sars killed one-in-ten infected while mers killed one-in-three both could have caused a horrible amount of human deaths if they spread to the worlds entire population 2 the coronavirus that caused sars had its reservoir in bats which hibernate in caves in winter this is the time of the year when hardly anyone hunts or consumes bats however sars managed to infect an animal from the cat family a civet from a civet it was then also contracted by a man a farmer in guangdong province in late 2002 sars then spread to more than twenty countries and infected more than 8000 people with every tenth infected person dying from the disease it was the fifth human coronavirus but it was the first to kill humans 2 ten years later in 2012 the mers coronavirus appeared in saudi arabia it was passed on to humans from the camels in the desert it has also spread to more than twenty countries infecting about 2500 people and every third infected person died 2 so both sars and mers had a really scary case-fatality rate the advent of mers showed us that sars was not an isolated incident with a coronavirus that we could just forget about but that coronaviruses have become the most significant potential biological threat to our species if sars or mers had spread around the world and infected billions of people they would have caused a catastrophe unlike any other in the modern history of humans in those two cases we were actually very lucky essentially an entirely new virus that tries to transfer over to the human species can spread among humans in three basic ways each of these three ways informs our strategies for epidemic surveillance and dealing with the epidemic once the virus enters the human body it begins to multiply in the kind of specialised cells that it has the ability to bind to in the case of coronaviruses these are the cells of the respiratory system the virus multiplies in them by hacking their cellular genetic code and using their machinery to build its own proteins 2 this multiplication of the virus eventually destroys the infected cells that is the reason for the eventual development of the symptoms that are characteristic of respiratory infections such as a sore throat and cough in the first mode of the spread the virus will jump from the infected person to unaffected people only after the onset of those symptoms such an epidemic is the easiest to control and contain that is because the sick person is soon confined to bed and no longer leaves home therefore the virus can mainly spread to their household members this also makes it relatively easy to identify everyone who was in contact with the person after the onset of symptoms those people can then be placed in isolation quite easily we were fortunate that both sars and mers spread to other people only after the onset of the symptoms of the disease this is why we were able to suppress the epidemics by isolating those infected and all their contacts after the onset of the symptoms this is quite likely the most important reason why sars and mers did not manage to kill remarkably large number of people 2 it is much more difficult to contain an epidemic if the virus spreads from infected to healthy people during the period of the so-called incubation this period lasts from the entry of the virus into the body until the onset of the first symptoms 3 in such case infected persons can transmit the virus by contact to a significantly larger number of people in the days before they get any symptoms that seems to be the situation with this new covid-19 pandemic but even then it is at least possible for every new patient to determine from whom they contracted the infection namely all newly diagnosed cases had to meet an existing and known case in the past this allows epidemiologists to follow the entire chain of movement of the virus from person to person due to this favourable circumstance intensive isolation measures of all those who were in contact with those already infected can significantly slow down the spread of the virus this was done in wuhan that is why test-trace-isolate as the first line of defence and quarantines as the ultimate response both represent a justified containment strategy when people are infectious for others during incubation period both approaches will slow down and contain the epidemic if applied properly a nightmare scenario for any epidemiologist however is a third possibility for the virus to spread in such a variant people become infected and transmit the virus but they themselves never show any symptoms scientists are currently looking for such possible spreads of contagion with this new covid-19 pandemic that is the reason why such possible persons are occasionally mentioned in the media in high-profile articles namely because of such infected people cases are beginning to emerge among the population that cannot be linked to any of the already infected people when people are circulating in the population without symptoms but passing the virus on to others it is very difficult for epidemiologists to do anything to prevent it from spreading among all humans such an epidemic has the potential to spread over time mainly due to such transmitters or carriers who show no symptoms when something has happened six times within a system that is as complex as the earths ecosystem then it is no surprise that it would also happen for the seventh time another coronavirus is now trying to make itself at home in the human species in this case the primary reservoirs were probably bats again we know this because the genetic sequence of this new coronavirus coincides with that found in hibernating bats in about 96 percent 4 this time instead of a civet a smaller mammal or bird has probably served as coronavirus so-called transitional reservoir it is possible that it was a pangolin because in one of them a coronavirus that matched to the human form by as much as 99 of the sequence was found although this is not completely definite either 5 sequence matching is not the only important factor when it comes to viral jump from animals to humans what is also important is how many individuals in the species that serve as a transitional reservoir are infected and how often the species comes into contact with humans sometimes these factors are more important so they can bridge the gap of 2-3 of the difference in genome sequence because pangolins are a protected species and cannot be eaten thus in the chinese province of hubei in the city of wuhan which has a population of eleven million at around the end of 2019 the number of patients with an unusual and very dangerous type of pneumonia began to increase many of them had in common that they visited a particular fish market it was soon discovered that this infectious disease was spreading very quickly each infected person managed to further infect as many as two to three people such a degree of infectivity is quite high and leads to rapid growth of the epidemic we had the misfortune that the disease caused by the 7th coronavirus  covid-19  apparently manages to spread even during the incubation period possibly even by touch this incubation period lasts about five days on average it would be very tricky if it lasted longer because the novel coronavirus would then have more time to spread from an already infected person to others however an incubation period of up to two weeks is not entirely unusual even rare cases who had incubation period of up to four weeks seem to be possible during some of this time the infected person can spread the virus before the onset of their first symptoms if there are infected people who do not develop symptoms it will be really difficult to contain this pandemic until we develop a vaccine in conclusion infectivity ie the ability to move from the infected to the uninfected seems to be significantly higher in covid-19 than it was with sars and mers as a trade-off we now know that the covid-19 case-fatality rate is significantly lower than that of sars and mers in order to answer this rather complicated question it must first be said that nowadays the registered number of infected persons and the number of deaths can be monitored online 6 when the number of deaths was divided by the confirmed and registered number of infected people at the beginning of the pandemic a figure of about 2 would be obtained 6 from this alone one could apparently conclude that  given that this is an entirely new coronavirus and nobody is immune to it  it will necessarily spread throughout the world and infect us all if it kills 2 percent of all people then it follows that out of a total of 75 billion people about 150 million will necessarily die it is difficult for anyone who is not a specialist in this field to understand how such an outcome can now be prevented because a vaccine against this virus does not yet exist nor do medicines the question of the case-fatality rate among those infected with covid-19 exposed a general lack of epidemiological knowledge among the general public and in the media from the very beginning of this pandemic there were people who claimed that the new coronavirus was a disease milder than even the flu but also those who believed it was significantly more dangerous in recent days this issue has finally caught the attention of all the worlds media as the world health organisation reported that about 34 of those infected with coronavirus have died 7 that sounded terrifying to the media and the public but then the president of the usa mr donald trump also made a public statement saying the number released by the who was wrong he said that hed talked to people who knew something about it and that his impression was that the number was certainly below 1 if not significantly less 8 in my guest appearance on sunday at 2 an influential croatian tv programme on march 1st i made an estimate of the case-fatality rate of 05-1 allowing for the possibility that it could even be smaller 9 namely at this point we do not properly distinguish infection-fatality rate from case-fatality rate so once that insights into seroprevalence become available they may even bring this estimate further down however both president trump and who are actually right each in their own way which shows best how difficult it is for many people to keep track of what is really going on because of their lack of knowledge of the epidemiology in the beginning of every epidemic of a new virus the virus has to jump over from animals to humans and then from humans to humans that can be quite difficult therefore the virus will be more likely to successfully infect those with a weakened immune system who will find it more difficult to reject it because of this the first patients are often people who are either older or already have some underlying illnesses that make them more vulnerable they end up in a hospital where at that point no one suspects that pneumonia that they are experiencing may have an epidemic potential then they infect other hospital patients and some health care professionals the latter can then spread the disease to other patients in the hospital  mainly to those most susceptible such as those ailing or immunocompromised treated for serious illnesses or the elderly this is the reason why the case-fatality rate among all covid-19 patients was initially very high in wuhan and later in italy many people died of covid-19 infections in hospitals and they were mostly very old and sick people 10 in the meantime the virus has started to spread among the general population  in the community and outside of hospitals it has infected many people who are otherwise healthy and had a much better immune response a large number of these people would have thought that they had a cold or the flu and perhaps even a more severe flu they were just resting at home and letting those respiratory infections run their course considering that it was flu season in wuhan at the time of the outbreak and the media reported that a strange epidemic was causing many deaths in wuhans hospitals it is quite likely that many wuhan residents who were infected with the coronavirus stayed home and treated themselves few people would choose to go to the hospital to test whether their flu-like symptoms were caused by the novel coronavirus when a deadly epidemic was spreading there only the few who have struggled with fevers and symptoms for more than eight or nine days sought help from wuhan hospitals in china there is typically no primary health care and family medicine as we know it but there are large hospitals in their huge cities where patients report directly that is the most likely explanation as to why the case-fatality rate among patients at wuhan hospitals at the beginning of the epidemic was so frighteningly high it is not the epidemic seemed even more dangerous at first as it created a great deal of pressure on hospital intensive care units which were unprepared for this infection as a result all severely ill patients could not receive intensive care this further increased the case-fatality rate at the beginning of the epidemic that is why the chinese have started building the two new hospitals they wanted to ensure a sufficient capacity to provide intensive care also they needed to move all those infected with covid-19 away from other seriously ill people who were sick from other diseases and at the highest risk of dying if they became infected based on this it should be understood that the total number of those infected with covid-19 in wuhan could have been much higher than what was confirmed by their health statistics specifically only those with coronaviruses who were eventually admitted to the hospital were confirmed to be infected and were tested for the new virus there they are by no means representative of all those infected with the new coronavirus in wuhan therefore the early estimates of case-fatality rates in wuhan cannot be extrapolated even to all those with confirmed coronavirus infection in wuhan let alone would they be representative of the entire population of wuhan for those reasons it is wrong to look at the number of deaths and the number of confirmed infected cases and divide those two numbers and draw any conclusions 11 if all the reported deaths are divided by the total number of people with confirmed infection then both the numerator and the denominator are wrong when it comes to calculating the actual case-fatality rate even deaths in the numerator would be wrong this is because we monitor the confirmed infected and those who have died in real time a great many infected people have not even had a chance to either recover or die so the number of deaths in the numerator is an underestimate some of the people who are presently in intensive care are expected to die in several days weeks maybe even months this is why the number of deaths that corresponds to the number presently infected will inevitably increase over time therefore some future number of deaths as the numerator will increasingly correspond to the current number of registered infected persons as the denominator as a result the case-fatality rate of deaths among those with confirmed infection will then no longer be 2 or 3 percent but it may increase quite considerably over time  perhaps to 6-7 percent or even more therefore to simply say that about 34 of those confirmed to have been infected so far have died is not really wrong in itself which is what the world health organisation did but it missed explaining that this case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is quite unrepresentative of the mortality rate among all those who were infected 11 the true rate should be much lower it would not surprise me as an epidemiologist if it is up to ten times smaller perhaps even more 11 depending on the actual true number of infected people which should be used as a denominator this could ultimately make covid-19 a less deadly disease even than the common flu given that the virus is new and unknown this is a key question unfortunately the possibility that this virus is quite different from other known viruses must also be allowed it may be that the case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is only 3 to 5 times higher than the infection-fatality rate ie the number of deaths among all infected people so it may not be ten or thirty times higher as many epidemiologists would expect the only thing we can be reasonably sure of is that the number of confirmed infected people was not equal to the number of all infected people in wuhan the current global totals of confirmed infected and fatalities for covid-19 are still largely determined by what happened in wuhan at the beginning of the epidemic this is because about two-thirds of cases worldwide still originate in wuhan to this day 6 that is why i have already explained on sunday at 2 tv programme that the case-fatality rate among those who were confirmed to be infected is not so important it is only a subset of the patients with the most severe symptoms we need to find out what is the case-fatality rate among all infected people however no one can know that at this time because a random sample of at least 100 000 wuhan residents would need to be tested for this then the presence of antibodies against coronaviruses should be detected this is how we measure seroprevalence 3 this would allow us to estimate the number of people in wuhan who got over the infection with the novel coronavirus without ever seeing a doctor so far no one has conducted these studies because the health system was preoccupied with diagnosing and treating the epidemic of covid-19 in hospitals and struggled with it it is now understood that during some days of the wuhan outbreak there were not enough tests for all those who reported to hospitals with symptoms however additional lines of evidence are beginning to emerge the first is the report of an international panel of experts who visited china 12 they looked at the cases across china that were reported after february the 1st at this point the identification of those infected was significantly improved also hospitals were better prepared for the epidemic case-fatality rate of all cases that came under health surveillance and were tested dropped to about 07 12 for anyone who may remain skeptical of chinas data the first reports have recently been provided by south korean authorities that country has really led by example in proactively testing people seeking out all those infected and their contacts isolating them and treating them in their analyses to date case-fatality rate of all infected people has been slightly above 06 13 both of those estimates could still increase albeit not substantially if they also included those who will likely die over time and are currently counted as infected still at such a low case-fatality rate there should not be many additional deaths in fact it is more likely that many infected people remained undiagnosed and that the case-fatality rate is actually even lower 11 another interesting recent new source is the study of more than 1000 hospitalized covid-19 patients who were followed up until the very end of the infection this sample has been collected from more than 500 chinese hospitals and the result was published recently in a leading medical journal 14 this analysis quoted their overall case-fatality rate to be about 14 however it did not include all those infected again but rather those who requested hospital treatment 14 therefore it should still be possible that the infection-fatality rate is at least two to three times smaller among all those who were infected with the novel coronavirus thus it appears that data from very different and increasingly reliable sources are starting to converge to the values which i predicted on sunday at 2 tv show on march 1st ie 05-1 because of all of the above president of the usa donald trump was most likely right to say that this number should be closer to 1 and that he believes that it could even be well below 1 8 everything we know about epidemiology and previous pandemics gives us hope that this should be the case the virus will not succeed in infecting everyone for a number of reasons our first line of defence consists of anti-epidemic measures all those who are experiencing symptoms and may be infected are being tested all their contacts are also tested for the presence of the virus then covid-19 patients and all their contacts are being isolated 15 these measures will significantly slow down the spread of the infectious disease and buy us time it is of utmost importance that the number of patients with covid-19 does not increase too quickly when the new cases emerge more slowly the staff of national health care systems will be able to provide quality care to all patients for the more severe cases they will also offer intensive care in the absence of these measures there would be an exponential increase in the number of infected people this number would soon outgrow the capacity of the health system many people within countries are also protected by their geographical dispersion ie many people live in smaller towns and settlements a large number of them will probably never be exposed to an infected person furthermore as people become infected develop covid-19 and then get well they should become immune to the virus as a result there will be fewer people the virus can still infect at some point the number of susceptible persons that infected people can spread coronavirus to will decrease substantially at some point each infected person will on average pass the virus to less than one susceptible person in time this will eventually limit and stop the epidemic that is the reason we vaccinate even if the virus infects some unvaccinated people it will have very few options for further spread vaccinated people will already be immune to the virus and their bodies will react vigorously if the virus tries to enter 16 many processes in nature are self-limiting in a similar way  forest fires stock market crashes and epidemics furthermore the case-fatality rate should not be directly applicable to the entire population of a country to estimate the possible death toll the first reason is that the virus mainly endangers the elderly whose case-fatality rates are much higher young people and children rarely get unwell and their death rates are much much lower this is why age and sex structure of the population can diminish the potential of the virus to cause a very high number of covid-19 casualties if the population is reasonably young 11 the situation should be taken seriously and people should be cautious but there is no reason to be overly afraid there is especially no reason to panic many people are afraid of this pandemic because they probably think that we are in a completely unfamiliar situation so anything could happen but it is unlikely that much could happen for which science could not find explanations and answers and the epidemiological services could not respond in a timely manner it is unwise for a serious scientist to try to predict the spread of a completely new and unknown virus to the entire human population in the world let alone to predict more specific outcomes still we have in recent weeks collected enough information about the new covid-19 virus for at least some predictions if the new coronavirus spreads across any country over time and manages to circumvent the many prevention measures in place the application of anti-epidemic measures should still limit its casualties to make them at least roughly comparable to the deaths from flu or road accidents in the same period this means that some healthy caution is advisable this caution is reasonable as long as it is on the same level as the fear you may feel when sitting in a car and preparing for a longer trip or when you hear on the news that a more severe form of influenza has arrived but many are wondering why the novel coronavirus attracts such a level of media attention this is because flu has been a well-known disease for decades it comes back every year and we have experience with its manifestations among many millions of patients worldwide we know how to develop vaccines against flu in advance of its season 16 we have even started to produce the first somewhat effective drugs and offer them on the market 17 unlike the flu the new coronavirus is unknown to us we should remain cautious so that we do not get unpleasantly surprised at the same time the most vulnerable among us who are already seriously ill or very old are not vaccinated as is the case with the flu this is why the new disease covid-19 can kill more easily this question has constantly been being raised since the beginning because many are looking at various figures without a deeper understanding of their background and are comparing the incomparable first of all the general public underestimates how serious and dangerous and serious the flu actually is  especially for the most vulnerable the elderly and those who are already ill globally influenza causes between 250 000 and 650 000 deaths annually depending on the strain of the circulating virus 18 different strains can cause milder or more severe symptoms and the virus mutates each year however we try to protect those most vulnerable before the flu season begins by vaccinating them therefore the number of deaths from influenza is reduced by preventive health intervention ie vaccination this cannot be done with the spread of covid-19 this is the first reason why the flu seems less dangerous than covid-19 however it may not be much less dangerous inherently especially during seasons when flu is more severe it is just that we protect the most vulnerable in addition flu vaccinations make it more difficult for it to spread among the population because there are fewer options for it to transfer to the uninfected due to the slower spread new cases emerge more slowly and the health care system has time to deal with them properly especially if they require intensive care another reason is that the number of deaths directly from the flu is several times lower than the number of deaths that are indirectly caused by the flu influenza is often not cited as a direct cause in statistics on the causes of death if it has merely led to the exacerbation of some of the long-present chronic underlying disease these chronic diseases are then cited as the primary cause of death rather than influenza therefore the actual role of influenza in annual mortality is often significantly underestimated it can be several times higher when the causes of death are reclassified at the end of each year based on the increase in deaths from chronic diseases during the flu season the third reason for caution in comparing covid-19 and flu is that we have a much better idea of the total number of people truly infected with the flu than we do about the novel coronavirus this is because influenza is a disease that is typically managed within primary care after which patients are referred to home care only the most serious cases of flu are referred to hospital there is an obligation to report the total number of people infected with influenza in the population to the central registry as well as for sick leave this makes the denominator for case-fatality rate of influenza better known to us than we can estimate it for the novel coronavirus covid-19 has so far been diagnosed and treated exclusively in hospitals where severe cases clustered the early estimates of case-fatality rates for covid-19 included patients suffering from hospital outbreaks which affected the elderly the sick and the immunocompromised this is why those case-fatality rates are hardly comparable to a spread that would occur in the general population from all of this it should be concluded that case-fatality rates from influenza as another very dangerous viral disease have been mathematically reduced compared to the current reports of case-fatality rates for coronaviruses for the three reasons i mentioned the first is because we vaccinate those most vulnerable to the flu the second is that health statistics do not assign the majority of flu deaths to influenza but rather to the exacerbations of pre-existing underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes malignant tumours and others the third is that the denominator we use to calculate case-fatality rates from influenza is much closer to the actual number of those infected while the denominator for coronavirus is not yet known with sufficient certainty from their experience with other respiratory viruses epidemiologists know that all events in hospitals will dramatically over-represent the most vulnerable this is why those case-fatality rates should by no means be applied to the general population however lay members of the public cannot have a good sense of these nuances that is why it is best to avoid comparisons between case-fatality rates for the flu and for the novel coronavirus until we learn more on the seroprevalence of the latter the general public underestimates the risk of influenza for the three reasons mentioned above they are also likely to overestimate the risk of the new coronavirus due to its intense media focus if influenza infections and deaths were monitored in the same way each year the public would realise how dangerous the flu really is and how reasonable it is to be vaccinated against it therefore it still does not seem possible to me at least at this stage of the pandemic to decisively state which of the two diseases is inherently more dangerous to human beings or which will eventually cause more human deaths in 2020 flu will cause fewer deaths because the most vulnerable will be vaccinated and health statistics will not properly attribute many indirect deaths to flu which really caused them covid-19 in turn will cause fewer deaths due to epidemiological surveillance the prevention of its spread and possible strict quarantine it may also have seasonal characteristics and simply disappear with the arrival of late spring when we have no other means of defending ourselves against the new virus all we can really do is retreat indoors and prevent the virus from jumping from infected to healthy individuals too quickly people generally do not have an intuitive sense of exponential growth if each newly infected person infects just one more person each day the number of newly infected people will increase from 2 to 16 during the early phase which does not seem like a big increase a little later it will jump to 1024 infected people from 128 over the next three days and that does not sound so terrible either but there will also come four days in which the number of newly infected people will increase from 100 000 to 800 000 when china realised that the covid-19 epidemic was out of control and that it already entered this explosive phase the authorities immediately cut off wuhan and then fifteen other cities from the rest of the country in addition the authorities ordered that the population within these cut-off areas stay in their apartments and not leave it was an unprecedented measure in human history  tens of millions of people were quarantined for weeks everything stopped 12 however this measure produced excellent results and china could keep its death toll below 5000 although the epidemic caught them unprepared and the virus spread to all chinese provinces a recent report from the world health organisations commission made up of 25 international experts visiting china concluded the following chinas bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic faced with an unknown virus china has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history 12 this may be because on these large ships people are mostly older one should look very closely at the age and gender structure of passengers which would tell us more about the final outcome it is also quite possible that a mutated version of the virus which is somewhat more dangerous could have entered such a pocket such isolated groups can always emerge and the disease may actually run a more severe course there this is possible but not very likely also this case-fatality rate should not be extrapolated to the entire country for the same reason once the virus begins to spread through the entire human species it will continue to mutate it will try to adapt to humans as quickly as possible according to previous epidemiological experiences many of those mutations should make it less dangerous for human health as this would lead to a better adaptation however some random mutations could make it more dangerous to us this is why we need to be on our guard until we get better acquainted with the virus and the pandemic is over it is unlikely that the novel coronavirus will mutate to become significantly more dangerous than it is now but we will only be able to assert that with certainty when the pandemic is over these are very difficult questions to answer until we get more quality data from both countries in principle it is possible that the first entry of the virus into a new country may be through an infected person in whom the virus has mutated into a more severe form if all further cases arise from that mutant then the situation in those countries may initially seem more difficult than elsewhere in population genetics this development is known as the so-called founder effect 19 however patterns of spread and case-fatality rates in both countries may also have many different explanations the reason why the death toll among infected people in italy appears to be very high is because the disease is spreading in small-town hospitals and elderly care homes which were completely unprepared for the epidemic the elderly and infirm are at much greater risk of dying if they become infected case-fatality rates in hospital outbreaks where older sick and immunocompromised people are affected will be much higher than those in the community among younger and healthy people among the first several hundred deaths in italy almost all people were over 60 years of age and had underlying illnesses 20 that is why the case-fatality rate seems so high there but it is not representative of the entire population a harsh flu season would probably have done similar damage if people had not been vaccinated against it but it is also possible that there are many more cases in the population than previously thought because the virus has been spreading for a long time in iran however the situation is unclear so far the most likely explanation too is that there are already significantly more cases of infection among the population than it was thought initially if covid-19 proves to be significantly more dangerous than seasonal influenza then one million deaths worldwide could indeed be expected perhaps significantly more unfortunately such a scenario is still possible in principle with a virus that is new and unknown to us for a variety of reasons because of this all experts in the field including myself are constantly urging people to take caution but without the unnecessary panic in which scenarios could the situation become much more difficult first most epidemiologists based on their experience with previous epidemics and pandemics expect the covid-19 case-fatality rate to fall below 1 when the total death toll is divided by a better estimate of the total number of infected people however the virus is new so it is possible in principle for this specific virus that the number of infected individuals who are not confirmed through testing may not be as large as epidemiologists would expect this would come as a surprise to science and would indicate a different nature of this virus the new coronavirus causing covid-19 is somewhat similar to that caused by sars the sars pathogen however had a much higher case-fatality rate if the total population infected by the novel coronavirus is found to be higher than the registered infected population by only two or three times and not by eg ten times or more then the case-fatality rate of those infected with covid-19 could be significantly higher than the flu combined with the lack of an available vaccine in such a case it would lead to a significantly higher number of deaths than the flu however such an occurrence should still be prevented by measures of isolation of the patients and their contacts as well as by quarantines which are not applied in the case of flu we also hope that with the winter ending and the new seasons arriving seasonality would slow down or completely hinder the further spread of the virus furthermore the virus could spread to infected people in some of its more dangerous forms as well as in milder forms previous experiences with epidemics have shown that mutation into milder forms is more likely but mutation into more dangerous forms or those that are more easily spread is not impossible either 3 in some countries such a variant would increase the case-fatality rate locally compared to other countries or accelerate infection this would put their health systems in a really difficult situation as intensive care units would soon become overburdened with poorer care available case-fatality rate of all those infected would increase further with the likely collapse of part of the health system it is also a very tricky scenario in which many health care professionals would become infected over time in providing care to patients which would make the situation worse therefore currently perhaps the most important citizens of any country are health care professionals who work in hospitals for infectious diseases especially in their intensive care units they should be protected not only from work overload but also from coronavirus infection by their patients with the increasing number of infected people with severe forms of disease the demand for quality intensive care respirators and ecmo devices for extracorporeal oxygen enrichment will become the bottleneck of the health care system the same is true for healthy and well rested doctors and nurses in these wards those parts of the health system should be amplified and further strengthened before they come under increased pressure the worst-case scenario imaginable right now is the entry of some more dangerous mutated version of coronavirus into one of the very poor countries in the world with a dysfunctional health system such countries cannot implement satisfactory quality epidemiological surveillance measures then a more dangerous version of the virus would likely infect a larger percentage of the countrys population relatively quickly panic would ensue probably also a black market for the transport of migrants to other countries then a more severe variant of covid-19 would start to expand uncontrollably and in a whole new way in the event of any of these unfavourable developments all of which are unfortunately possible though not likely an entirely new protection strategy would be required each country will have its own approach when the death toll in each of the affected countries begins to rise so much as to cause fear among the population people will become increasingly willing to undertake much stricter epidemiological measures in such a case an increasing number of countries will resort to a solution that has proven effective in wuhan  ie declaring large very strict quarantines it is essential to buy time in such quarantines so that health systems do not become overburdened we should then anticipate the end of winter and hope that there would be evidence of possible seasonality of this virus it may then begin to spread in a weakened manner or disappear altogether at least until next winter there are at least several reasons for optimism first of all epidemiological surveillance and first lines of defence are currently in place throughout the european union if they work well in most countries it is possible that their outbreaks will be controlled and would not enter a phase of exponential growth in the number of infected cases in the most favourable scenario with this retention this novel coronavirus would show seasonality then it would gradually disappear from circulation among humans with changes in nature characteristic of late spring and summer 3 however this is the most favourable scenario in which the final death toll would be much lower than that already caused by the flu this year however if the front line of defence and epidemiological surveillance is broken through by the virus then governments will resort to strict measures to ban assemblies and organise quarantines as the chinese did several models done in recent weeks indicate that strict quarantine should completely suppress the spread of this coronavirus within up to three months 21 this is exactly what we have already seen in china that is why it seems that one great positive lesson of this pandemic is that humanity today would be able to survive even more dangerous infectious diseases than covid-19 with strict quarantine in which people would remain until scientists developed vaccines in this unusual situation this answer has been revealed to us all finally the tireless work of numerous scientists currently testing over a hundred drugs against this virus as well as at least eleven experimental vaccines should be noted 22 it is not impossible that some existing medicines may show some effect and be repurposed to treat covid-19 also vaccines should become available over time in this unusual situation emergence of an effective drug or a vaccine could make a sudden and important difference we should try to find something good in all the bad things that seem to be happening many people may finally realise how dangerous flu is more of them may start getting vaccinated against it each year the flu kills between 250 000 and 650 000 people worldwide 18 in china which is one-sixth of the worlds population the death toll from covid-19 could be stopped below 5000 by the wuhan quarantine if all other countries could implement anti-epidemic measures like china then the death toll from covid -19 could be at most six times higher ie up to 30 000 that would be ten times fewer deaths than the total number of deaths caused annually by seasonal influenza unfortunately many countries will not be able to follow chinas example closely and will have uncontrolled outbreaks if the warmer season does not stop the spread of the virus furthermore if the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the leadership and public health systems of individual countries function it will be possible to produce performance charts for each country in controlling this new infectious disease given the population size and age structure these will be very important lessons to learn in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerous additionally viruses generally spread by contact this means that it is good to be reminded that hands should be regularly and properly washed during epidemics and touching surfaces that many people touch should be avoided knobs handrails atms shaking hands should also be avoided and we should keep at least two steps away from people who have symptoms of respiratory infections it is also advisable to regularly ventilate all living quarters it is also helpful to strengthen personal immunity with sufficient sleep exercise and good nutrition we all hope at this point march 7 2020 that there would be very few i explained why it is no surprise that after the previous six coronaviruses the seventh has now also managed to infect humans nor is its spread rate a surprise as there are both more and less infectious respiratory viruses 3 it would be somewhat surprising for epidemiologists if the total number of infected people in the population was not significantly higher than the number of registered infected people in such occurrence case-fatality rate would indeed become significantly higher than that of the flu we should continue to await the information of well-conducted studies on this key question perhaps the biggest surprises so far have been related to the clinical course of covid-19 rather than its epidemiology for now clinicians in china have reported that registered infected people report to the hospital rather late on average after as many as 9-12 days of home care 23 this may reflect their fear of being admitted to the hospital during an epidemic but it may also be an interesting feature of an illness with slow development in comparison to other respiratory infections furthermore fever does not appear to always accompany other symptoms of the disease in the first few days making it difficult to identify possibly contagious cases by controlling peoples temperatures 23 the media has also reported on the possible return of the virus after suffering from the infection in some cases 24 for now it is hard to know how common these cases are and how many exceptions there are it is often wise to rest well after many viral respiratory infections to allow the body to recover after the infection has ended it is unknown whether this infection can return if the immune system has not completely removed the virus from the body but with all new and unknown viruses such surprises are possible so one should be careful until the pandemic is over in all the answers provided in this editorial i endeavoured to convey the most likely scientific explanations for the abundant information that is published about covid-19 in the domestic and international media over time some of the likely scientific explanations may need to be modified in the light of new information one should not forget that this is a new and unknown virus therefore surprises and deviations from the expected scenarios are in principle possible that is why i emphasise that caution is needed but not panic the community of scientists and health experts will continue to closely monitor the further development of the pandemic obviously we need to prepare for a very serious flu-like illness against which no-one will be able to be vaccinated against for quite a while therefore elderly people and those with underlying illnesses should be extremely careful because the infection is the most dangerous for them having gained our first knowledge of covid-19 we now need to concentrate on preventing the spread of the virus and buying time until the arrival of warmer days then we might be lucky enough to see the virus slowly disappearing due to seasonality unfortunately we cannot know that right now from everything written here it should be understood that all measures of active searching and the isolation of affected patients and their contacts are justified these also include bans on gathering together larger groups of people as well as possible quarantine if the epidemic starts to elude epidemiological control particularly older people should be looked after because the probability of a bad outcome increases significantly with age in addition those with heart disease diabetes or undergoing cancer treatment should take special care  support groups and individual mental health care via video conferencing for frontline clinicians during the covid-19 pandemic ramaswamy viswanathan michael myers ayman fanous   the current coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is placing an enormous emotional stress on frontline healthcare workers1 2 3 4 psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are being called upon to address the mental health threats posed to several clinicians of different disciplines in numbers to which they are altogether unaccustomed never before has the mental health profession been faced with delivering such help on this scale at the same time the threat of contagion requires that such help be delivered from a distance via virtual means a challenging departure from traditional psychiatric intervention this calls for innovative service delivery data are sparse in this area because of the short time since this devastating pandemic started nevertheless there are suggestions for individual interventions and systems interventions3 4 5 6 7 to our knowledge group intervention in this area has not been described in detail in the literature so far though some systems in the usa including ours have begun offering them7 here we report the methods we have developed at the group and individual levels to help our peers and describe in a qualitative manner our preliminary experience since march 28 2020 our university hospital of brooklyn has been designated as a covid-19 only facility by new york state from late march 2020 our department of psychiatry began offering support group and individual video-conference sessions to help our frontline attending physicians resident physicians nurses and other healthcare professionals and students later we began support group conference calls by telephone for our nurses as they preferred this modality over video-conference participation in our groups is voluntary a support group is defined as a group of people with common experiences and concerns who provide emotional and moral support for one another 8 our groups for attending physicians are organized around their roles and specialties such as hospitalists emergency medicine physicians and pediatricians redeployed into adult covid units while in the beginning we thought it might be advantageous to have separate groups for attending physicians and residents later we relaxed that policy at the request of the attending physicians who desired their residents to be included this has not presented any problems probably because in this crisis they both face similar issues and have a sense of solidarity in a desperate fight against a common enemy  in fact attending physicians provided great solace and a calming effect to their junior colleagues we have two facilitators per group drawn from psychiatry faculty and residents for the nursing group there is also a nursing leader serving as a co-facilitator the groups meet weekly for about 40 minutes in the meetings we emphasize that these are peer-support groups encourage spontaneous expression of thoughts and feelings and acknowledge that some may not feel ready to talk but they can still benefit by listening the supportive interventions that we employ are explained in the discussion section we have also set up a system to provide individual counseling sessions to any employee or student in our medical center in a confidential manner all licensed faculty members in our department have made themselves available during certain periods for these sessions via telehealth our institutions employees or students can leave a voice or text message in a confidential manner at a dedicated telephone number or send an email to a dedicated email address senior psychiatry residents screen the messages and schedule an appointment for the caller with a faculty clinician based on availability and the knowledge of each clinicians areas of expertise the faculty clinician can initiate a video conference call from the scheduling software do a brief evaluation provide counseling and if necessary schedule additional sessions issue prescriptions for medications or make outside referrals we estimate that about 40 attending physicians 40 residents and 50 nurses all frontline healthcare professionals have participated in the group sessions and 57 people have used the individual sessions some times more than one person use the same computer or speaker-phone all our nurses participated by audioconference only six attending psychiatrists and 10 psychiatry residents facilitated the groups ten attending psychiatrists one psychologist and one psychoanalyst-social worker provided individual sessions the number of participants in various group sessions has varied from 5 to 14 the number of weekly sessions needed by many groups to terminate with a sense of adequate emotional healing and strength has generally been 4 to 7 the number of individual sessions for a person has generally been two both the group and individual sessions have been found to be helpful by the participants as told to us by them in the group and individual sessions and to their peers by them who in turn told us for example two residents disclosed in their individual sessions with one of the authors mm that they have found both individual and group meetings helpful a few nurses physicians and administrators not involved with the groups have told us that they have heard from the participants how helpful the groups were we did not collect formal measures of distress or outcome data as these were not patients or research subjects and the interventions were done during a dire period of life-threatening collective crisis the individual sessions tend to be used by people who do not want to participate in support groups because the problems they are experiencing are sensitive they want to preserve confidentiality or their issue is of a nature or severity that cannot be adequately dealt with in a peer support group they are also used by employees who are not frontline clinical workers the presenting symptoms have been mostly anxiety-related including some work deployment issues because of the private nature of these sessions we are not giving here details of the discussions in these sessions in the physicians and nurses weekly groups the content of the discussions evolved over time at first they focused on anxiety related to contracting covid-19 and fear of spreading it to ones family and friends on the strain imposed by taking extraordinary precautions to prevent this including social distancing and isolation from ones own family wearing masks at home taking care ones clothing or the places one touches do not place the family at contagion risk and guilt over putting ones family at risk some individuals opted not to go home at all after work but instead stay in the hospital or a hotel or rental apartment in order to reduce contact risk to their families many disliked being bombarded by news and conversations about the coronavirus when they were off work people also complained of the difficulties and discomfort imposed by having to wear full personal protective equipment ppe all the time for long hours in their clinical work and the interference with their collegial relationship at work because of it there was also anger and dismay at the shortage of ppe people used the analogy of soldiers being sent into the battle without armor or arms in later sessions a prominent theme has been the threat to the intimacy of the doctor-patient or nurse-patient relationship physicians and nurses are concerned about dehumanized interactions with patients because they wear their ppe at all times which conceals their facial expressiveness and identifying features as a human being they spoke of how this deprives very ill or anxious patients of the personal comforting they need from their healthcare professionals and frightens the cognitively impaired some are also afraid that communicating traumatic news often in quick succession is making them become numb or robotic in such interactions and they fear an erosion of their humanity because of institutional policies aiming to reduce the risk of contagion they have been prevented from allowing family members to be with their loved ones in their dying moments this has been heart-wrenching for physicians and nurses to bear as they are used to the role of being a bridging and consoling presence between dying patients and their families physicians and nurses also struggle with a feeling of lack of control and a sense of futility in that with many patients they can do little to halt the progress of this disease while attending physicians may have more experience with this clinical dilemma than trainees it has never been on such a massive scale exacerbating this sense of lack of control is the fact that there are very few data on prognostic factors in hospitalized covid-19 patients that they can rely on for their own guidance or to reassure patients and families many patients deteriorate unpredictably and quickly and die death of their own colleagues and family members of colleagues from covid resulted in intense bereavement-focused sessions the deaths of a critical care specialist physician and an emergency department nurse both of whom had worked in our medical center for decades and were widely beloved were especially hard to bear those who got covid and stayed at home for a period of time felt guilty that they were not at the frontline helping when their colleagues were overworked people also expressed guilt about getting free food from well-intentioned donors while they knew that many people in the community they serve were food-deprived people were appreciative of the enormous outpouring of community support and the support they received from their colleagues and the institutional leadership how do we as mental health professionals respond in a therapeutic manner to these themes we utilize reflective listening clarification reassessment of perceptions employing socratic dialogue and relabeling of emotions an example emergency physician the patient was dying i knew his wife was just outside the emergency room in the waiting area yet i could not bring her to the dying persons bedside it tore my heart facilitator so it was heart-wrenching for you that you could not do a basic humane thing and had to let your patient die without family at bedside reflective listening some other examples are given in table 1
 we have existential discussions on control meaning and purpose in life and use of spiritual coping in those who are so inclined and encourage focus on positive aspects of ones personal and professional life we teach affect regulation and mindfulness one of us rv ends each session with a 3-minute meditation utilizing slow deep breathing with instructions as follows abridged close your eyes pay attention to your breathing notice the rhythm of your breathing slow it down breathe in deeply and slowly breathe out gently prolonging your exhalation as you continue to breathe deeply and slowly focus on the movement of air through your nostrils if you would like you may also focus on a word or phrase sacred or meaningful to you as you are focusing on your breath after a minute of doing so while continuing to focus on your breath reflect on the things you are grateful for both in your personal life and in your professional life we encourage people to take minibreaks during their stressful work and use brief mental relaxation strategies during the course of their work such as the meditation outlined above we emphasize the importance of proactively looking after ones physical and mental health including physical exercise sleep healthy nutrition recreation and social connectedness we advocate limited or titrated exposure to covid-19 media breaking news programming to counteract the relentless feeling of powerlessness expressed by some physician participants simply reminding them of the basic tenets of the doctor-patient relationship goes a long way we urge them never to underestimate how much they help their patients and their families by their presence commitment and acts of kindness we lauded one physician who in response to his patients plaintive query doctor am i going to die said we are going to do everything we can to treat this to help you although the patient did die within a few hours there was a collective sense in the group that his physicians words provided some solace without the physician being untruthful we have to keep in mind that our healthcare professionals have not faced before deaths of their patients on such a massive scale in such a rapid manner as of may 27 2020 kings county brooklyn new york where our hospital is located had recorded 5035 covid-19 related deaths the highest number among all the counties in the usa9 this happened in a period of two and a half months this is bound to have a demoralizing effect group interventions help reach a larger number of people with a limited number of mental health professionals and can offer some additional healing elements that individual approaches do not such therapeutic factors include sharing experiences in a peer setting consensual validation support and learning from peers and building a sense of solidarity and camaraderie with fellow group members10 examples are given in table 1 all our nurses prefer audio-only groups over audio-visual groups some nurses have told us that they and their colleagues would not want to show their faces when they are emotionally upset because it is not in their culture we do not know how much of this preference has to do with differences between nursing culture and physician culture in our institution accessibility to a private space in the work place where computer or smart phone use is feasible or cultural issues related to demographics even in the physicians videoconference groups about half the participants keep their video muted they are not seen even though their identity is visible and some selectively unmute their video so that they can be seen at times because of the crisis nature of these-support groups we did not do a deeper investigation of this issue whats most important is to honor and implement whatever format helps as pointed out before some people and problems require individual sessions telehealth interventions minimize the risk of contagion to providers and participants which is important during the covid pandemic they also facilitate access people can participate without losing too much work time or rest time11 telehealth support groups for patients have been successfully deployed before11 they would be easier to set up to help health professionals some of the pointers other institutions can take from our experience psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are not peripheral to this covid-19 crisis but can be at the front and center helping frontline health care professionals preserve their mental health while being effective in helping the patients and the community both group and individual sessions need to be offered groups work best if one member of the clinical service takes responsibility of organizing the weekly videoconference or teleconference and serves as the groups liaison with the group facilitators one has to be flexible with some traditional ways of running groups some people may participate by telephone or computer audio only and some listen without uttering a word but still seem to be benefiting by such participation the groups need to be offered at different periods of day and evening to accommodate different work schedules weekly groups at set times work well the employer needs to give time for the employees to participate in these groups recognizing that this wellness intervention ultimately helps patient care some people prefer participating while they are on site and some others while they are off work the sessions need to be shorter than the traditional 90-minute sessions because of the time constraints imposed by conducting them during work hours our groups typically run for about 40 minutes we hope that peer group support and individual interventions like these will help protect the mental health of a number of clinicians who are doing such commendable and courageous work so that they can continue to effectively help the countless severely ill patients with covid-19 other institutions can adapt these methods to their own needs this is a significant way the field of behavioral health can assist in this moment of world crisis conflict of interest disclosure for all the authors relevant to this manuscript none  science education in the light of covid-19 michael reiss j   i am primarily a biology educator and when considering the adequacy of school science education in a time of covid-19 it is tempting to wring my hands and complain that when i started my school teaching career in the 1980s we did large amounts of teaching about disease we taught at secondary level about a whole range of human infectious diseases with detailed life cycles showing the roles of intermediate hosts and the importance of animal-human transmission we taught about how infectious diseases could be tackled by prevention eg nets for malaria as well as treatment and cure we taught about the role of nutrition and general good health in reducing the likelihood of developing certain diseases and enhancing the bodys ability to respond appropriately if a person did become infected we taught about the immune system and what happens when it fails to recognise a new pathogen or when it over-reacts we taught about immunisation and how different approaches to it were needed for different infectious organisms and i was at the very beginning of my teaching career when hivaids made an appearance and educators responded quite rapidly with materials and pedagogies to be used in schools eg harvey and reiss 1987 but there is not much use in grumbling about historical changes in educational practices and school science education some 35 years ago did not inhabit a golden age what i want to do here is to respond to sibel erdurans call as editor of science  education for position papers about how hps can contribute to science education in the era of the covid-19 pandemic erduran 2020 p 234 the paper will also have resonance to the current stem education special issue of science  education some of the examples in the paper will illustrate that science is situated not only within history philosophy and sociology but also it often has implicit links to mathematics technology and engineering my focus is on school science education recognising that science education takes place in a myriad of other places from those that can respond very rapidly to changing events the news cycle on the internet radio and tv to those that respond more slowly permanent exhibits in museums my aim here is not to look at the specifics of how biology education might respond to covid-19 but rather to examine what history philosophy and sociology of science might contribute and the implications of this for school science to structure my argument i will begin by looking at these three disciplines one by one though it will soon be evident how much they intertwine and towards the end of this article i will argue for the benefits of a more interdisciplinary approach to school science education in a project that is currently delayed in its pilot stage as a result of covid-19 catherine mccrory forthcoming1 writes about the place of history in science teaching she points out that history too often serves in science teaching as decoration and cites the historian of science hasok chang who in his 2015 wilkins-bernal-medawar lecture wrote of accounts of history in science textbooks or popular media they tend to be human interest stories appearing as mere garnishes to presentations of scientific content  stories of heroic scientists who overcame adversity tragic scientists hampered by human limitations and circumstances fortunate scientists who made great discoveries by exploiting chance happenings strange scientists who engaged in bizarre experiments or devised fantastical theories and so on chang 2017 p 92 now i could erect a defence of garnishesthe surface application of detail so as to delight that quintessentially distinguishes postmodernism from modernism in architecturebut instead i will follow chang who goes on to ask whether the study of the past of science can help us improve present scientific knowledgea key question asked in the history philosophy and sociology of science hps and addressed enthusiastically as chang notes by harvards project physics 19621972 and successive school curriculum initiatives in answering his question chang argues that knowledge of the history of science can result in a better understanding of the scientific knowledge that is accepted at present in addition it can give us a better understanding of the methods that scientists use to which i will return in the section on the philosophy of science changs argument from the history of science is one that has had support within the science education community allchin having undertaken an analysis of mendel and genetics kettlewell and the peppered moth fleming and penicillin semmelweis and handwashing and harvey and the circulation of blood critiqued popular histories of science that romanticize scientists inflate the drama of their discoveries and cast scientists and the process of science in monumental proportion allchin 2003 p 330 he concluded that we do not need more history in science education rather we need different types of history that convey the nature of science more effectively allchin 2003 p 329 in an illustration of the reality that in science education we often seem to reinvent rather than build on previous findings and arguments milne had earlier critiqued heroic science stories pointing out that science stories transmit both knowledge and values milne 1998 p 186 chang only mentions motivation once in his articleand then rather negatively in his final paragraph where he writes i noted that history is often used in order to excite curiosity and give inspiration for science and that this motivation often encourages distortions and oversimplifications of history chang 2017 p 104 however as mccrory forthcoming points out student motivation matters when i used to teach secondary students i peppered a form of garnish my lessons with accounts of the lives and work of the scientists behind the science that the students were learning there were no doubt plenty of occasions when even a school history teacher let alone an academic historian of science might have cringed on hearing me but the function of such teaching was not so much for me to teach my students about the history of science it was to engage them to motivate them only occasionallythe role of mendel darwin and wallace in the theory of evolution is a notable examplewere the historical stories key to the science when we focus on covid-19 it seems clear that history has lessons that can help students both the better to understand the emerging science and to appreciate how science is undertaken some of the aims of this teaching will depend on the circumstances under which the teaching takes place i am writing this in early may 2020 where the widespread presumption in many countries is that we are over the worst of the pandemic and what is needed now is a roadmap to restoring countries to normality so that people can get back to work and to normal social interactions much school teaching in so far as it is taking place is occurring on-line or via other modes of distance learning the reality is that for a biology teacher this absence of face-to-face contact makes it more difficult to discern and take account of how students are feelingit may be for example that some students are scared others grieving others bored the most obvious way that a biology educator might see the role of history of science in a time of covid-19 is by considering past pandemics few students will know that the infectious disease that has killed the most humans over the last two centuries records before that time are poor in quality is tuberculosis tb caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis paulson 2013 to this day over a million people a year die from it 15 million in 2018the latest year for which good-quality data have been published world health organization 2020a remarkably about a quarter of all people around the globe have latent tbbut they do not develop symptoms unless their immune system become severely compromised for instance through hiv infection or because of malnourishment resulting from something like homelessness tb is spread primarily by the inhalation of tiny water droplets with the bacteria that are released when someone who has pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis coughs sneezes laughs shouts etc this transmission route is also one that covid-19 has however unlike covid-19 tb is not spread via contact with infected surfacestouching does not spread tb unless the bacterium is breathed in a closely related disease bovine tb is caused by mycobacterium bovis and spread from cattle to other mammals including humans as with most topics in science the history of tb is fascinating and a host of factorspasteurisation of cows milk improved living standards and general health the development and increasing use after the second world war of the bacillus calmettegurin bcg vaccinehas led to it being less of a problem in wealthy countries lienhardt et al 2012 the involvement of cattle in the spread of tb has similarities with the importance of animal-human transmission for covid-19 and there is on-going controversy as to the relevance of badgers in bovine tb tb in cattle and about how bovine tb might best be tackled mcculloch and reiss 2017 personally i would garnish the tuberculosis story with a sprinkling of the terrifying roll call of those who have died from tb just from the world of literature there are anne and emily bront elizabeth barrett browning anton chekhov franz kafka john keats and george orwell who survived long enough to be treated in 1948 with the antibiotic streptomycin discovered in 1943 before dying in 1950 the pandemic that is most often mentioned in the context of covid-19 is the 19181919 influenza pandemic see also the 19761977 swine flu epidemic in the usa neustadt and fineberg 1978 it has been estimated that about 500 million people became infected with the influenza virus one-third of the then worlds population and about 50 million people died a mortality rate of about 10 like covid-19 the disease was another example of a zoonosis a disease transmitted to humans from non-human animals being caused by an h1n1 virus with genes of avian origin jordan et al 2019 but unlike covid-19 mortality seems to have been highest in people younger than 5 years old 2040 years old and 65 years and older fig 1 it is not known where the 19181919 influenza pandemic originatedthough it was probably in the usa europe or china taubenberger 2006 the disease is often referred to as spanish flu the reason for this is not that it originated there but that spain was one of the few european countries to be neutral in the first world war wartime censors in other countries suppressed the news of the influenza fearing its adverse effect on morale it is often the case that countries name diseases after other countries in an attempt to deflect blame from those in power and to stigmatise foreigners syphilis had a variety of names usually people naming it after an enemy or a country they thought responsible for it the french called it the neapolitan disease the disease of naples or the spanish disease and later grande verole or grosse verole the great pox the english and italians called it the french disease the gallic disease the morbus gallicus or the french pox the germans called it the french evil the scottish called it the grandgore the russians called it the polish disease the polish and the persians called it the turkish disease the turkish called it the christian disease the tahitians called it the british disease in india it was called the portuguese disease in japan it was called the chinese pox and there are some references to it being called the persian fire frith 2012 p 50 there are interesting parallels with covid-19 which donald trump of course has more than once referred to as the chinese virus less well known is the story behind the world health organization calling the virus the covid-19 virus viruses are named by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv who have named the causative agent for covid-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 however as the who explains from a risk communications perspective using the name sars can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations especially in asia which was worst affected by the sars outbreak in 2003for that reason and others who has begun referring to the virus as the virus responsible for covid-19 or the covid-19 virus when communicating with the public world health organization 2020bfinally there are similarities between current attempts to tackle covid-19 and historical attempts to tackle the 19181919 influenza pandemic fig 2 masks were used public gatherings banned schools and businesses closed good hygiene practices recommended makeshift hospitals established and desperate unsuccessful attempts made to manufacture a vaccine in the end it was herd immunity that caused the disease to die out if it is herd immunity that causes covid-19 to die out we will have lost millions of people there is much overlap between the history of science and the philosophy of science and there is of course an enormous literature on the nature of science nos in my own country england we have long favoured a simplified version of popperian science in our accounts for school students as to how scientific knowledge is built up as i have written previously poppers ideas easily give rise to a view of science in which scientific knowledge steadily accumulates over time as new theories are proposed and new data collected to discriminate between conflicting theories much school experimentation in science is popperian in essence we see a rainbow and hypothesise that white light is split up into light of different colours as it is refracted through a transparent medium water droplets we test this by attempting to refract white light through a glass prism we find the same colours of the rainbow are produced and our hypothesis is confirmed until some new evidence causes it to be falsified we accept it reiss 2007 63this is not the place to give a 101 account of the philosophy of science more profitable i think is to look at how some of the core issues to do with the philosophy of science might usefully be addressed when teaching at school level about covid-19 we can start with perhaps the most basic thing students are taught to do when beginning to study sciencenamely to measure carefully whether they are determining the length of an object its mass its temperature or whatever let us consider the measurement of mortality that results from covid-19 we can start by noting that it is very likely that countries under-report deaths from covid-19 some of the reasons for this are overtly political but others are to do with more fundamental issues to do with scientific measurement for a start attributing cause of death is often a matter of judgement even if we possess perfect knowledge about the circumstances of a persons death consider someone who under the influence of alcohol falls and hits their head on a kerb and so dies was their death caused by the kerb the alcohol the breakup of their relationship that caused them to drink too much their parents poor marriage which failed to provide a model for a successful relationship or what one thinks of aristotles material formal efficient and final causes and of humes writing about the inherent difficulties of discerning causes for school students they could think about why it is difficult to determine whether people have died as a result of covid-19 reasons in addition to the more general issues raised in the preceding paragraph include the fact that many people die without a clear-cut diagnosis of covid-19 in part due in the large majority of countries to a lack of capacity with testing a consideration which leads to the underestimation of mortality resulting from covid-19 students could also be helped to realise that just because i die and am shown by testing to have covid-19 does not necessarily mean that i died because of covid-19 infectionas per the above fact that about a quarter of those across the globe who die would test positive for tb but the vast majority of such individuals do not die because of ts infection a consideration which leads to the overestimation of mortality as a result of covid-19 then there are what might be termed the indirect consequences of covid-19 on mortality to list just some of these fewer people go to hospital for treatments because they are afraid of becoming infected with covid-19 there leading to an increase in mortality rates greater anxiety and other mental health issues with outcomes that include suicide leading to an increase in mortality rates an increase in domestic violence leading to an increase in mortality rates lower levels of exercise and increased food consumption possibly leading to an increase in mortality rates lower levels of traffic leading to a decrease in mortality rates lower levels of air pollution leading to a decrease in mortality rates and so on the point of this litany is not for students to learn it off by heart but to think about the indirect effects that covid-19 might have on mortality in schools students are all too often given the impression that measurement is a trivial issuesomething that with a bit of an effort and some care that they should be able to sort out straightforwardly measurement relies on mathematics knowledge and it can be considered a cross-cutting theme in stem related problems at best they are taught something about random and systematic errors and anomalous results in reality careful measurement lies at the heart of science and raises a number of philosophical issues tal 2017 for a lovely account of what the boiling point of water is as determined by measurements of it spoiler alertwater only boils at its official boiling point under very distinctive circumstances see chang 2008and the issue is often as much to do with what to measure as to how to measure it with regard to what to measure while mortality is what makes headlines healthcare decisions are rarely made on mortality alone students might be introduced to at least two complicating factors the first is that it may not be that health systems attempt to minimise or should attempt to minimise mortality but to maximise what are called qalys quality-adjusted life years the second complicating factor to which i return below is to do with the economics of health care rationing qalys are an attempt to deal with the obvious truth that most people do not so much want to live longer per se as to have more years of good health qaly calculations therefore attempt to combine the additional years of life that are expected to be gained from a successful intervention with a measure of the effects for patients on the quality of their lives everyone accepts that actually measuring qalys is an inexact science but it is generally thought to be better than not trying to one qaly equals 1 year in perfect health so that an additional year of life has a maximum qaly of 1 and a minimum of 0 or even some maintain less than 0 if the quality of ones life is such that one would be better off dead measuring the additional years of life from a successful medical intervention can be estimated with some confidence measuring the quality of life after a medical intervention is much more difficult and there are various methods used of which the most common is the entirely subjective one of asking people to rate their quality of life on a scale from 0 i would be as well off if i were dead to 100 perfect the relevance of qalys to covid-19 is that while we are still in the early phase of the pandemic it is clear that many of those who recover from covid-19 will have a reduced level of quality of lifefor example because they will require life-long renal dialysis or a kidney transplant state medical systems have when resources are finite to make decisions about how much to treat people and qalys are used to help facilitate such decisions if something like qalys are not used health systems can end up spending all their resources on keeping a relatively small number of people alive when many others could be treated or enabled never to become ill in the first place eg through public health initiatives for the same amount of financial investment and medical time also often a limiting resource in the above i have focused on the measurement of mortality and issues to do with the quality of life but there are other important issues to do with covid-19 and measurement in particular the value of the basic reproduction number r0 ie the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a totally nave population and of the subsequent reproduction rate r ie the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person at any time are both difficult to determine estimates of r0 for covid-19 currently vary by a factor of more than two liu et al 2020 and there is inevitably a time lag between the human behaviours that affect r and subsequent measurements of it students can also be helped to appreciate that r is affected by a very large number of variables to do with both the person who is already infected and those whom they may go on to affect including age gender population density presence of underlying health conditions and a number of variables to do with behaviour such as extent of social interactions and personal hygiene students might also be helped to appreciate that tb while it has a similar value of r to that of covid-19 a recent review gave values that range from 024 to 43 ma et al 2018 is far less contagious in the sense that it is substantially less likely that a person with tb will spread it to someone else per unit of time that they spend in each others company tb unlike covid-19 influenza or colds usually only spreads between family members who live in the same house i have concentrated in this section on issues to do with measurement when measurement is considered in undergraduate physical science courses the emphasis is on issues to do with quantum theory as is well known heisenbergs uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical constants can be measured iconically momentum and position at the appropriate stage of their education students can be helped to enquire whether this is a constraint that results from the effect of observers or whether it is a constraint that is inherent within all wave-like systems however there are as indicated above many other issues to do with measurement that can help students appreciate how the rigorous thinking and conceptual clarity that should characterise philosophical thinking including thinking about the philosophy of science can help illuminate issues of central relevance to covid-19 some of these issues are considered in school biology courses for example statistical issues to do with sampling resulting from limitations on access to data but others are less often considered with any degree of explicitness for example the importance of biological objects being historical products montvil 2019 of course measurement is only one issue with which the philosophy of science concerns itself but i hope that i have shown that there is plenty here to profitably occupy school students when learning about covid-19 issues moral philosophy can obviously be considered as sitting within philosophy but i have given the discipline its own section here in part because even at school level ethics is often given a certain prominence in biology as is the case with debates about the place of history in science education there is a long-running debate about the place of ethics in science education reiss 1999 objections to the inclusion of ethics in science education include the claim that ethics simply does not fit there on epistemological grounds any more for example than aesthetics does and that science teachers lack the expertise to teach it those in favour of including ethics in school science can point to the fact that mathematics is epistemologically distinct from science but we include plenty of mathematics in science and that many students find that the inclusion of ethics in science makes the subject more engaging and relevant for them there is also the argument that including ethics can lead to a better understanding of science understood narrowly for example discussing ethical objections to in vitro fertilisation or cloning can lead to a deeper examination of questions about when human life begins and what we understand by individuality there are a number of ethical issues raised by covid-19 that would make for good discussion in the classroom i will mention two here health care rationing and vaccination health care rationing is not often discussed in school biology lessons where the focus is more often on the acceptability of new technologies such as genetic engineering or cloning environmental issues such as pollution and the loss of biodiversity as a result of human activities and sometimes beginning and end of life issues the reality though is that health care rationing nearly always exists even if it is often kept hidden and even though in countries with public health care systems people like to presume that it does not exist with covid-19 the initial threat in the spring of 2020 that health care systems around the world would be overwhelmed led to a more explicit acknowledgement of health care rationing as there were near panics about the availability of ventilators and other items of equipment not to mention the availability of doctors nurses and other health care professionals the ethical issues that flow from such shortages are principally to do with who gets privileged access for example should someone in the prime of life with young children be favoured over someone in poorer health in their 80s with no dependent relatives at the time of writing we do not know whether it will be possible to develop one or more vaccines against covid-19 unlike health care rationing vaccination is often covered in school biology though the coverage can focus simply on the science with vaccination being presented as an unproblematic success story reiss 2018 after an account of edward jenners classic 1796 experiment on 8-year-old edward phipps itself more than a little ethically problematic by todays standards graphs are presented showing dramatic decreases thanks to vaccination in the incidence of such diseases as smallpox and polio however objections to vaccination began almost as soon as the practice was introduced nineteenth century objections included arguments that they did not work and were unsafe ernst and jacobs 2012 or that their compulsory introduction eg the 1853 compulsory vaccination act in the uk violated personal liberties durbach 2000 to this day vaccination is rejected by some for much the same reasons such individuals are often castigated by health care experts and portrayed as selfish i have nothing against passionate teaching and learning but in a school setting there is the opportunity to examine more carefully the arguments for and against vaccination in a way that can be difficult in students homes such ethical examination goes hand-in-hand with mainstream science teachingfor example teaching that if herd immunity is to help prevent the spread of a disease through vaccination a certain percentage of the population the percentage varies inversely with r0 needs to have acquired immunity done poorly ethics teaching can become no more than a list of arguments for and against certain practices to enhance the quality of students arguments students need to be introduced to some of the main ethical frameworksmost likely consequentialism duties and rights and virtue ethics my own view is that it is easier for science teachers to teach about ethics than it is for specialist ethics teachers to teach about science which is another reason for including ethics in the science classroom rather than hoping that the ethical implications of science get covered somewhere else in the school curriculum however if ethics is to be covered in school science students need to be assessed appropriately both formatively and summatively reiss 2009 when one looks at examples of the summative assessment of ethics in school philosophy and religious studies courses one finds that good candidates are expected to be able to write at some length and to craft a developing argument furthermore banding rather than the allocation of precise marking points is often employed in the mark schemes used by the organisations that set the official school examinations in philosophy and religious studies notable too is the expectation that candidates taking these examinations should be able to criticise major ethicists and be familiar with the contrasting views of a range of both classical eg kant sartre bentham and contemporary eg singer authors at present such features are rare to the point of non-existence when ethics is examined at the end of school science courses within hps the contribution of sociology is probably best known through the work of t s kuhn and the subsequent science wars more generally sociology is the discipline principally concerned with how people behave in society the specific field of medical sociology traditionally analysed such things as patient-doctor relationships but has grown to encompass any of the cultural as opposed to biological effects of medical practice in relation to covid-19 medical sociologists indeed sociologists more generally are therefore interested in such things as who gains access and who does not gain access to technologies for prevention and treatment classically much sociology looked at the importance of social class gender and ethnicity on matters like living conditions work patterns and wages it is already clear that all three of social class gender and ethnicity along with disability are of great relevance for the likelihood of someone becoming infected by covid-19 and dying as a result there is therefore a normative element to medical sociology which therefore overlaps in its interests with moral philosophy there is now the growing emergence of a body of specialised sociological analysis in relation to covid-19 sadati et al 2020 point out that one of the most important consequences of the covid-19 outbreak has been the worldwide creation of social anxiety they link this to ulrich becks pioneering book risk society beck 1992 in which beck as did other sociologists such as giddens argued that while societies have always been exposed to risks modern industrialised societies are particularly exposed to risks that are the result of modernisation itself indeed it is clear that contemporary practices in food production and travel have at the very least fuelled the covid-19 pandemic brown 2020 also hones in on issues to do with risk pointing out that they cannot be equated with probabilities and draws on mary douglas classic work on everyday rituals and their purpose and her assertion that it is essential for each culture to believe that the other cultures cherish wrong-headed concepts of justice douglas 2007 p 9 it is not of course my contention that school students should be introduced in science lessons to the work of sociologists like beck and douglas rather students can be introduced in the context of covid-19 to sociological ways of thinking and ways of examining data and questioning human practices such activities can help students the better to appreciate for example the enormous differences between countries in terms of how they have reacted to the pandemicdenial lockdown social distancing use of masks use of technologies for contact tracing faith in a vaccine or treatments etc i have already commented how sociology overlaps with moral philosophy it also overlaps with disciplines like politics in my final section before some conclusions i examine the contributions of disciplines other than history philosophy and sociology to science education as exemplified by covid-19 though i recognise that some sociologists would include much of economics and politics within their own discipline in schools students are often given the impression that scientific knowledge comes first in terms of temporality and is then applied to technological problems the economics behind science the politics of the societies within which science is funded and enacted and issues to do with psychology are rarely considered yet these disciplines have great influence on the science that is undertaken and then used in society ziman 2000 describes the legend as being that account of science that is entirely realist and keeps it separate from such influences few school students are likely to need much persuading of the relevance of economics and politics to covid-19 in terms of politics covid-19 provides an opportunity for students to consider how democratic and non-democratic governments including those in monarchies theocracies and totalitarian regimes can differ in their response to events the importance of psychology is perhaps not quite as clearthough one could try asking students why covid-19 has caused far more draconian governmental action than other viruses that are either more dangerous eg ebola sars or regularly infect huge numbers of people eg the various influenzas or to diseases such as tuberculosis mentioned above that at the time of writing kill many more people every year than covid-19 has to date students can also reflect on the diversity of opinions within countries about attempt to contain the virus fig 3 and the psychological factors that might be behind these the mention of economics politics and psychology raises the more general issues of interdisciplinarity back in 2013 melissa leach and ian scoones published an article with the title the social and political lives of zoonotic disease models narratives science and policy the abstract of which is worth citing in its entirety zoonotic diseases currently pose both major health threats and complex scientific and policy challenges to which modelling is increasingly called to respond in this article we argue that the challenges are best met by combining multiple models and modelling approaches that elucidate the various epidemiological ecological and social processes at work these models should not be understood as neutral science informing policy in a linear manner but as having social and political lives social cultural and political norms and values that shape their development and which they carry and project we develop and illustrate this argument in relation to the cases of h5n1 avian influenza and ebola exploring for each the range of modelling approaches deployed and the ways they have been co-constructed with a particular politics of policy addressing the complex uncertain dynamics of zoonotic disease requires such social and political lives to be made explicit in approaches that aim at triangulation rather than integration and plural and conditional rather than singular forms of policy advice leach and scoones 2013 p 10 leach and scoones provide a powerful argument for the benefit of an interdisciplinary approach in tackling zoonoses like covid-19 science curricula pedagogies and assessment should not be changed in a knee-jerk reaction whenever some new science-related issue arises nevertheless science curricula perhaps especially biology ones have a history of changing appropriately in response to important science-related issues that arise in society it seems likely that covid-19 constitutes such an instance the question then arises for those convinced as i am of the value of hps for science education as to how hps can usefully play a role i have tried to sketch out some possibilities above of course not everyone is convinced of the worth of hps in school science in such circumstances and focusing on covid-19 though the point holds more generally those of us keen to see hps playing more of a role in science education might profitably argue that the history of science the philosophy of science and the sociology of science can all help promote scientific literacy and the public understanding of biology cf reiss et al 2020 covid-19 can also be presented as a socio-scientific issue in a recent article hancock et al 2019 examine how science teachers collaboratively design ssi-based curricula they note that ssi curriculum design requires careful consideration of the focal ssi to ensure that it features both social and scientific components they found that issue selection by teachers was characterised by iterative discussion in the three dimensions of leveraging existing resources mobilising passions and exploring issue relevance at present covid-19 resources are beginning to be developed and it is certainly a topic that is relevant and likely to mobilise passions  evaluating covid-19 public health messaging in italy self-reported compliance and growing mental health concerns 1 soubhik barari stefano caria antonio davola paolo falco thiemo fetzer stefano fiorin lukas hensel andriy ivchenko jon jachimowicz gary king gordon kraft-todd alice ledda mary maclennan lucian mutoi claudio pagani elena reutskaja christopher roth federico slepoi raimondi  the covid-19 death-rate in italy continues to climb surpassing that in every other country we implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the italian government public health efforts and citizen responses findings 1 public health messaging is being heard except for slightly lower compliance among young adults all subgroups we studied understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the sars-cov-2 virus remarkably even those who do not trust the government  or think the government has been untruthful about the crisis believe the messaging and claim to be acting in accordance 2 the quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the populations mental health policy recommendations communications should move from explaining to citizens that they should stay at home to what they can do there we need interventions that make staying following public health protocols more desirable such as virtual social interactions online social reading activities classes exercise routines etc -all designed to reduce the boredom of long term social isolation and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations interventions like these will grow in importance as the crisis wears on around the world and staying inside wears on people 1 roma capitale municipality of rome convened our covid-19 international behavioral science working group to i strengthen its public health policies and guidance ii suggest new policies and guidance based on rigorous behavioral science and iii develop empirical evidence about behavioral change we report here empirical results and policy interventions aimed at achieving the objectives of the national italian government concerning the containment of the pandemic thanks to tim spa fastweb spa and indra italia spa for financial support the current version of this paper is at garykingorgcovid-italy   at the request of government officials from the country hardest hit by the covid-19 crisis we evaluate public understanding of italian government public health messaging about the crisis we do this via a nationally representative survey of 3452 italian adults between march 18th 2020 and march 20th 2020 a statement of ethical approval appears in appendix a we draw five main conclusions and present evidence for each in the following five sections first most demographic groups especially the elderly believe in and follow health measures section 2 second even skeptics about the seriousness of the disease and of the governments messaging truthfulness and abilities still largely believe the messaging and report being in compliance with it section 3 third most people especially the elderly and infirm leave home only for reasons deemed essential section 4 fourth the population is experiencing high levels of anxiety especially vulnerable groups section 5 and finally nudges to improve attitudes and compliance that are already near their maxima have little effect section 6 methodological details including survey questions appear in appendix b we now present two pairs of figures describing beliefs about public health measures figures 1 and 2 and compliance with recommended health practices figures 3 and 4  the first figure in each pair gives overall results and the second is broken down by demographic group what does the italian public believe about recommended health measures regarding the covid-19 crisis figure 1 shows that our subjects are appropriately cautious nearly 100 endorse four recommended public health measures handshake avoidance social gathering avoidance non-essential activities curfew and non-essential shop closure of the four the curfew and shop closure are slightly less popular but an 89 endorsement rate is still remarkable compared with decades of advice to reduce smoking drinking and lack of exercise these levels are very high all demographic groups strongly agree with these four measures though there is consistent small disagreement amongst respondents reporting that they are in excellent health  figure 2  when asked to reflect in writing about the social costs of reneging on the quarantine nearly all respondents express agreement and emphasize collective responsibility a representative open text reflection from the entire respondent sample reads  3 i believe that everyone should stay at home leaving only for the bare minimum and taking security measures only in this way can we solve and solve this enormous problem in the shortest possible time we note that older respondents 1 consistently express worry or anxiety and 2 perceive that others in the public are reneging on their duty a representative reflection from the 60 subgroup reads  4 i fully understand everything that is happening so in spite of myself i stay at home but i would like this to include all those people who unfortunately continue to go out especially the young even every day i think the longer we stay home the sooner we get out we turn from respondents beliefs to their actual behavior figure 3 shows that a majority of respondents report that they have been strongly complying with recommended health practices week histograms correspond to responses to item 1  in the past week on a scale from 1-100 to what extent did the following describe your behavior  in the appendix b dashed lines show average score figure 4 shows that seniors 60 women and healthier individuals say they are more compliant with most health practices relative to others the young defect from social distancing and hand-washing in a statistically significant sense poor-health individuals are notably less compliant with staying at home but with high variance the reason may be their frequency of hospital and pharmacy visitation see figure 8  given the public salience of these health measures it is likely that self-reports suffer from social desirability bias future studies should validate the compliance rates

likely working parents aged 40-49 more consistently cite economic distress and struggles with home-schooling and work than other groups which of course might well have been the case if we had a control group from before the crisis overall this confirms that different demographic groups are struggling with different aspects of quarantining going forward these groups might benefit from personalized morale-boosting interventions the average level of anxiety surrounding the crisis in the population is high none of our respondents reported being completely without anxiety  figure 11

although anxiety might be driving healthy behaviors and pro-health beliefs described above additional anxiety due to ones vulnerable status is likely to negatively impact long-term mental health it is possible that increased messaging may not inform but rather exacerbate anxiety for inherently vulnerable groups like seniors and the immunocompromised despite these differences the overall levels are very high for every group  in case the messaging was not effective we implemented a fully randomized survey experiment with informational interventions to try to drive strong pro-health beliefs figure 1 and 2 and positive opinions about the crisis response  figure 5 and 6  a third of respondents assigned to the control group received no message a third received a message about social externalities

italians and stay home please write 1-2 sentences reflecting on this message how does it make you thinkfeel  and the last third received a message about social externalities with a prompt to name a

covid-19  in fact these beliefs were so close to the ceiling to begin with there was little room for an intervention to have an effect figure 13 and 14 report the results nearly everyone in all three messaging groups -social externalities with reflection social externalities with personal naming and no message -agreed on the necessity of canceling social gatherings closing non-essential businesses imposing a curfew and avoiding physical contact the treatments did little to decrease skepticism or cause backlash figure 14  we further did not find that receiving treatments changed any intention to leave home in the coming week or the reasons for doing so there were also no significant treatment heterogeneities on any outcome by gender age health group anxiety levels or any past behavioral reports or other attitudinal traits this is consistent with a theory of information overload  that is before our intervention everyone already received this information and accepted its importance from previous studies advertising government messaging friends family and other sources though some rejected therefore additional information is unlikely to change anyones beliefs on the necessity of the given measures indeed the maximum theoretical effect which would be seen by moving these percentages up to 100 was close to the measurement uncertainty 12  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is

people willing to share this message we gave respondents the option of sharing a message of their choosing with up to 5 people the vast majority 90 chose not to share the message but100 people who received our reflection treatment were significantly less likely to share with anyone those who did share were consistently people who strongly believed in the efficacy of social distancing nothing else predicted sharing behavior including receiving an information treatment there are two explanations for this 1 most skipped over this prompt 2 most other than those who strongly endorse social distancing believe their friends and families already know and wouldnt additionally benefit from this information the latter is consistent with our theory of information overload  it is likely that we can greatly expand this behavior by tuning this message overall this experiment suggests receiving new information is not changing beliefs behavioral intentions or message-spreading largely because the population had adopted these beliefs prior to our survey in other words the control group with no messaging from us has been receiving the same messaging in other ways for weeks the italian population is receiving public health messaging understands it and most -save for small numbers of young people and skeptics -claim to be following it closely those who take it seriously defect for mostly universally recognized acceptable reasons eg groceries medicine new messaging campaigns designed to accomplish the same purpose should not be the focus at this point however the negative psychological effects of the quarantine -most commonly boredom perceived immobility and anxiety -are beginning to wear on people and seem likely to become more serious over 13  cc-by-nd 40

spread of covid-19 it would be helpful to find ways of reducing these negative effects of the quarantine a messaging campaign that suggests how to make the quarantine easier and more frictionless rather than repeating the now well-known dire reasons to stay indoors should begin possibilities include messaging about online collective exercises social reading activities eg perusallcom for schools and universities safe ways for people to get fresh air outside classes eg edxorg for online classes or novel ways of bridging social capital between young and old or even distribution of inexpensive tablets or laptops to ensure the whole population has video conferencing abilities if we look for activities and interventions that make the quarantine easier for those affected by it the population may be able to better tolerate the treatment for as long as it takes to overcome this public health crisis respondent of an intensely personal impact of non-compliance with the quarantine

expert or celebrity advice and healthcare sector externalities ie flatten the curve the survey proceeded by then asking respondents for their beliefs social perceptions and perceived efficacy about government andor public safety measures respondents were also asked about their trust in government and the degree to which the government was providing factual information about the crisis we asked respondents a series of questions about anxiety stress and worry around the current circumstances next respondents were asked about their future behaviors -namely whether they planned to leave the house in the next 5 days and their top reasons for leaving as well as negative aspects of complying with staying at home finally respondents took a brief personality battery provided personal demographic information and were asked whether they would share either the social externalities message or some other message of their choosing with upto 5 of their friends or loved ones via text or

topaloglu serhan ziya  on june 24th governor cooper announced that north carolina will not be moving into phase 3 of its reopening process at least until july 17th given the recent increases in daily positive cases and hospitalizations this decision was not surprising however given the political and economic pressures which are forcing the state to reopen it is not clear what actions will help north carolina to avoid the worst we use a compartmentalized model to study the effects of social distancing measures and testing capacity combined with contact tracing on the evolution of the pandemic in north carolina until the end of the year we find that going back to restrictions that were in place during phase 1 will slow down the spread but if the state wants to continue to reopen or at least remain in phase 2 or phase 3 it needs to significantly expand its testing and contact tracing capacity even under our best-case scenario of high contact tracing effectiveness the number of contact tracers the state currently employs is inadequate  this report provides a summary of our analysis into how social distancing measures along with testing and contact tracing capacity will likely impact the evolution of covid-19 pandemic within the state of north carolina until the end of 2020 this analysis is based on a model which was first introduced in 4  a report on the findings of a similar study conducted for new york city for the convenience of the reader this paper is prepared as a self-contained document that includes a complete description of the mathematical model and therefore parts of it which pertain to the mathematical model in general overlap with 4  the first covid-19 case in north carolina was identified on march 3rd and the state of emergency was declared on march 10th on march 30th statewide stay-at-home order was put in place and non-essential businesses were ordered closed these orders stayed in place until may 8th starting with that date the state entered phase 1 of its reopening process on may 22nd phase 2 took effect with a scheduled end date of june 26th however on june 24th governor cooper announced that this date has been pushed three weeks into the future to july 17th it is not clear whether the state will indeed move to phase 3 on that date or it will be postponed again over the last few weeks north carolina has experienced significant increases in the number of new cases and hospitalizations as the state has continued to lift restrictions at the same time pressures that have forced the officials and other administrators to open up the economy economical political or otherwise appear to be still there and it is not clear what course of action will help balance the competing priorities our objective is to investigate the impact of different social distancing measures the state might choose to put in place in the future whether increases in states testing capacity might help in mitigating the impact of reopening on hospitalizations and deaths and what resource demands will be needed for contact tracing in the following we summarize our main findings for a broad description of our mathematical model see section 7 for details see the appendix we do not know the exact current testing capacity in north carolina however the data indicate that the maximum number of tests performed on a single day is between 25000 and 30000 therefore we chose a testing capacity of 30000 per day as the base case we also do not know what the testing capacity will be in the future but to get a sense of the impact of the test availability on controlling the spread of the disease we considered 60000 per day as an alternative scenario the top and bottom panels of figure 1 respectively provide the trajectory of projected daily deaths under the testing capacity of 30000 per day and 60000 per day each data series in the two panels corresponds to a different level of social distancing that will be practiced starting with july 17th we consider three possibilities moving to phase 3 staying in phase 2 or going back to phase 1 all assumed to be in place until the end of the year it is important to note that we do not expect the state to stick with any one of these three choices until the end of the year however comparing the projection under each scenario provides some insights into what kind of impact each one of these choices will have on the diseases spread as we can see from the blue curve in the top panel of the figure with a testing capacity of 30000 tests per day moving to phase 3 will likely be disastrous with a major peak that will arrive some time in early november and a projected number of deaths of approximately 160000 by the end of the year labels on the right end of each panel give the total number of deaths by the end of 2020 in fact such a major peak would mean that hospitals would be overwhelmed to such a level that they may not be able to provide their regular level of care and the mortality rates might end up being more than what the data to date suggest and our analysis assumes if the state chooses to stay in phase 2 there will surely be fewer deaths however we predict that there will still be a significant increase in daily deaths and hospitalizations compared with current levels with a peak in december from the bottom panel we can see that having more tests would definitely help resulting in fewer deaths but even a capacity of 60000 tests per day will not be sufficient to prevent a major wave of hospitalizations and deaths in fall the figure suggests that what will help in reining in the spread of the disease is going back to the restrictions that were in place in phase 1 regardless of whether the testing capacity is 30000 or 60000 it appears that increasing testing capacity at least to 60000 will not help mitigate the impact of relaxing social distancing measures the discussion in the previous section suggests that even if the state does not move into phase 3 and stays in phase 2 until the end of the year hospitalizations and deaths will soar over the next few months even if the daily testing capacity increases to 60000 moving back to phase 1 would help but given the highly likely economic impact of taking such an action it might be helpful to consider alternatives in particular it is of interest to investigate what levels of testing capacity might be sufficient for different levels of social distancing that might possibly be experienced in the coming months as a result of different policies that might be employed figure 2 shows the trade-offs between the total number of deaths by the end of the year and the level of social distancing to be practiced post july 17th under different testing capacities the horizontal axis shows the level of social distancing expressed as a percentage relaxation in the social distancing norms in reference to what was experienced before phase 1 under the stay-at-30000 tests per day 60000 tests per day home order thus 0 corresponds to stay-at-home whereas 100 is full relaxation corresponding to life before the pandemic with no restrictions in place social distancing levels that correspond to phases 1 2 and 3 are also marked on the x-axis so that the reader can get a sense of roughly what different social distancing levels correspond to social distancing levels in phase 1 2 and 3 respectively correspond to 25 50 and 75 which is in line with social distancing estimates in 6  the vertical axis shows the total number of projected deaths by the end of 2020 each data series corresponds to a different level of testing capacity our analysis assumes that new testing capacity and social distancing norms become effective on july 17th in computing these projections we use the reported number of tests performed on each day up to june 15th between june 15 and july 17 we assume 30000 tests are conducted daily current discussions and political and economical climate in the state suggest that going back to phase 1 is not being considered as a serious possibility at least in the near future in fact with planned opening of the schools and colleges in late summer the state is on path to further opening this suggests that it would make sense to pay more attention to the right half of figure  2  the part that corresponds to relaxation levels that are larger than 50 ie either staying at phase 2 or moving further to phase 3 and beyond there we can observe that having more tests available everyday would make a significant difference to be clear having more tests cannot be a substitute for social distancing as we can see from the figure even under the daily testing capacity of 200000 the total number of deaths by the end of the year would be very large social distancing appears to be the only way to keep the spread under control still it is important to note that even if more tests will likely not alter the dynamics of the diseases spread it will at least help in keeping the numbers smaller one important point to highlight about our model is that it assumes that there is a contact tracing policy in place more specifically it assumes that close contacts of individuals who test positive are identified and they are asked to self-isolate which helps in reducing new infections in the population in fact this is the main reason why in our model more testing helps without contact tracing the benefit of having more tests beyond a certain level would be minimal our analysis makes certain assumptions about the effectiveness of contact tracing but there is in fact significant uncertainty around this issue to partially address this uncertainty we consider alternative scenarios in regards to contact tracing effectiveness and investigate the changes in our projections as we explain in the appendix because we are not aware of any studies on contact tracing in the united states we used a study conducted in china to come up with a rough approximation for a parameter that captures the contact tracing effectiveness we control the effectiveness of contact tracing via the parameter ctep which stands for contact tracing effectiveness parameter for details on ctep we refer the reader to the appendix where likofbeinginfected is used for ctep but it might be useful for the reader to know that ctep is basically an indicator of how successful contact tracing is in identifying asymptomatic infected individuals over the non-infected ones if ctep  1 this means that contact tracing is of no use at all and higher values of ctep indicate higher likelihood of identifying infected people or more effective contact tracing our analysis above assumed ctep  5 based on our rough approximation for the parameter figure 3 considers two additional cases one with ctep  2 and the other with ctep  10 all under the assumption that the state will continue to operate in phase 2 until the end of the year not surprisingly when contact tracing is more effective number of deaths decline considerably nevertheless even when ctep  10 we project a very large number of deaths and hospitalizations by the end of the year with a major peak in late fall however it is important to remind the reader that in fact we do not know how effective contact tracing is or will be in the future and it is possible that even setting ctep to 10 might be underestimating the actual effectiveness we do hope that is the case as that would suggest that given the substantial decreases in the projected number of deaths with increased contact tracing efficiency and perhaps combined with increased testing capacity the state might be able to keep the spread somewhat under control the critical question in that case would be whether the state has the sufficient resources for contact tracing this is what we investigate next there are mainly two components of contact tracing first close contacts of individuals who test positive are identified and tracers contact these individuals informing them about the possibility of their having been infected and giving them directions as to what they need to do over a period of roughly two weeks second during this period when these close contacts need to self-isolate unless they are tested and result comes negative tracers periodically contact them to check up on their conditions and ensure that they are self-isolating figure 4 shows our daily projections for new cases who need to be interviewed to determine their close contacts while figure 5 shows our projections for the number of individuals who need follow-up calls from contact tracers again we can see from the figures that contact tracing resource needs peak some time in fall regardless of how effective tracing is however the effectiveness has a significant impact on the number of tracers that would be needed for the mid-range effectiveness scenario where ctep  5 the maximum value for the number of daily new positive cases is 7121 whereas the maximum value for the number of isolated individuals who need follow-up is 127617 according to the estimates by the fitzhugh mullan institute for health workforce equity of the george washington university a single contact tracer assuming an 8-hr workday would be able to interview six index cases individuals who test positive or make 12 initial contact notifications or make 32 follow-up calls 5  this would then mean that north carolina would need roughly 7550 contact tracers this number is very close to 7700 the current estimate by the fitzhugh mullan institute our estimate would be roughly 11630 for ctep  2 and 2860 for ctep  10 according to recent reports 14  north carolina has roughly 1500 contact tracers meaning that even under our more optimistic scenario of high contact tracing effectiveness the states tracing resources would fall short of meeting the demand our main objective in this work has not been to make precise predictions for key metrics like number of deaths number of hospitalizations etc but rather to understand the dynamics of the spread of the disease how these dynamics would depend on the states testing and contact tracing capacity and provide insights into whether the existing capacity is sufficient for the state to reopen without overwhelming its healthcare resources therefore the reader should take the precise values of the estimates we report in this paper with a grain of salt but give credence and pay more attention to the insights we generated through their analysis collectively unfortunately this analysis strongly suggests that even if north carolina does not move to phase 3 on july 17th without further restrictions the number of new cases hospitalizations and deaths will continue to increase substantially peaking some time in fall there are several ways that this grim prediction may not become reality one possibility is for the state to reimpose some of the restrictions that were in place in phase 1 of the reopening alternatively of course the state might continue with is reopening plan but take other actions that would significantly limit person-to-person transmission such as enforcing face covering requirements more strictly the goal here should be to bring down the transmission rate at least to the levels achieved under phase 1 the current economic and political climate in north carolina suggests that reimposing restrictions is not very likely and it is not clear whether strict requirements for face coverings could keep new infections down as the state keeps opening if the state continues with its reopening plan with no further restrictions there appears to be only one way the spread of the disease can be kept under control and that is through extensive testing combined with effective contact tracing there is some uncertainty as to how effective contact tracing will be but it is safe to say that north carolina is significantly understaffed to keep up with the workload that will be generated for contact tracers over the next few months therefore it is essential for the state to quickly hire new contact tracers to keep up with the impending jump in their workload and ensure that contact tracing is effective in identifying infected individuals and prevent them from infecting others in the community it is also important to understand that testing capacity and contact tracing capacity are directly tied to each other and any meaningful response should include increasing both in some proportional manner beyond certain levels of testing capacity further increases will not bring much benefit if contact tracers are already overwhelmed similarly hiring more contact tracers will be meaningless unless the state continues to test at certain numbers everyday without further action from the state one possibility that could alter our predictions is that with the increased public awareness around how the disease spreads the infection rates for different phases might end up being lower than what we assumed in our analysis based on the mobility data it is also possible that over the next few months the diseases spread might follow a course that is quite different from what we observed so far this may not necessarily be a result of some form of mutation in the virus but could simply be a result of the changes in the demographics of the population who is infected by the virus over time in fact our analysis of the most recent data from north carolina suggests that there appears to be some drop in the overall mortality rate and this appears to be a national trend recent news articles reported that median age of individuals who test positive has dropped substantially since march 13 and such a change in the infected population would reduce hospitalization and mortality rates interestingly in north carolina even though we observe a drop in mortality rates hospitalization rate appears to not have changed in any significant manner if this trend continues it is possible that the scale of the problem we will face will be smaller than what we expect based on our analysis however it is important to keep in mind that younger individuals who tend to be mostly asymptomatic and are more socially active can spread the virus more easily to different segments of the population which might increase the hospitalization and mortality rates back up again in any case it would be prudent to not put our hopes on possibilities that are beyond our control but take actions that would help even under the worst circumstances our model follows the standard susceptible-infected-recovered paradigm with compartments capturing individuals classified along the dimensions of infected noninfected and recovered as well as symptomatic-isolated asymptomatic-isolated and asymptomatic-nonisolated once an individual is tested positive a certain number of individuals who are expected to have been in close contact with the positive individual are transferred to a certain isolated compartment in this way we build a contact tracing mechanism to ensure that those who have been in contact with a positive individual reduce their contact with the rest of the population running our model with a starting date of march 2 we get a trajectory of the pandemic that is in reasonably close agreement with the actual trajectory in north carolina so far in the appendix we give a discussion of our model and provide comparisons of its output with the actual trajectory of the pandemic wang  the appendix is organized as follows in appendix a we discuss our model at a high level this section avoids any technical details but it is useful for seeing how our model works what compartments it uses and how the different compartments interact with each other in appendix b we provide the full mathematical details of our model in appendix c we elaborate on the parameters of our model and how they are estimated we borrow some of the parameters from the literature and derive others based off of problem primitives we explain how we arrive at the derived model parameters in appendix d we compare the output of our model with the trajectory of the pandemic in north carolina until early may and demonstrate that our model does a reasonably good job of predicting the trajectory that has been observed so far in our model we capture the two benefits of testing which are isolating the specific individual tested positive and tracing the contacts of the positive individual in particular our model distinguishes the infected individuals who know that they are infected from the infected individuals who do not know whether they are infected once a person is tested positive this person is an infected individual who knows that she is infected such a person minimally infects others moreover considering the individuals who do not know whether they are infected we classify them as symptomatic-isolated asymptomatic-isolated or asymptomatic-nonisolated once an individual is tested positive a certain number of people around this person are classified as asymptomatic-isolated people so these individuals reduce their contact with the general population preventing them from infecting others to some extent our model follows the standard susceptible-infected-recovered modeling paradigm in figure 6  we show the compartments in our model the boxes represent the compartments the arrows represent the possible flows between the compartments the three compartments on the right of the figure capture the individuals who know that they are infected in particular the compartment labeled ki corresponds to the infected individuals who know that they are infected and not yet hospitalized the compartment labeled h captures the infected individuals who are hospitalized the individuals in the latter compartment also know that they are infected the compartment labeled kr captures the recovered individuals who knew that they were infected perhaps optimistically in our model the individuals in all of these three compartments minimally infect others since they are aware that they were infected the nine compartments on the left side of the figure capture the individuals who do not know whether they are infected some of these individuals will in actuality be infected some will be noninfected and some will even have recovered without knowing they had been infected we classify the individuals who do not know whether they are infected along two dimensions in the first dimension any such individual could be symptomatic-isolated asymptomatic-isolated or asymptomatic-nonisolated asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals do not show symptoms of the disease and do not make an effort to reduce their contact asymptomatic-isolated individuals make a conscious effort to reduce their contact mainly because they have been in touch with a person who tested positive symptomatic-isolated individuals show symptoms but do not know whether they are infected their symptoms may be due to other diseases once again perhaps optimistically in our model all symptomatic individuals isolate themselves so we do not have a compartment for symptomatic-nonisolated people symptomatic-isolated and asymptomatic-isolated individuals infect others with a smaller rate when compared with figure 6  compartments used in our model asymptomatic-nonisolated people when stricter social distancing norms are enforced all individuals will reduce their contact with the general population but we follow the assumption that asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals will still maintain a higher contact rate with the rest of the population than asymptomatic-isolated and symptomatic-isolated individuals considering the individuals who do not know whether they are infected we classify them along another dimension in this second dimension an individual who does not know whether she is infected could be infected noninfected or recovered thus considering the nine compartments on the left side of figure 6  the compartment labeled i an  for example captures the infected and asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals who do not know whether they are infected note that these individuals are infected in actuality but they do not know that they are infected and they maintain a high contract rate with the rest of the population being nonisolated when we perform tests on a segment of a population the proportion of positive tests is given by the fraction of the infected individuals in the segment relative to the size of the whole segment for example using the label of a compartment to also denote the number of individuals in the compartment since there are n an  r an  i an asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals if we test t asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals then the number of positive tests is t  i an n an r an i an  so far we indicated two reasons for our model to be optimistic in addition our model assumes that close contacts of every positive case are traced and these close contacts remain in isolation for 14 days or until they are tested negative in other words our model implicitly assumes that the bottleneck is the testing capacity not contact tracing capacity it is important to note that growing the testing capacity in the state beyond a certain level without growing the contact tracing capacity will not be of much benefit so any decision regarding how much to grow the contact tracing capacity should be directly informed by the plans to grow the testing capacity in this section we provide a detailed description of the system dynamics of our model the state of the system at each time period t is described by a vector where the variables i t an denote the states associated with the nine compartments on the left side of figure 6  these nine compartments correspond to individuals whose covid-19 status is unknown the variable d t denotes the number of individuals who die in period t and the variable h t denotes the number of individuals who are hospitalized in period t the variable ki t captures the number of individuals who have been confirmed to have covid-19 and are currently infected in period t the variable kr t captures the number of individuals who have been confirmed to have covid-19 and recovered by period t description of sub-compartments for our state variables we use regular font to denote scalars and bold font to denote vectors we use vector notation when a compartment has multiple sub-compartments representing different subgroups of the population here are the descriptions of the sub-compartments  sub-compartments within the i si compartment the i si compartment has 3 sub-compartments a those who will recover naturally without requiring any hospitalization b those who will require hospitalization and c those who will die without access to a covid-19 diagnostic test thus  we use the notation t si  i t si recovered  i t si hospitalized  i t si death to denote the total number of individuals in the i si compartment the trick we use here is that when an individual is infected we immediately decide whether this person will recover will be hospitalized or will die we keep the identity of the individual accordingly throughout the simulation  sub-compartments within the i ai compartment the i ai compartment has 2 sub-compartments a those who will never develop covid-19 symptoms and b those who will show covid-19 symptoms but are currently pre-symptomatic thus and we let t ai  i t ai recovered  i t ai show symptom denote the total number of individuals in the i ai compartment  sub-compartments within the i an compartments similar to the i ai compartment the i an compartment has 2 sub-compartments a those who will never develop covid-19 symptoms and b those who will show covid-19 symptoms but are currently pre-symptomatic thus and as before we let t an  i t an recovered  i t an show symptom denote the total number of individuals in the i an compartment  sub-compartments within the h compartment the h compartment consists of two types of individuals a those who will die and b those who will eventually recover thus we have h t  h t die h t recovered   sub-compartments within the ki compartment the ki compartment consists of two types of individuals a those who will require hospitalization and b those who will recover without visiting a hospital therefore we have that ki t  ki t hospitalized ki t recovered  we assume that the diagnostic test is 100 accurate and the result is obtained instantaneously however when we perform the test we cannot differentiate between unknown infected unknown non-infected and recovered people we can only test people based on their observable characteristics at the beginning of each period we test t si symptomatic-isolated individuals t ai asymptomatic-isolated individuals and t an asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals we assume that the tests are administered at random within each of these populations let  si   ai  and  an denote the fraction of symptomatic isolated asymptomatic isolated and asymptomatic non-isolated individuals respectively who receive diagnostic tests then the above fractions drive the dynamics across compartments which are described below based on the events that can occur in our model in the fraction  si  we assume that the infected symptomatic-isolated individuals from the death sub-compartment are inaccessible for testing our description below is organized by the compartments for each compartment we describe the inflows outflows and the new state at time period t  1  infected symptomatic-isolated compartment i si  as noted earlier the i si compartment has 3 subgroups of individuals a those who will recover naturally without requiring any hospitalization b those who require hospitalization and c those who die without access to a covid-19 diagnostic test thus denotes the total number of individuals across the three sub-compartments inflow the inflow to the i si compartment consists of 3 sources given by -non-infected symptomatic-isolated n si  individuals who did not get tested and were newly infected during period t the number of such individuals is given by where t an 1   an   t ai 1   ai   t si 1   si  represents the infected population who remains untested and

individuals is given by where inftosymptime represents the average number of days until an infected person displays symptoms in our model we set inftosymptime to be 5 days see section c for more details -infected asymptomatic-isolated i ai  individuals who become symptomatic using a similar logic as above the total amount of such inflow is given by we assume that a fraction hospoutofsympfrac currently set at 20 of the total inflow to the i si compartment will require hospitalization and a fraction deathoutofsympfrac 2 will die without being tested the remaining 1  hospoutofsympfrac  deathoutofsympfrac  78 will recover at home justifications for these fractions are given in section c outflow there are four destinations for the outflow from the i si compartment -individuals in the recovered sub-compartment i t si recovered will move to the recovered asymptomatic-nonisolated r an  compartment at the rate of 1symptorecoverytime where symptorecoverytime represents the average time for a symptomatic individual to recover from the disease currently symptorecoverytime is set at 14 days -individuals in the hospitalized sub-compartment i t si hospitalized will move to the h compartment at the rate of 1symptohosptime where symptohosptime 5 days represents the average number of days from symptom onset until hospitalization -individuals in the death sub-compartment i t si

sub-compartment will move to the known infected ki compartment due to testing update equations let recoveroutofsympfrac  1hospoutofsympfracdeathoutofsympfrac we have the following update equations

likelihood that a contacted individual is in the infected population as compared to the non-infected and recovered populations we set likofbeinginfected at 5 we assume that a fraction symptomfrac

outflow from the i ai compartment  non-infected symptomatic-isolated compartment n si  inflow the inflow to the n si compartment has two sources -non-infected asymptomatic-nonisolated n an

equations we have the following update equations in this section we discuss how we obtain the estimates for different model parameters we assume an incubation period of 5 days 11  after an individual develops symptoms we assume it takes another 5 days for the individual to become hospitalized 18  specifically we set inftosymptime  inftohosptime  symptohosptime  5 we set the recovery time for symptomatic individuals to be 14 days in our model we do not differentiate between recovery at home versus at the hospital and set symptorecoverytime  hosptorecoverytime  14 we set the time for a symptomatic individual to die to be 14 days similar to the recovery time we do not differentiate between deaths at home versus at the hospital and set both symptodeathtime  hosptodeathtime  14 11  we assume that individuals who self-isolate after being identified as a close-contact or develop symptoms from a non-covid-19 illness spend an average of 10 days reducing their contact with others while the who recommends a quarantine period of 14 days the cdc gives a less stringent recommendation of 10 days 2  we set selfquartime  asymptorecoverytime  10 in our model non-infected and recovered individuals develop symptoms due to non-covid-19 diseases at a rate of noncovidsymptrate  1 1200  this rate is based on the assumption that 10 of the population is infected over the course of 4 months this is roughly estimated using the flu symptom rate in past years as reported by the cdc 3  we set n  10 490 000 the population of north carolina in 2020 we also assume that 34 966 individuals corresponding to 03 of the population initially has symptoms due to the seasonal flu this is calculated assuming that flu symptoms last for an average of 4 days we use sympoutofinffrac to denote the fraction of covid-19 infected individuals who develop symptoms numerous reports have given different estimates for this fraction from 82 on the diamond princess cruise ship 10 to roughly 40 on the uss theodore roosevelt 16  we set sympoutofinffrac  50 the parameter hospoutofsympfrac denotes the fraction of symptomatic individuals who need hospitalization we set this value to be 20 the parameter deathoutofhospfrac denotes the fraction of hospitalized individuals who die we set this value to be 333 both of these values are roughly estimated using historical hospitalization and death numbers as reported by new york city 15  finally we assume that some portion of the infected population die at home without hospitalization we denote this portion as deathoutofinffrac and set it to 2 we estimate this value using the number of probable deaths as reported by the city the basic reproductive number r 0  captures the average number of new infections produced by each infected individual there are numerous recent studies estimating the value of r 0 for covid-19 these estimates vary widely from anywhere between 22 9 and 57 17  furthermore it is possible that r 0 varies across different countries and cities due to climate environmental and sociological differences as a result we set r 0  304 according to a tuning procedure using historical hospitalization and death statistics as reported by north carolina we briefly discuss the details of this procedure in section d the rate of new infections is controlled by  the contact rate between infected and non-infected populations in a standard compartmentalized model the number of new infections during any time period is captured by in our model we have a similar term for every pair of infected and non-infected compartments we employ two different contact rates  h and   so we differentiate their usage according to whether we are considering isolating or non-isolating compartments we set  h  r 0 n symptorecoverytime and use this as the contact rate between infected and non-infected compartments that are both non-isolating when at least one of the compartments is isolating or symptomatic we assume that contact between these populations is reduced by one third and use the contact rate   2 3  r 0 n symptorecoverytime  beginning on march 27 we reduce both  h and  by a factor of 12 this reduction is due to social distancing measures associated with the nc stay-at-home order we set this reduction to 12 according to data from ihme that reports that starting april 1 mobility in north carolina was reduced by approximately 50 6  on may 8 we assume that phase 1 relaxes social distancing to 25 of the stay-at-home level on may 22 we assume that phase 2 relaxes social distancing to 50 of the stay-at-home level the parameter contactperposcase denotes the average number of close contacts that are identified via tracing for each covid-19 positive individual we assume that close contacts are always identified from within the non-isolating population to estimate contactperposcase and the proportion of infected and non-infected individuals within the close-contact group we use the results of 1  a comprehensive study on contact tracing this study reports the results of contact tracing in shenzhen china but the index cases are mostly travelers arriving from hubei province to the best of our knowledge there are no detailed studies on contact tracing in the united states therefore we use findings reported for the hubei province in china and its capital wuhan to estimate contactperposcase and to get a rough approximation for likofbeinginfected as explained in the following in this study the authors identified 1286 close contacts based on 292 covid-positive cases this suggests an average close contact group size of 1286292  44 for each covid-positive individual identified according to recent news articles the state of massachusetts which has recently initiated a comprehensive contact-tracing effort found that the average close contact group size is two 12  therefore we set the parameter contactperposcase to 4 in our model the parameter likofbeinginfected is a multiplier that captures how much more likely it is for an infected individual to be identified as a close contact as compared to a non-infected individual and therefore can be seen as a measure of the effectiveness of contact tracing specifically  it would be reasonable to consider settings where likofbeinginfected  1 only since if contact tracing is of any value at all it should make randomly chosen infected people more likely to be identified as close-contact than non-infected people in order to get at least some rough approximation for likofbeinginfected we use the following approach we can show that likofbeinginfected  p infected  close-contact p non-infected  close-contact  p infected p non-infected  thus we need estimates for the proportion of infected versus non-infected individuals within the non-isolating population as well as the proportion of infected versus non-infected individuals among people identified as close contacts of the 1286 close contacts studied in 1  98 tested positive thus we estimated the proportion of the infected to non-infected within the close contact group to be p infectedclose-contactp non-infectedclose-contact  981188  0082 next we estimate p infectedp non-infected the proportion of infected to non-infected in the general non-isolating population using findings of studies done on data collected from wuhan around the same time the study discussed in 1 was conducted according to 8  in wuhan the probability of death after developing symptoms was 14 using this estimate and the number of deaths in wuhan which is reported as 4512 by the johns hopkins coronavirus resource center 7 we can estimate the total number of infected individuals in wuhan over the course of the pandemic at least as of now to be 322286 in order to estimate the total number of infected individuals at some random time between mid-january and mid-february we divide this by two and use 161143 as the average number of infected individuals at a given time this approximation implicitly assumes a linear build-up of new covid-positive cases which is not true for infection spread within a population but nevertheless serves as a reasonable rough estimate then using 11000000 for the population of wuhan we estimate p infectedp non-infected to be 161 14311 000 000  161 143  0015 finally using our estimates for the infected to non-infected proportion within the close-contacts and within the general non-isolating population we estimated the ratio of these two proportions to be 00820015  547 clearly this is a very rough approximation and it would not be reasonable to reach conclusions based on results only on this estimated value therefore in our analysis we consider scenarios that assume different values around 547 specifically in the main body of the paper we report results based on three settings with likofbeinginfected set to 2 5 and 10 respectively corresponding to increasing levels of contact tracing effectiveness we manually calibrated two parameters of the model to roughly match its output to the observed trajectory of the pandemic up until april 15 these two parameters are the r 0 value and the initial number of infected asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals on march 2 we ended up with an r 0 value of 304 and an initial infected asymptomatic-nonisolated population of 676 these starting parameters are tuned based on hospitalization death and test data up to june 15 we use testing data from the nc department of health and human services we assume that the tests are conducted daily on people in the order of symptomatic isolated and finally non-isolated people the plots in figure 7 show the epidemic trajectory as predicted by our model in particular figure 7a shows the total number of currently hospitalized symptomatic infected asymptomatic infected and known infected people on each day as projected by the model in figure 7b  we compare the cumulative number of deaths predicted by our model with the actual cumulative number of deaths in figure 7c  we plot the actual daily number of tests conducted and positive cases found in north carolina we use the same historical testing capacity in our model we set the testing capacity to 30000 for future projections in this plot note that the daily number of positive tests in our model fluctuates because we use the actual number of tests performed in north carolina until june 15 as the number of tests performed in our model however the number of positive cases identified in our model emerges from the internal behavior of our model the fit between the model and the actual trajectory in terms of positive cases is reasonably good figure  7d shows the daily number of active hospitalizations reported by north carolina against the number of hospitalizations projected by our model   religious nationalism and the coronavirus pandemic soul-sucking evangelicals and branch covidians make america sick again peter mclaren   recently journalist amanda marcotte 2020 shared a disturbing story a train engineer named eduardo moreno apparently with great deliberation derailed the freight train he was manning in southern california nearly killing occupants of three nearby cars his target the usns mercy a navy medical ship thats been assisting nearby hospitals with covid-19 patients the rationale given by the train engineer is enough to cause even the most reserved introvert to spit fire marcotte elaborates apparently moreno believes in a conspiracy theory that the coronavirus crisis is a hoax being deployed to cover for a shadowy takeover of the government will sommer 2020 reported on an illinois woman inspired by pro-trump qanon conspiracy theory videos who traveled to new york city armed with more than a dozen knives and who intended to kill former vice president joe biden she tried to get near to the us navy hospital ship comfort the hospital ship that was sent to new york city to help with the coronavirus pandemic but mistook the comfort for the uss intrepid a retired aircraft carrier like many qanon believers she had become obsessed with the comfort convinced that its being used to rescue mole children from the clutches of liberal elites who enjoy sodomizing and then cannibalizing young children some of these same conspiracy theorists believe that children are being held hostage in secret tunnels beneath city streets by liberal democrats to be used in rituals designed to conjure satan a vigilant trump was apparently onto them in a thrice and is preparing to bring the evil doers to justice sommer and marcottes reporting identifies one type of conspiracy theory-fueled insanitythat which has infected the trumpster qanon followers and those who enable them including the previously anti-vaccination crusader president donald trump but there is another type of insanity the one that attempts to separate the rich and the poor and then pretends that such a separation does not exist trump and the conspiracy theorists belong in this camp

frightening and in this toxic mix of circumstanceswhere we are saddled with a president who has claimed that a final us coronavirus death toll of approximately 100000 to 200000 people would indicate that his administration has done a very good job rupar 2020the evangelical community is putting countless numbers of people at risk by refusing to stop holding large church gatherings and refusing to cease its decades long attack on science in the usa the evangelical community has found a second-tier messiah in the person of donald trump mclaren and jandri 2020a christian nationalism in the age of trump is a religious virus that gives no respite to its hostthe commonweal and its enduring search for spiritual and material prosperity but trump is no fool when it comes to pleasing his basehe had been cannily throwing them red meat long before his run for president and as president he is well on the way to defunding planned parenthood and in the mind of many evangelicals to bringing about the biblical apocalypse approximately 40 of american adults are biblical apocalypticists and believe that jesus will or likely will return to earth by 2050 dias 2020 from the time that the coronavirus crisis first appeared on the shores of gods favorite piece of real estate it became clear that it is comorbid with christian nationalism or to put it another way christian nationalism seems to be a co-occurring condition relative to pandemics that reach the shores of america the beautiful mclaren and jandri 2020a some religious scholars in fact are in agreement that there is a two-way relationship between religion and nationalism a mutual reification and buttressing as grzymala-busse 2019 explainsin this relationship religiosity defines the nationand nationalism reinforces religiosity leading to unusually high rates of national identification with a given religion and high rates of religiosity itself this mutual reinforcement characterizes countries where religious participation and religious nationalism are both high such as the philippines poland ireland until the late 1990s or the united states grzymala-busse 2019 and while this is certainly true we cannot blur the distinction between the sacred dimension of religion and profane sphere of the political nation which remain separate even when they contradict andor reinforce each other i would not want to make the case that christianity is equivalent to the political state in whose wheelhouse trump sits in washington when he is not bedizened in golf attire swinging the clubs at mar-a-lago but it is increasingly clear that trump has identified himself with charismatic pentecostal and evangelical christianity largely for political reasonstheir practitioners perceive him as a divine instrument of god and are prevalent in key states important for trumps reelection chances i am largely against religious states in principle and have said so when speaking in israel or pakistan or the west bank palestine i have always supported freedom of religion within a secular state apparatus open to a wide range of religious faiths and i have always defended the separation of church and state thomas jeffersons phrase in articulating my understanding of the intent and function of the establishment clause and free exercise clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution which reads congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof see mclaren and jandri 2020b ignoring the constitution those who have helped to manufacture the virus of christian nationalism boast no need of critical sobriety and less need for metropolitan intellectuals with their incessant insistence on finding new ways to clamp down on what they see as the necessary separation of church and state christian nationalism is a sickness that poisons every ethico-political reservoir of hope and possibility with a fatal hubris for decades the messages of prosperity preachers have hollowed into my mind sometimes in the form of a revolving worm announced by a roll of thundering apocalyptic prose and on other occasions like a flaming corpse decamped from the grave of undiscovered history and in my most paranoid moments they take the shape of unclean spirits shooting like roman candles from some pungent weed-strewn sepulcher right out of buffy the vampire slayer on the surface christian nationalism may seem about as dangerous as the skeletons that spring from the crypt at spook-a-rama courtesy of denos wonder wheel amusement park on coney island but that would be a serious miscalculation what cannot be denied is that christian nationalism in the age of trump and his disaster capitalism cabinet stalks the halls of the white house and the nations airwaves like marx and engels hobgoblin rudely awakened from the depths of oblivion former evangelical frank schaeffer states were at a time now when the naked lickspittle enablement of donald trump by his evangelical followers is more horrifying than ever schaeffer in boggioni 2020a he goes on to say when we come to this time of covid-19 overtaking our country a literal life and death issue we see two things very clearly one is the utter moral bankruptcy of this leader who pits himself against governors trying to save their people and the second is the utter moral bankruptcy of evangelical the white evangelical voter schaeffer in boggioni 2020a after being placed in charge of the coronavirus crisis the first action undertaken by mike pence was to form a prayer circle with evangelical supporters later the state of oklahoma held a statewide prayer day where megachurch pastors from all over the state appeared with gov kevin stitt r-ok to try and pray away the coronavirus and of course prayer circles popped up all over the country that would not be so bad if these titans of christian power were not part of a long tradition that was infamously anti-science rational- and religious-minded citizens as well as atheists and i count myself as among the former group have no immunity to this type of siege to this type of hobbesian war of all against all we have no maid of orlans armor of god that can protect us from the battlefield tactics of idolatrous trumplar knights from this inescapably salty theology creeping up our spine like a winter chill at a nova scotian fishing village and from this widespread winnowing of reason this twitterverse phrasemongering pitched from a mar-a-lago golf course caddy shack the trump cults that operate like impassioned yet enigmatic love functionaries for jesus and the 45th president regularly hand over our future to corporations which chomsky refers to as private tyrannies falcone 2015 a measure tantamount to having a spiritual death wish that will surely lead to self-destructive turmoil if not a fate more harrowing than even end times prophets can wrench from the moribund secrets hidden within ancient scrolls discovered on episodes of the naked archeologist the trump cult places in counterpoint the endless sweep of falsehoods about the coronavirus and the turbid unyielding faith of those who propagate such falsehoods see peters et al 2020a b while we lack at present a set of evidentiary standards for establishing the empirical existence of religious nationalism that goes beyond the invocation of religious motifs and symbols in politics grzymala-busse 2019 it seems reasonable to assert that religious nationalism is alive and well among trumps evangelical christian baseand its not pretty according to anna grzymala-busse 2019 religious nationalism especially in the christian world has shaped the very definition of legitimate citizenship delineating the nation and privileging some political actors and visions in making public policy obtaining electoral support and building states religion as it relates to behavior belief and belonging is extremely ramped up among evangelicals in terms of attending religious services evangelizing and taking part in communal religious activities such as bible study or prayer according to grzymala-busse 2019belief is an internalized and personal adherence to the doctrine and to the sacred the personal level and kind of faith acceptance of doctrine and relationship to the deity the sacred and religious teachings belonging or affiliation is a much weaker connection it may simply consist of self-identification or a nominal belonging to a given religiongrzymala-busse 2019 elaborates that where nationalism seeks political recognition and sovereignty for the nation religious nationalism does so for a nation first and foremost defined by religion she also points out correctly that referents of religion are the sacred and the transcendental nations are fundamentally mundane and political and i fully agree with the observation that whether religion and nation replace reconcile with or reinforce each other they are conceptually and empirically distinct additionally i would argue that intense activities such as bible study prayer proselytizing participating in religious pilgrimages and peregrinations contributing to religious publications and attending religious performances can create the contextually specific conditions of possibility for religious nationalism once the tribal conditions in american politics are met for the creation of a patriotic protestant temperament and once trump was elected reshuffled the government and began to communicate through twitter the tribal conditions were set in place twitter for trump is equivalent to the microphone at the lectionary of a church from here he can dictate the catechism for the days events the compatibility and mutual buttressing between the secular state and the evangelical community redound to the trump administration solidifying his christian base while accentuating the chasm between the illegitimate state and the true religious calling of the country to bring freedom to all nations of the world whether this includes imposing sanctions or bombing those countries back to the stone age the hebraic idea of people enjoying a special covenant with god has had an impact on northern irish afrikaner and israeli nationalismand also on us nationalism grzymala-busse 2019 the narratives of nations as divinely chosen people have merged religious and national identities in these countries and i would say that trumps moving of the us embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem certainly has secured the gratitude of many israelis and christians who believe that this action brings the world one step closer to armageddon and the coming of the messiahfor christians this would mean that jesus would establish the kingdom of god on earth and true christians who had repented their sins would receive heaven as their reward the pandemic for some is seen as a divine reset get ready the locusts having been swarming in east africa wildfires have ravaged australia and the golden trumpet was shaken free from angel moronis hand on top of the salt lake temple during a recent earthquake dias 2020 while it might be that those totemic entities known as sports have displaced religion as the chief factor in human group relationships in the usa religion is still going strong just witness how many americans today believe in angels some reports say 8 in 10 cbs news 2011 alt-right ethno-nationalist movements are identifying with nordic symbology just look at the symbols on alt-right shields during their confrontations with antifa are they seeking historical continuity with the inhabitants of ragnarok are they seeking the twilight of the gods where odin and the fenrir wolf will fight each other to the death and where loki will go against the aesir and fight heimdall to the death will tyr and the watchdog garm that guards the gates of hel kill each other stay tuned for a new season of the coronavirus dating game where participants will compete to find couples who are still alive in new york city clearly as grzymala-busse 2019 puts it religious nationalism thus reinforces popular religiosityand that religiosity becomes a marker of who belongs to the nation and who is a true member of the national community this statement could not be more apposite than in the usa today given the anti-muslim policies of trump and the hostility toward migrants immigrants and those seeking refugee status as a result of experiencing persecution in their own countries and of course there are other attitudes that accompany religious nationalism that are associated with cultural homogeneity and the preservation of national traditions these include natalism redistribution to members of the religious nation the preservation of national religious symbols and traditions grzymala-busse 2019 in contrast religious nationalism holds little affinity for increased diversity or change in national composition grzymala-busse 2019 religious nationalism thus correlates with high levels of hostility toward immigrants and other new groups that dilute the existing national identity grzymala-busse 2019 and of course there is an antipathy toward stem cell research abortion rights same-sex marriage divorce and other issues that are related to public policy conflicts between secular and religious authorities reinforce old borders as well as breed new borders and borders are prone to propagating violence give me a border and i will show you an enemy some evangelical christians who argue that christianity is under attack in the usa have motivated christian militias to prepare for a holy war against the deep state religion and nation god-talk and nation-talk all those contentious and toxic analogues tend over time to genuflect toward conflictif not outright violence that is the nature of this virus is it any wonder that the nrx movement refers to trump as the god-emperor who has the power and will to restore order to an immigrant-flooded nation under the thumb of a progressive media-academic complex  global jewry in neo-nazi-speak obrien 2020 obrien writes thatthe neoreactionary movement also known as nrx or dark enlightenment is a geeky subset of the racist misogynistic far-right that has festered in silicon valleys libertarian circles for over a decade especially within the cryptocurrency community its members revere peter thiel microdose lsd and gussy up totalitarian ideas with a pseudo-intellectualism that creates a moral pretext for them to undermine  engineer they might say  democracy obrien 2020 and to say that christian nationalism i would link this to the prosperity gospel ideology which is deeply imbricated in the logic of capitalism that is the ruling ideas which marx argued are inextricably braided to the ideas of the ruling class is plague-infested would be an insult to the power of the plague if the prosperity preachers are wincing from criticisms by fellow evangelicals they certainly know how to hide it as they continue to double down on their convictions their embrace of trumpwho before his presidency rarely ventured into spiritually loaded territoryhas been widely documented and commentaries that have offloaded scathing criticism are not difficult to find the evangelical community continues to preen itself as the spokesperson for the correct trajectory of todays political christianity and in doing so has proclaimed donald trump as the new christian messiah mclaren and jandri 2020a weve all seen their performances on television or in personthe flair the

religious celebration preaching while enthralled with the sensation of being enthralledit all boils down to this we might profitably entertain this preponderance of delusion by asking the following questions could this spectacle be traced to the hebraic idea of the covenant which is revealed in the narratives of nations as divinely chosen people could it be tied historically to the advent of confessionalization or the protestant reformation see grzymala-busse 2019 could this type of spectacle be a twentieth-century remnant of biblical literalism or the detritus of an arch monasticism so spiritually claustrophobic that it finally led to a mass exodus to the cities could religious hysteria have slowly trickled down through the ages only to be rekindled in big tent revivalism and the eventual appearance of the praise-be-to-god-amening-hallelujahing grahams falwells robertsons swaggarts whites tiltons bakkers and others of this grandstanding self-serving ilk could it be that god is having a kayleigh mcenany-type meltdown or can the spectacle be traced to something more recent a sloppy metaphysics spun from the lecture halls of liberty university perhaps an overweening estimation

pathological logic and demonic invective of rightwing broadcasters like rush limbaugh could be a contributing factor to the madness that surrounds us see mclaren and jandri 2020b dont you feel falwell must be one of limbaughs dittoheads cant you just picture jerry falwell jr in miami his scarf billowing in the night air as he drives his convertible into the parking lot of his favorite dance club listening to rush on the radio or simply put is the lock-step attachment of evangelicals to trump more of a case of just plain hypocrisy on the part of the contemporary evangelical leadership surely there is much more to the story and there is benjamin e park 2018 writes that during times of national or international crisis the power of religious rhetoric is a force that can always be counted on historically to focus on and reinvigorate the idea of american nationalism and in recent years its singular purpose has been to connect christianity with the republican party which can be seen in the moral majoritys ascension to the national stage in the 1980s and its connection to ronald reagan and the republican party park 2018 but we can see explicit religiosity and conservatism reaching back even earlier to the framers of americas federal government though the framers of americas federal government sought a distinction between denominational influence and state powerso much so that evangelical observers critiqued the constitution as a godless documentpartisans quickly capitalized on the power of religious rhetoric in political debates park 2018 in the age of revolutions which included both the french revolution and the american revolution key figures turned to biblical figures for inspiration according to park 2018 french philosopher jean-jacques rousseau for instance looked to moses as the premier example for turning a national body into a political body that lived together with stability and peace in germany friedrich schlegel argued for a symbiotic relationship between religion and politics park 2018 the french revolution caused american leaders to become concerned about the violence into which france descended promoting competing theologies of national belonging park 2018 and causing some politicians to rationalize french anarchy and violence as a result of a lack of religious devotion among its citizens the french revolution influenced americas concept of exceptionalism and placed christianity at the center of the idea of patriotism park 2018 there was fear that the french revolution was a threat to christianity globally and the influence of writers such as thomas paine became a concern of major significance since he was in favor of banishing religion from society and embracing secularism in its stead and embracing the enlightenment commitment to universal rationalism as a challenge to religious authority and authoritarianism consequently park 2018 writes that in a world of growing secularism the united states is presented as a last refuge for explicit christian devotion and in recent times burgeoning religious nationalism has even made possible one of the unlikeliest of alliances the loyalty between evangelical ministers and donald trump the ideological hieroglyphics directing trumps thinking are not hard decipher as bob cesca makes clear when he writesduring a presidency thats beyond satire no one really anticipated that trumps red hat militia would end up being a death cult but here we are the cults warped calculus is basically this trump will only be re-elected with a prospering economy but if covid-19 decimates the economy trump could lose so we have to save the economy literally at any cost even if it means we have to sacrifice older americans who typically vote republican cesca 2020trumps evangelical base seems to be adhering to their masters logic and besides kathaleen wall a member of the texas state republican executive committee and a candidate for texas 22nd congressional district is euphoric that the coronavirus has a silver lining its going to save more people than it kills this weekbecause abortion clinics in the state of texas have been closed chapman 2020a i am certain most of trumps salvation corps would agree the evangelical communitywho are less likely to be seen wearing a protective mask while shopping at the local piggly wiggly than their scientifically minded atheist brethrenhas received an upsurge of attention during the coronavirus crisis journalist catherine stewart disagrees that christian nationalism is equivalent to a religion since she notes the positive things many evangelicals and other christians are doing with respect to the coronavirus crisis she prefers to view christian nationalism as a political ideology that cloaks itself in religious rhetoric and as a political movement that put trump in power cited in chapman 2020b she writes the movement promotes an anti-science culture  that has obviously contributed to our inability collectively to address this crisis in an evidence-based fashion misinformation is rife in those hyper-conservative and highly politicized religious communities that were all in for trump chapman 2020b trump has boasted about his effectiveness in mobilizing the country against the coronavirus crisis but amanda terkel has shown the extent to which trump downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus when it first showed up in the usa this timeline is worth quoting in fullon feb 10 he repeatedly predicted  at a meeting with governors at a campaign rally and in a fox business interview  that the coronavirus would no longer be a problem by april he then made this claim at least three more times a few days laternow the virus that were talking about having to do  you know a lot of people think that goes away in april with the heat  as the heat comes in typically that will go away in april were in great shape though we have 12 cases  11 cases and many of them are in good shape now feb 10looks like by april you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away feb 10i really believe they are going to have it under control fairly soon you know in april supposedly it dies with the hotter weather and thats a beautiful date to look forward to feb 10we think and we hope based on all signs that the problem goes away in april feb 13theres a theory that in april when it gets warm  historically that has been able to kill the virus so we dont know yet were not sure yet feb 14i think its going to work out fine i think when we get into april in the warmer weather that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus feb 14on feb 10 there were 12 confirmed cases of covid-19 the illness caused by the coronavirus in the united states according to johns hopkins university now there are nearly 200000 and on tuesday the death toll in the us surpassed 3000 making the virus more deadly than the 911 terrorist attacks that reshaped much of american life who knows how many people will have died as the result of the coronavirus by the time this article sees print terkel 2020 trump has referred to the covid-19 as the corona flu minimizing its potential to wreak lethal havoc on the us population geriatric populations especially are at major risk mike davis 2020 reports that the death rate among those over 65 is 23 in italy and 18 in britain because of the shortage or unavailability of test kits containment in the usa is virtually impossible and without testing it is difficult to ascertain the size of the infected population davis 2020 reminds us that this virus is mutating as it courses through populations with different age compositions and acquired immunities davis 2020 also points out that even if the virus remains stable and little mutated its impact on under-65 age cohorts can differ radically in poor countries and amongst high poverty groups davis admonishes journalists and western governments for egregiously ignoring the threat of the coronavirus to the global poor he warns us that the only certainty is that rich countries and rich classes will focus on saving themselves to the exclusion of international solidarity and medical aid walls not vaccines could there be a more evil template for the future the usa was woefully unprepared for previous flu seasons and its hospitals were unable to cope with those who became stricken as a result of profit-driven cutbacks of in-patient capacity which resulted in a shortage of medical supplies and hospital bed availability davis notes 2020 that er conditions in such institutions are already unable to cope with seasonal infections so how will they cope with an imminent overload of critical cases already 380000 nursing home patients die every year from facilities neglect of basic infection control procedures nursing homes are very likely to become coronavirus hotspots davis 2020 underscores the unwillingness of big pharma to participate in the development of new antibiotics and antivirals remarking that of the 18 largest pharmaceutical companies 15 have totally abandoned the field they are more interested in producing profits by churning out tranquilizers pain killers and viagra davis warns that as the antibiotic revolution is rolled back old diseases will reappear alongside novel infections and hospitals will become charnel houses the role of the big lie in germanys wwii persecution of the jews is often attributed to goebbels and the nazis and was used to push long-standing anti-semitism into the unholy precinct of torture medical mutilation and mass executions jennifer rubin cited in burris 2020a condemns fox news for spreading what amounts to the big lie with respect to appropriate ways of reacting to the coronavirus she writesin short fox news  its anchors its contributors its panelists and its guests eg republican elected officials  have spread provably wrong information to its viewers on arguably the most important story in our lifetimes said rubin a large percentage of americans who form the trump cult and absorb his misleading information its like the flu plenty of tests get their misinformation reinforced by an outlet that seeks as its main goal to support the president rubin in burris 2020a clearly trump is no 1950s commando cody-type hero when it comes to a national crisis commando cody defended us from the radar men from the moon trump cannot make enough test kits available for the american public in fact he has clearly exacerbated the crisis by dint of his initial cavalier attitude toward it and yet even the medical experts have waffled on exactly how to fight the virus at first they said that americans do not need to wear masks then they changed their minds kenen and roubein 2020 report the agency said the virus spread through droplets from coughs and sneezes  but then warned about catching it from people with no symptoms or even from surfaces like subway turnstiles or metal shopping carts it said young people are at low risk  but the hospital beds and morgues of new york called that into question and while confusion has reigned supreme among the trump administration including its medical teams what is very clear is that the country should be practicing social distancing and residents should remain in their homes unless they are part of essential services to the community many trump supporters however are flagrantly disregarding the advice of medical experts since they want to show their loyalty to trump by downplaying the crisis hey let us go to the beach today honey its a nice sunny day thanks to the slavish veneration that they afford their man-child master in his war against america trumps cult followers are more receptive to the idea that the coronavirus should be called the china virus hey let us make the virus the fault of china to deflect blame away from trumps ineptitude in handling the crisis the alt-right and ethno-nationalist movements are going to be inundated with new applications for membership as a result of trumps racist dog whistle and all of this is occurring when the number of deaths in the usa has exceeded the us death toll during its invasion of vietnam when us lawmakers are cashing in on millions of stock transactions when school districts across the country are preparing to lay off 300000 teachers and when gun-toting michigan protestors pack into the statehouse calling for the governor to be hanged because of her stay-at-home law and lets not forget the stream of vile comments made by politicians who think its a fair trade-off to let the elderly and infirm die in order to preserve the economy dont they realize that the coronavirus also kills children take for example comments made by the repugnant antioch planning commission chairman ken turnage ii who felt compelled to compare the corona virus to a forest fire that burnsold trees fallen brush and scrub-shrub sucklings that drain resources adding that society will strengthen when the pandemic is all settled we would have significant loss of life we would lose many elderly that would reduce burdens in our defunct social security system health care cost once the wave subsided make jobs available for others and it would also free up housing in which we are in dire need of turnage wrote in the post that has since been deleted we would lose a large portion of the people with immune and other health complications i know it would be loved ones as well but that would once again reduce our impact on medical jobs and housing prieve 2020 these comments made all the more chilling as they appear delivered in a dispassionate pragmatic and businesslike manner echo aktion t4 the program for involuntary euthanasia in nazi germany a project of mass murder that took the lives of approximately 300000 people between 1939 and 1945 the program was based on eugenics theory racial hygiene and budgetary concerns certain people were selected as lebensunwertes leben unworthy of life or useless eaters and were killed by lethal injection gas or other means that we have politicians that would so easily condemn americas useless eaters to a suffocating death should serve as a warning that the unthinkable could happen again and this time in a country that brags about its concern for human rights the herd immunity argument is similar judith butler writesbecause the vulnerable are not deemed productive in the new quasi-aryan community they are not valued lives and if they die that is apparently acceptable since they are not imagined as productive workers but drains on the economy although the herd immunity argument may not make this claim explicitly it is there cited in yancy 2020 well i hope burning away the rotting old brush is worth it to mr ken turnage ii maybe he can make another killing on estate auctions charles sykes 2020 reports that feckless and fancy-free evangelical jerry falwell jrwho is as subtle about his adoration of trump as the hair and mustache dye on mypillow ceo mike lindellhas held in flagrant disregard the health of his students at his liberty university and by extension the health of all those with whom his students will come into physical contact falwell who has maintained that the coronavirus was a plot to hurt trump and hinted that it could be a bioweapon created by north korea or china to attack the usa has acted recklessly and irresponsibly despite the escalating coronavirus pandemic several thousands of students and professors returned to liberty universitys main campus while the rest of the nations campuses were locked downfalwell who is the president of the conservative christian school defending his decision by insisting that 99 percent of students are not at the age to be at risk and they dont have conditions that put them at risk that of course is factually untrue young people are not immune indeed last week the centers for disease control and prevention said more than a third of us patients ill enough to be hospitalized were ages 20 to 54 and of course even young people who do not become seriously sick can pass the disease to others sykes 2020 see palma 2020a sv date 2020 reports that trump has been trying to convince the american people that he has been a great wartime president who has done a miraculous job in protecting the country from the coronavirus having sold himself as a great business and military leader despite bankrupt casinos and bone spurs president donald trump faces his greatest challenge yet making americans forget the two months he dismissed concerns about a deadly pandemic as a hoax at the time of this writing trumps approval ratings are increasing demonstrating yet again that the american public have fallen victim to the swarmy cult of trump trumps evangelical followers can continue to bask in his carnivorous glory an immediate challenge to be reckoned with is the idea that the coronavirus can be cured by prayer or by being implored by a preacher to touch the television screen very likely close to the commercial break sky palma writesone of those people is evangelist kenneth copelandwho visited the white house in 2018 for a dinner trump held with a group of evangelical leaders earlier this month copeland went viral for a segment he did on this victory network channel where he asked his viewers to put their hands on their tv screens in order to receive gods divine protection against the coronavirus put your hand on that television set copeland said hallelujah thank you lord jesus he received your healing now say it i take it i have it its mine i thank you and praise you for it palma 2020b when the catholic church is searching for a miracle to prove sainthood it is well understood that finding such proof can take years even decades of careful investigation including scientific investigation do we really expect those desperate for a cure for say liver disease to find the holy spirit cascading through the neon xenon and argon gases that have miraculously combined into the phosphor gas that makes up the cells of their flat screen television set or by making such a statement am i admitting to an egregious lack of faith will my television set suddenly turn on by itself in the middle of the night with an urgent message from john the baptist that the second coming is now in progress since it is unlikely that those pastors under 60 have ever frequented pavilions for pulmonary patients my father died slowly and painfully of emphysema and hacking coughs and mounds of bloody mucous were a steady fixture of my childhood and adolescence they may feel that they have been granted divine immunity by the holy spirit or should they contract the disease and survive they can then make the boastful claim that their daily baptism in the word of god protected them from a painful death by calling for church services to continue they willingly subject themselves and the hundreds or thousands who pack their churches to the virus and this is true even if they hold their church services outdoors do pastors think outdoor winds do not carry christian spittle even if that spittle is born again reverend tony spell who defied an order from louisiana governor john bel edwards against large gatherings in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak because the good reverend spell believes the handling of the coronavirus pandemic is politically motivated was charged on six misdemeanor counts for his actions but hallelujah he is going to be advised in court by alabamas infamous judge roy moore even though moore is not licensed to practice law in louisiana moore believes that charging rev spell is a violation of the acknowledgment that god is sovereign in america gstalter 2020 and even though he has been charged reverend spell is back at it again intent on holding more services at his life tabernacle megachurch in baton rouge with the justification that jesus is a physicianpeoples hope is in the house of godif they do contract the virus if they have fears of the virus the church is more essential now than ever to pray with people to let them know there is a physician in jesus christ he is the healer come under you all that are weary and heavy-laden let me give you rest we were supposed to be at a million and a half body bags and were at 4800 so the narrative is false spell in boggioni 2020b reverend spell claims to believe the science surrounding covid-19 but then argues astonishingly that because he heard that some people are infected with the virus and recover without even being aware they had the virus this somehow justifies putting his parishioners and those with whom they may come into contact at serious risk for the good reverend spiritual healing supersedes medical safety precautions he also claims that his services are preventing incidents of domestic violence suicide and starvation spell in boggioni 2020b in fact rev death wish let-me-be-remembered-as-a-martyr-spell is advocating religious fanaticism calling for christians literally to die from the coronavirus in the name of religious freedom he proclaimed that those who prefer tyranny over freedom do not deserve freedom he also said that the bible teaches us to be absent from our bodies so we can be present with the lord  so like any revolutionary or like any zealot or like any pure religious person death looks to them like a welcomed friend palma 2020c does this sound to you a bit like a christianized version of the heavens gate cult whose leaders preached that suicide would allow them to exit their bodily containers in order to enter an alien spacecraft hidden behind the hale-bopp comet a nightmare scenario aaron bundy joins rev spell in a waco-like standoff this is an attack of the branch covidians  other megachurch pastors are intent on flouting social distancing guidelines during palm sunday and easter kelly burton a pastor at lone star baptist church in lone star texas wrote satans trying to keep us apart hes trying to keep us from worshipping together but were not going to let him win barone 2020 fundamentalist christians as a spiritual tribe frequently rally around the idea that they are being persecuted remember how indignant christian evangelicals felt about being persecuted by the vile evil satanic greeting of happy holidays because they felt it was an attack on merry christmas and christianity in general fox news played this persecution to the hilt trump bragged to a conservative student group turning point usa that he had given the right to speak the words merry christmas back to americans after it was falsely claimed that the white houses national christmas tree was renamed the holiday tree under president obama does anyone remember when in 2003 france criticized the us plan to invade iraq and elected officials in the us house of representatives decided to rename french fries freedom fries fortunately im not ancient enough to recall when during world war i sauerkraut was renamed liberty cabbage and german measles became known as liberty measles if evangelical christians want to understand religious persecution in a more serious vein they can certainly find valid examples of the persecution of christianswhere those faithful to their beliefs have been exiled or tortured or burned alive at the stake but the idea that christians are being persecuted for having to hold their church services onlineas most college professors have been required to do with teaching their classes during this pandemicis stretching the notion of persecution to absurd proportions mclaren 2020 but this christian persecution complex does serve a purpose evangelical congregations can now identify as martyrswith those christians thrown to the lions in ancient rome by emperor nero but seriously we are talking here about throwing christians to their laptops so that they are forced to watch their pastors speak in tongues on their computer screens how traumatizing is that have the faithful forgotten that you can now be healed by touching a tv screen while a church service is in progress and im sure god would not discriminate against computer screens just ask evangelical preacher kenneth copeland havent these evangelicals heard of cybertemples and churches and online prayer chapels in networked environments that can be customized to any religious belief system yes be wary of technology but do not be too fearful that watching a church service in lieu of the real thing is the digital equivalent to being a loser is there anything worse in trumpworld than not winning the public release of the apple iphone was regarded as the jesus phone when it first came out in 2007 and then for those with more conservative inclinations there is the flip-phone sometimes called the kosher phone that has no internet to tempt the user into entering the world of sinthe original model being the lg vx5500 which was released in 2008 ammon bundy of the malheur militia who once led an armed takeover of a wildlife refuge in oregon has encouraged idaho residents to defy the social distancing orders at a public meeting he told the audience that the coronavirus is a relatively low-risk situation and added that if nine out of 10 people were dying it still does not justify the taking of rights humphrey 2020 bundy warned that he was willing to use weapons to defend the rights of businesses to remain open during the pandemic humphrey 2020 and you can be sure that white supremacist militia members all over the country are all on board with this sentiment perhaps they frequent the same shooting ranges as their fellow evangelicals where they can share information on the best firearms to have during a pandemic hey you rookies avoid the five-shot snub-nose j-frame revolvers they have heavier trigger pulls and a shorter sight radius and lack the accuracy of revolvers with larger frames get your asses in gear on this okay pandemic preppers arm up already lawmakers in michigan are wearing bulletproof vests to the statehouse to protect themselves from duck dynasty lookalikes carrying assault rifles youve got them running scared bobby lee ever since you were knee-high to a grasshopper ive been telling you that the day will come when you need to soak the flag of freedom in the blood of tyrants hey bubba why not use your 1200 cash payment to invest in an ar-15 with a scope in the meantime most of the money in the governments economic stabilization plan will be used by the federal reserve to buy up us treasury and other bonds in order to prevent a collapse of the international financial system and they will be lending money directly to corporationsa frightening prospect but of course all of this drama around putting people at risk of the coronavirus is supposedly for the benefit of the younger generation who will otherwise die and according to trump many will die of suicide should the economy collapse besides its a chance to show that born again christians are not wimps trump has now tacked to the left in so far as stressing the deadly seriousness of the virus yet immediately afterwards he tacked to the right again by saying that we need to open the country up again for business some people are questioning if trump has business ties to the drug hydroxychloroquine or if hes onto something that has escaped the attention of the medical establishment after all hes a billionaire and in his own words a stable genius perhaps trump would be willing to attend a service at the river church in tampa where as burris 2020b notes pastor rodney howard-browne has denounced social distancing claiming that he can cure the coronavirus just like he did with the zika virus which still exists howard-browne promised his flock that he would never close the church regardless of what scientists and doctors say burris 2020b howard-browne is insistent that he has a cure for the covid-19we are not stopping anything ive got news for you this church will never close the only time the church will close is when the rapture is taking place we brought in 13 machines that basically kill every virus in the place and uh if somebody walks through the door its like it kills everything on them if they sneeze it shoots it down at like 100 mph itll neutralize it in split seconds we have the most sterile building in i dont know all of america burris 2020b amen so let me ask this if the evangelical leaders are so sure that their faith will protect them will they volunteer to be the last ones to receive the vaccine when it is available if we learn one thing from this pandemic it is that the us health care system ripped to shreds by tax breaks for the rich privatization austerity capitalism and the rise of the gig economy needs to be replaced by socialized medicine the whole country needs socialismand if people cannot see this then it just shows how powerful a hegemon the media industrial complex is as it continues to create the necessary illusions that so far have worked effectively in keeping the american people from mounting a popular ground-level challenge to the overall capitalist system here the media serve as a self-replicating filibustering mechanism that keeps the public in a state of endless debate over whether or not there are viable alternatives to the current capitalist system creating a pendulum of inertia at both ends of the argument it appears that many christian nationalists formulate the pandemic in a way that metaphysically juxtaposes nature to history producing a manichean duality of good versus evil a social universe overpopulated by metaphysical reflections of a mystified world they understand the pandemic not as historically mediated by circumstances engendered in a world that is both real and law-governedie as in the chronic tendency of capitalism toward overproductionand that can be explained dialectical analysis but as trapped within a chamber pot history in which the laws of nature remain static timeless and stagnant in this way the virus can be interpreted as an indication of gods wrath against those who support abortion or who are homosexual and those in the deep state who are working to undermine trump and setting up cannibal-pedophile rings underneath dingy strip mall pizza joints an attachment to this type of paranoid ideology clearly is preventing evangelical christians from understanding the virus in an historical and materialist mannerfrom the vantage point of a deep realismand thus promoting relief from spiritual constipation does not the basis of the spiritual reside in the materialin flesh blood and brain im not taking a physicalist position heresince i think it is very likely that consciousness exists beyond the material and is mediated that is refracted not reflected in along and through the brain what i am saying is that evangelicals appear in many cases to have adopted a creed of thought that antiseptically separates the general from the particular and the universal from the specific and conceives of dichotomies ie fact versus value from an abstract and metaphysical perspective but binary oppositionslet us say male and female black and white and up and downare not oppositions only in a metaphysical or idealistic sense but in the real world of scarcity they exist as distinctions trapped within dependent hierarchies capitalism constrains labor whiteness constrains blackness maleness constrains femaleness and so onvia capitalisms institutionalized structures and their normalizing functions attached to racism sexism division of labor judicial system etc we must wake up to the fact that we make ourselves our self and social formation in accordance with wider laws of nature and in so doing we are dependent upon laws of necessity external nature imposes necessity upon human beings but there is after all absolute necessity and contingent necessity necessity is absolute only in relation to the needs of society which are historically specific we live in a capitalist society and we necessarily have to sell our labor power for a wage unless we own the means of production in other words needs are contextually specific they are contingent upon the situation at hand ie mode of production geopolitics existential challenges so that contingency and necessity have to be understood dialectically not as eitheror but as bothand all things are relative to the necessity that produces them yet evangelical preachers declaim messianically that humankind is universally born of the spirit and propagate the falsehood that contingent phenomena such as the coronavirus are in reality divine plagues cast upon humankind for the sin of homosexuality abortion fornication political correctness and multiculturalism in this way for evangelicals faith in the transcendent supernatural power of jesus must supersede science humans are perceived as powerless if they decline to pray to the god of prosperity here science is glibly supplanted by a metaphysical abstraction but prayer should not be done in the spirit of helplessness we cannot pray and then abdicate our responsibility for achieving what we are praying for because we are denying the difficult work ahead in saving the country from covid-19 prayer can serve as a smokescreen that hides the class struggle and the socialist structures that are necessary to create a world prepared for disasters such as the coronavirus pandemic i am not denigrating the power of prayer here since i endorse the following statements of the galileo commissionno human intellectual activity including science can escape the fact that it has to make assumptions that cannot be proven using its own methodology ie absolute presuppositionsthe prevalent underlying assumptions or world model of the majority of modern scientists are narrowly naturalist in metaphysics materialist in ontology and reductionist-empiricist in methodologythis results in the belief that consciousness is nothing but a consequence of complex arrangement of matter or an emergent phenomenon of brain activitythis belief is neither proven nor warrantedin fact there are well-documented empirical phenomena that contradict this belief galileo commission 2020 this is not an argument against materialism as a bona fide teslified ecopedagogicalized social scientist i rely on materialist analysis but i can affirm that there are reasons to move beyond materialist explanations for understanding and appreciating certain phenomena this is not prophecy television gobbledygook speech i remain committed to an historical materialist analysis of capitalism and still at the same time consider it possible that prayer may have some effects that cannot be explained by traditional paradigms of science see mclaren and jandri 2020b but during a pandemic prayer should not be a substitute for medical research and prayer circles cannot replace medical treatment and religious bullshit cannot take the place of rational adjudication and dialectical reasoning paula jerry and franklin are you listening you might want to order some books on liberation theology or join a paulo freire or thomas merton reading group im sure they will encourage you to pull up a chair attend a sunday service by dr william j barber ii co-chair of the poor peoples campaign you can still accept jesus as your lord and savior without at the same time blaming the filthy commies from waging a war against christianity through their advocacy of multiculturalism feminism lgbtq rights bilingual education and democratic socialism well the list goes on liberation theology advocates a preferential option for the poor and its exponents and practitioners have stood beside peasant resistance movements in latin america even as us trained and sponsored death squads of the salvadorean military and police forces assassinated many of their leaders including six jesuits their housekeeper and her daughter in 1979 in their residence on the campus of the jesuit central american university uca in san salvador el salvador the death squads also participated in the assassination of archbishop scar arnulfo romero the voice of those without voice who was gunned down saying mass at hospital de la divina providencia a catholic

america latina  stochastic modeling of an infectious disease part i understand the negative binomial distribution and predict an epidemic more reliably hisashi kobayashi  why are the epidemic patterns of covid-19 so different among different cities or countries which are similar in their populations medical infrastructures and peoples behavior why are forecasts or predictions made by so-called experts often grossly wrong concerning the numbers of people who get infected or die the purpose of this study is to better understand the stochastic nature of an epidemic disease such as covid-19 and answer the above questions the author hopes that this article will provoke discussions among the modeling communities and stimulate mathematically inclined people to study this interesting and important field ie mathematical epidemiology much of the work on infectious diseases has been based on sir deterministic models pioneered by kermack and mckendrick in 1927  in our study we will explore several stochastic models that can capture the essence of the seemingly erratic behavior of an infectious disease which the deterministic model cannot explain a stochastic model in its formulation takes into account the random nature of an infectious disease thus such a model if properly constructed should be able to provide a more reliable and informative forecast of an epidemic pattern the stochastic model we study in this article is based on the birth-and-death process with immigrationbdi for short which was originally proposed in the study of population growth or extinction of some biological species to the best of this authors knowledge the bdi process model has not been investigated by the epidemiology community perhaps for the reason we briefly discuss in section 2 the general birth-and-death bd process usually defies an attempt to obtain a closed solution for the time-dependent ie transient probability distribution of the population size etc the bdi process however is among a small number of bd processes which we can solve analytically negative binomial distribution nbd with its parameter r being less than one we show that the coefficient of variation the standard deviation normalized by the mean of the bdi process is larger than r 1  1 furthermore a nbd with small r has a long tail in its distribution form like the zeta distribution aka zipfs law these properties of the infection process explain why actual infection patterns exhibit enormously large variations furthermore the mean value of the number infected provided by a deterministic model is far from the median of the distribution this explains why any forecast or prediction based on a deterministic model will fail more often than not in part ii of this report 1 we will present results of our extensive simulation study and further analysis of the stochastic model based on the bdi process  most of the mathematical models of infectious diseases seem to be based on the kermack-mckendrick model published in 1927 2  which was proposed to explain the rapid rise and fall in the number of infected population observed in epidemics such as the great plague in london where more than 15 of the population died 1665-66 and the cholera outbreak in london caused by contamination in the thames river 1865 and the plague epidemic in bombay 1906 3  the model consists of a system of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the infected population it the susceptible population st and the recovered population rt kermack-mckendricks sir model is a deterministic model which provides the expected values of these processes which we denote as st est it eit and rt ert a majority of biological and epidemiological models 4 5 6 fall in this class of deterministic models actual observed data of the infected population for instance is merely an instance or a sample path of this stochastic process it the process naturally deviates from the expected value it obtained by a deterministic model thus a deterministic model alone fails to provide any quantitative explanation when observed data differ significantly from the expected value in a stochastic or probabilistic model on the other hand the intrinsic stochastic nature of a process is explicitly taken into account in its model formulation the importance of stochastic processes in relation to problems of population growth was pointed out by w feller in 1939 7  he considered the birth-and-death process in which the expected birth and death rates per person per unit time were constants say  and  d g kendall 8 extended fellers birth-and-death bd process by considering the birth and death rates as any specified functions of the time t t and t the bd process is a special class of time-continuous discrete-state markov process and has found applications in many scientific and engineering fields including population biology 9  teletraffic and queueing theory 10  11  12  system modeling 13 14  pp 63-94 15  pp 407-410 i have done some investigation with help from prof hideaki takagi whose unpublished lecture note at the university of tsukuba 16 provided me with several references as to who coined the term birth-and-death process with immigration and have found the english statistician ms bartlett 1910 bartlett  -2002 in his famous book an introduction to stochastic processes 17 1st edition in 1955 in his discussion of the birth-and-death process in section 34 multiplicative chain subsection 341 the effect of immigrationthat he uses the phrase a birth-death-and-immigration process but bartletts doctoral student david g kendall 1918 kendall  -2007 gives a detailed analysis of the bdi process in his 1949 article 18  which bartlett refers to in his 1949 article 19  so my tentative conclusion was that kendall was the first that worked on the bdi although he did not use the term birth-death-immigration or something to that effect another english statistician norman t j bailey published in 1964 the elements of stochastic process with applications to the natural sciences 20  and in section 87 the effect of immigration pp 97-101 he gives a thorough treatment of the bdi process linda j s allen an introduction to stochastic processes with applications to biology 2nd edition 2011 21 discusses the bdi process in section 644 simple birth and death with immigration pp 254-258 but her focus seems to be more on the stable case frank p kelly 12 gives a brief treatment providing the steady-state distribution all other numerous textbooks on random processes make no mention of the bdi process and even the above handful of authors who might have had epidemiologists in mind among their readership seem to treat the bdi process for its possible application to population biology and none allude to its use in epidemiology 1 at any time t an individual is either susceptible s  infected and infectious i  or recovered and immune r 2 only susceptible individuals can get infected remain infectious for some time and recover and become completely immune 3 there are no births deaths immigration or emigration during the study period in other words the community is closed consequently individuals can only make two types of transitions i from s to i and ii from i to r thus the kermack-mckendrick model is often referred to as an sir epidemic model a model which assumes no immunity ie a recovered person becomes immediately susceptible is called an sis model if we explicitly consider an exposed state during which an infected individual is not yet infectious the model is called an seir model a model in which immunity wanes after some period is called an sirs model and so forth in the remainder of this section we give a brief account of the sir model in a closed community so that the reader can compare this deterministic model to our stochastic model to be presented in the next section for details of the kermack-mckedrick type deterministic models the readers are referred to abundant books and articles anderson and may 5  martcheva 6 to name just a few let st it and rt respectively 2  denote the number of the susceptible infected and recovered at time t since we assume no births deaths immigration nor emigration we have where n is a constant number representing the population of the community from the set of assumptions stated above the deterministic processes can be defined by the following set of three differential equations these differential equations together with 1 and the initial condition define the deterministic model it is easy to see that st is monotone decreasing and rt is monotone increasing the function it increases or decreases at time t depending on whether the ratio r t defined by the following expression is greater or smaller than unity its initial value r 0 is referred to as the basic reproduction number  a term having its origin in demography the ratio r t is called the effective reproduction number or the real-time reproduction number and is more meaningful than r 0  which is a static number in estimating the current epidemic situation and making a decision to control the epidemic the term stit in 2 and 3 comes from the argument that the susceptible must have contact with the infected in order to get infected and if we assume some sort of uniform mixing the infections should occur at a rate proportional to stit consequently the unit of the parameter  is personunit-timepersonperson whereas the other parameter 3  has the unit of personunittimeperson when the total population n of 1 is sufficiently large st  n is much larger than it and can be treated as unchanged at least in the initial phase of an epidemic then by setting and by substituting this into 3 we have the following ordinary differential equation ode from which and the initial condition 5 we readily find the solution for it which is an exponentially growing or decaying function depending on whether a  0 or a  0 when a  0 it is a constant i 0 for all t  0 when the infected it grows to the extent that the approximation 7 no longer holds ie the infinite population assumption fails we have to deal with the nonlinear differential equations of 2 and 3 a major advantage of the sir model is that because of the product term stit the differential equations take into account explicitly the fact that occurrences of infections will gradually decreases towards to zero as the susceptible population becomes extinct towards the end of the infection processes the main drawback of the sir model on the other hand is its inability to capture any probabilistic fluctuation of the infection process the sir model may be an appropriate model in describing the interactions between the susceptible group and infected group in a closed environment such as a hospital retirement home cruise ship night club etc but it is a poor model in describing a major outbreak of an epidemic in a larger environment such as a city or a country where most infections take place independently and randomly and the product term stit does not have any significant meaning furthermore the product term makes the entire sir model a nonlinear system and makes the system mathematically intractable except for a few simple cases which may not be useful in reality as we will show in this article and part ii 1  the deterministic model in addition to being unable to describe the stochastic fluctuation of an epidemic pattern is more likely to grossly overestimate the number of casualties thus the deterministic model is not only limited in its applicability but can be damaging and harmful in some cases in this and following sections we will discuss our stochastic model based on the birth-and-beath with immigration bdi process it is a special case of general birth-and-death bd process 4  before we present a detailed mathematical analysis of this model we will show an example of our simulation model based on the bdi process figure 1 shows the first 6 out of a total of 12 simulation runs consecutively done in one execution of our simulation program in a matlab script our simulator is based on the event scheduling approach 5  where events are arrivals of infected persons from the outside at rate  personsday occurrences of secondary infections within the community at rate  infectionsdayinfectious person and recoverydeaths of the infected persons at rate  recoverydeathdayinfected person the parameter values of   03   01 and   02 are assumed figure 2 plots the same set of curves in a semilog scale the exponential growth curves are shown as straight-lines the initial part of the simulation is more clearly shown in the semilog scale figures 3 and 4 are the plots of the remaining six runs there are at least two questions concerning these simulation runs 1 why are the variations among different simulation runs so large 2 there are more runs whose plots are below the deterministic model curve does the deterministic model tend to overestimate the size of the infected population if so why the analysis of the bdi process in the following sections should be able to answer these questions let it represent the number of infected persons at time t and p n t be the time-dependent or transient probability mass function pmf 6 of the process it ie p n t  prit  n n  0 1 2     and t  0 we assume that each infected person is infectious and infects susceptible persons at rate  personsunit-timeperson where the time unit can be arbitrary eg a second an hour a day etc let us assume that an infected person recovers gets removed or dies at rate unit-time thus  1 unit-time is the mean infectious period the ratio  is equal to the basic reproduction 4 william willy feller introduced what is now known as the birth-and-death process in his 1939 article 7 published in german regarding the problem of population growth he used the term vermehrung reproduction and tod death david g kendall in his 1948 paper 8 referred to fellers model as a birth-and-death process feller used this term in his volume i 9  whose first edition was in 1950 5 the time-asynchronous event scheduling approach is a more time efficient and accurate simulation method than a time-synchronous approach see eg 13 pp 230-234 or 14  pp 626-630 6 we could use perhaps a more common term the probability distribution function but pmf is more explicit that we are dealing with a discrete distribution not a continuous distribution number ie the mean number of infections caused by an infected person during the infectious period we can formulate an infectious disease as a birth-and-death bd process by defining the birth and death rates both of which are simple linear functions of the state n of the process it a few remarks are in order this particular state-dependent bd process is also known as the birthdeath-immigration bdi process see eg 12  p 14 for the steady state distribution in which the parameters   and  represent the birth ie secondary infection death ie recovery or death and immigration ie arrival of an infected individual from outside rates respectively a few remarks are in order 1 in actuality recovery removal and death are distinctly different matters in analyzing the infection process however these three sources of loss from the susceptible or infected population are mathematically equivalent in the sense they will not contribute to the infection process in the future we assume here that those who have recovered from the disease have acquired immunity and will not be susceptible nor infectious the assumption that each infected individual recovers or is removed or dies at rate  is equivalent to assuming that the duration s that each sick person remains infectious is exponentially distributed with mean 1 that is 2 it can be shown mathematically that many of our results to be obtained in terms of the probability mass function pmf of it and other related quantities are insensitive to the actual distribution of s  all that matters is that we set 3 in the present paper we assume that the population is homogeneous and the susceptible population size remains sufficiently large thus mathematically treated as infinite furthermore the parameters   and  are assumed to be constant many of our results can be extended to the case of multiple types of populations eg clustering of infections a model with the susceptible population decreases as some of them get infected and the case where the model parameters values change eg the situation where the infectious rate  may change as peoples behavior changes and these generalized models will be discussed in subsequent reports we can show see eg 15  pp407-408 that the pmf 10 of this bd process should satisfy the following set of linear differential-difference equations aka kolmogorovs forward equation with the initial condition where  mn is kroneckers delta we transform the above set of infinitely many equations 13 into a single equation by using the probability generating function pgf see eg 15  p 402 defined by multiply the set of equations 13 by z n and sum them from n  0 to  obtaining the following partial differential equation with the boundary condition although the process it is the main focus of our analysis it will be worthwhile to introduce related processes and our assumptions definition 1 is the cumulative count of external arrivals of infectious individuals from the outside we assume that at is a poisson process with rate  personsunit time 2 the process bt is the cumulative count of internally infected individuals we assume that the birth of such persons occurs at the rate of  personsunit timeinfectious person 3 the process rt is the cumulative count of recoveredremoved or dead individuals we assume that the departure of such persons occurs at the rate of  personsunit timeinfected person note that all infected persons are infectious persons until their recoveryremovaldeath is the present number of infected persons ie the expectation and variance of the above processes will be of our interest which we denote by before we discuss how to find the pgf gz t from the pde 16 let us derive first an ordinary differential equation for it by dividing both sides of 16 by z  1gz t we will have by setting z  1 we find 7 where on the lhs 8  we first set z  1 which corresponds to differentiation at z  1 and use lhpitals rule obtaining 9 eit  it the ordinary differential equation 22 can be solved yielding if the model parameters are set to new values say to    and  at some point t  t 1  0 then the solution it for t  t 1 is given by it should be clear that it diverges to infinity if a  0 in 23 and converges to a in the limit t   if a  0 similarly in 24 the process converges to  a  if a  0 if a  0 then 10 in figure 5 we show the case where   03   01 and   02 and at t 1  30 a new parameter   006 is set whereas the original values of  and  are retained the mean values of other processes can be easily found at is a poisson process with rate  which implies since each person in the infected population it infects others at the rate of  personsunit time the differential of bt is given by from this and 23 we obtain 7 alternatively we can obtain this differential equation directly by multiplying each equation in 13 by n and summing them up from n  0 to infinity 8 the abbreviations lhs and rhs mean the left-hand side and right-hand side respectively 9 here we use an important property of pgf ie gzt t  eitz it1  and by setting z  1 the rhs becomes eit we changed the order of differentiation wrr to z and t which can be justified because the function gz t is an analytic function ie it is continuous and differentiable everywhere 10 the second term becomes 00 so we apply lhpitals rule for t  t 1  we find which takes the same form as that for t  t 1  it should be worthwhile to note that both 28 and 29 could be derived from the mean value of the identity equation 18 together with the relation which is evident as shown below the recovery process rt should satisfy the following differential equation similar to 27 thus it readily follows the above expressions for it and other processes can be viewed as our deterministic or non-probabilistic model for the dynamics of the bdi process from these simple expressions we can extract a few important characteristics concerning the mean values of it and others 1 a     determines the exponential growth or decay rate of bt rt as well as it 2  is merely a linear scaling factor for it and other processes and so is i 0  the initial number of the infected 11 3 if a  0 then it grows exponentially without bound if a  0 it decays exponentially towards a if a  0 it  i 0  t ie it grows linearly 4 the ratio of the infection rate or reproduction rate  to the recovery or removal rate  is called the basic reproduction number in epidemiology see eg 6  p 21 the term was originally defined in the context of a deterministic model called the sissusceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model it is the average number of persons whom an infectious person infects before hisher recovery removal or death the reproduction number determines whether the infection will grow exponentially die out or remain constant depending on whether r 0  1 r 0  1 or r 0  1 respectively the exponential parameter a can be expressed in terms of r 0 and  11 eq23 can be rewritten as it  i0   a e at   a  so  a  i0 is the multiplying coefficient of the exponential term e at  5 the amount of time t that takes for it or other related quantities to double and thes exponential growth parameter a are related by e at  2 or equivalently at  0693 note that both the integral and derivatives of the exponential function e at are also  e at  thus the above formula for t equally applies when cumulative numbers or incremental numbers are to be counted for a given a via an observed t  6 unless we can expect to increase the value of  by improving the medical service or producing an effective vaccine to immunize the susceptible population the only options we have for controlling an infectious disease is to increase  by removing as many infectious individuals away from susceptible population as possible andor to decrease  by increasing the socalled social distances between the susceptible and the infectious we will provide an illustrative example in part ii 1   so far we have discussed only the mean values of the random process it and other processes before we find the probability mass functions p n t n  0 1 2    for any t we obtain in this section the steady-state distribution lim t p n t   n  if it exists we know already that when a  0 such distribution does not exist thus the steady state distribution can possibly exist only when a  0 in order to find it we set the lhs of the pde 16 equal to zero obtaining the following ordinary differential equation for the pgf gz  which readily leads to integrating the above and using the boundary condition g1 t  1 for any t we find this pgf reminds us of the negative binomial distribution nbd this distribution was originally introduced to express the probability of the number of failures n needed to achieve r successes in a sequnce of bernoulli trials when the probability of failure is q definition 2 negative binomial distribution nbd negative binomial distribution nbr q is defined by where the parameter r is a positive real number when r is a positive integer and 0  q  1 the above reduces to the classical definition of the shifted 12 negative binomial distribution sometimes called the pascal distribution associated with bernoulli trials the gamma function x is defined for a positive real number x by 13 the probability generating function of nbr q of 39 is given by the mean and variance of a rv random variable x possessing this distribution can be readily found from 38 and the above formula we readily find the steady state distribution of it for a  0 is given as follows 12 p14 4 time-dependent probability distribution of the infected process it the partial difference equation pde 16 for the pgf gz t is a linear pde and is sometimes referred to as planar differential equation see 22  14  pp 600-605 this type of pde can be solved by using lagranges method with its auxiliary differential equations which is discussed in appendix a 14 12 some authors define the negative binomial distribution as the distribution of the number of trials instead of the number of failures needed to achieve r successes under this definition n  r r  1 r  2     the probability distribution 39 is then referred to as the shifted negative binomial distribution see eg 15  pp 59-62 13 this definition can be extended for a complex number z with z  0 14 it will be worth noting that ren and kobayashi 23  24 discuss this type of pde in the analysis of multiple on-off sources in traffic characterization of a data network 41 when the system is initially empty ie i0  0 when the system is initially empty ie i0  0 its pgf can be found by solving the pde given by see a20  if we define a function t we can write 44 compactly as which is the pgf of the generalized negative binomial distribution nbr t defined in definition 2 thus we find that the pmf of the bdi process it is given by when a  0 the above expression can be simplified noting we find which lead to and p n t  n  r  1 n 1 t  1 r t t  1 n  51 the mean and variance can be computed from the distribution function obtained above but we already know the expression for the mean i bdi t from 23  which can be also found from the formula of the nbr q ie which certainly agrees with 23  similarly the variance can be found from the formula of nbr q as the reason why this simple innocent-looking equation is put in a box is because this expression for the variance is perhaps the most important feature behind the erratic behavior we observe in the covid-19 or an infectious disease in general as we analyze below and demonstrate by presenting simulation results in part ii up to now we have focused on the case when the system is initially empty in this section we wish to study a general case where i0  i 0 is an arbitrary non-negative integer the pgf solution for this general case is in fact given in a 19 of appendix a in this section we will add to the pgf and pmf of this general case a subscript or superscript bdii 0 wherever we need to distinguish similar functions of other processes so we can write where where the first given by 55 is the same as 44 discussed in a preceding section whereas the second one 56 is the pgf of the birth-and-death process obtained by setting   0 in the pgf a 19  thus we see that the bdii 0 process can be expressed as a sum of two statistically independent processes i bdii 0 t  i bdii 0 0 t  i bdi 0 z t it can be further shown that the the birth-and-death process can be decomposed into two processes the the pure-birth process and a generalized binomial distributed process denoted i gbpt t where pt is given by 87 thus and the pgfs of these processes can be expressed as g bdi 0 z t  g n bi 0 t z t g gbi 0 z t where 5 important properties of the negative binomial distribution nbd let us further examine properties of a random variable x of nbr q defined by its pmf 39 and pgf 41 its mean and variance are given in 42 the mode of the this distribution is given by recall that the parameter r in our problem is the ratio of  personunit-time the rate with which an infected person arrives in the community in question to  personunit-timeperson the rate with which an infectious person infects susceptible people as long as tight security measures are enforced at the boundaries of the community  is kept small thus in our problem of practical interest r  1 or even r 1 figure 6 shows the shifted negative binomial distribution nbd for p  1  q  05 and for various values of r  05 1 2 4 8 16 32 as we can see in figure 6  the pmf with r  05 falls off rapidly by around n  5 for q  05 and r  05 we compute the first several values of p n  p 0  07071 p 1  05303 p 2  03315 p 3  01934 p 4  01088 p 5  00598     p 10  000256 63 in order to see more clearly how the pmf p n looks for small r let us rewrite 39 as follows the leading term kr does not depend on n so we can write in the limit r  0 the shape of p n will become recall the following maclaurin series expansion from which we obtain thus we find 66 can be written as this distribution is called the logarithmic distribution aka logarithmic series distribution which was introduced by r a fisher in 1943 25  the pgf of 69 is given using 67 once again by in our case the probability q is given by t of 45 thus for sufficiently large t the parameter q is very close to one thus the term q n is a slowly decreasing geometric series for small r the coefficient is also slowly decaying thus for small r and q close to 1 the nbd is a very slowly decaying distribution having a long tail similar to zipf s law or the zeta distribution with small power exponent  see eg 15  pp 62-64 example 2 consider the same set of model parameters used in example 1 ie   03   01 and   02 then r     2 3  and a      02 in figure 7 through figure 12  we show the pmf p n t 47 of the infected population it at t  1 5 10 20 30 and 50 in all these cases i 0  0 ie there are no infected individuals at t  0 one useful method to see clearly the tail end of the distribution function is to plot the log-survival function log 10 1f n  where f n is the cumulative distribution function cdf ie f n  n i0 p n t and its complement 1  f n is called the survival or survivor function 15 in figure 13 and figure 14  we show the log-survivor functions of the distribution of it at t  10 and t  30 we confirm our earlier observation that the nbd behaves similar to a geometric distribution which is a straight line in the log-survivor plot as we observed in example 51 the pmf p n t looks similar to a slowly decaying geometric distribution for modest values of t with a long tail which gives a large variance an often used measure of dispersion is the coefficient of variation cv from 53 we can derive the following expression from which we find the cv at time t of the bdi process is given by it is evident that t quickly approaches unity from below as t increases 16 thus we have arrive at the following proposition regarding the cv of the bdi process proposition 1 the coefficient of variation of the bdi process rapidly converges to a constant  r 1 for all t such that   t  7 so we have confirmed that the coefficient of variation is bounded from below by  r 1 1225 15 the term survival or survivor function is often used in reliability theory if a continuous variable x represent the life of a human or a product eg electric bulb with its probability density function pdf fx x and cumulative distribution function cdf fx x  t 0 fx s ds  the survival function is defined by 1  fx x by plotting log1  fx x vs x we find more clearly how the remaining life will behave than a regular plot of fx x or fx x see eg 15 pp 144-146 16 when t is such at  7 for instance will make t within around 2 off from the unity in our example of a  02day t  23days will make t practically equal to unity in the previous section we gave a formal definition of the generalized negative binomial distribution by allowing the parameter r to be a positive real number we now want to generalize the binomial distribution b n p  by allowing n to be a real number positive or negative and p be any real number positive or negative thus we cannot assign any probabilistic interpretation definition 3 consider a generating function of z which takes the form for real numbers p and  then its inverse transform is called a generalized binomial distribution denoted gbn p there is no guarantee that each f n non-negative let alone 0  f n  1 however they add up to unity because g1  1 the main reason why we wish to generalize the binomial distribution is for the convenience of computing p n t for the bdi process and other birth-and-death processes without immigration discussed proposition 2 a generalized binomial distribution associated with a generalized negative binomial distribution for a given generalized negative binomial distribution whose pgf is given by with the pmf its associated generalized binomial distribution is given by where p and q satisfy the relation proof first we compare the generalized binomial coefficients we also find thus we have shown the equivalence between 79 and 80 an alternative way to prove this equivalence is to write the pgf 78 using p defined by 81 recall newtons generalized binomial formula apply this formula to the rhs of 84 by setting a  r and t  pz 1p  the coefficient of the z n term is given by f n of 77 now let us revisit the pgf 44 which we can write as where by referring to proposition 2 we find that pt and t are related by thus by applying newtons formula we can obtain the following expression for p n t p n t  r n 1  pt n pt rn  n  0 1 2     using the binomial coefficient formula and the equivalence 83 ie we see that p n t given by 89 is equivalent to 47 in this section we will investigate how to represent the bdi process i bdi t as a compound poisson process the negative binomial distribution is infinitely divisible see eg feller 9  and hence can be represented as a compound poisson process first we show this representation by considering a special case of the bdi process where no death occurs let us consider a process which has not been discussed to the best of our knowledge in the literature that is the pure birth process accompanied by immigration let us call this process a birth-and-immigration process a bi process for short the pgf of this process can be readily found by setting   0 in a 19  and after some manipulation we obtain where not surprisingly this  0 t can be obtained by setting   0 in t of 45 thus the bi process i bi t is distributed according to the negative binomial distribution nbr  i 0   0 t shifted by i 0  hence we find the pmf at time t as given below if i 0  0 the pmf reduces to nbr  0 t by noting r   we find the first few pmf values as follows  where p bi0 0 t represents the idle period of the system which ends upon the poisson arrival this initial idle period is the only time when the system is empty since there is no death or departure of any kind the population monotonically increases as the time elapses as we defined in definition 1 of section 32 at is the cumulative count of infected and infectious persons arriving from the outside up to time t let us count them as c  1 2     at consider a countable attribute associated with each arrival and denote it n c  assume that the n c s are independent identically distributed iid rvs kobayashi and konheim 26 discuss use of acompound process in the context of data communication system where each arrival of a data packet carries n c data units eg bytes  then the sum should be a quantity of interest in determining eg the buffer size of a statistical multiplexer needed to keep the probability of buffer overflow below some prescribed level in our problem at hand each infected arrival from the outside becomes an ancestor who produces many descendants over multiple generations who are all infected persons and constitute the members of the c clan such a process is called a branching process in our model each infected individual whether an ancestor or a descendant produces a new descendant at rate  personunit-time let a j t be the number of arrivals in 0 t and having j descendants at time t the case j  0 does not exist since there is no death hence each clan includes at least its ancestor such that branson 27  who ascribes the original idea to karin and mcgregor 28  shows that the rvs a j ts are independent poisson variables with mean m j t where where  is a function of  and t the above formula 96 leads to the idea that the probability distribution that each ancestor should produce j descendants ie secondary tertiary infectees etc whose probability distribution takes the form this distribution is the logarithmic distribution of 69 the pgf of n c t is therefore given by note that n c t is the number of the family members at time t of the cth clan with the ancestor itself included since we are assuming no death the sum of these numbers over all at ancestors should be the total population it at time t then the pgf of it can be expressed as the pgf of the poisson arrival process of rate  is given by thus we find the pgf of the bi process a compound poisson process is which is the pgf 91 where i 0  0 thus we have shown that the poisson process with rate  ends up with the negative binomial distributed process nbr  0 t it is interesting that the infection process which forms a branching process where an infectious person infects a susceptible person at rate  personstime unit will result in the negative binomial distribution the positive feedback loop of creating its descendants exhibits the negative binomial distributed process now we extend our argument of the previous section to the bdi process with the initial condition i 0  0 whose pgf is given by 44 where t is defined by 45 the first few pmf values can be found from 47 as the function t is between 0 and 1 and approaches 1 as t   if   0 then r  0 as well and bt  1 since btr does not depend on n we see again the fisher series then by replacing  0 t  1  e t by t  e at 1 e at  the entire mathematical steps of the bi process case carry over to the case of the bdi process except for the last step 102 where the parameter r needs to be defined as if a      0 then for t 1 the following approximation holds therefore it seems clear that we need to to choose a poisson process other than the one with mean t let t be the mean of the poisson process which is to be compounded with n c t whose pgf is then it should be clear from the above discussion that t must be given by thus thus we have shown that the bdi process as a compound poisson process with rate t at the beginning of section 3 we showed the results of twelve simulation runs of the bdi process to provoke the readers interest hopefully you have found an answer to the first question how about the second question if you are an avid reader you should have figured out the answer by now in part ii of this report under preparation 1  we will present more simulation results which should help the reader find a definitive answer to the second question in this report we focused on the analysis of it the infected population although we presented the stochastic means of bt the population of the secondary infections and rt the recovereddead population we defer a full analysis of these processes to part ii we will also show both by analysis and simulation how the infection process can be controlled by changing the values of   and  at certain points in time increasing the so-called social distance would decrease the value of  the value of  can be increased by improving medical treatments to speed up the recovery process another possible option is to reduce the size of the susceptible population significantly by exposing the young and healthy susceptible to the disease so that they become immune to the disease the quantitative model such as ours should help policy makers and health officials to make judicious choices of these options by assessing the effects and costs of various options available to them in part ii or iii we will also discuss how we should estimate the model parameters from empirical data so that the forecast can be made as reliable as possible the partial differential equation pde 15 can be solved for pgf gz t by lagranges method with auxiliary differential equations we write 15 in the following form of a planar differential equation see eg 22  24  23  14  pp 600-603 where g denotes gz t defined above and p q and r are in general functions of t z and g the solution g  f t z represents a surface in the t  z  g space the normal vector to the surface at any point t 0  z 0  g 0  is perpendicular to the line through this point whose direction numbers are the values of p q and r evaluated at this point which we denote by p 0  q 0 and g 0  this line has the equations hence at each point p q g of the surface there is a normal vector whose direction numbers dt dz and dg satisfy the following equation in our problem at hand we set where c 1 and c 2 are integration constants we write the functional relations between c 1 and c 2 as     when we have a vaccine against covid-19 who should be vaccinated first the question is relevant because initially vaccine availability will likely be limited after healthcare and some other essential workers it might seem the most obvious candidates are the elderly and other groups that are more vulnerable to the virus however we argue that this is not necessarily the case protecting the most vulnerable might require prioritizing vaccinating children in order to maximize the benefits of indirect immunity for the elderly and the other vulnerable groups whether this will be the best strategy from a public health perspective will depend on characteristics of the vaccine and of the virus which are currently unknown here we assess this possibility from an ethical point of view by drawing comparisons and analogies with the case of the flu vaccination and with other examples of health policies and practices we conclude that there are strong ethical reasons to vaccinate the young to protect the old provided that the risks imposed on children are reasonable even if that implies using children as a means to protect the elderly and the vulnerable it is april 2021 a vaccine against covid-19 has been tested and is now available the last 12 months have been incredibly disrupted economies are in tatters people have lost jobs many have died and many of those who have survived are struggling with the financial and mental health consequences of the restraining measures repeated cycles of relaxing and tightening social distancing have created uncertainty to the detriment of both economic growth and mental wellbeing even if at some point strict lockdown measures have been relaxed for certain people for the sake of economic recovery many elderly people have been effectively trapped in their homes for more than a year they have had friends die from the virus and have feared that they too would become unwell they have been waiting desperately for months for the long-awaited vaccine in order to be released from prison now the vaccine is here the government understandably decides to make the first batch of the vaccine available to healthcare workers when the second batch follows quickly many expect that it would be given to the elderly but instead the government announces that children under 10 years would be immunised first as part of a strategy to maximize the long term benefits of the vaccine given limited availability  the decision leads to a public outcry how could this be ethical after all the elderly have been through and considering the risk that covid-19 poses on them this is the question we want to address in this paper the world is anxiously waiting for a vaccine against covid-19 that is widely considered as the real endpoint of this global health emergency when full normality can not only be restored but actually maintained however this is a rather optimistic view the end point of this emergency will not be when we have a vaccine but when we have an adequate vaccination policy to get the vaccine out to people in the most effective way 1  formulating and implementing such a policy might be more difficult than it might initially seem which policy will best achieve the goal depends in large part on the characteristics and availability of the vaccine the vaccine will allow a return to full and lasting normality only if there will be high enough uptake and if it will be distributed in the most effective way the first condition seems obvious and raises the question of whether the vaccine should be compulsory which we will not address here but the second risks being overlooked for two reasons one is that there seems to be a tendency to think that once we develop a vaccine this will be available for everyone straightaway which is very unlikely availability is likely to be limited initially the other reason is that the general assumption is that we should give priority access to those who need the vaccine most that is more vulnerable groups the elderly and those with certain pre-existing health conditions however this might not be the most effective strategy to protect the vulnerable a lot will depend on the characteristics of the vaccine and more specifically for which groups it will be more effective and what the risks of side effects will be in this article we want to explore the possibility that there might be public health reasons and ethical reasons to target children and young people as a matter of priority in order to build up immunity to protect the elderly depending on the characteristics of the vaccine this might mean imposing some cost on children -eg in terms of taking on the small risks of the vaccine -for the sake of vulnerable groups a possible vaccination policy that targets children in order to protect the most vulnerable and particularly the elderly might not be necessary if we end up having a vaccine that works well on the elderly and the other vulnerable groups then these groups should probably have priority access indeed if at the point of implementation there is significantly greater confidence in safety and effectiveness in adults than there is in children for example if there has been significantly less experience in children testing that will be a reason to prioritise adults over children but what if the vaccine will not be like that what if we have sufficient confidence in vaccine safety in children and the vaccine will be more effective at building collective immunity if administered to children rather than to adults given initial scarce availability in the second section we are going to briefly present some of the relevant ethical issues about distribution of scarce healthcare resources in this covid-19 pandemic in section 3 we will spell out how these ethical considerations apply to the case of vaccination we will explain why if the vaccine turns out to be more effective on children than on the elderly we might need to target children with vaccination policies in order to create the best protection possible for the elderly at least while vaccine availability is limited finally in section 4 we will examine some of the ethical implications of using children as targets of vaccination policies to protect the elderly and we will argue that the strategy could be ethically justified we will end by spelling out how the general ethical principle about the permissibility of targeting one group as a means to achieving a broader societal benefit can have different implications for vaccination policies these implications would also depend on whether the vaccine will turn out to have different characteristics than the ones we focus on and if we decide to prioritize different kinds of collective goods it seems relatively uncontroversial that healthcare workers and other categories providing essential services should have priority access to the vaccine first we need their services but their work exposes them to risk of infection since they have a right to work in the safest conditions possible and since arguably the risks associated with caring for sick patient during epidemics go beyond their normal professional responsibilities malm et al 2008  it seems plausible that we have a duty to give them priority access second they risk infecting others if they are contagious so there are important public health considerations in favour of prioritizing them but assuming essential workers ought to prioritized who should be next even if we agreed that the aim is protect the most vulnerable the means of achieving that aim is not as obvious as it might seem the measure for the effectiveness of the covid-19 vaccine and of related vaccination policies will be the number of deaths that it will be able to prevent the high public health and economic toll of covid-19 is caused in large part by the relatively high number of people who are dying of it and the massive amount of public health resources eg beds in intensive care units icus health care staff etc required to limit the number of deaths reducing the number of the most life-threatening cases should be the aim of vaccination policies therefore those who are more likely to suffer severe symptoms and to die are the ones whose protection should be considered a priority in order to maximise the effectiveness of the vaccine there are two plausible criteria for allocation of scarce health resources one is the maximisation of the overall benefit for the population -in philosophical jargon the maximisation of expected utility the other is the prioritization of the needs of the worst off in philosophical jargon the prioritarian principle of distributive justice eg parfit 2000  parfit 2012  although these two criteria are conceptually distinct they would often yield the same practical conclusions about resource allocation given that usually the person who needs the resource the most will benefit the most this consideration is indeed at the basis of prioritarianism however this is not always the case the probability of actually benefitting from the resource and its opportunity cost need to be taken into account for example in the case of allocation of beds in icus during the covid-19 crisis the criterion that some medical associations eg in italy have adopted in triage decisions is prioritization not according to need but according to chances of survival maximisation of expected utility conflicted with the prioritarian principle it was decided that maximization of expected utility should take priority thus instead of giving the icu bed to an 85 year old person who needs it more because they are more likely to die of complications of covid-19 the decision was to give it to an otherwise healthy 40 year old who may need it less because they are more likely to survive without it in this way it is more likely that the scarce resource utilized will be effective or it might be argued that they should be allocated according to expected qalys acronym for quality adjusted life years according to this criterion we should give it to an otherwise healthy 70 year old with decent chances of survival rather than to a 50 year old with equal or maybe higher chances of survival but with some severe disability that makes their quality of their life significantly lower according to some plausible measure of quality of life savulescu cameron wilkinson 2020 we are not going to discuss these criteria here however we mention them just to point out that scarce health resources are not and should not necessarily be allocated purely according to need in order to maximize their expected benefits in the case of vaccination if we wished to maximize the number of expected qalys saved by a certain policy a standard measure of effectiveness of health systems we would need to consider probability of survival length and quality of life this may require prioritising a certain group such as those in late middle age if instead we assume the goal is simply to save the greatest number of lives regardless of length or quality which is the rationale behind the current lockdown measures it would seem that the goal would be best achieved by prioritizing the elderly say those over the age of 60 however even if the aim is simply to save the greatest number prioritizing the elderly might not be the best strategy how to best protect those who most need protection and save the greatest number will depend on the characteristics of the vaccine one of the benefits of vaccination is that it often protects not only those who receive it but those around them as well we often have an extra weapon when it comes to distributing vaccines which we do not have when distributing other kinds of scarce healthcare resources vaccination strategies can aim at creating as much immunity as possible by relying both on the individual and the collective benefit of the vaccine an icu bed might prevent one death but one dose of a vaccine can prevent many so in the case of vaccination it is important to figure out how to effectively create immunity at the collective level on the basis of this there might be a lesson to be learned from the flu vaccine seasonal flu kills up to 650000 people worldwide every year the vast majority of whom are over 65 who 2020  in being significantly more dangerous for the elderly the flu is similar to covid-19 it has traditionally been considered important that the elderly and others particularly vulnerable to infection eg those with chronic respiratory diseases be vaccinated against the flu eg oecd 2016  however targeting the elderly in vaccination policies has not maximally reduced influenza-related mortality rates an increased uptake of the flu vaccine among the elderly has not consistently correlated with a decline of flu-related deaths in the same population bambery et al 2018  relying on direct protection through vaccination is not necessarily the most effective way of protecting the vulnerable flu vaccine efficacy decreases with age at least after the age of 60 and on people over 70 the efficacy might be as low as 23 goevert et al 1994  the elderly are generally less immunocompetent although children are less likely to experience severe consequences and to die of flu they tend to get infected more frequently to remain infected for longer glezen 2006  and therefore to become vectors for the contagion of the elderly who are not adequately protected by the vaccine this means that vaccinating children is a more effective strategy to build up immunity at the collective level than vaccinating the elderly at least with respect to flu children are not the ones who need the vaccine the most because they are less likely to suffer severe consequences from the flu than the elderly however they are the ones who can mostly contribute to the effectiveness of the vaccine at the population level and to protect those who need protection the most we have argued elsewhere that flu vaccination strategies should target children in order to protect the elderly bambery et al 2018  thus allocating vaccines in a way that benefits the most vulnerable and that maximises the vaccines effectiveness might mean prioritizing or targeting those who are less likely to benefit from the vaccines or that need the vaccine the least whether this will be the case with the covid-19 vaccine will depend on features of the vaccine which we do not know yet more specifically it will depend on whether the vaccine will be more or less effective on young people and on whether the side effects will be more or less likely or severe in young people if the vaccine turns out to be as effective or more effective on the elderly the presumption is that they should be given priority access other things being equal given that they are more at risk if the vaccine turns out to be more effective on children then saving the greatest number might require prioritizing children other things being equal eg given the same level of risks in both population and perhaps even a slightly higher level of risk on children it will also depend on how contagious covid-19 actually is for young people this last consideration is important to determine to what extent children can be a threat for the elderly and the vulnerable it is uncertain how contagious this coronavirus is in a paediatric population the widespread perception at present is that covid-19 affects children much less than other population groups this is because relatively few children have died of covid-19-related complications or have developed severe symptoms or indeed have developed any symptoms at all according to a study recently published in the journal of the american medical association for instance less than 1 of recorded covid-19 cases in china were in children younger than 10 wu 2020 however one credible hypothesis is simply that children develop symptoms less frequently because their body reacts better to the virus once they get infected rather than because they get infected less frequently cdc 2020 lu et al 2020 more research needs to be done on this but if that were the case it would mean that children are very subtle vectors of the disease as they cannot be easily identified as sources of contagion and isolated they represent a big threat for the most vulnerable in the case of the flu vaccine one reason for targeting children is that children are more likely to infect others because they are more likely to get infected in the case of covid-19 it might well be that children are more likely to infect others in large part because their infection is less likely to be detected if that were the case -and this is something at the moment we are uncertain about -having a vaccination policy that targets children would likely be the most effective thus depending on a number of variables indirect immunity might well confer more protection to the elderly and the other vulnerable population groups than direct vaccination if that were the case would it be ethical to implement a vaccination policy that targets children in order to protect the elderly what kinds of ethical concerns might be raised by a policy that prioritizes children access to the covid-19 vaccine in order to protect the elderly before we address them consider the following two cases folic acid intake in pregnant women it is widely accepted that it is at least permissible if not morally required for women to get an adequate intake of folic acid when pregnant folic acid can prevent serious risk of disease and disability in their future children such as spina bifida folic acid is not only recommended but typically added to basic everyday food such as breakfast cereal and bread this is normally seen as unproblematic the actual benefit of folic acid for women and for people in general is minimal unless there are specific health conditions such as folate deficiency anaemia actually there are cases in which folic acid is contraindicated for example in rare cases people can experience allergic reactions including anaphylaxis nhs 2019  and yet we commonly accept that it is at least permissible to encourage the introduction of a certain substance into a persons body in order to benefit someone else paediatric bone marrow donation donating stem cells to a sibling or a relative through bone marrow donation is a commonly accepted practice including when the donor is a child this kind of donation is often necessary to save the recipients life for example in cases of leukemia where other compatible donors cannot be found in a timely manner the practice is invasive and requires general anesthesia and although bone marrow harvesting is considered relatively safe there are some risks of nerve bone and tissue damage as well as the risks normally associated with anesthesia including death the procedure is considered ethically acceptable even if donor children are not legally competent to make these kinds of decisions bendorf et al 2011 the case of vaccinating children to protect the elderly is similar to these two cases in some relevant respect in all of these cases we are targeting a certain individual in order to benefit someone else in all of these cases the main benefit accrues to the third party and not to the individual who is used to benefit others although there might sometimes be some benefits to the direct target of the intervention such as to the mother in the folic acid case there are also risks associated with it the risk assessment is clearly not favourable to the direct target in the case of the bone marrow donation and although the targets legally valid consent to the procedure is not always possible such as in the bone marrow donation case the intervention is generally considered permissible as long as it is done in a way that appropriately balances the targets interests that is that the risks are reasonable reasonable risk in this context means that the benefit could not be accrued in another less risky way that the risks are minimized and proportionate to the combined benefits to the child and others the absolute risk should be such that the sacrifice constitutes an easy rescue that is no more than could otherwise be imposed on a child in ordinary life savulescu and hope 2010  from all these examples two main ethical issues arise treating someone as a mere means in order to benefit someone else and targeting one person to benefit someone else without the targets autonomous consent using children as means one concern with vaccination policies targeting children to benefit primarily the elderly and the most vulnerable might be that we are using children as means to protecting the elderly more generally we are using children to benefitting the collective through alleviating the burden on healthcare systems the greatest benefit of vaccinating them en masse will accrue to the vulnerable ones through indirect protection rather than to the vaccinated children themselves the main problem with this strategy is that no vaccine is 100 safe and 100 effective the covid-19 vaccine will be no exception human trials will need to demonstrate an acceptable level of safety and effectiveness on various population groups the vaccine currently being developed at the university of oxford for instance is now entering phase ii and iii trials and phase ii includes testing on children aged 5-12 2  thus safety and effectiveness will be tested in this age group as with all vaccines however trials will never guarantee 100 safety and 100 effectiveness the ethical issues that we are discussing in this paper would not be as pressing if we could have a vaccine that was 100 and 100 effective the reason why the problem can be framed in terms of treating children as means is that under this strategy in fact we would be exposing them to some level of risk however small it is also or even primarily for the sake of protecting others the children will vastly benefit from the vaccine because they will gain immunity but as with all vaccines the risk is not zero the situation may be worse with covid-19 as the problem is so urgent and no vaccine has ever been developed against a coronavirus of which covid-19 is a type although past research on sars and mers vaccines has identified potential approaches mayo clinic 2020 the challenge requires that a new type of vaccine be developed research has been made faster by new technologies being deployed such as a new adenovirus manufacturing platform adopted by oxford university as well as next-generation gene sequencing 8 methods 3  but the need to adopt and use somehow novel methods and to have the vaccine as quickly as possible means that the vaccine may be entering unchartered waters there is a chance that although still very safe the risks of this vaccine be greater than in the case of more conventional vaccines moreover the benefit to children may be significantly less mortality rate in children has been consistently around 001  which is similar to the flus mortality rate in children rchpch 2020 if the vaccine provides benefits to children they are likely to be marginal especially compared to the benefits provided to the elderly thus the issue of whether vaccinating children is using them as means arises it might be thought that using individuals in this way is morally wrong however using people as means is not morally problematic per se we do that in many everyday interactions when we require the service of other people we do that when we encourage pregnant women to take folic acid or harvest bone marrow from certain children to save the lives of their siblings using people as means can be morally wrong only if people are used as means in a way that harms them or that is in some other way disrespectful of them even in that case it could be plausibly argued that treating them as means is morally wrong only if they do not consent to it this might be rephrased consistently with one formulation of the kantian categorical imperative by saying that it is morally impermissible to treat people as mere means as kant put it so act that you treat humanity whether in your own person or in the person of any other always at the same time as an end never merely as a means kant 1785 429  now there are some extreme circumstances in which even treating people as means in a way that is harmful or disrespectful to them and without their consent may be considered permissible the prohibition against treat people merely as means weakens where something sufficiently valuable is at stake those familiar with the thought experiments related to the trolley problem in moral philosophy would easily recall some variations of the original scenario in which it seems intuitively permissible to kill 1 individual in order to save 5 take loop case variation of the original trolley case scenario for instance diverting a trolley onto a side track where it would kill one person instead of onto a side track where it would kill 5 seems intuitively permissible even if the two tracks are connected by a loop whereby if the 1 person was not there to stop the trolley the trolley would go around the loop and come back to kill the 5 in this case the 1 person is in fact used as a means to save the 5 this seems intuitively permissible to many even if it means that the 1 person dies so it is not so obvious that even using people as mere means is always morally wrong it might be plausibly argued that this is what we do when we harvest bone marrow from children to save their siblings in the case of the covid-19 vaccine what is at stake is very valuable -that is the life of many vulnerable people so perhaps it would not even be wrong to treat children as mere means unlike the fictitious loop case we have just described and unlike the bone marrow case the sacrifice we are asking young people is vastly smaller all they would need to do is get vaccinated and accept the very small risks of vaccination which are vastly smaller than in the fictitious loop case and likely smaller than or at worst similar to the risks in the case of bone marrow donation  in the case of vaccinating children for the flu the vaccine actually benefits children as a small proportion do suffer significant consequences and even die who 2020 the vaccine is comparatively safe if the covid-19 vaccine is similar to flu vaccine then by using children as a means to protect the elderly and the vulnerable we are using children as means in a way that also actually benefits the children as they acquire protection against covid-19 even if covid-19 seems to be not life threatening for young children it still is a disease that can cause some complications and some level of pain or discomfort and however small there is some risk of severe complications and death even in children thus whether it is reasonable to use children will be determined by the vaccines safety in children and their rate of complications from both covid-19 and vaccination if the profile were similar to flu it would be reasonable to vaccinate children primarily to benefit the elderly because the risk is reasonable if we think bone marrow donation is permissible even if we are treating one child as a means to saving another one and that encouraging women to take folic acid is permissible even if we are doing it just for the sake of the future child then we should think that vaccinating children to protect the elderly is permissible as far as our concern is about using someone as a means it is true that in the bone marrow case and in the folic acid case one might think that there are special obligations toward family members that require certain sacrifices of people however when the sacrifice required of individuals is very small the case for requiring these sacrifices is very strong even in absence of special obligations when the sacrifice actually entails some benefits the case for requiring it is even stronger a second ethical concern is that children cannot autonomously choose vaccination there can be two versions of this objection depending on how coercive the vaccination policy will be if we adopt some coercive covid-19 vaccination policy then there is an autonomy-based objection that applies to coercive vaccination policies more generally this would require a separate discussion about the relative weight of autonomy either bodily autonomy or parental autonomy compared to considerations about public health benefits of vaccination and fairness in contributing to the public good of herd immunity we have argued elsewhere that such considerations weigh in favour of compulsory vaccination eg giubilini 2019a giubilini 2019b giubilini and savulescu 2019  however in this paper we want to focus more specifically on targeting children in the future covid-19 vaccination policy regardless of whether the policy will be coercive if there is any concern about autonomy specifically with regard to children as a target of vaccination policies then it would be about childrens autonomy it is exactly the same autonomy-based concern that arises in the child bone marrow donation case however this concern can be dismissed by pointing out that children are not generally deemed competent to make autonomous decisions about health care or disease prevention anyway we normally accept that parents make such choices on their behalf targeting children cannot meaningfully infringe on their autonomy simply because children do not have the relevant capacity for autonomous decisions -that is whatever capacity for autonomous decision they have it is normally not taken to warrant a right to autonomous decision hence targeting children in vaccination policies cannot infringe upon their autonomy in an ethically relevant way simply there is no autonomy to be infringed upon of course older adolescents who are competent would be an exception but in the case the relevant autonomy-based objection would be the one often raised against compulsory vaccination as we said we are not going to address it here if we think that child bone marrow donation is permissible even if children cannot provide valid that is autonomous consent then we should think that targeting children in vaccination policies is permissible too as far as our concern is about autonomy thus if it will turn out that a vaccination policy targeting children is more effective at creating immunity at the collective level  and if initial vaccine availability will be limited there seem to be significant reasons for prioritizing child access to the vaccine this measure would be more likely to be effective and there would be no ethical objection to this kind of policy as far as we can see in a way this is what is already happening children and young people and society more broadly are paying a high cost for the sake of protecting the vulnerable children are forced to keep social distance from their peers they cannot attend school they are prohibited from accessing playgrounds and they will inevitably pay a high price from the huge economic impact of the lockdown at present and in the future while the elderly and vulnerable people are the main victims of the virus young people and children particularly are arguably among the main victims of the social measures implemented their life is going to be significantly impacted in a negative way by these measures and they have less to gain from such measures given that they are very unlikely to experience significant symptoms and complications and extremely unlikely to die of covid-19 the limitations they are subject to are meant to benefit the elderly and the most vulnerable groups primarily this is the background against which the post-vaccine scenario and the ethical issues around the distribution of the vaccine must be assessed it may be that the sacrifices of being vaccinated for a child are smaller than the sacrifices of lockdown the proposal to vaccinate they young to benefit the old is controversial we need to start debating it now in the cool calm hour as butler put it there is a scientific as well as an ethical challenge to be addressed before adequate law can be formulated ethical discussion needs to commence and legal options and possible plans need to be examined now in this way when we have a vaccine we will be able to get it out to the right people and to return to full and lasting normality as soon as possible when the uk government started to seriously consider various options to control the spread of covid-19 in early march 2020 many people at some point had the impression that the strategy was that of building up natural herd immunity this strategy would have gone in the exact opposite direction of that pursued by most other countries which enforced harsh lockdown measures at an early stage with the exception of sweden some statements by some representatives and scientific advisors of the government seemed to suggest that this was the line of the government at least initially because it was considered the most effective way to keep the number of infections at any one time within the capacity of the nhs to absorb new cases 4  whether that strategy would have been effective or more effective than the lockdown enforced a few days after is unknown according to some predictions it would have led to an estimated half million deaths before the vaccine becomes available way more than the ones we are likely to have with a lockdown many thought that this strategy would have been unethical because it would have meant exposing certain people to considerable risks of illness and deaths for the sake of protecting others according to their view you cannot make certain people sick in order to protect others through immunity at the collective level we do not take a stance on the ethics of that kind of policy here rather we want to point out that the strategy of vaccinating children in order to protect the vulnerable would follow the same logic that seemed to inform the initial attitude of the uk government building up immunity at the collective level in order to protect the vulnerable however it would allow that objective to be achieved without anywhere near the risks and the ethical costs that many identified in that natural herd immunity strategy if building up immunity in a way that would protect the vulnerable is desirable an appropriate use of the vaccine would allow to achieve that aim at no significant ethical cost there remain important empirical questions to be answered both in terms of the role of children in spreading covid-19 and the effectiveness of any candidate vaccines in different groups however if the covid-19 vaccine does turn out to be significantly more effective on children and children represent a key vector for spread then there is a strong ethical case that vaccination policies ought to prioritize children rather than the elderly importantly the same ethical point we have made in this paper can have different practical implications depending on the other groups that might be or become higher risk groups the kind of good we want to achieve the best way to achieve it and the characteristics of the vaccine here we have only discussed what seems one of the most feasible and effective instantiations of a more general principle that could guide vaccination decisions and policies in the next months but there are other possible applications of the same principle for instance prisoners are a higher risk groups because of the higher risk of infection in jails closed environments and retail shop workers will become a higher risk group once the lockdown measures are eased some of these groups are also essential for restarting the economy and therefore for bringing about important social goods beyond the mere contribution to realising collective immunity these are all considerations that need to be taken into account when deciding which groups to target in order to protect which other groups and to contribute to the collective good more generally importantly the decision about how to balance these different considerations will depend on the vaccines features for example there is a possibility that one of the most promising vaccine candidates will be effective at preventing people from getting sick eg from developing pneumonia but not too effective at stopping transmission because the virus might still be present in the nose as shown in animal experiments and spread through sneezing or coughing van doramalen et al 2020 once we take all these variables into account we might still want to prioritize those who do not stand to benefit the most from the vaccine if there is some important societal good to be achieved by doing this but we will need to decide whom to prioritize for the sake of whom and in view of achieving which societal good for example we might want to prioritize those groups who are essential to the upkeep of society such as factory workers grocery store workers medical and nursing school students and others it all depends on what kind of good we want to achieve eg protecting the vulnerable restarting the economy longer term economic benefits etc and what is required to achieve it eg creating herd immunity allowing the workforce to safely and quickly return to full activity etc the relative ethical weight of the different goods at stake and their opportunity costs would need to be considered for each of these possible solutions our point is that assuming the vaccine will be safe and effective prioritizing a certain population group also as a means for achieving a larger societal benefit is ethically permissible and might indeed be ethically required  creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike 40 international cc by-nc-sa 40   from the leader of the free world to the world press to more than one researcher there has been a focus on something called the mortality rate of the new viral disease covid-19 2  we are told that whether we should worry or not worry depends on whether the newish 3 infection does or does not cause many more deaths than traditional infections like the flu a number apparently to be arrived at by dividing the number of fatalities by the number of infected or ill or diagnosed people if this number is comparable to the flu then we are supposed to take a break from worrying on the other hand if it is significantly higher then we should go back to worrying or instead of flu we are told to think of the number of people who die in car crashes divided by the total number of people driving or riding in an automobile these are the supposedly key numbers we heard and read about when the question of locking down arose in the past couple of months they are now red-hot again as the issue of what to do next for example relax the lock-down or maybe make it stricter becomes urgent this is all entirely wrong -and if many or even just a few researchers and decision-makers continue to think this way very bad things will happen -or rather bad things will continue to happen and worse things will follow why do i say this because there is confusion about just what those supposedly decisive numbers actually measure there are in reality many different numbers that are studied by epidemiologists actuaries statisticians this is not the time or place to go through all that -and above all not the time to get lost in technical concepts and terminology that is often confusing and sometimes actually confused there are for starters four basic points that everyone needs to understand the mortality rate constantly talked about seems 4 to be the percentage of people with a given illness that will die this is a very useful concept in epidemiology and actuarial science but not the way it is being used to inform the response to covid-19 or any similar epidemic in the future 5  after all there are 1 note to the reader we have deliberately written this article in non-technical language eg avoiding terms like case fatality risk and so on so as to make it accessible to the largest possible audience affected by the current crisis it is for the same reason that we tried to write simply eg using the word avoid rather than eschew we also of necessity oversimplify numerous indeed almost all technical points we would also like to take the opportunity to thank roman belolipetsky ivan ivanov ukasz kauny maciej kulczycki yoram meroz ed rosenberger mikhail zhivlov for crucial references discussion and commentary 2 there are several problems with the definitions and terminology currently used in the case hivaids a clear distinction is made between being infected with the hiv virus and having the full-blown disease aids in the case of covid-19 anyone infected is considered by definition to have the disease but if it is agreed that the vast majority of such people do not require any medical care then it becomes crucial to distinguish degrees of how sick different people are 3 it might be very useful if everyone were to understand that this virus correctly named sars-cov-2 is very closely related to one that has been seen before and to others that we will certainly meet in the future 4 it is not always possible to be sure because much of what one reads or hears does not specify exactly what number is being referred to usually one can figure it out from the context or from the numbers cited 5 the great uncertainty about how many people are actually infected due to problems with testing and the rarity of truly random testing is not the only reason that the case fatality risk cannot be calculated the other reason is that technically this can only be validly computed once every case is closed so that we know how many have died and how many have recovered so even here we need a rethink because this technical concept will thus be largely inapplicable in the current situation until long into the future diseases with around 100 mortality 6  for example rabies yet we do not ring an alarm on a worldwide scale about rabies because such diseases are so rare you may be tempted to retort if so you have just granted our first point the very word rare means that we are now talking about an entirely different number -not what percentage of patients stricken with a given disease flu covid-19 rabies or riding in a motorcar will die from it -but rather what percentage of the total population will so you have already agreed with point one of what we wanted you and everyone else to understand and just to drive this point home think of how many hospital beds denmark has versus china monaco versus the united states obviously rabies is equally deadly wherever it is found but just because it is rare it can be handled everywhere but there is always a limit on the amount of medical care that is obviously connected 7 to the size of the population -and the big question before us is whether covid-19 will exceed or in some places already has exceeded that limit so yes it has to be at least in part about the number of people who will die of covid-19 in relation to the total population here is another way to approach this a study in california claims that the real infection rate is 50-85 times higher than the rate deduced from the tests done so far the study was not properly randomized and so means nothing but if these numbers were valid would this be good news or bad good if we care about mortality rate per infected population which would be that much lower but maybe not such good news if it revealed that our testing is wholly inadequate that the infection has spread much more rapidly than was thought perhaps that the measures taken to slow the spread or stop the infection have not worked and that soon we may expect many more per population very sick and dying people than expected arriving much faster than expected on the doorsteps of hospitals that cannot possibly grow the number of beds or doctors or equipment at the same rate so we have to understand what the numbers mean before we can decide if they are good or bad news but second counting deaths per population is not enough which is why there is this point and two more after all life itself like rabies has a 100 mortality rate and since life is a condition we all suffer from it is all 100 mortality per capita but with recent advances people with rabies as we know can be saved while people with life cannot this may sound flippant but it is not we need to know not just how many people will likely die of covid-19 if untreated but also how many will die even if treated and again this is because there is every indication that we may reach or in some places have already reached a situation where people who could be saved with medical care will die because there will not be enough of that care to go around or it will be misallocated and this would be or is a key concern for a civilized society placing the medical profession in an impossible situation third ordinarily people do not all die at the same time it happens over years and decades at a more or less constant and more or less known rate so time is an essential factor in the calculations that we really need this is what the flattening of the curve has been all about trying to buy time but the mortality rates being talked about do not take time into account -by design it is important for various scientific and practical purposes to know that rabies if untreated will be uniformly fatal -while the time it takes is not so significant so the mortality rates that ignore time are not invalid they just were never intended to guide policy in a situation such as the one we face with covid-19 the time factor is critical and so any time you hear or read some mortality rate cited ask yourself and if possible ask them whether it is a rate calculated per unit of time fourth and perhaps even more important medicine does not save lives i am very sorry but it does not it is simple logic that if life has a 100 death rate then no ones life gets saved that would be just a flat contradiction what medicine does do is to prolong lives and to reduce the suffering of the living none of us wants to suffocate or see someone else suffocating on the doorsteps of a hospital or in the waiting area -or at home because no ambulance is available to take us to the hospital so even if many of the most seriously ill covid-19 cases will die it would be intolerable for a civilized society to refuse them medical care if at all possible so it is not about the death rates alone it is also vital to think of what i will call the suffering rate 8  the number of people again per population and per time who whether they soon die or not will require intensive care in the interim its not the mortality rate stupid reumatologia 2020 582 let us try to think this through another way forget the infection for a second and think of an airplane or train or bus crash or a major accident at sea even as it is any of these will shock people more than a car crash or a normal death from the complications of diabetes this is because the more people die or even are merely injured at once the more it threatens the fabric of society beginning with the all-important question of whether we can guarantee them the care we can and do offer to individuals if the rate of such incidents increased just a little over what it is the health system would soon find itself unable to receive and treat the survivors that is precisely the issue with the corona virus and again the point is that the capacity of a health care system is related not to the number of infected cases or the number of airplane crash survivors but roughly proportional to the population if the number of airplane crashes doubles or triples or whatever we cannot instantly double triple etc the number of ambulances of emergency room beds of medical personnel of equipment exactly the same as in the case of an infection such as covid-19 is or may be or may become the reason this new infection has been so difficult and threatens to become disastrous is not just the biology of the corona viruses there is also a vast lack of relevant and valid information 9  an influential and highly-placed physician writes but is the outbreak currently trending downward or increasing linearly or exponentially unfortunately it is impossible to answer this question with certainty because of the masking effect by just observing the numerical totals of patients we are essentially flattening a complex multilayered picture and only seeing its projection like a shadow on the wall 10  to have better information we need to know what to count at the very least we need to know the number of infected people in relation to population and time then the number who will require intensive care whether they will be saved or not then the number that can be kept by intensive care from the death that will some other hopefully distant day come from some other cause 11  and how to count too most of the figures reported to date are wholly meaningless and the constant repetition of meaningless numbers by the who by governments by the media does not help it has to be done on random samples of the relevant populations and subpopulations 12  this is just beginning to be done notably in germany of course months too late 13  while at the same time elsewhere in the world studies are being done on samples that are not random at all and serve no purpose eg volunteers responding to ads placed on social media 14  and what if you should wonder whether the measures taken to date or maybe which particular measures have had the desired effect -or anyway some effect the answer is basically the same supposing that you now know what to count and how to count then someone needs to calculate each of the right numbers multiple times once if no measures of social distancing or hygiene are or had been taken a second time in relation to the measures in place a third time in relation to any new measures either stricter or more relaxed that anyone is contemplating and so on the mathematics and science to do this exist some mathematicians and scientists have been calling for better information from the beginning -and the majority who have not been heard from have kept quiet because they did not expect to be heard plato fantasized about philosopher kings we need at least for those mathematicians and scientists who understand what and how to count to be listened to only then can we begin to figure out the answers to the two essential questions before us 1 is the pandemic we are seeing with its actually historically quite low numbers just a pale preview of a major disaster that has already been stopped in time or the beginning of a major disaster that has to be stopped now or something else 15 2 on various scenarios what can our health care systems and social order in general handle or what can they potentially be redesigned to handle in the future nor is this the end next we really have to have a little talk about the mutations that have already arisen 16  not to mention a bigger talk about those that science tells us to expect the author declares no conflict of interest 15 there are many possibilities besides the simplistic alternatives of a quick exit now from the current emergency measures or a much slower exit much later perhaps only after a vaccine comes into universal use but both assuming that at some point fairly soon life will return to normal a particularly unsettling possibility is that covid-19 becomes chronic or recurrent so that the vast majority of people are not threatened but a much higher rate of patients that we are accustomed to continue to require intensive care and perhaps many cannot obtain it andor die in other words a partial return to the way the human kind lived before the explosive advances in science medicine and public health that we all have been taking for granted 16   dynamical model of spreading of covid-19 based on a flow networks and sir family a comparison of trends in spain and the netherlands victoria lopez milena uki  the pandemic of sars-cov-2 made many countries impose restrictions in order to control its dangerous effect on the citizens this work is a theoretical dynamical model based on flow networks and the sir family model that illustrates the developments and trends based on publicly available data based on this model a code in r was written and fed by publicly available data from spain and netherlands to compare their trends our results show that the peak of infection is already behind us in both countries but also demonstrate that there is a danger of rebound of a spread of infections it is obvious that measures imposed are giving the results but we should be precarious of near future practices and development since the majority of population will be still susceptible to infection most importantly this model can be easily adapted to other regions to replicate model in different situations and be useful for optimization of response  the viral infection is raging around the world since its start in china in last quarter of 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 sars-cov-2 which is causing the disease covid-19 spread all over the world in last three months who the first european country registering the person with covid-19 was france after which other countries followed among them with very high speed of spread was spain which already reached the peak of number of infected citizens in the netherlands the alarming level of infections was lagging after spain the first patient infected during his recent travel to lombardy in the netherlands was confirmed on february 27th 2020 very soon after outbreak the website dashboard of john hopkins university started updating publicly available data on number of infected deceased and hospitalized persons in all affected countries and many scientific groups tried to employ their knowledge and already developed methods to answer various unknowns in connection to this epidemiologic phenomenon many research groups are working on similar problems and we wanted to stress here some of the most important findings so far friston published technical paper present on government website in uk friston et al 2020 the dynamical causal model of spread shedding light on some parts of the mechanism the same group published another paper also as a preprint on arxiv aiming at estimating the susceptible part of population coming to the conclusion that less than 20 of eu countries population is infected and that only 64 of those infected are gaining immunity since their posteriori estimate is suggesting that the majority of european population will stay without the immunity after this first outbreak this would eventually lead to another cycle of infections resulting in consecutive peaks they compared this situation with spanish flu pandemic from 2018 which had three peaks in total moran et al 2020  their result is important since it can inform further governmental actions to prevent loss of larger parts of european population due to the high infectivity of the corona-virus researchers from the netherlands concentrated on testing of healthcare workers who became infected concluding that more than half of them had mild symptoms and many of them kept on working while symptomatic kluytmans van den bergh et al 2020 on rivm governmental site the netherlands april 102020 it was stated that at one-point healthcare professionals were actually 24 of all recorded infected cases chinese researchers reported before about the mechanisms and levels of infectivity as well as symptoms but also used the epidemiological tools to predict outcomes prem liu et al 2020  several studies tried to forecast the future disease trajectories informing further management of hospitalization moghadas shoukat et al 2020  as we were working on this model the number of preprints regarding covid-19 doubled every week resulting in another phenomenon described by the nature from 29 april the publishers removing firewalls and speeding up the reviewing process for covid-19 bundles actually contributed to slipping in some incompetent or bad science using this opportunity for fast publication although different countries adopted different approaches to solving the problem of massive infections mainly by social distancing and lockdown it can be seen that a similar pattern are present modelling a dynamic system that represent those patterns has been the goal of the present work we started with the epidemiological compartments model originated from work of kermack and mckendrick in 1927 sir and then we developed a flow network with some characteristics from markov chain where all the states for a person are represented the first results of this work were publicly shared on linkedin pages of the authors in consecutive days from the end of march and the first three weeks of april 2020 gaining valuable suggestions from colleagues on how to improve the model after defining parameters and inferring unknown variables the code in r was written and fed first by the publicly available data present on john hopkins university website dong et al 2019  after the first week we started using publicly available data present on the website of spanish ministry of health ine after which we decided to start calculating the trends for the netherlands from governmental rivm website also with the difference in the data accessible for example the data about the numbers of recovered persons is not stated in rivm daily updates it has to be inferred although the disclaimer says that the number of deaths and hospitalization very often are cumulative for couple of days especially around easter holiday the aim of this work is to compare trends in two european countries since the initial dynamics in one country can become similar in another one which is lagging in numbers of hospitalized and infected people it can already be seen that measures taken are affecting the dynamics and total numbers of affected people in both countries also the aim of our work is to share the detailed theoretical model especially how we determined transfer parameters between states in order to help further balancing the future model and managing the scarce resources since we believe that another peak in infection is possible this article is organized as follows after this brief introduction in section 2 methods and data are explained section 3 is dedicated to the data available for the study and the necessity of inferences or data estimation we explain all details of our model in section 4 where it is introduced as a flow network model results of the application of the model can be read in section 5 finally section 6 contains the discussion conclusion and future work compartmental model is technique which simplify the mathematical modelling of infectious disease one of the simplest compartment models is sir model it presumes that all the members of population are going through the three statesbelong to three compartments those who are susceptible s those who are infected i and eventually those who recovered r-number of recovered or deceased to represent that the number of susceptible infected and recovered individuals may vary over time even if the total population size remains constant we make the precise numbers a function of time t st it and rt the model utilizes ordinary differential equations ode which are deterministic but the dynamics of the flow can become nonlinear and therefore can be understood in stochastic framework if the latter is the case the model becomes more realistic but also much more complicated to numerically execute the sir model susceptible infected recovered is deductive within the differential equation system t time unit is the variable and coefficients are a list of parameters these parameters are not easy to infer because they are fuzzy noisy and dependent of the same data from which the model is due figure 1 shows the sagittal graph and some details on the different perspectives sir seir sitr seqijr also in this figure the distribution of the data poisson and the calculation of its parameter  are remarked and the system of derivative equations that models the sir system from the definition of the states on day t1 with respect to the previous day t and using the derivative approximation the system of differential equations is constructed this idea simplified all the others in the family the seqijr model was used by the researchers for sar-cov-1 the predecessor of sar-cov-2 which is causing of covid-19 these models include nodes for susceptible s latent e infected i quarantine t q isolation j and recovered r the model of our work has 10 nodes and the quarantine and isolation nodes are implemented within real containers in the process of recovering as next section shows the advantage of our model is that the parameters are less uncertain for calculations as it is explained in section 4 first of all we started from the information about the number of inhabitants of spain as a publicly available number of 47 100 396 wwwinees of which 17 are people older than 60 years of whom 25 are over 80 for the nederland rivm the national statistics office stated that the number of population the data are from november 2019 is17 424 978 centraal bureau voor de statistiek cbs and that 149 of them are persons older than 65 during the first week we used data from a repository for the 2019 novel coronavirus at johns hopkins university center for systems science and engineering jhu csse were used dong du et al 2020  after that initial week we started using instead the official reports of spanish wwwinees httpscovid19isciiies and nederlands national institute for public health rivm httpswwwrivmnlennovel-coronavirus-covid-19current-information-about-novelcoronavirus-covid-19 from already mentioned resources we collected daily the following figures important for the model the information about daily reported number of infected persons infi persons admitted to the hospital h people who deceased lostf people who recovered r active healthcare workers ps and healthcare workers infected psinfac we indirectly found the data about the number of people who are working even in this situation te of the lockdown beside healthcare workers like drivers those who deliver food police etc we supposed that those who are in lockdown q in the situation like this are close to the number of inhabitants since self-isolation in both countries was mandatory latent persons l is people who are infected but asymptomatic or just not registered due to the lack of massive testing l size can be inferred with some reliability from the biological research 16 times r in spain in the first week of april for example this model is a combination of flow networks fn and the sir model with some considerations from markov chains figure 2 shows as a starting point the two networks before left and after right graph the lockdown in spain a lockdown on 14-03-2020 and in the netherlands partial one on 23-03-2020 it can be seen on above graphical representation of the model that the nodes are symbolizing subpopulations of the number we begin with the number of the whole population although it is an approximation of the reality we simplify the problem in order to model it the number from the beginning q those in lockdownconfined and ps active healthcare workers on the first line of primary care and in hospitals are contributing to the next compartment l latentinfected but not registered on the version after the lockdown we added te the working people who are actively in transfer during the lockdown then after the exposure or after the incubation which can be according to who between 14 and 28 days they gather in the compartment inf which is infected both l and inf can go directly to recovered r but also those infected can die at home or die after admittance to the hospital h those people who do recover r are coming from two different compartments namely inf and h those who are treated in hospitals can develop life-threatening problems and be transferred to icu those from icu can eventually become better after which they can be transferred to rehabilitation center or another department in hospital the people who die f from spanish fallecidos due to the consequences of covid-19 are comprising of prior members of three different compartments inf those who die at home h those who die in the hospitals and icu those who were on intensive care probably on ventilators the symbol a represents those who after being infected recovered and develop the immunity on a corona virus sars-cov-2 as we mentioned earlier it is still not clear from different sources of information scientific literature included whether the covid-19 patients develop partial or full immunity and whether re-infection is possible after recovery we did not further specify this possible development in our model since we did not have reliable data about those who do have immunity on corona virus and we cannot do this estimation we considered in our model that two main end-nodes are r and f the objective functions we aimed to find in this research are the part of optimization for which you need to introduce certain restrictions for example looking overall it is a question of in which relationship are arrivals and departures and only if they are equal the system can be in equilibrium but that is not possible in reality we consider this work as a trial of making balancing this model due to the knowledge of certain transfers of possible importance for further management of resources hospitals and icus are in any system so far bottlenecks since they have limited capacities to manage to circumvent such a bottlenecks administrators of a system can try to optimize the flow by tackling the certain transfers we managed to define another question visible on our left panel the model before the lockdown is illustrated in the arrows in the bottom grey one -those still in incubatory period and those with symptoms of the disease and yellowish one-showing those who are latent or asymptomaticwithout symptoms and those who are already infective have capacity to infect others so they can transfer the disease further in their contacts on john hopkins website it can be seen for example that more than 802 confirmed patients were actually with very mild symptoms sometimes believing it was the seasonal flu the number of asymptomatic people is still not known because that would require massive testing of the whole populations or at least a big sample to estimate that number researchers from germany for example found that almost half of total cases are originating from people without obvious symptoms after a proper investigation and follow up they found that someone can be contagious two days before the development of symptoms dr drosten from charite berlin germany epidemiological coordinator the aim of all the measures applied at the moment is that the healthcare system and measures proposed would try to maximize the processtransferarrow leading from inf to r and eventually to a and minimize the summary flow to f deceased another representation of compartments leading us to the better understanding of the underlying dynamics can be seen on the figure 3  as the figure 3 shows the sir model fits perfectly within our flow network model per each arc ab the flow is number of persons that goes from a to b daily which is a poisson distribution where the parameter lambda is also variable figure 4 is showing the set of equations behind the model the first one is an invariant equation that make consistence of the model total population within the network is stable the rest of the equations comes from the variation of the flow per each node in the same way than the differential equations used for sir model here we are giving the meaning of all the parameters used in recurrent equations since they are the arrows illustrating the flow between compartments including all the possible interactions we could include at the moment beta  is the average number of contacts per person per time here we are choosing the time of update is one day and decribes the transition from one compartment to another we explored several scenarios to probe this in case of our model since we have three groups of susceptible peersons there are three transition parpameters probability of contagioninfection in isolation for example members of household 1 probability of contagion for a person who is an active healthworker 2 and probability of contagion of a person who works during the lockdown as a non-healthcare worker 3 the parameter gamma  the the probability of developing the illness once you get infected l are people that got the virus but dont develop the illness asymptomatic persons inf are the people who after getting infected are so evidently sick that they are easily registered we did not mention the probability to change the state from latent to infective one so one can transfer the disease and on a final model there is not even an arrow between those two states the parameters alpha are describing the probability of death 1the probability of dying at home or in a nursing home 2-the probability of going to a hospital and 3the probability of recovery at home parameter showing the probability of passing away in hospital not in icu is described here as 1 2 is probability of that one need a care in icu and 3 is probability of recovering at hospital parameters signifying the probability of passing away in icu 1 and 2 the probability to leave the icu and be transfered to another department in hospital or another hospital for rehabilitation omega 1 signifies the probability to become infected for the second time after the recovery and 2 signifies the probability of immunization or of attaining the immunity to corona virus 2 in addition we need to stress here that it is still not clear whether the presence of antibodies in the serum of a tested person is a certain support of total or partial immunity to sars-cov-2 on the final model figure 3 it can be seen that the l and infi nodes have been neighbors as they are logically connected by the flow of infection affected by the viral load according to the time windows there is transit between the q and te nodes that are now active jobs outside the home the model below does not study those immunized or infected in successive instances because they are residual or there is insufficient information the model could be useful if applied to specific regions such as a city or a town the spanish state is very diverse and this makes estimates very unreliable our opinion is that madrid as such a big affected citya focus is contributing to the public figures but it is a question how that applies to other areas like almeria or alhambra for example thus the model had to be tested further with a fresh data the model is very dynamic the parameters require daily updates in order to obtain good quality results due to the constant introduction of political measures for the management of the pandemic it is also a very vulnerable system any misuse can lead to radical changes such as neglect or misuse of prevention measures based on above described model a code in r is written and fed by the data from official sources mentioned in the data section which were updated daily this yielded an evolution of the states cumulatively from early march to april 29th 2020 for spain and as a comparison similar output graphic representation for the netherlands although with some missing data as we could not retrieve the number of recovered persons from rivm website we only combined it with some updates from jhu we need to stress once more that our model is a generalization based on the data from the whole country but we are confident that it would work even better for a smaller region or data with easily stamped data our results comprise of two parts the first one is the evolution of the spread of disease in spain from 9-03-2020 to 29-04-2020 with a special focus on a novel trend obtained in the third week of april and the cumulative evolution of a spread in the netherlands for the same period note that the proposed lockdowns were ten days apart there are some specific remarks we can infer from those results  the model indicates that the probability of contagion is higher for active sanitary workers 28910 -3  logically those in isolation are the least vulnerable 100710 -3  estimated beta parameter for regular workers under the recommended protection is bounded as 3310 -3 a proper estimation is not possible due to lack of data  as a conclusion of this study we could say that these data indicate a danger of rebound in the pandemic as the first peak of infections in spain was behind us reached on march 26 th  people gradually start going out for work but it is again giving rise to the number of newly infected ones and it can mean that another peak of spread is following figure 7 shows the danger index which is a formula that computes the difference between the arrivals and departures in the network this difference is desirable to be negative linear regression curve indicates an increasing tendency it can be seen that the peak of spread dynamics was on march 26th but if we observe the difference between the inflow and output from this network we can see at the far right part of the graph that another rise of infected persons is starting again figure 8 shows same approach 4 days after we can observe how the tendency can change after a few new input data in this figure there are also remarks to some important dates to understand the evolution of the sanitary crisis in spain 26th april changes totally the tendency of the red line which is here touching the blue line blue is symbolizing the confidence interval  the evolution and observed trends in the netherlands due to some mising data we were not able to estimate the number of recovered persons but it seems as also stated on rvo website that the proposed measures of social distancing self-isolation and working from home are giving the results the problem we faced is that the data reported by rivm in the netherlands are limited to the total number of registered infected persons and new daily registered cases number of people admitted to the hospitals with a daily number of new admissions and the number of registered deaths with the disclaimer that the numbers may vary since nor the hospital admissions not the deceased are accurate due to specific procedures causing aggregation of the data for several days the number of health professionals infected we got indirectly from another study published by the group in erasmus hospital in rotterdam and the number of recovered is totally absent we found some data on jhu but the total number of 250 recovered people when the total number of cases was already above 30 000 is probably unreliable we tried to infer some data from those which we have with the help of la places rule but sometimes we could not do that either another information which is missing is the number of people in icus again we found just sporadic data presented on other news during the pandemic like 1200 persons in total according to governmental media also from other sources of information we learned that a portion of patients from netherlands was treated in neighboring germany due to their better preparedness some cases were for example transferred from rotterdam to amsterdam and all in all we are aware that the accurate figures will be known only after the whole crisis would be over so we decided to focus on the part of the model we can infer about and the final nodes which were r and f we already stated that we decided not to elucidate about a since the mechanism of attaining immunity is still not known entirely again when we take into account all the unknowns we suppose that the rebound is possible which could be only seen after the gradual relaxation of special measures imposed to all the population on the last day we entered the data to the model the numbers of admitted patients in hospitals the registered deceased and the newly registered cases dropped significantly 88 48171 but according to already mentioned study performed with the support of sanquin royters only 3 of tested population developed antibodies which translated to the whole population is pointing out at the level of potential immunity much lower than desired herdimmunity which was so overrated term in a public discourse our results show by employing our dynamical model fed with publicly available data the sars-cov-2 which cause the disease covid-19 spread evolution and trends in spain and in the nederland cumulatively from 9 march to 29 april 2020 it is clear that in both countries the recommended measures of social distancing and closing the public gatherings are giving the results the peak of new infections admissions to hospitals and deaths already happened in both countries we think that our dynamical model based on compartment sir epidemiological model with modifications from markov chain and network flow are giving the tool to those who want to optimize the management of resources especially in other than central areas it is of importance since our results are also showing that another wave of infections is possible and that we would probably have another peaks our model is giving indications of future increase in infections which is in line with other researchers findings that only a fraction of population 64 in any european country will have the antibodies necessary for later immunity on covid-19 moran et al 2020  it is still not clear whether those who recover after the infection are attaining partial or total immunity for covid-19 since there are reports of sporadic re-infections in asia a study of dutch blood donors has found that around 3 have developed antibodies against the new coronavirus which change the insight in how many people were being sick below the radar of detection reuters on a population of above 17 million it is much more than the publicly available records giving the retrograde conclusion that some half of a million were sick in the past in the beginning of march an analysis of waste water around amsterdam showed the presence of corona virus illustrating the extent of spread of infection which is probably larger than the detected cases which is not strange since only around 17000 tests were performed in the nederland until the conclusion of this study our results are implying that active health workers have increased probability of contagion and that only those in isolation are safe but that is defensive measure since the first vaccines can be expected in around a year for safety reasons the question here is how we are going to live since the majority of population is not immune to the virus infection many will agree that life will have to change after this pandemic significantly another important issue in this crisis is the role that asymptomatic persons are having in germany it is found an interview with the countrys medical coordinator dr christian drosten with guardian that almost half of all infections was coming from contagious but asymptomatic people at least there were without symptoms in the time of transmission another follows up showed that they became contagious two days before developing the symptoms dr drosten is pointing out that the tracking mobile systems are racing with the time since the dynamic is very complicated when those latent people are in the game there is also another effect dr drosten mentions which is the irrational effect of their successful strategy germany has the lowest number of deceased in regard with the total number of registered infections which is giving the false impression that the problem is exaggerated and that those who are strategists of epidemiological health workforce are against economy every country has its own flaw our like netherlands showing overrated optimism in the beginning of the crisis demonstrating false impression of safety versus small risk perceived we are aware that our study has some limitations we think that among limitations and restrictions which should be taken in consideration of our model has the following  model assumes a constant n population no births or immigration as any sir model  the population is not homogeneous this study would be probably more useful for a small region although moran et al 2020 showed that the small city region model is less effective than the dynamical one  the parameters are estimated from the official data which are sometimes aggregated  q represents the quarantined and healthy node ie one person may be incubating the virus and being in the quarantine but that person is placed in the latent node l  the strength of the infection and rate of recovery determine some transfers  no pharmacological intervention vaccines drugs exist at the moment  transmission is by random contact all persons have the same probability of exposureafter the state of lockdown and within the corresponding population sector  infection capacity per infected person 2 to 3 people some reports indicate 25 or somewhat less  the initial values on the population q0 ps0 and te0 are also estimates from the official data we believe that our model can be even better applied to smaller regions and even cities with their collected data since the publicly available data that we used is probably affected greatly with the big cities like madrid and amsterdam for example and the dynamics can be somewhat different in another province therefore we would like other researchers to test further this model in conclusion we can say that our results show that the dynamical trend in nederland seems to follow a very similar pattern in the spain it is just lagging behind for less than two weeks due to the lack of r data on the nederland side we can only estimate it from other present data as a conclusion of this study we could say that these data indicate a danger of rebound in the pandemic since the data show that spain already reached the peak of spread it could mean that other peaks are to follow which can inform further preventive decisions from authorities that can be concluded also with the comparison with the most similar pandemic of spanish fly in 2018 it has three peaks in total and the policy makers affected the curve of spread greatly in a documentary about pandemics from netflix serial explained emitted before the onset of sars-cov-2 in europe a sentence from an expert epidemiologist from who stays a long time with us mother nature is the ultimate bioterrorist the narrative was and now we all know too well that the question is not will the pandemic hit us but when we hope that we can at least learn from the previous experience and make better optimization of our health care systems in next period because the virus is here to stay and we have to find a way to survive it the first step to that goal is to understand every little detail in the dynamics of its spread if almost every state in the world is doing the simulation of future elections or invest heavily in warfare then the usage of precisely the same techniques and resources for fighting the virus should be possible  can testing ease social distancing measures future evolution of covid-19 in nyc omar housni el mika sumida paat rusmevichientong huseyin topaloglu serhan ziya  the new york state on pause executive order came into effect on march 22 with the goal of ensuring adequate social distancing to alleviate the spread of covid-19  in this study we analyze the impact of social distancing measures and testing capacity on the evolution of covid-19 in new york city on march 22 the new york state on pause executive order came into effect to ensure adequate social distancing and it has been helpful in controlling the spread of the disease and preventing healthcare resources from stretching too thin pause will remain in effect in the city in some form until early june social distancing measures to the degree they are practiced today are not sustainable testing particularly together with contact tracing could help relax social distancing measures facilitating the partial reopening of the economy while keeping the spread of the disease under control however the level of testing capacity necessary to allow noticeable relaxation in the social distancing norms and to help reopen the economy is not yet clear we consider various possibilities regarding the social distancing measures and testing capacity availability in the immediate post-pause period we project the evolution of the pandemic in the city until the end of september to make our projections we use a compartmentalized model that captures the limited availability of testing capacity while allowing some contact tracing to identify test and isolate individuals at risk we find that testing capacity must increase dramatically if it is to counterbalance somewhat small levels of relaxation in the social distancing measures in the post-pause period if the social distancing measures in the post-pause period are relaxed to pre-pause norms and the city continues to perform 20000 tests per day then the number of deaths by the end of september can reach 250000 if the social distancing norms are fully relaxed then even with a testing capacity of 100000 per day the city still faces a second wave of the pandemic that would likely supersede the one it experienced in april by keeping the social distancing measures halfway between the preand in-pause levels and performing 100000 tests per day in the post-pause period the number of deaths by the end of september can be kept at around 27000 if the city is to go back to pre-pause social distancing norms and keep the number of deaths by the end of september under 35000 then it should be performing 500000 tests per day the message is clear if one considers for a moment going back to the pre-pause life quickly in the post-pause period then the city should be ramping up its testing capacity to 500000 but even then there will be a price to pay our model follows the standard susceptible-infected-recovered paradigm with compartments capturing individuals classified along the dimensions of infected noninfected and recovered as well as symptomatic-isolated asymptomatic-isolated and asymptomatic-nonisolated once an individual is tested positive a certain number of individuals who are expected to have been in close contact with the positive individual are transferred to a certain isolated compartment in this way we build a contact tracing mechanism to ensure that those who have been in contact with a positive individual reduce their contact with the rest of the population running our model with a starting date of march 2 we get a trajectory of the pandemic that is in reasonably close agreement with the actual trajectory in the city so far in the appendix we give a discussion of our model and provide comparisons of its output with the actual trajectory of the pandemic in the top and bottom panels of figure 1  we give the trajectory of projected daily deaths under two testing capacity scenarios of 20000 and 100000 tests per day each data series in the two panels corresponds to a different level of social distancing practiced in the post-pause period expressed as a percentage relaxation in the in-pause social distancing norms specifically 0 is no relaxation corresponding to the strictest level of social distancing that was implemented in the in-pause period whereas 100 is full relaxation corresponding to no social distancing as in life in the pre-pause period other percentages reflect different levels of relaxation the city may consider each with a certain r-naught value between the two extremes all newly-imposed social distancing measures come into effect on june 1 the beginning of the post-pause period the testing capacities of 20000 and 100000 tests per day represent the current situation and an order of magnitude bump noting the purple data series in the figure fully relaxing the social distancing measures immediately in the post-pause period and going back to pre-pause practices will lead to another wave peaking in late august regardless of whether the city has 20000 or 100000 per day testing capacity testing capacity will surely have an impact on the size of the next wave under 20000 per day testing capacity full relaxation of social distancing measures will result in 252000 deaths by the end of september note that the labels on the right end of each panel give the total number of deaths by the end of september even with 100000 per day testing capacity if the social distancing norms are fully relaxed in the post-pause period then the next wave in august will be significantly larger than what the city already experienced in april ultimately resulting in 109000 deaths by the end of september social distancing measures somewhere halfway between the pre-and in-pause levels corresponding to the green data series in the figure in this case if the city keeps on performing 20000 tests per day in the post-pause period then the number of deaths by the end of september adds up to 30000 increasing the testing capacity to 100000 per day reduces the number of deaths by the end of september to 27000 but even in this case the daily deaths demonstrate a slightly increasing trend at the end of september being more liberal with the social distancing measures in the post-pause period and relaxing them even more than halfway between the pre-and in-pause levels will be problematic consider relaxing the social distancing measures by 75 corresponding to the red data series in the figure under both testing capacities of 20000 and 100000 per day a second wave picks up at the end of september the testing capacity will affect the magnitude of the wave but the number of deaths by the end of august reaches 52000 even with a testing capacity of 100000 per day in figure 1  full 100 and no 0 relaxation in social distancing practices correspond to life before and after march 22 we emphasize that the interpretation of other levels of social distancing measures requires more care in particular the other levels of social distancing measures correspond to different r-naught values between the two extremes and they should not be interpreted as a suggested level of occupancy in business establishments there is work to be done to convert these social distancing levels into public health policy the discussion in the previous section indicates there are risks if the city quickly relaxes the social distancing norms in the post-pause period a natural question is what testing capacity would likely be sufficient to keep the risk of a second wave at bay while relaxing the social distancing measures to a degree that the economy can start functioning in the top panel of figure 2  we show the tradeoff between the total number of deaths by the end of september and the level of social distancing practiced under different testing capacities the horizontal axis shows the level of social distancing expressed as before as a percentage relaxation in the in-pause social distancing norms thus 0 is no relaxation corresponding to the strictest level of social distancing observed during pause whereas 100 is full relaxation corresponding to the loosest level of social distancing that was in the pre-pause period the vertical axis shows the total number of projected deaths by the end of september each data series corresponds to a different level of testing capacity in the bottom panel of figure 2  we give the same information but zoom in on the more relevant region of social distancing measures in our model all new testing capacity and social distancing norms become effective on june 1 before may 1 we use the actual number of tests performed by the city and extrapolate between early-may and june 1 a good starting point is to consider the case where the city relaxes the social distancing measures halfway between the pre-and in-pause norms corresponding to 50 on the horizontal axis in the figure keeping the social distancing measures any stricter will likely not be useful for reopening the economy we observe that keeping a testing capacity of 20000 per day results in a total of 30000 deaths by the end of september raising the testing capacity to 100000 per day reduces the number of deaths by the end of september to 27000 consider relaxing the in-pause social distancing measures by 75 during the post-pause period even by performing 250000 tests per day the total number of deaths by the end of september can only be kept at 34000 thus if one considers for a moment quickly going back to the pre-pause life then the city should be ramping up its testing capacity dramatically up to 500000 per day even then there will be a price to pay and testing is far from being a perfect substitute for social distancing the analysis in this study puts all new social distancing measures and testing capacities into effect immediately on june 1 in practice the change will be gradual our model provides a tool to investigate how to relax social distancing measures gradually as the city ramps up its testing capacity over time an analysis along these lines will be our next line of attack moreover as discussed in the appendix we have a contact tracing mechanism in our model where close contacts of every positive case are put into isolation in other words our model implicitly assumes that the bottleneck is the testing capacity not the contract tracing capacity we plan to use our model to estimate the number of contact tracers needed to keep up with the increasing testing capacity and new cases the interpretation of the pre-and in-pause social distancing measures are somewhat clear each corresponding to life before and after march 22 relaxing social distancing measures by any percentage corresponds to adjusting r-naught to lie appropriately between the r-naught values of these two extremes it should be noted that it will require work to understand which relaxation in social distancing norms public health policy would achieve what level of r-naught value lastly we believe that the death projections from our model are on the optimistic side because our model assumes the presence of a streamlined tracing mechanism and individuals in certain compartments are willing to isolate themselves infecting others minimally such optimistic behavior of our model should be taken into consideration when interpreting our results the appendix is organized as follows in appendix a we discuss our model at a high level this section avoids any technical details but it is useful for seeing how our model works what compartments it uses and how the different compartments interact with each other in appendix b we provide the full mathematical details of our model in appendix c we elaborate on the parameters of our model and how they are estimated we borrow some of the parameters from the literature and derive others based off of problem primitives we explain how we arrive at the derived model parameters in appendix d we compare the output of our model with the trajectory of the pandemic in the city until early may and demonstrate that our model does a reasonably good job of predicting the trajectory that has been observed so far in our model we capture the two benefits of testing which are isolating the specific individual tested positive and tracing the contacts of the positive individual in particular our model distinguishes the infected individuals who know that they are infected from the infected individuals who do not know whether they are infected once a person is tested positive this person is an infected individual who knows that she is infected such a person minimally infects others moreover considering the individuals who do not know whether they are infected we classify them as symptomatic-isolated asymptomatic-isolated or asymptomatic-nonisolated once an individual is tested positive a certain number of people around this person are classified as asymptomatic-isolated people so these individuals reduce their contact with the general population preventing them from infecting others to some extent our model follows the standard susceptible-infected-recovered modeling paradigm in figure 3  we show the compartments in our model the boxes represent the compartments the arrows represent the possible flows between the compartments the three compartments on the right of the figure capture the individuals who know that they are infected in particular the compartment labeled ki corresponds to the infected individuals who know that they are infected and not yet hospitalized the compartment labeled h captures the infected individuals who are hospitalized the individuals in the latter compartment also know that they are infected the compartment labeled kr captures the recovered individuals who knew that they were infected perhaps optimistically in our model the individuals in all of these three compartments minimally infect others since they are aware that they were infected the nine compartments on the left side of the figure capture the individuals who do not know whether they are infected some of these individuals will in actuality be infected some will be noninfected and some will even have recovered without knowing they had been infected we classify the individuals who do not know whether they are infected along two dimensions in the first dimension any such individual could be symptomatic-isolated asymptomatic-isolated or asymptomatic-nonisolated asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals do not show symptoms of the disease and do not make an effort to reduce their contact asymptomatic-isolated individuals make a conscious effort to reduce their contact mainly because they have been in touch with a person who tested positive symptomatic-isolated individuals show symptoms but do not know whether they are infected their symptoms may be due to other diseases once again perhaps optimistically in our model all symptomatic individuals isolate themselves so we do not have a compartment for symptomatic-nonisolated people symptomatic-isolated and asymptomatic-isolated individuals infect others with a smaller rate when compared with asymptomatic-nonisolated people when stricter social distancing norms are enforced all individuals will reduce their contact with the general population but we follow the assumption that asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals will still maintain a higher contact rate with the rest of the population than asymptomatic-isolated and symptomatic-isolated individuals considering the individuals who do not know whether they are infected we classify them along another dimension in this second dimension an individual who does not know whether she is infected could be infected noninfected or recovered thus considering the nine compartments on the left side of figure 3  the compartment labeled i an  for example captures the infected and asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals who do not know whether they are infected note that these individuals are infected in actuality but they do not know that they are infected and they maintain a high contract rate with the rest of the population being nonisolated when we perform tests on a segment of a population the proportion of positive tests is given by the fraction of the infected individuals in the segment relative to the size of the whole segment for example using the label of a compartment to also denote the number of individuals in the compartment since there are n an  r an  i an asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals if we test t asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals then the number of positive tests is t  i an n an r an i an  so far we indicated two reasons for our model to be optimistic in addition our model assumes that close contacts of every positive case are traced and these close contacts remain in isolation for 14 days or until they are tested negative in other words our model implicitly assumes that the bottleneck is the testing capacity not contact tracing capacity it is important to note that growing the testing capacity in the city beyond a certain level without growing the contact tracing capacity will not be of much benefit so any decision regarding how much to grow the contact tracing capacity should be directly informed by the plans to grow the testing capacity in this section we provide a detailed description of the system dynamics of our model the state of the system at each time period t is described by a vector where the variables i t an denote the states associated with the nine compartments on the left side of figure 3  these nine compartments correspond to individuals whose covid-19 status is unknown the variable d t denotes the number of individuals who die in period t and the variable h t denotes the number of individuals who are hospitalized in period t the variable ki t captures the number of individuals who have been confirmed to have covid-19 and are currently infected in period t the variable kr t captures the number of individuals who have been confirmed to have covid-19 and recovered by period t description of sub-compartments for our state variables we use regular font to denote scalars and bold font to denote vectors we use vector notation when a compartment has multiple sub-compartments representing different subgroups of the population here are the descriptions of the sub-compartments  sub-compartments within the i si compartment the i si compartment has 3 sub-compartments a those who will recover naturally without requiring any hospitalization b those who will require hospitalization and c those who will die without access to a covid-19 diagnostic test thus to denote the total number of individuals in the i si compartment the trick we use here is that when an individual is infected we immediately decide whether this person will recover will be hospitalized or will die we keep the identity of the individual accordingly throughout the simulation  sub-compartments within the i ai compartment the i ai compartment has 2 sub-compartments a those who will never develop covid-19 symptoms and b those who will show covid-19 symptoms but are currently pre-symptomatic thus and we let t ai  i t ai recovered  i t ai show symptom denote the total number of individuals in the i ai compartment  sub-compartments within the i an compartments similar to the i ai compartment the i an compartment has 2 sub-compartments a those who will never develop covid-19 symptoms and b those who will show covid-19 symptoms but are currently pre-symptomatic thus and as before we let t an  i t an recovered  i t an show symptom denote the total number of individuals in the i an compartment  sub-compartments within the h compartment the h compartment consists of two types of individuals a those who will die and b those who will eventually recover thus we have  sub-compartments within the ki compartment the ki compartment consists of two types of individuals a those who will require hospitalization and b those who will recover without visiting a hospital therefore we have that ki t  ki t hospitalized ki t recovered  we assume that the diagnostic test is 100 accurate and the result is obtained instantaneously however when we perform the test we cannot differentiate between unknown infected unknown non-infected and recovered people we can only test people based on their observable characteristics at the beginning of each period we test t si symptomatic-isolated individuals t ai asymptomatic-isolated individuals and t an asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals we assume that the tests are administered at random within each of these populations let  si   ai  and  an denote the fraction of symptomatic isolated asymptomatic isolated and asymptomatic non-isolated individuals respectively who receive diagnostic tests then the above fractions drive the dynamics across compartments which are described below based on the events that can occur in our model in the fraction  si  we assume that the infected symptomatic-isolated individuals from the death sub-compartment are inaccessible for testing our description below is organized by the compartments for each compartment we describe the inflows outflows and the new state at time period t  1  infected symptomatic-isolated compartment i si  as noted earlier the i si compartment has 3 subgroups of individuals a those who will recover naturally without requiring any hospitalization b those who require hospitalization and c those who die without access to a covid-19 diagnostic test thus denotes the total number of individuals across the three

simulation we set   18823  10 8  and starting on march 22 we reduce  by a third to a new value of 62742  10 9  see section c for more details -infected asymptomatic-nonisolated i an  individuals who become symptomatic the total inflow of such individuals is given by where inftosymptime represents the average number of days until an infected person displays symptoms in our model we set inftosymptime to be 5 days see section c for more details -infected asymptomatic-isolated i ai  individuals who become symptomatic using a similar logic as above the total amount of such inflow is given by we assume that a fraction hospoutofsympfrac currently set at 20 of the total inflow to the i si compartment will require hospitalization and a fraction deathoutofsympfrac 2 will die without being tested the remaining 1  hospoutofsympfrac  deathoutofsympfrac  78 will recover at home justifications for these fractions are given in section c outflow there are four destinations for the outflow from the i si compartment -individuals in the recovered sub-compartment i t si recovered will move to the recovered asymptomatic-nonisolated r an  compartment at the rate of 1symptorecoverytime where symptorecoverytime represents the average time for a symptomatic individual to recover from the disease currently symptorecoverytime is set at 14 days -individuals in the hospitalized sub-compartment i t si hospitalized will move to the h compartment at the rate of 1symptohosptime where symptohosptime 5 days represents the average number of days from symptom onset until hospitalization -individuals in the death sub-compartment i t si death will move to the death compartment d at the rate of 1symptodeathtime where symptodeathtime 14 days denotes the average time from symptoms onset to death -finally a fraction  si in every sub-compartment will move to the known infected ki compartment due to testing update equations let recoveroutofsympfrac

infected population as compared to the non-infected and recovered populations we set likofbeinginfected at 55 we assume that a fraction symptomfrac currently set at 50 of the total inflow to the i ai

the recovered sub-compartment i t ai recovered will move to the r an compartment at the rate of 1asymptorecoverytime the parameter asymptorecoverytime represents the average time that an asymptomatic

simulation we set  h  282341  10 8  and starting on march 22 we reduce  h by a third to a new value of 941135  10 9  see section c for more details we assume that a fraction symptomfrac currently set

sub-compartments with ki t  ki t hospitalized h t recovered and we have the following dynamics inflow there are three sources of inflow the infected individuals in i si  i ai  and i an compartments who are tested we assume that individuals from the i si hospitalized subcompartment flow into the ki t hospitalized sub-compartment and that individuals from the i si recovered sub-compartment flow

80 will recover naturally outflow individuals who require hospitalization move to the h compartment at the rate of 1inftohosptime where inftohosptime represents the average time until an infected

update equations in this section we discuss how we obtain the estimates for different model parameters we assume an incubation period of 5 days 8  after an individual develops symptoms we assume it takes another 5 days for the individual to become hospitalized 16  specifically we set inftosymptime  inftohosptime  symptohosptime  5 we set the recovery time for symptomatic individuals to be 14 days in our model we do not differentiate between recovery at home versus at the hospital and set symptorecoverytime  hosptorecoverytime  14 we set the time for a symptomatic individual to die to be 14 days similar to the recovery time we do not differentiate between deaths at home versus at the hospital and set both symptodeathtime  hosptodeathtime  14 8  we assume that individuals who self-isolate after being identified as a close-contact or develop symptoms from a non-covid-19 illness spend an average of 10 days reducing their contact with others while the who recommends a quarantine period of 14 days the cdc gives a less stringent recommendation of 10 days 2  we set selfquartime  asymptorecoverytime  10 in our model non-infected and recovered individuals develop symptoms due to non-covid-19 diseases at a rate of noncovidsymptrate  1 1200  this rate is based on the assumption that 10 of the population is infected over the course of 4 months this is roughly estimated using the flu symptom rate in past years as reported by the cdc 3  we set n  8 550 971 the population of nyc in 2020 as projected by the city 11  we also assume that 28 000 individuals corresponding to roughly 3 of the population initially has symptoms due to the seasonal flu this is calculated assuming that flu symptoms last for an average of 4 days we use sympoutofinffrac to denote the fraction of covid-19 infected individuals who develop symptoms numerous reports have given different estimates for this fraction from 82 on the diamond princess cruise ship 7 to roughly 40 on the uss theodore roosevelt 13  we set sympoutofinffrac  50 the parameter hospoutofsympfrac denotes the fraction of symptomatic individuals who need hospitalization we set this value to be 20 the parameter deathoutofhospfrac denotes the fraction of hospitalized individuals who die we set this value to be 333 both of these values are roughly estimated using historical hospitalization and death numbers as reported by new york city 10  finally we assume that some portion of the infected population die at home without hospitalization we denote this portion as deathoutofinffrac and set it to 2 we estimate this value using the number of probable deaths as reported by the city the basic reproductive number r 0  captures the average number of new infections produced by each infected individual there are numerous recent studies estimating the value of r 0 for covid-19 these estimates vary widely from anywhere between 22 6 and 57 15  furthermore it is possible that r 0 varies across different countries and cities due to climate environmental and sociological differences as a result we set r 0  338 according to a tuning procedure using historical hospitalization and death statistics as reported by new york city we briefly discuss the details of this procedure in section d the rate of new infections is controlled by  the contact rate between infected and non-infected populations in a standard compartmentalized model the number of new infections during any time period is captured by in our model we have a similar term for every pair of infected and non-infected compartments we employ two different contact rates  h and   so we differentiate their usage according to whether we are considering isolating or non-isolating compartments we set  h  r 0 n symptorecoverytime and use this as the contact rate between infected and non-infected compartments that are both non-isolating when at least one of the compartments is isolating or symptomatic we assume that contact between these populations is reduced by one third and use the contact rate   2 3  r 0 n symptorecoverytime  beginning on march 22 we reduce both  h and  by a factor of 13 this reduction is due to social distancing measures associated with the start of ny pause we set this reduction to 13 according to a report by safegraph which used smartphone location data to estimate the reduction in foot traffic due to social distancing measures across the united states their study shows that starting march 22 foot traffic in the new york region is at roughly one third of the activity level recorded in previous years over the same time period 14  the parameter contactperposcase denotes the average number of close contacts that are identified via tracing for each covid-19 positive individual we assume that close contacts are always identified from within the non-isolating population the parameter likofbeinginfected is a multiplier that captures how much more likely an infected individual will be identified as a close contact as compared to a non-infected individual specifically which can be shown to be equal to  thus we need estimates for the proportion of infected versus non-infected individuals within the non-isolating population as well as the proportion of infected versus non-infected individuals among people identified as close contacts unfortunately to the best of our knowledge there are no studies that can be used to estimate these proportions for new york city therefore we use data reported for wuhan the capital of hubei province in china to estimate these proportions wuhan has a population of approximately 11 million people and is comparable in size to new york city it experienced a surge of covid-19 cases similar to that of new york city to estimate contactperposcase and the proportion of infected and non-infected individuals within the close-contact group we use the results of 1  a comprehensive study on contact tracing this study reports the results of contact tracing in shenzhen china but the index cases are mostly travelers arriving from hubei province in this study the authors identified 1286 close contacts based on 292 covid-positive cases this suggests an average close contact group size of 1286292  44 for each covid-positive individual identified according to recent news articles the state of massachusetts which has recently initiated a comprehensive contact-tracing effort found that the average close contact group size is two 9  therefore we set the parameter contactperposcase to 4 in our model of the 1286 close contacts 98 tested positive thus we estimated the proportion of the infected to non-infected within the close contact group to be p infectedclose-contactp non-infectedclose-contact  981188  0082 to estimate p infectedp non-infected the proportion of infected to non-infected in the general non-isolating population we used the following approach according to a recent study in wuhan the probability of death after developing symptoms was 14 5  using this estimate and the number of deaths in wuhan which is reported as 4512 by the johns hopkins coronavirus resource center 4 we can estimate the total number of infected individuals in wuhan to be 322286 this estimates the total number of infected individuals over the entire course of the pandemic in wuhan in order to estimate the total number of infected individuals at some random time between mid-january and mid-february we divide this by two and use 161143 as the average number of infected individuals at a given time this approximation implicitly assumes a linear build-up of new covid-positive cases which is not true for infection spread within a population but nevertheless serves as a reasonable rough estimate then using 11000000 for the population of wuhan we estimate p infectedp non-infected to be 161 14311 000 000  161 143  0015 finally using our estimates for the infected to non-infected proportion within the close-contacts and within the general non-isolating population we estimated the ratio of these two proportions to be 00820015  547 and set likofbeinginfected to 55 we manually calbirated two parameters of the model to roughly match its output to the observed trajectory of the pandemic up until april 15 these two parameters are the r 0 value and the initial number of infected asymptomatic-nonisolated individuals on march 2 we ended up with an r 0 value of 338 and an initial infected asymptomatic-nonisolated population of about 10000 these starting parameters are tuned based on hospitalization death and test data up to april 15 we use testing data from nys health department 12  we assume that the tests are conducted daily on people in the order of symptomatic isolated and finally non-isolated people the plots in figure 4 show the epidemic trajectory as predicted by our model in particular figure 4a shows the total number of currently hospitalized symptomatic infected asymptomatic infected and known infected people on each day as projected by the model in figure 4b  we compare the cumulative number of deaths predicted by our model with the actual cumulative number of deaths the data set from nyc health includes confirmed and probable deaths due to covid-19 a death is classified as probable if the decedent was a new york city resident who had no known positive laboratory test for covid-19 but the death certificate lists as a cause of death covid-19 or equivalent we show both confirmed deaths and probable deaths in our plots in figure 4c  we plot the actual daily number of tests conducted and positive cases found in the city we use the same historical testing capacity in our model we set the testing capacity to 20000 in the city for future projections in this plot note that the daily number of positive tests in our model fluctuates because we use the actual number of tests performed in the city until early may as the number of tests performed in our model however the number of positive cases identified in our model emerges from the internal behavior of our model the fit between the model and the actual trajectory in terms of positive cases is reasonably good figure 4d shows the daily hospitalizations reported by nyc health against the number of hospitalizations projected by our model figure 4e plots the daily deaths projected by our model against the daily deaths reported by nyc health including probable deaths   editorial covid-19 special collection sunanda ray c   it is a well-known story disease epidemics by their nature sweep through countries exposing underlying weaknesses and vulnerabilities and in the process eventually revealing inequalities in access to healthcare and means of protection our challenge in african countries with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is how to change these threats into opportunities so that we could be better prepared to manage our response to this pandemic and also to prepare for the next and possibly worse infectious disease pandemic a colleague with experience from the 20142015 ebola epidemic in west africa advised us to make the most of the calm before the storm the period between the early cases and widespread community transmission to get health staff informed and skilled to run drills and practical training to organise health facilities to improve patient flow to explore strategic approaches that describe clear roles tasks and communications and to develop ways of supporting each other when things get worse johnson o 2020 personal communication 04 april 2020 the epidemic has evolved from those who could afford to travel and brought the infection from distant lands to local transmission through social work and other networks it will initially spread through urban areas and to areas of high population density and will impact the poor and less privileged the most the purpose of publishing special reports in the african journal of primary health care and family medicine is to share examples of preparedness and lessons already learnt from the covid-19 pandemic we would like to know how we can become better in coping with the crisis having stopped to take a breath how can we re-frame the future so that it is more compassionate more respectful of diversity and inclusive of all sectors of societies we need to share ideas on how to maintain critical health services during this emerging crisis especially in areas where there is lockdown to avoid longer term consequences primary care services play an important role in this regard and must be part of the strategic emergency response we can learn from previous epidemics in african countries the decrease in utilisation of healthcare services during the 20142015 ebola outbreak in sierra leone was estimated to cause 2800 excess deaths from malaria human immunodeficiency virus hiv and tuberculosis tb nearly three quarters as many as the direct ebola deaths in the country declines in utilisation of family planning antenatal care facility delivery and postnatal care services were estimated to translate to 3600 additional maternal neonatal and stillbirth deaths mandatory curfews border closures disruption of transport and fear of exposure to infection led to a decline in the numbers of people seeking healthcare clinic closures and interruption of routine health services such as hiv and tb treatment childhood vaccinations and maternity care had long-term consequences on the health of communities12 although we tend to think of cholera in terms of outbreaks it is endemic in 47 countries of sub-saharan africa ssa between 2000 and 2015 83 of 63 658 deaths from cholera reported to the world health organization occurred in ssa3 mapping of incidence of cases during spikes in incidence outbreaks allows for identification of hotspots areas of high-risk populations which could be targeted for intensive interventions to control outbreaks and prevent further transmission34 the approach to hotspots could be used in covid-19 outbreak control also and is underway in south africa at present using community health workers to screen people in households for symptoms an intervention common to both diseases is the promotion of handwashing therefore ensuring that soap and water are provided to communities is essential the second best strategy for those who are unable to get to a facility to wash their hands is that hand sanitiser with at least 60 alcohol also needs to be provided the most vulnerable to both diseases are those who live in overcrowded accommodation sharing toilets with large numbers during cholera outbreaks in zambia and zimbabwe donations of soap and water supplies were often provided by civil society organisations religious institutions and non-governmental organisations ngos along with health education on the importance of handwashing engagement of such organisations is essential for covid-19 also during the response to the devastation caused by cyclone idai civil society and community organisations coordinated the response in an efficient and timely manner they provided transport collected materials needed identified those who needed support the most and distributed food packages medications and equipment in high-income countries volunteer support for health staff has been notable including providing emotional and material support for critical care workers a targeted hotspot approach may work as an alternative to total lockdown once community transmission has become established but relies on very good information systems linking laboratories with action groups and rapid response teams transparency of data on case-finding and contact tracing when vaccinations became available for cholera identifying hotspots was crucial as a way of targeting areas of greatest ability to benefit4 inevitably there will not be sufficient vaccine supplies for covid-19 when they are cleared for general use targeting hotspots will ensure that covid-19 vaccines are used for the most vulnerable and those with best ability to benefit rather than general dissemination this is a pandemic that has been unfolding rapidly with the internet buzzing with new information sharing protocols guidelines research articles ideas and examples as well as some fake news we can learn from the experiences of those who faced these challenges before us diaspora doctors in britain and the united states of america are sharing their workplace experiences in critical care with their counterparts in district hospitals in zimbabwe non-medical journals have carried stories about whether giving oxygen only is as good as putting patients on ventilators some of us have learnt for the first time about proning and the benefits of this for patients in respiratory distress the preoccupation with critical care has been a natural progression in understanding why the aim of prevention is to keep total numbers down so that we have fewer seriously sick patients in hospitals needing critical care 5 of those infected otherwise we would be fine with having a mild infection with a few days of illness sadly about 1  4 of those who get this infection will die from it these will not all be elderly or those with comorbidities lockdown is easier for people who live in houses with big gardens it is harder for those who live in crowded homes sharing their living spaces and toilets with others if they are not at work or at the shops they will be sitting outside rarely alone there has been frustration with people who seem to ignore the calls to stay at home and for social distancing as though they do not appreciate the seriousness of this disease the sad truth is that for many in our communities they know that if they or their family members get seriously ill they will die even before covid-19 going into hospital with a serious problem getting critical care was out of reach and unaffordable some have accessed funding for medications from family members abroad through remittances the majority do the best they can so covid-19 is no different for them they need to earn money through vending or small jobs and then to join the queue to buy basics for the day to feed the family they are very aware that they are more likely to die of high blood pressure or diabetes than covid-19 some feel they are more likely to die of hunger these needs are much more real to them than talk about ventilators and oxygen concentrators most governments do not pay social benefits or provide food parcels unless campaigning for an election most governments do not consult communities on how they would like to respond to crises like covid-19 there are stories of initiatives and innovations that groups all over africa are exploring in how to transform this crisis into something radical sustainable and will endure we must share them and learn from them  coronavirus optimization algorithm a bioinspired metaheuristic based on the covid-19 propagation model f martnez-lvarez g asencio-corts j torres f d gutirrez-avils l melgar-garca r prez-chacn c rubio-escudero j riquelme c a troncoso  a novel bioinspired metaheuristic is proposed in this work simulating how the coronavirus spreads and infects healthy people from an initial individual the patient zero the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates creating new populations of infected people every individual can either die or infect and afterwards be sent to the recovered population relevant terms such as re-infection probability super-spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity the coronavirus optimization algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies first the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics  corresponding author fmaralvupoes 1 arxiv200313633v2 csai 16 apr 2020 preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values second the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations without setting this value either infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations when considering social isolation measures and the high number recovered and dead people the number of infected people starts decreasing in subsequent iterations furthermore a parallel multi-virus version is proposed in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations finally the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase as application case the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed showing quite remarkable performance  the coronavirus covid-19 is a new respiratory virus firstly discovered in humans in december 2019 that has spread worldwide having been reported more than 1 million infected people so far much remains unknown about the virus including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections and whether they can transmit the virus the precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know bioinspired models typically mimic behaviors from the nature and are known for their successful application in hybrid approaches to find parameters in machine learning model optimization viruses can infect people and these people can either die infect other people or simply get recovered after the disease vaccines and the immune defense system typically fight the disease and help to mitigate their effects while an individual is still infected this behavior is typically modeled by an sir model consisting of three kind of individuals s for the number of susceptible i for the number of infectious and r for the number of recovered metaheuristics must deal with huge search spaces even infinite for the continuous cases and must find suboptimal solutions in reasonable execution times the rapid prop-agation of the coronavirus along with its ability of infecting most of the countries in the world impressively fast has inspired the novel metaheuristic proposed in this work named coronavirus optimization algorithm cvoa a parallel version is also proposed in order to spread different coronavirus strains and achieve better results in less iterations the main cvoa advantages regarding other similar approaches can be summarized as follows 1 coronavirus statistics are known by the scientific community in this sense the rate of infection the mortality rate or the re-infection probability are already known that is cvoa is parametrized with actual values for rates and probabilities preventing the user to perform an additional study on the most suitable setup configuration 2 cvoa can stop the solutions exploration after several iterations with no need to be configured that is the number of infected people increases during the first iterations however after a certain number of iterations the number of infected people starts decreasing until reaching a void infected set of individuals 3 the coronavirus high spreading rate is useful for exploring promising regions more thoroughly intensification while the use of parallel strains ensures that all regions of the search space are evenly explored diversification 4  another relevant contribution of this work is the proposal of a new codification discrete and of dynamic length specifically designed for combining long short-term memory networks lstm with cvoa or any other metaheuristic as for the limitations of the current approach there is mainly one since there is no vaccine currently it has not been included in the procedure to reduce the number of individuals candidates to be infected this fact involves an exponential increase of the infected population in the first iterations and therefore an exponential increase of the execution time for such iterations this fact however is partially solved with the social isolation measures that simulate individuals that cannot be infected at a particular iteration a study case is included in this work to discuss the cvoa performance cvoa has been used to find the optimal values for the hyperparameters of a lstm architecture 17  which is widely used model for artificial recurrent neural network rnn in the field of deep learning 8  data from the spanish electricity consumption have been used to validate the accuracy the results achieved verge on 045 substantially outperforming other well-established methods such as random forest gradient-boost trees linear regression or deep learning optimized with other metaheuristics the code developed in phyton with a discrete codification is available in the supplementary material along with an academic version in java for a binary codification finally it is acknowledged the need of further study on the performance of wellknown functions 16  however given the relevance of coronavirus is acquiring throughout the world declared as pandemic by the world health organization and the remarkable results achieved when combined with deep learning it was wanted to share this work hoping it inspires future research in this direction the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses related and recent works the methodology proposed is introduced in section 3 section 4 proposes a discrete codification to hybridize deep learning models with cvoa and provides some illustrative cases a preliminary analysis on how populations are created and evolved over time is discussed in section 5 the results achieved are reported and discussed in section 6 finally the conclusions drawn and future work suggestions are included in section 7 there are many bioinspired metaheuristics to solve optimization problems although cvoa has been conceived to optimize any kind of problems this section focuses on optimization algorithms applied to hybridize deep learning models it is hard to find consensus among the researchers on which method should be applied to which problem and for this reason many optimization methods have been proposed during the last decade to improve deep learning models generally the criterion for selecting a method is its associated performance from a wide variety of perspectives low computation cost accuracy or even implementation difficulty can be accepted as one of these criteria the virus optimization algorithm voa was proposed by liang and cuevas-jurez in 2016 18 and later improved in 19  however as many other metaheuristics the results of its application are highly dependent on its initial configuration additionally it simulates generic viruses without adding individualized properties for particular viruses the results achieved indicate that its usefulness is beyond doubt one of the most extended metaheuristics used to improve deep learning parameters is genetic algorithms ga hence a lstm network optimized with ga can be found in 6  to evaluate the proposed hybrid approach the daily korea stock price index data were used outperforming the benchmark model in 2019 a network traffic prediction model based on lstm and ga was proposed in 5  the results were compared to pure lstm and arima reporting higher accuracy multi-agents systems have also been applied to optimize deep learning models the use of particle swarm optimization pso can be found in 20  the authors proposed a model based on kernel principal component analysis and back propagation neural network with pso for midterm power load forecasting the hybridization of deep learning models with pso was also explored in 13 but this time the authors applied the methodology with image classification purposes ants colony optimization aco models have also been used to hybridize deep learning thus desell et al 9 proposed an evolving deep recurrent neural networks using aco applied to the challenging task of predicting general aviation flight data the work in 12 introduced a method based on aco to optimize a lstm recurrent neural networks again the field of application was flight data records obtained from an airline containing flights that suffered from excessive vibration some papers exploring the cuckoo search cs properties have been published recently as well in 23  cs was used to find suitable heuristics for adjusting the hyper-parameters of another lstm network the authors claimed an accuracy superior to 96 for all the datasets examined nawi et al 22 proposed the use of cs to improve the training of rnn in order to achieve fast convergence and high accuracy results obtained outperformed those than other metaheuristics the use of the artificial bee colony abc optimization algorithm applied to lstm can also be found in the literature hence and optimized lstm with abc to forecast the bitcoin price was introduced in 26  the combination of abc and rnn was also proposed in 3 for traffic volume forecasting this time the results were compared to standard backpropagation models from the analysis of these works it can be concluded that there is an increasing interest in using metaheuristics in lstm models however not as many works as for artificial neural networks can be found in the literature and none of them based on a virus propagation model these two facts among others justify the application of cvoa to optimize lstm models this section introduces the cvoa methodology thus section 31 describes the steps for a single strain section 32 introduces the modifications added to use cvoa as a parallel version section 33 suggests how parameters must be set section 34 shows the cvoa pseudo codes and comments them step 1 generation of the initial population the initial population consists of one individual the so-called patient-zero p z as in the coronavirus epidemic it identifies the first human being infected step 2 disease propagation depending on the individual several cases are evaluated 1 some of the infected individuals die they die according to the coronavirus death rate p die such individuals can no longer infect new individuals 2 the individuals surviving the coronavirus will infect new individuals intensification two types of spreading are considered according to a given probability p su p ersp reader  ordinary spreaders infected individuals will infect new ones according to the coronavirus spreading rate sp readin g rat e  super-spreaders infected individuals will infect new ones according to the coronavirus superspreading rate su p ersp readin g rat e 3 there is another consideration since it is needed to ensure diversification both ordinary and super-spreaders individuals can travel and explore solutions quite dissimilar therefore individuals have a probability of traveling p t rav el thus allowing to propagate the disease to solutions that may be quite different t rav eler rat e in case of not being traveler new solutions will change according to an ordin ary rat e note that one individual can be both superspreader and traveler step 3 updating populations three populations are maintained and updated for each generation 1 dead population if any individual dies it is added to this population and can never be used again 2 recovered population after each iteration infected individuals after spreading the coronavirus according to the previous step are sent to the recovered population it is known that there is a reinfection probability hence an individual belonging to this population could be re-infected at any iteration provided that it meets the reinfection criterion p rein f ect ion  another situation must be considered since individuals can be isolated simulating they are implementing the social distancing measures for the sake of simplicity it is considered that an isolated individual is sent to the recovered population as well when meeting an isolation probability p isolat ion  iteration according the procedure described in the previous steps it is possible that repeated new infected individuals are created at each iteration and consequently it is recommended to remove such repeated individuals from this population before the next iteration starts running  it must be noted that it is very simple to use cvoa in a multi-virus version since it can be implemented as a population-based algorithm when considering the pandemic as a set of intelligent agents each of them evolving in parallel in contrast to trajectory-based metaheuristics population-based focuses on the diversification in the search space for this case a new variable must be defined strains which will determine the number of strains that will be launched in parallel each strain could simulate different regions in other words strains can be differently configured so that each of them intensifies with their own rates several considerations must be done for this case 1 every strain is run independently following the steps in the previous section a wise strategy should be followed to generate p zs for each strain for instance it is suggested the generation of orthogonal p zs or with high hamming distances that way a wider search space could be covered enhancing diversification 3 the interaction between the different strains is done by means of dead and recovered populations which must be shared by all the strains operations over these populations must be handled as concurrent updates 11  4  new infected populations on the contrary are different for each strain and no concurrent operations are required 5 this version may help to simulate different rates for different strains that way if there is any initial information about the search space some strains could be more focused on diversification and some others on intensification depending on the hardware resources and how busy they are every strain may evolve at different speeds this situation should not pose any problems since it is known that the pandemic evolves at different rates and starts at different time stamps depending on region of the world last another application can be found for this parallel version cvoa emulates an sir model and consequently any other global pandemic could be modeled by using the known rates of for instance the flu of 1918 or 1957 another coronavirus sars or mers hiv or ebola hypothetically parallel pandemics could be run with different rates since cvoa simulates the coronavirus disease propagation most of the rates propagation re-infection or mortality are already known this fact prevents the research from wasting time in selecting values for such rates and turns the cvoa into metaheuristic quite easy to execute however it must be noted that the current rates are not definitive yet and it is expected they will vary over time as the pandemic evolves maybe these values will not be stable until 2021 or even 2022 the suggested values have been retrieved from the world health organization 1 and are discussed below 1 p die an infected individual can die with a given probability currently this rate is set as almost 5 by the scientific community therefore p die  005 it is the probability that an individual spread the disease to a greater number of healthy individuals it is known that this situation affects to a 10 of the population therefore p su p ersp reader  01 after this condition is validated two situations can be found  ordin ary rat e if the infected individual is not a super-spreader then the infection rate also known as reproductive number r 0  is 25 it is suggested that this rate varies from 0 to 5  su p ersp reader rat e if the infected individual turns out to be super-spreader then heshe infects up to 15 healthy individuals on average it is suggested that this rate varies from 6 to 15 the current reported rate is 14 therefore p rein f ect ion  014 4 p isolat ion  this value is uncertain because countries are taking different measures for social isolation this parameter helps to reduce the exponential growth of the infected population after each iteration therefore a high value must be assigned to this probability it is suggested that p isolat ion  05 any place in the world and can infect healthy individuals it is known that almost a 10 of the population travel during a week simulated time for every iteration so p t rav el  01 6  p an dem ic du rat ion  this parameter simulates the duration of the pandemic since the estimated recovering time is one week each iteration simulates one week currently this data is unknown so this number can be adjusted to the size of the problem it is suggested that p an dem ic du rat ion  30 7  strains this parameter should be adjusted according to the size of the problem and the hardware availability and it is difficult to suggest a value suitable for all situations but a tentative initial value could be five in an attempt to simulate one different strain per continent therefore strains  5 another important decision that must be made is how to initialize every p z associated with the strains when just one strain is considered p z is suggested to be randomly initialized however with strains  1 the user should search for orthogonal p zs and to uniformly distribute them in the search space this strategy should help to cover bigger search spaces in less iterations and to evaluate individuals with maximal distances this section provides the pseudo code of the most relevant functions for the cvoa along with some comments to better understand them this is the main function and its pseudo code can be found in algorithm 1 once the new population is formed qll individuals are evaluated and if any of them outperforms the best current one the latter is updated dead  dieinfectedpopulation 12 for all i  inf ectedp opulation do 13 aux  infectirecovereddead 14 if notnullaux then 15 newinfectedpopulation

22 recovered  infectedpopulation 23 clearinfectedpopulation 24 infectedpopulation  newinfectedpopulation  given an infected individual this function generates new infected individuals according to the spreading and traveling rates this function also controls that the new infected individuals are not already in the dead list in such case this new infection is ignored or in the recovered list in such case the p rein f ect ion is applied to determine whether the individual is re-infected or if it remains in the recovered list additionally it considers that the new potential infected individual might be isolated which is controlled by p isolat ion  although the use of an extra list could be implemented it has been decided to treat these individuals as recovered therefore if an isolated individual is attempted to be infected it is added to the recovered list the effective generation of the new infected individuals must be carried in the function replicate whose pseudo code is not provided because it depends on the codification and the nature of the problem to be optimized this function must return a set of new infected individuals according to the aforementioned rates specific information on how this codification and replication is done for lstm models the pseudo code for the described procedure can be found in algorithm 3  this is an auxiliary function used to find the best fitness in a list of infected individuals its peudo code is shown in algorithm 5 if fitnessi  bestfitness then 6 bestfitness  fitnessi  the pz as it has been described previously is the individual of the first iteration in the cvoa algorithm following the hybridization proposed a random individual is created considering the codification defined above in first place a random value for the learning rate of the pz is generated specifically a number between 0 and 5 is generated randomly in a uniform distribution such limits are indicated in figure 1  according to the possible encoded values of the learning rate element the same process is carried out to produce a random value for the dropout element in such case a random number between 0 and 8 is generated in second place a random number of layers is generated for the element l of p z such number of layers is a random number between 2 and 11 note that the first layer is reserved for the input layer of the neural network as it has been discussed before in last place for each one of the l layers a random number of units is generated between 0 and 11 covering the possible encoded values for the number of units previously defined see figure 1  the infection procedure described here corresponds to the functionality of replicate introduced in the line 4 of the algorithm 3 this procedure takes an individual as input and returns an infected individual according to the following procedure the first step is to determine the element l of the infected individual that will be mutated the probability of such mutation occurs has been set to 1 3 so that every element has the same probability to mutate if the mutation occurs then the element l of the individual is modified according to the process described in section 44 if the element l the number of layers of the network changes then the elements encoding the different layers within the individual layer 1  layer l must be resized accordingly such resizing process is explained in section 43 the second step is to determine how many elements of the individual will be infected if the t rav eler rat e  0 then the number of infected elements is generated randomly from 0 to the length of the individual excluding the element l else the t rav eler rat e indicates itself the number of infected elements  when an individual is infected at the position of the element l the list of elements that encodes the number of units per layer layer 1  layer l must be resized accordingly in the case that the new number of layers after the infection is lower than its previous value then the last leftover elements are removed for instance if the initial individual is  the process carried out to change the value of a specific element of an individual is described in this section first a signed change amount c  2 1 1 2 is randomly determined using the following criteria a random real number p between 0 and 1 is generated using a uniform distribution if p  025 then the change amount will be c  2 else if p  05 then the change amount will be c  1 else if p  075 then the change amount will be c  1 else the change amount will be c  2 once the amount of change is determined the new value for the infected element is computed if its previous value is v  then the new value after the single position mutation will be v  v  c if the new value v exceeds the limits defined for the individual codification such value is set to the maximum or minimum allowed value accordingly this section provides an overview on how populations evolve over time and how the search space is explored to reach the optimum value for a given fitness function to conduct this experimentation a simple binary codification has been used the fitness function was f x  x  15 2 because to goal of this section is to evaluate the growth of the new infected populations and not to the find challenging optimum values this function reaches the minimum value at x  15 that is f 15  0 for this reason individuals with 10 20 30 40 and 50 bits have been tested tables 1-5 summarize the results achieved for each of these lengths respectively every experiment has been launched 50 times determining that on average the optimum value was found for 11 12 14 15 and 17 iterations respectively each table shows the results of an execution meeting this criterion table 6 summarizes the amount of search space explored on average before finding the optimum value for a small space of 2 10  1024 possible values the optimum one is reached after exploring 156250 valid solutions however this value acutely decreases as  this section reports the results achieved by hybridizing a deep learning model with cvoa gorithm section 62 describes the dataset used section 63 discusses the results achieved and includes some comparative methods the forecasting of future values fascinates the human being to be able to understand how certain variables evolve over time has many benefits in many fields electricity demand forecasting is not an exception since there is a real need for planning the amount to be generated or in some countries to be bought the use of machine learning to forecast such time series has been intensive during the last years 21  but with the development of deep learning models and in particular of lstm much research is being conducted in this application field 2  the time series considered in this study is related to the electricity consumption in spain from january 2007 to june 2016 the same as used in 24  it is a time series composed of 9 years and 6 months with a 10-minute sampling frequency resulting in 497832 measures as in the original paper the prediction horizon is 24 that is this is a multi-step strategy with h  24 the size of samples used for the prediction of these 24 values is 168 furthermore the dataset was split into 70 for the training set and 30 for the test set and in addition a 30 of the training set has also been selected for the validation set in order to find the optimal parameters the training set covers the period from january  this section reports the results obtained by hybridizing lstm with cvoa by means of the codification proposed in section 4 to forecast the spanish electricity dataset described in section 62 linear regression lr decision tree dt gradient-boosted trees gbt and random forest rf models have been used with a parametrization setups according to those studied in 15 14  a deep neural network optimized with a grid search dnn-gs according to 24 has also been applied another deep neural network but optimized with random search dnn-rs and smoothed with a low-pass filter dnn-rs-lp 25  has also been applied furthermore cvoa has been combined with dnn dnn-cvoa using the same codification as in lstm these results along with those of lstm and combinations with gs rs rs-lp and cvoa are summarized in table 7  expressed in terms of the mean absolute percentage error mape it can be observed that lstm-cvoa outperforms all evaluated methods which have showed particularly remarkable performance for this real-world dataset additionally dnn-cvoa outperforms all other dnn configurations which confirms the superiority of cvoa with reference to gs rs and rs-lp another relevant consideration that must be taken into account is that the compared methods generated 24 independent models each of them for every value forming h so it would expected that lstm-cvoa performance increases if independent models are generated for each of the values in h these results have been achieved with the

finally figure 4 depicts the first five predicted days versus their actual values expressed in watts this work has introduced a novel bioinspired metaheuristic based on the coronavirus behavior on the one hand cvoa has two major advantages first its highly relation to the coronavirus spreading model prevents the authors to make any decision about the inputs values second it ends after a certain number of iterations due to the exchange of individuals between healthy and deadrecovered lists additionally a novel discrete additional experimentation must be conducted in order to assess its performance on standard f functions and find out the search space shapes in which it can be more effective some actions must be taken to reduce the size of the infected population after several iterations that grows exponentially in this sense a vaccine must be implemented this case would involve adding to the recovered list at a given v accin e rat e healthy individuals this rate will remain unknown until a vaccine is developed another suggested research line is using dynamic rates for instance the observation of the preliminary effects of the social isolation measures in countries like china italy or spain suggests that the in f ect rat e could be simulated as a poisson process but more time and country recoveries is required to confirm this trend finally for the multi-step forecasting problem analyzed it would be desirable to generate independent models for each of the values that form the prediction horizon h along with this paper an academic version in java for a

kristian lum patrick ball  we fit a bayesian model to data on the number of deaths attributable to covid-19 with the goal of estimating the number of infected individuals our model links an underlying susceptible infectious removed sir model of disease dynamics to observed deaths via a time-to-death distribution informed by previous studies this allows us to actually fit a statistical model to the data unlike many epidemiological studies in which the sir model parameters are simply calibrated to obtain outputs that look similar to the real data the main outputs of our model are estimates of the number of infections currently as well as forecasts of the number of infections and deaths under various scenarios for the effectiveness of social distancing measures all of our outputs have attached bayesian credible intervals an important conclusion is that the confirmed case counts greatly underestimate the total number of infected individuals  the total number of people infected with the sars-cov-2 virus is unknown in the united states there is a severe shortage of sars-cov-2 tests and so even people in hospital with obvious symptoms of covid-19 are rarely tested furthermore it is by now well-understood that many perhaps most people infected with sars-cov-2 have mild or no symptoms the combination of these factors means that only a small fraction of the sars-cov-2 cases are ever confirmed by a positive test because the widely-reported case counts are based only on the number of positive tests official case counts cannot possibly reflect the true number of people infected with the sars-cov-2 virus indeed the confirmed case counts may more accurately represent the distribution of tests than the prevalence of infections the true number of sars-cov-2 positive individuals is necessarily much higher than the reported counts but how much higher understanding the total size of the infected population is important for planning policy and public communication because it determines how many people will need critical care and how many are at risk of death knowledge of the true number of affected individuals could also help with public adoption of containment or mitigation measures which may seem an overreaction when the only publicly available numbers make it appear that the disease affects relatively few it is therefore important for healthcare planning economic policy and transparency to estimate the population prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection this analysis models the spread of sars-cov-2 infection in the united states based on data on the number of covid-19 attributable deaths the infection fatality rate reported by previous studies and the time-to-death reported by previous studies we chose this approach because while we believe the case count data from which epidemiological models would normally be built to be highly unreliable we expect the data on the number of deaths from covid-19 to be reasonably close to the truth our approach is founded on the belief that vast majority of covid-19-related deaths are recorded as such if this is not true the model would likely underestimate the true prevalence of the disease the bayesian model we present here is a version of the standard susceptible-infectious-removed sir model however rather than calibrating the parameters of the sir model to obtain a reasonably close match to the observed deaths we develop an explicit probabilistic model linking the dynamics of new infections in the sir model to observed deaths this allows us to give estimates of uncertainty in parameters such as the number of infected individuals the sampling model for the daily number of deaths uses a model of disease progression conditional on the past time series of new infections the parameters defining the disease progression model are fixed and based on existing clinical data the underlying process generating the time series of new infections is the sir model the parameters of which are estimated by markov chain monte carlo mcmc we place informative priors on these parameters using existing estimates of the r 0 and the infectious period of sars-cov-2 using this model we are able to work backwards from the time series of observed deaths to estimates of the standard epidemic curves in a principled way this fully model-based approach allows us to incorporate detailed information on disease progression such as a distribution over the time to death as opposed to assuming every person dies exactly x days after their infection as has been done in similar more informal analyses our approach allows us to provide uncertainty intervals on parameters estimated by our model and using our fitted model we make rough preliminary estimates of the actual number of sars-cov-2 positive americans the goal of this work is not to provide specific forecasts of the infected population and likely deaths although our initial estimates here fit the observed patterns of deaths accurate forecasts will require location-specific measures of containment and treatment efficacy as well as age-and comorbidity-specific infected fatality rates we dont have these data at present but our model could incorporate them as better information becomes available our paper offers a modeling approach using minimal but probablygood data describes a likelihood and priors is fitted to data and is underpinned by a widely-used epidemiological model that is designed to approximate the real dynamics of disease spread several previous studies have offered methods for estimating the total number of infections although estimating the size of the infected population has been largely a side-effect of other analytic goals for example li et al 5 propose that in china in the first month of the epidemic 82-90 percent of infections were undocumented riou et al 8 use a seir model-an analogue of the sir model in which there is a lag between exposure and the individual becoming infectious-and calibrate their model to the time series of reported deaths and reported infections by modeling the underreporting of symptomatic cases and by assuming that approximately half of infections lead to symptomatic cases they estimate the infected population in hubei finding that approximately 30 of infections were documented ferguson et al 1 model the effect of transmission between susceptible and infectious individuals using a microsimulation model built on synthetic populations designed to mimic the populations of the united kingdom and united states they assume a fixed time-to-onset and a range of r 0 values from 20-26 and they assume symptomatic cases to be 50 more infectious than asymptomatic cases they calibrate their model to the cumulative number of deaths seen by march 14 2020 this is conceptually similar to our approach in that the model ignores case counts and is fitted only to death information however the calibration is based on only one observation-the cumulative number of deaths at a fixed time point-rather than fitting to the full time series of deaths and there is no likelihood or sampling model from which to estimate parameter values having calibrated their model to the cumulative number of deaths ferguson et al estimate deaths and hospital loads under different non-pharmaceutical interventions npi involving social distancing and isolation the estimated infected population is a side-effect of their model by contrast perkins et al 7 estimate directly that in the us more than 90 of infections have been undocumented by tests using chinese data and initial reports in the us the chime app 1 is an online tool created by researchers at the university of pennsylvania to help hospitals anticipate the number of incoming covid-19 patients and their needs it takes a conceptually similar approach to the work we present here the chime model uses the current number of covid-19 hospitalizations to back out the total number of cases based on external estimates of the hospitalization rate of the disease similar to our work they do not use data on the case counts they make forward projections for the number of hospital admissions icu admissions and ventilators needed over the coming weeks they allow the user to specify the parameters of their underlying epidemiological model as inputs in terms of the doubling times two other models are worth noting the new york times online tool allows the user to specify inputs to understand how those inputs affect likely infections hospital loads and deaths infections are a side-effect of the rest of the model the model given in murray 6 has a goal similar to chime hospital use planning however murray 6 does not use an sir model or any mathematical model of disease spread instead his projection uses only the pattern of observed deaths which he fits to an arbitrary curve chosen because it fits the data well p4 he uses location-specific parameters and the time between infection and death as predictors this model avoids predicting the infected population at all the size of the infected population and the extent to which the reported case count underestimates it are important questions the size of the infected population could inform health care providers about the number of cases likely to require hospitalization in the coming 1-2 weeks furthermore knowing the probable size of the infected population would alert policymakers and the public about the likely number of deaths in the next 2-4 weeks we model the infection spread in the entire us population with a single sir model with the unfortunate recent growth in the number of reported deaths and hospitalizations there will soon be enough data to disaggregate the modeling to individual states or even cities the use of a single model for the entire us population is clearly a limitation of our approach and we anticipate disaggregating geographically in the near future let  t be the number of new infections on day t of the epidemic and let p denote the infection fatality rate ie the probability of death given infection we denote the day of the first infection by t 0  let   t s  s  0 1  mu be the set of probabilities defining the discrete time-to-death distribution where  s denote the probability that for those who die death from covid-19 occurs s days after the initial infection let xpt t 1 q denote the number of individuals newly infected on day t who die on day t 1  our death model is the observed deaths on day r are thus given by dprq  the sum over all previous days of the number of individuals infected on that day who went on to die on day r this has marginal distribution the use of a poisson distribution in specifying our model may seem unnatural compared to the specification xpt t 1 q  p   binomialp t  p ptt 1 q q the poisson specification simplifies computation as we will see in section 4 and fortunately in cases where p s is small and  is large precisely the situation in which we find ourselves after the very early days of the epidemic the poissonpp s q distribution is a good approximation to binomialp p s q furthermore allowing for  t to take real values as opposed to integer values as would be required for a binomial distribution allows us to use simpler deterministic models for the underlying epidemiological curves defining the  t s this also simplifies computation the observed number of deaths d are linked to the compartmental model via the total number of newly infected individuals on day t  t  which appears in the above equations in our preliminary analysis we have used a discrete-time version of the susceptible-infectious-removed sir model with a modification of the state evolution to make the model consistent with the observed number of deaths on each day that enter into our likelihood the state evolution of this model is deterministic and given by where s t is the number of susceptible individuals at time t i t is the number of infected individuals at time t n is the total population size set to 330 million in the united states and r t is the number of removed recovered or deceased individuals at time t in this model infected individuals are considered contagious this model is nearly identical to the classic sir model with the exception that i t1 in the canonical model has been replaced by  r pi t1dt1 qd t1 in our specification in our evolution model the expected number of individuals who move from state i to state r is explicitly decomposed into the number who died which is an integer count that comes directly from our observed data and the expected number who recover each day  r pi t1d t1 q the logic behind the latter term is that pi t1dt1 q is the number of people who were infected as of time t1 who did not die during that time period of those we expect  r to recover per unit time so in our model  r is the rate of recovery for those who will eventually recover thus the mean time between infection and recovery the end of the contagious period for those who do recover is given by 1 r  and r 0 is approximately given by 1 r  these equivalences are approximate in our case since our compartmental model is discrete-time rather than continuous-time and we explicitly split the removed population between deceased and recovered figure 1 shows one realization of our modified sir model the top panel shows one draw of the daily number of deaths notice that this is not a smooth curve when fitting our model these ds will be our data and will be the only thing we observe directly the other panels are what we will infer from the ds the middle panel of the figure shows the s the number of daily new infections the series of ds has roughly the same shape as the s though it lags it by about 25 days this lag is due to how we have set  the parameter governing the time-to-death distribution which we describe below the bottom panel gives the standard view of the sir model showing the total number of susceptible infected and removed at any given time point this model has several parameters due to identifiability constraints we do not estimate all of them rather we fix those for which there exists high quality information on reasonable values that is applicable in the context studied here by and large this includes those parameters pertaining more to the biology of the disease than to the figure 1  one realization of our modified sir models social dynamics of its spread 2 these include  and p for  we draw primarily from two studies zhou et al 10 reports that in wuhan china the time from symptom onset to death had a median time of 185 days with an interquartile range of 15 to 22 days a poisson-gamma distribution with parameters t u  t2775 15u matches the reported quantiles well lauer et al 3 estimate the incubation period of the disease also using data from china they report a median incubation time of 51 days with an estimated 975th percentile of 115 days and a 99th percentile of 14 days the quantiles of a poisson-gamma distribution with parameters t u  t55 11u match these reported quantiles well we calculate the distribution of the total time from infection to death by generating 100000 samples from the described distribution of the incubation period and the described distribution of the time from symptom onset to death the time to death is the sum of these two numbers we truncate the maximum time to death from infection to be the 99th percentile of the generated samples this results in a time to death distribution shown in figure 2  to set p we rely on several external data points russell et al 9 use data from individuals on the diamond princess cruise ship to estimate an infection fatality rate of 12 95 ci 038-27 after adjusting for delays between infection confirmation and death the ship was a closed population we know who was on the ship and therefore who to test so we have confidence in the denominator all individuals infected figure 2  conditional on death occurring the probability of death on each day following infection with covid-19 were identified because all people on the ship could be tested as of 25 march 2020 there were 9137 confirmed positive cases and 126 deaths in south korea 3  this gives a crude case fatality rate of 14 although this statistic focuses on confirmed cases this number may be reasonably close to the true infection fatality rate because south korea has aggressively tested and traced contacts including testing of asymptomatic individuals moreover south koreas epidemic is relatively old giving sufficient time that many of the infected individuals who will go on to die have already done so keep in mind that computing an infection fatality rate in this way-by dividing total deaths at time t by total cases that have been identified up to time t-would give an underestimate of the infection fatality rate because the denominator includes some people who are currently infected who will eventually die to give some estimate of how much of an underestimate this may be south korea as of 25 march reports 59 patients in serious or critical condition if 14 of these patients die then the empirical case fatality rate would rise to 16 on the other hand despite the very high level of testing in south korea as of 25 march they had performed about 7 tests per 1000 population the number of reported cases is still an underestimate of the total number of cases the other country that was very aggressive about testing and surveillance from the early days of the epidemic is germany as of 27 march germany reports 281 deaths and 47278 total cases giving an ifr estimate of 059 percent germanys case count still appears to be rising whereas south korea appears to have largely controlled the spread so many of the fatalities in germany may be yet to come if this is true then the raw ifr from germanys data could be an under-estimate if this effect is enough to offset the infections that have gone undetected despite the aggressive testing taking place in both the comparison to germany and south korea differences in underlying demographics comorbities and other risk factors could limit the applicability of these estimates to the united states however such factors are difficult to adjust for since data on risk factors is preliminary and limited we believe that the comparison is still useful in providing a rough ballpark estimate finally a recent paper in science attempts to estimate the total size of the infected population during the epidemic in china 5  their estimates of the total number of infected implies an adjusted infection fatality rate of about 04 percent see the note between li et al 2020 co-author j shaman here  thus consistent with all of these estimates and because the infection fatality rate is arguably the most important parameter in our model that cannot be learned from the data we consider two different cases 05 percent and 10 percent we estimate the parameters of the model that govern the spread of the disease rather than its progression conditional on infection the parameters we estimate in our model are  r   and t 0  previous estimates of the length of the infectious period 1 r vary widely so we choose a fairly diffuse prior 1 r  uniformp3 25q corresponding to an infectious period that ranges from 3 to 25 days to set the prior on    r  we use the reported 95 percent confidence interval in 4 to establish upper and lower bounds on the r 0  and put    r  uniformp14 r  39 r q encompassing possible r 0 values of between 14 and 39 for all of the allowed values of  r  we place a uniform prior on t 0 between january 1 and january 30 we do computation by mcmc using the following algorithm this algorithm is an adaptive metropolis-within-gibbs algorithm see eg 2  the algorithm produces samples from the bayesian posterior distribution of the parameters of our model 1  sample x given d  p  from xp sq  multinomialpd s  q where  t 9 p t  pstq  each multinomial sample of xp sq imputes the number of people infected on each day that went on to die on day s conditional on having observed exactly d s deaths at day s this follows because a vector of independent poisson random variables constrained to sum to some positive integer has a multinomial distribution with probabilities proportional to the poisson rate parameters see 4  2 we update   r  and t 0 using the adaptive metropolis algorithm to do this we propose a new set of parameters t r  t0 u from n pp  r  t 0 q q with the time-inhomogeneous covariance  computed using the method of 2  we then calculate the corresponding set of t s we accept or reject the proposed t r  t0 u using metropolis-hastings with target density propportional to p   r q   t logpp t  pttq qlogpp  r  t 0 qq with  t   t t 1 1 xpt t 1 q and pq representing the prior we fit our model to the daily number of deaths in the united states as recorded on httpsworldometercom we use data up until 28 march 2020 to fit our model we run for 50000 iterations begin adaptation after 5000 iterations and use 10000 iterations of burn-in trace plots for the parameters   r  t 0 are shown in the appendix r code for all of the analysis here is available at xxx the left panel of figure 9 shows the posterior distribution of the number of newly infected individuals on march 18 and the right panel shows the total number of infected plus recovered individuals on 18 march we focus on an estimate of the number of infections on march 18 because this is roughly the time at which social distancing measures began in earnest in the united states for example california put into place statewide social distancing measures on 19 march because we fit our model to only deaths through march 28 and very few individuals die within 10 days of infection we do not expect that social distancing has had much effect yet on our estimates however it does affect the interpretation of our estimates the deaths being observed today are of individuals infected several weeks ago at a time when few social distancing measures were in place and the virus was spreading essentially unchecked in the united states thus our estimates of r 0 reflect the transmissibility of the virus without social distancing in place once social distancing measures took effect we expect that the r 0 would decline we study several cases for how social distancing has changed r 0 in the next section our mean estimate of the total number of infected plus recovered on march 18 is about 475000 comparing this to the number of reported cases on 18 march 9187 we find that the reported case numbers underestimate the total number of infected by a factor of about 50 of course infected individuals take some amount of time to develop symptoms and thus we would not expect everyone who had ever been infected as of march 18 to have sought or received testing one study 4 reports the incubation period is about 5 days and the 90th percentile is about 125 days while another study lauer et al 3 reports the median incubation period is about 51 days the 25th percentile about 22 days and the 975th percentile about 115 days thus a better comparison may be between our estimate of the total number of infected on march 182020 and the total number of reported cases on 23 march 2020 43781 or on 27 march 2020 85435 which suggests that the case count underestimates the total number of infected who are visible to testing by a factor of between 5 and 10 the latter is in line with the recent paper on the undercount in hubei 5  although the extent of under-testing could be very different in the united states and in hubei we find it interesting that these estimates correspond and suspect this is because the numbers are linked by the fact that in both places asymptomatic people were rarely tested next we look at model predictions under several scenarios since significant mitigation strategies began to be put in place about ten days ago in each scenario we assume that the r 0 is as estimated by our model up until march 18 at which point the r 0 drops several options for after-mitigation r 0 s are considered in each of the figures each new r 0 corresponding to a different colored trajectory plots of the number of figure 10  the right panel of figure 10 shows the estimated number of deaths by day in each of the scenarios in the absence of social distancing measures the number of daily deaths continues to rise if this curve were extended out further wed find that the number of daily deaths peaks at around 10 5 in early to mid may under this scenario on the other hand if social distancing measures have the effect of reducing the r 0 by about 36 percent to 175 then the number of deaths would be less by an order of magnitude at this time though will not yet have peaked similarly under the no effect of social distancing scenario new infections peak in early to mid-april at about 10 74 at more than 10 million new infections if social distancing measures reduce r 0 to 175 the number of new infections at this time is less by more than an order of magnitude in a more hopeful scenario where the r 0 drops to 125-almost to the point of suppression-the number of daily deaths in mid-may is only about 4000 and the number of daily new infections in mid-april is only about 400000 all of these results have been conditional on the assumption that the ifr is 1 this is the most important assumption in the model and the value of the ifr cannot be learned directly from the data used in this analysis it must be included as an input or assumption to the model because of this we also give results for an alternative lower ifr of 05 in the appendix our model strives to use only information which has a reasonable chance of being measured correctly we condition our findings on the observed number of deaths and we use the infected fatality rate p and the time from infection to death  s  measured in specific clinical settings to estimate the number of people infected and the number likely to die our model predictions of the number of deaths in the us are consistent with the time series of deaths observed from the beginning of the pandemic to the present in contrast to models that use a wider range of information that may be less precisely measured our approach minimizes information use and prioritizes parameter identifiability the uncertainty from the clinical measures is propagated to the estimates of new infections  t and likely deaths d t by means of explicit priors that reflect the ranges of the reported measures the model has several underlying assumptions perhaps most importantly we assume that after an individual has recovered they cannot be reinfected the parameters we draw from prior studies p and  may be better measured as more data is collected and clinicians improve reporting it is easy to update our model with improved values of these parameters finally our model uses the sir approach to link observed deaths to the underlying unobserved infections it would not be difficult with our approach to change the linkage for some other model the authors thank dr megan price and tarak shah

morphology of hybrid nanoparticles deposited on air filter media was investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem the antimicrobial and filtration efficiencies of the filter were evaluated and compared to filter media coated with np nanoparticles or mwcnts alone

chambers with separate capillaries a particle hybrid chamber positive and negative power supplies and two syringe pumps the np and mwcnt suspensions were transferred using metal taper tips new objective woburn ma usa and stainless steel tubing idex health  science oak harbor wa usa respectively the tip with an inner diameter of 100 m was used for the np suspension for the mwcnt suspension tubing with an inner diameter of 150 m was used to increase the number of mwcnts transferred and to reduce the likelihood of nozzle blockage by nanotubes of the undesired size two separate syringes hamilton reno nv usa on two individual syringe pumps kd scientific holliston ma usa were used to drive the two solutions the pump flow rates were 008 mlh for the np solution and 08 mlh for the mwcnt

fig 2a the bacteria were nebulized at an airflow rate of 5 lmin dispersed bacterial aerosols were passed through a diffusion dryer to remove moisture and then introduced to a filter holder in which the fabricated antimicrobial filter was installed the size distribution and concentration of the bacterial aerosol were measured using an aerodynamic particle sizer aps 3321 tsi shoreview mn usa the bacteria were allowed to reside on each filter for 5 min the filter was then removed from the holder and soaked in a 50-ml conical tube containing 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline pbs ph 74 with 001 tween 80 samples in the fluid were vortexed for 2 min and then sonicated in an ice bath for 10 min to ensure bacterial transmission from the filter to the pbs buffer finally the suspension was serially diluted and 100 l of each resulting suspension were respectively plated onto nutrient agar becton dickinson and incubated at 37 c for 24 h colonies that formed on the plate were counted after incubation the bacterial inactivation rate was calculated using the following equation1inactivationrate1cfuantimicrobialcfucontrol100where cfuantimicrobial is the number of bacterial colonies cfu counted from the antimicrobial filter and cfucontrol is the number of bacterial colonies counted from the pristine control filter to investigate the filtration efficiency of the antimicrobial filters the total number concentration of bacterial aerosols was measured at the inlet and outlet of the filter using an aerodynamic particle sizer filtration efficiency was calculated using the following equation2filtrationefficiency1concentrationoutletconcentrationinlet100where concentrationoutlet and concentrationinlet are the total particle concentrations particlecm3 of bacterial aerosols measured at the filter inlet and outlet respectively as shown in fig 2b pressure drop across the test filters was measured using a micromanometer fco12 furness controls ltd bexhill uk thes was used to prepare npmwcnt hybrid nanoparticles the procedure consisted of two steps electrospraying two kinds of droplets followed by controlled ethanol evaporation and coagulation of particles resulting from coulombic collisions between oppositely charged nps and mwcnts in the first step the droplets containing dissolved nps experienced a transient phase change from a liquid to a solid camelot et al 1999 morozov 2011 tan et al 2007
fig 3 shows the wps size distributions and tem images of the nps mwcnts and npmwcnts a significant transport loss of particles 90 was observed when generating pure np nanoparticles or pure mwcnts via single-nozzle electrospraying without charge neutralization these losses were due to the high electrical charge per particle this phenomenon was similar to that shown in the experimental results of fu et al 2012 to mitigate this effect as shown in fig 3a and b np nanoparticles or pure mwcnts were generated using simultaneous electrospray of pure ethanol the opposite charge polarity of which served to neutralize unipolarly charged np nanoparticles or mwcnts the neutralized np nanoparticles had a positively skewed size distribution of 10100 nm with a peak diameter of 115 nm a geometric standard deviation gsd of 163 and a geometric mean diameter gmd of 185 nm fig 3a

fig 4 shows the surfaces of pristine filters and antimicrobial filters onto which np mwcnt and npmwcnt nanoparticles were deposited the surface of the pristine filter fig 4a b was smooth and clear while the surfaces coated with np fig 4c d and mwcnt fig 4e f nanoparticles were relatively uneven compared to the mwcnt coatings the np coatings were uniformly deposited onto the filter surface in contrast the npmwcnt-coated filters fig 4g h formed dendrites on the filter surface which suggests that the unique shape of the npmwcnt particles contributes to the formation of dendrites on the filter surface and that the deposition structure increased the contact surface area between the antimicrobial substance and bacteria there was no additional separation unit for np and npmwcnt nanoparticles therefore the coating on npmwcnt-coated filters also contained np nanoparticles however the npnwcnt nanoparticles were expected to show a greater antimicrobial activity than that of either the pure np nanoparticles or pure mwcnts prior to conducting this study we collected filter samples with similar pressure drops at a face velocity of 8 cms to prevent false results from filter variations alone as shown
fig 5 the pressure drops of the antimicrobial filters were higher than those of the pristine filters 66 mmh2o the mwcnt- 111 mmh2o and npmwcnt-coated filters 116 mmh2o showed a significant increase in pressure drop compared with the np-coated filters 71 mmh2o the surfaces of the np- and mwcnt-coated filters were yellow and black respectively the npmwcnt-coated filter was gray due to the combination of np nanoparticles yellow and mwcnts black the filtration efficiencies of pristine np mwcnt- and npmwcnt-coated filters were tested using s epidermidis aerosols
fig 6a shows the normalized aerodynamic particle size distribution of tested bacterial aerosols generated by the nebulizer the size distribution of the aerosols was a monomodal curve with a peak diameter of 0898 m a gmd of 0914 m and a gsd of 117 the concentration of s epidermidis in the aerosols was 133103

fig 7 shows that the npmwcnt filters had a higher antimicrobial activity than the np and mwcnt filters under identical experimental conditions the npmwcnt filters inactivated 95 of the test bacteria while the other filters inactivated 70 of the bacteria spss t-test p005 these results are consistent with the results of previous studies showing that agcnt nanoparticles or nylon-6agcnt hybrid polymer nanocomposite fibers had significant antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species including e coli staphylococcus aureus and s epidermidis jung et al 2011a rangari et al 2010 such inhibition appears to be due to the high contact surface area between bacteria and antimicrobial substances factors that have been shown to influence the antimicrobial efficacy of such coated filters include the size concentration and shape of the coating materials ji et al 2007 kim et al 2007 pal et al 2007 the np nanoparticles used in this study were composed primarily of flavonoids flavonoids exhibit an antibacterial activity by reducing the fluidity of the inner and outer layers of bacterial membranes thereby inhibiting dna and rna synthesis and deterring energy metabolism cushnie  lamb 2005 in addition direct contact between cnts and bacteria cells causes damage to the outer bacterial membrane and subsequent cell death short cnts are more effective in damaging bacterial cells due to increased interactions with the cell membrane the open ends of nanotubes can induce further bacterial cell damage kang et al 2008 the primary reason for the enhanced antimicrobial activity of the npmwcnt filters was the increased contact surface area resulting from the high surface area of the np particles and the presence of the mwcnts the net effect was the high antimicrobial efficacy of filters coated with hybrid npmwcnt nanoparticles npmwcnt hybrid nanostructures were produced using a thes technique the particle size distribution and tem and sem analyses showed that np particles were successfully combined with mwcnts the hybrid nanoparticles were continuously deposited onto filter surfaces using an aerosol process the npmwcnt-coated filters exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than those coated only with np particles or mwcnts the fabrication technique described is simple and the resulting hybrid particles have demonstrated a potential for applications in indoor air andor water purification systems however the experimental results also showed that electrical charge optimization on the particles was necessary to increase the synthesis rate of the hybrid nanoparticles thus future studies will include electrical charge optimizations for efficient hybrid nanoparticle synthesis  health psychology frederick leong tl wade pickren e mark leach m anthony marsella j frances aboud e   health psychology is a relatively new field and international health psychology even newer anthropologists and cross-cultural psychologists have worked in africa and asia for many years but i rarely find another health psychologist when i work in the poorest countries with their skills they would have a great deal to offer health psychologists know not only about cultural differences but also about basic cognitive and social processes as they apply to health problems they know how to use qualitative and quantitative methods to describe problems and evaluate solutions health psychologists generally are problem-focused they study health problems where socialpsychological and behavioral processes are part of the problem health psychologists are also solution-focused they are not satisfied with simply describing and measuring stress and its effect on health they also want to evaluate ways to reduce stress they study diet and exercise and ways to enhance these and other lifestyles through health promotion international health psychologists use the same problem- and solution-focused approach in developing countries working with a local team of experts who have identified the pressing local health problems they examine sources of the problem and ways to tackle it the problems are different in developing countries but the steps taken to solve them may not be if you cannot use public service television advertising to tell people about the benefits of breast feeding and bed nets you can nonetheless train community health workers or teachers to provide lively entertainmenteducation on these topics to groups of people instead of tackling heart disease stroke and cancer international health psychologists tackle diseases of children who die in large numbers or are left physically and mentally disabled by the age of 5 they also focus on women who are at greater risk than men of getting hiv who die or are disabled as a result of giving birth and who are the guardians of their familys health yet have little decision-making power instead of working with hospitals where only a small minority of the population go for treatment international health psychologists work with rural communities and village health workers to prevent death and disease why might psychologists want and need to become informed about international perspectives on health first we have come to realize that we can learn from problems and solutions being evaluated in other countries we can learn how people from different cultures think about causes of illness and find strikingly similar ways of thinking in our own country we can learn how strategies to change health behavior have succeeded or failed in other countries for example with respect to abstinence and condom use and adjust our own strategies accordingly we can broaden our theories for example theories of stress and coping or theories of behavior change on the basis of research in developing countries second psychologists have an important role to play in improving the health of people in developing countries as health psychologists with a population health perspective we are welcomed by multi-disciplinary teams of researchers and health workers who attempt to resolve health problems through environmental social psychological and medical changes prevention of illness is less expensive than cure and psychologists are experts in preventive behaviors health workers therefore seek input from psychologists to help them promote a large array of good health behaviors for example hand-washing and home management of dehydration far exceed hospital or medical treatments of diarrhea behavior change in the use of treated mosquito bed nets are at the forefront of the fight against malaria given that no vaccine is yet available abstinence and condom use are still the only ways to prevent hiv having a birth plan to give birth at a clinic rather than at home increases a womans chance of surviving without disability  in many countries delivering a baby is riskier than an abortion persuading mothers to breast feed their infants for 6 months and to serve animal source foods and vegetables to their young children are keys to overcoming the appalling levels of malnutrition psychologists may not study viruses and vaccines but they know more than others about attitude and behavior change furthermore why might psychology students want to become informed about international perspectives on health more and more young people are traveling out of curiosity about others and a desire for personal growth they feel a sense of responsibility at least to be informed about the struggles of people who live in other countries some want to work abroad after their degree with peace corps or one of the many non-governmental organizations such as world vision or save the children most are relatively nave about the challenges they will encounter but they are eager and well-intentioned other students are critical of these adventurers and accuse them of being neocolonials and cultural universalists my class always has a rousing debate on these two positions some students mistakenly think that american psychologists parachute themselves into remote places and start controlling peoples health behaviors the reality is that we are visiting experts who work alongside local people who want to change organizations are happy to have students not because they have the skills to really make a difference but because they are the international experts of the future their international perspective will help american donors set proper priorities for the fight against hunger illiteracy hiv and malaria they will understand that the usual strategies of funding hospitals and expensive equipment are not the best solutions students with a background in psychology will see first-hand that their skills in the area of environmental social and behavioral change are put to good use as part of class preparation students can be encouraged to google organizations welcoming young volunteers and at the same time discover the common problems faced by people in places such as africa and south asia health is highly valued by people everywhere along with education health is recognized as one of the most important resources a people and a nation can possess goals set by the international community toward which all international experts are now working called the millennium development goals consist largely of improved health compare with the us healthy people initiatives among the eight goals to be reached by the year 2015 are reducing hunger child deaths womens deaths during delivery and infectious diseases such as hiv and malaria to accomplish these are goals that include clean sources of water proper waste disposal use of skilled birth attendants use of condoms and other forms of contraception and gender equality in education although some but not all of the goals will be met on time by some but not all regions of the world their ratification by all countries belonging to the united nations provides an incentive to work cooperatively students can find online the site for the millennium development goals and how much progress has been made in sub-saharan africa south asia and latin america in this chapter i provide lesson plans for three international topics that might be used in a course on health psychology rather than describe exotic cross-cultural examples of how a remote tribe in africa conducts trepanation to reduce pain or a how western surgeons fly to asia to perform cataract surgery small examples that add one unusual twist to an otherwise smooth-flowing lecture i have selected three millennium development goals
reducing the number of women who die delivering why is it riskier to deliver than to abort why do young women find it difficult to live healthy lives this is one of the most popular topics among my students because they note striking contrasts with their own life yet they strongly identify with the issuesenvironmental health including sources of clean water waste disposal and personal hygiene water shortage is a worldwide obsession and a looming problem for the usa why is water in developing countries unclean and what are the consequences for health this is a story of health behavior change in particular as it relates to waste disposal hand-washing and face-washing at the family level it extends to the use of mosquito nets and condoms psychologists are famous for their theories of behavior change but most theories have not worked well in developing countries why not there is ample scholarly space for insightful and creative students to answer this questioneliminating child hunger and its disabling effects on physical growth and cognitive development while nine to ten million children under 5 years die each year from preventable causes another 200 million are unable to reach their psychological potential because they lack food and stimulation as psychologists we grasp the tragedy of such waste one-third of children in developing countries are short for their age meaning they have suffered long-term hunger a similar proportion of american children are overweight two lectures back to back on obesity and hunger provide an instructive contrast
 other topics might fit your course and inclinations as well these include hiv and aids particularly in south africa where school programs imported from the usa and modified for the african context have been evaluated gallant and maticka-tyndale 2004 new programs to promote condom use in the community are currently being created and evaluated jewkes et al 2006 2008 it is also connected there with alcohol abuse intimate partner violence and coercive sex patientpractitioner interactions and quality of care can also be studied in developing country settings shared decision making privacy and adherence are dilemmas in family planning clinics health posts and hospitals abdel-tawab and roter 2002 hadley and roques 2007 health psychology students would enjoy arguing about the social cultural and ethical issues involved even where shared decision making and privacy are not cultural norms women may still want both finally alcohol and tobacco abuse are increasing in developing countries in the usa health education in schools target youth and environmental restrictions regulate where and to whom these items can be sold health psychology students might consider whether these strategies would be successful in papua new guinea india or china where in the world is papua new guinea where are all these 50 least developed countries you can find a list of them along with some facts and figures at the unicef web site httpwwwuniceforg my students get the latestpdf copies of the tables at the back of the unicef document called the state of the worlds children there are statistics on the proportion of children who die before their fifth birthday this is the most telling indicator of a nations overall health if you cannot keep your children alive then those who survive must also be doing poorly and their mothers must be in poor physical and mental health as well there are also figures on how long people can expect to live maternal mortality malnutrition literacy hiv prevalence among young people condom use immunization how much donor money goes into the country called official development assistance or oda and funds spent on health this and more information is available about each country about regions such as sub-saharan africa and latin america and about groupings of countries such as the 50 least developed countries and 39 industrialized countries you can also see how each indicator is defined and its source of data one instructive group assignment for students is to give them a list of indicators then let them pick a country in sub-saharan africa south asia and latin america for which they find the indicator data in the end the instructor creates a composite table in full view of all fielding figures from the three groups and inserting them into the table the three columns of figures for say ethiopia bangladesh and nicaragua may be compared with each other and with a fourth column of figures for the usa students can then decide which countries need the most work and in what areas of health other sites with useful information are the world health organization httpwwwwhoint and unaids hiv and aids httpwwwunaidsorgenissues along with unicef these organizations have teams of experts providing guidelines on the best practices known to date research is constantly updating these guidelines and psychologists contribute in important ways to this research incidentally this research is rarely published in mainstream american psychology journals although there is recent interest in doing so it is published in international journals such as the bulletin for the world health organization social science and medicine and the lancet international health psychologists collaborate with other health disciplines such as medical anthropologists epidemiologists nutritionists health programmers and public health specialists they all speak the same jargon and read the same documents to coordinate students introduced to international health psychology should be socialized into this team effort at a local and a global level why is it riskier to deliver than to abort why do young women find it difficult to live healthy lives women in the usa live longer than men but have more health complaints if they want to have a career and family there are resources to support their choices husbands can support them during delivery maternity leave gives them time off and day care centers provide quality care in the early years women may feel stressed but they actually thrive with multiple roles women in developing countries have a hard life over 500000 mothers die giving birth each year many more are disabled because they get infections lose blood or rupture the birth passage you might be reluctant to get pregnant under such dangerous conditions but young and uneducated women do not have much say maternal mortality is a health event with the greatest disparity between developing and industrialized countries in the usa only 1 of 4800 women will die during her reproductive years and at the time of delivery only 11 of 100000 will die from complications in the 50 least developed countries 1 of 24 women will die during these years and 870 of 100000 will die delivering her baby sub-saharan africa has a worse record than south asia and both are considerably worse than latin america see the lancet 2005 series on maternal mortality eg campbell  graham 2005 filippi ronsmans  campbell et al 2005 ronsmans and graham 2005 reasons for the deaths will be presented shortly along with some surprising new research findings but first let students imagine they are collecting the data to calculate these figures imagine we are the researchers collecting data on women who die during delivery in the usa we would go to a hospital or the death registry however most developing countries do not yet have registration of births and deaths furthermore most women do not deliver babies in hospitals or clinics they deliver at home so we go door-to-door using what is called the sisterhood method along with a verbal autopsy we interview women between 15 and 49 years and ask about their adult sisters survival for those sisters who died time of death along with details of the circumstances and symptoms prior to death is recorded if the death occurred during pregnancy delivery or up to 42 days after delivery from causes related to or aggravated by the pregnancy it is a case of maternal mortality obviously a much more reliable method is possible when health researchers set up a demographic surveillance site as they did in matlab bangladesh in the 1960s each year they visit households asking about births pregnancies deaths health and illness the following year outcomes of the pregnancy will be recorded if the mother has died the child commonly dies shortly thereafter because a child cannot survive for long without a mothers care and breast milk why do so many women die some reasons can be gleaned from the conditions of young women before they become pregnant others arise during pregnancy and delivery the first set of causes include early marriage parents arrange for their daughters to get married in their late teens perhaps to avoid her getting pregnant out of wedlock or to have one less person to feed usually they arrange an early marriage simply because everyone else in the village does and questions will be asked if a girl of 20 is still not married young brides and their families want children immediately because motherhood is a girls primary role and confers status young bodies especially bodies that are short due to malnutrition do not have a fully developed birth canal the fetus is likely to be either too large for the birth canal or low birth-weight young girls who live in an area across mid-africa have likely undergone a procedure called genital cutting which produces inflexible scar tissue this further impedes smooth passage of the fetus leading to the rupture of the birth canal if the woman is young and lacks primary school education she may be unaware of these risks she has simply followed the wishes of her family and the practices of her community if she has not completed fifth grade she is not sufficiently literate to read about alternative available practices health psychologists study the cultural social and behavioral practices that prepare girls for safe motherhood childbirth is a natural phenomenon but still things can go wrong during the growth and delivery of a fetus in the usa pregnancy is a time for joy and for preparation part of the preparation entails prenatal visits to an obstetrician to check on the mothers weight gain and blood pressure and to check on the fetus vital signs in the least developed countries particularly those in africa and south asia only 60 seek prenatal known as antenatal care the others claim that because they did not experience a problem they did not need to go the purpose of antenatal care however is prevention for example if it looks like the baby is too large for the mothers pelvic gap a cesarean section may be planned to prevent malaria during pregnancy she may be given anti-malarial pills if she is anemic and most are she may be given iron and folic acid supplements many of these services are provided free of charge by government clinics so health psychologists may try to create pictorial leaflets with messages that motivate pregnant women without scaring them to seek antenatal care our involvement with screening programs for cancer gives us a sense of how difficult it is to motivate women who fear bad news antenatal screening unfortunately is not a reliable predictor of who will encounter serious problems most common causes of maternal death and disability cannot be detected early and thereby prevented because of these limitations concerted effort now focuses on the need to encourage mothers to seek a skilled doctor nurse or midwife to deliver their newborn and to train these professionals in a few essential emergency obstetric procedures but delivery practices are difficult to change most mothers over 60 in the least developed countries deliver at home with the help of a traditional birth attendant or female relative who perform deliveries on a regular basis but know little about cleanliness and less about what to do when the mother starts to bleed she has no medicines to stop the pain or the bleeding the family is left on their own to cope with the crisis the common reasons for women dying are excessive bleeding in the 24 h after delivery and infection of the genital tract due to unclean hands and instruments being inserted neither can be predicted from an antenatal visit but both are preventable if the woman goes to a nearby clinic or hospital another preventable cause of deaths is obstructed labor due to a small birth passage to scar tissue from genital cutting or to awkward positioning of the fetus antenatal care would have alerted the mother of potential problems associated with these conditions perhaps to prepare for a cesarean section delivery health psychologists and other social scientists are helping to reduce maternal mortality in several ways the first is to show mothers the benefits of delivering at a clinic or hospital if women will not go to clinics to deliver then they need to seek a nontraditional skilled midwife you may have to convince not only the young mother but also her parents in-laws and husband furthermore health education along with pictures warns women of conditions that are life-threatening for which she should seek emergency obstetric care at the same time pregnant women are counseled on how to complete an advanced birth plan and to save some money for emergency transport to a clinic countries such as sri lanka and honduras have reduce their deaths greatly in recent years and so stand as good models for us to study another strategy to reduce maternal deaths is through family planning and the use of modern contraception women often continue to have children simply because they live in a culture that encourages having many children and they assume that their husbands want more children almost half of pregnancies 40 globally are unwanted meaning that the woman was not wanting or trying to get pregnant often she is too young or unmarried perhaps pregnant through rape or already has more children than she can care for some 22 of pregnancies result in induced abortion safe abortions have little risk but unsafe abortions often end in death and account for one-third of maternal deaths thus two common strategies for reducing maternal deaths are contraception and safe abortion one of the surprising research findings is that the most popular form of contraception worldwide is sterilization sterilization has such a bad reputation in the usa that few would choose it willingly yet in both india and china 34 of women undergo a simple sterilization procedure to stop having more children the intrauterine device iud comes next with again high use in korea and china chinas one-child policy has successfully reduced its population growth but countries in africa have no popular support for such policies overall india and bangladesh have close to 60 use of modern contraception latin america 70 sub-saharan africa has the lowest use at 23 education importantly increases the chances that both husband and wife will want to use contraception counseling women and particularly couples on the need to space or stop children is the preferred strategy but some countries also insert contraception episodes into television soap operas to raise awareness and create a social norm and demand students may be unused to considering family planning as both an individual choice and a social responsibility yet in places where responsibility to and for your extended family is strong neither marriage partner nor family size is solely an individual choice students tend to think that lifestyle and other health behaviors are under personal control yet there are many examples where governments for the protection of all have regulated safety most of us must wear seat belts while driving in a vehicle when seat belts were encouraged but voluntary most people did not wear them and so killed or maimed themselves and their children unnecessarily once laws were passed requiring seat belt use almost everyone buckled up and subsequently their attitudes changed in favor of seat belts this is a good example of how governments can regulate health behaviors for the good of all and let supportive attitudes follow in their wake another example is smoking governments regulate the age when one can purchase cigarettes and places where you cannot smoke  the latter being an example of social responsibility the age of alcohol purchase was raised in the usa as a result of alcohol abuse and drunk driving by high school and college students the people of china and india have social norms about limiting ones family size in many african countries the norm is to have many children in the usa there is no strong prescriptive norm some have no children some have the usual two and some have more a new and interesting research topic concerns hiv pregnancy and transmission to the newborn women between the ages of 18 and 24 are more than twice as likely as young men to become hiv-positive pregnancy increases her chances of becoming hiv-positive as does having an older male partner or husband who had premarital or extramarital sexual experience so for a number of biological and social reasons pregnant women have additional risks due to potential hiv infection a newborn child has a 35 chance of becoming infected mostly during delivery and partly from breast milk this is known as vertical transmission of hiv drugs given to mothers at the time of delivery prevent vertical transmission however expectant mothers need to first find out whether or not they are hiv-positive they need to go to a clinic that provides voluntary counseling and testing known as vct antenatal clinics in high hiv countries now offer this service as standard care so persuading pregnant women to attend an antenatal clinic is the first step then convincing her to accept testing is the second step on average about 70 do accept with a range of 33100 the reasons why they are reluctant to get tested include cost though the cost is usually subsidized by the organization or government running it fear of emotional trauma fear of losing her husband or partner and fear of social stigma the fear factor may explain why some women agree to get tested but do not return for the test results and why so few notify their partners of their status women who deliver at home have an extra responsibility to take the medication themselves at the right time health psychologists may have a special role to play evaluating womens fears and training counselors to be client-focused and sensitive thailand and uganda have the best records for tackling their hiv problems through open dialog and easy access to services we might learn from them something to apply at home and elsewhere see glick 2005 for more details why is water in developing countries unclean and what are the consequences for health we have all become aware of the viruses bacteria and parasites that lurk in our homes hospitals and outdoor environments and the need to wash our hands in a spirit of international solidarity the centers for disease control and prevention cdc dispatch experts to solve mysterious outbreaks of sars avian influenza west nile virus and nipah virus their goals are to track down the environmental culprit and the unhygienic modes of transmission new and reemerging infections arrive on our shores and we naively send them onwards recall the american groom who boarded a plane to his honeymoon destination knowingly coughing with highly infectious tuberculosis surprisingly personal rather than industrial behavior has been the main culprit in most developing countries eg biran et al 2005 stanton et al 1987 in the usa we take clean water for granted we turn on the tap and drink we have as much water as we want to bathe we have flush toilets at home and in public places in fact each person uses about 375 gallons of water a day for personal consumption the highest in the world however because of our profligate practices we will soon have to start worrying about water elsewhere in the world water has always been a problem  finding enough water finding clean water and finding water to keep clean unclean water unclean disposal of waste personal waste and unclean hygienic practices are the cause of much ill health in developing countries most of this illness could be prevented through health behaviors that create and sustain a clean environment the united nations declared 20052015 as the decade for action on water for life the millennium development goal 7 aims to cut in half the number of people without safe water and proper disposal facilities for waste currently 80 of people in developing countries use clean water but only 50 use toilets or latrines why is water in developing countries unclean and what are the health consequences the most common reason is that people and animals defecate on the ground or in the streams and this top water is used for drinking so two strategies are pursued persuading people to use latrines and having hand-drillers put a pipe down to raise water from a lower water table the former requires a change in health behavior and the latter requires technical skill and materials ethiopia has one of the lowest percentages of people using safe water and latrines only 22 drink safe water and 13 use latrines when we lived in ethiopia we boiled our water before drinking but of course no one else did most rural people defecated on the ground either in the bushes or around their home childrens feces are particularly contaminated so a government needs to ensure that water is brought up from a deeper level and attached to a hand pump cities generally provided the infrastructure for clean water and latrines but rural people had neither viruses bacteria and parasites are too small to see without a lens without an education people tend not to know about these microbes still people like to explain their misfortunes so a number of interesting causal attributions get passed down the generations diarrhea comes from the eruption of baby teeth hepatitis if you urinate at night facing the moon malaria from morning mists a cough and cold from cold weather more serious illnesses come from the evil eye of a person or supernatural spirits that inhabit streams animals and trees these are regarded as traditional beliefs but their similarity around the world suggests that they arise not from a particular culture but from a universal need to understand uncontrolled causes of ill health beliefs may arise from noticed correlations for example baby teeth tend to erupt at an age when children start crawling and crawlers pick up contaminated soil on their fingers and then suck them likewise malaria comes from mosquitoes which propagate on stagnant waters from which mist coincidently arises in the early morning we all have health beliefs it is difficult to break the transmission of such beliefs as we know from the cold belief and from other false hiv beliefs do we need to change such beliefs to change the health behaviors that stop the transmission of microbes what are the microbes and what health behaviors are needed to prevent their disabling effects the most common is rotavirus causing diarrhea also escherichia coli bacteria and cholera there are the common cold viruses which may lead to pneumonia and other more serious respiratory illnesses anemia is largely caused by hookworms which thrive in contaminated soil malaria is caused by the plasmodium parasite transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito trachoma an eye infection is caused by a bacteria carried by flies we still have viral diarrhea and the common cold and cough in the usa but no one dies from them except perhaps the frail elderly we used to have malaria and trachoma but we succeeded in quarantining patients and controlling the mosquitoes and flies that carry them however infections such as these cause death malnutrition and debilitating illness in africa and asia over six million children each year die from diarrhea and pneumonia many more are left weak and malnourished from repeated bouts of these illnesses millions suffer from recurring episodes of malaria and are unable to work while the fever rages but pregnant women and children are most likely to die especially from a cerebral form of malaria or anemia trachoma is active in 84 million people and is already responsible for blindness in 13 million people primary prevention of diarrhea respiratory illness and trachoma can be largely accomplished if everyone used a latrine and washed their hands and face known as sanitation and personal hygiene prevention of malaria requires the use of insecticide-treated nets at home lindblade et al 2004 these are health behaviors that stop infections from being transmitted from one person to another or from an insect to a person as an aside secondary prevention is the second line of action once the person has the illness and needs to prevent adverse consequences prevention of death from diarrhea which is due to dehydration requires oral rehydration sachets and zinc to replenish lost water and nutrients unfortunately uninformed mothers withhold food and fluid in the hopes of stopping water loss prevention of death from pneumonia requires recognition of the signs in a young child and obtaining antibiotics from a health clinic antibiotic creams are also used to prevent blindness from untreated trachoma secondary prevention is costly it is also ineffective in the long-term because a month or year later the microbes are back sanitation personal hygiene and using bed nets are therefore the new health behaviors people need to adopt to prevent the misery of these illnesses surprising research findings demonstrate that providing information about the real causes is insufficient to change peoples habits and secondly that behavior change may precede rather than follow belief and attitude change psychologists are expert at belief attitude and behavior change we have a number of well-tested theories to take to the field but we were not in the field when well-meaning programmers popularized what is called behavior change communication it refers to the use of communication to inform people and thereby persuade them to change their health behaviors the strategy relied solely on the use of information to change beliefs and attitudes however what is known as the kap gap appeared again and again demonstrating the wide gap between knowledge k attitude a and practice p changing peoples knowledge and attitudes about microbes water and latrines did not change their behavior eg bilqis et al 1994 stanton et al 1987 health education by itself is rarely sufficient because most people do not use the systematic route to persuasion glanz et al 2002 petty and cacioppo 1986 well-reasoned arguments and cognitive elaborations do not always guide ones behavior too much theory testing has been conducted with college students who are unsurprisingly cognitive we might learn more about the heuristic route if we tested our theories in rural areas of developing countries here habits are learned young and overlearned through practice what can our theories of behavior change tell us about how to change health behaviors and sustain the change our theories tell us that changing behavior requires an antecedent such as motivation and a reminder cue to trigger the new behavior lots of rehearsal of the new behavior so that it becomes perfected and automatic and pleasant consequences absence of debilitating illness ought to be pleasant enough but it is not a concrete and immediate consequence  no one notices its absence as an assignment students may be encouraged to search through their known theories to line them up in the before during and after categories of abc where aantecedent bbehavior and cconsequences we have so much to learn about applying theories of behavior change to serious health behaviors in developing countries we are still learning from our mistakes i find that the best way to present this information to students is through case studies there are generally one or two research articles on a specific program to change health behaviors and whether or not they were successful students like to dissect and evaluate the program each can be analyzed in terms of theories of behavior change and the abc elements the antecedent element may come in the form of self-determination theory intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and the health belief model which argues for a reminder cue in the environment the behavior element is implemented through the development and rehearsal of new behavior skills with the help of a model derived from social learning and social cognitive theory the consequence element may entail self-efficacy self-reward or a positive health outcome if you use the communication framework students can analyze who was the sender who the receiver and what was the message but then they will want to know if the resultant cognitiveattitude change translated into behavior change to examine its sustainability students may need to know more about social norms and social support in this regard a new model of community readiness pioneered in the usa is now being applied to norm change in developing countries eg mccoy et al 2007 case 1 hand-washing steve luby from the cdc has worked in pakistan and bangladesh to increase hand-washing and thereby reduce childhood diarrhea and pneumonia he has had some success on both counts luby et al 2004 in bangladesh people had an intrinsic motivation and sufficient knowledge the motivation was for appearance and to reduce germs but they were not in the habit of washing we decided to increase hand-washing at two key points  after defecation and before eating  by posting visual reminder cues at these two locations we also encouraged families to have a water bucket with soap just inside the door of their home and beside the latrine a few village sessions were given in which one person from each family was coached while washing their hands with soap and water that person then took responsibility for ensuring that the family washed their hands curtis and cairncross 2003 have reviewed this extensive literature which is now very relevant to north americans women are generally better at this than men but we all need notices posted in critical places to remind us the most successful programs target the whole village to get community acceptance and instill hand-washing as a social norm and also individual families who may need help fitting the new habit into their familys schedule of activities one benefit to targeting women is their influence on children in a bangladeshi project we added hand-washing to a child feeding program aboud et al 2008 we encouraged hand-washing and self-feeding at the same time with the phrase first you wash your hands then you touch the food in weekly group sessions the peer educator washed all the childrens hands before giving them some food according to mothers recall that was one of the most memorable behavioral messages of the 5-week program and raised pre-meal hand-washing from 2 to 62 6 months later save the children usa in bangladesh helps to develop the habit early by having children wash their hands when they arrive at preschool and at mid-morning daycares in the usa also have to be conscientious about hygiene because children pass germs to each other in group settings case 2 face-washing one of the cornerstones of the global elimination of trachoma by 2020 get 2020 includes face-washing mecaskey et al 2003 flies carrying trachoma seek the moisture in childrens eyes so eyelids need to be washed regularly tanzania is a water-poor country so the goal of a long-standing project was not only to promote washing childrens faces but also helping families overcome the water shortage which they said stood in the way of daily hygiene lynch et al 1994 mccauley et al 1990 the social norm implicitly understood by everyone was that precious water and time would be wasted on a childs face no woman wanted to be criticized for being wasteful furthermore her action might be interpreted as vanity provoking the evil eye from an envious neighbor the researchers therefore tried to build a community consensus by demonstrating that 30 people could wash their faces with water from a small gourd peer educators from the village visited individual families to help them identify reusable water for face-washing clean water is not necessary and a convenient time and to reward improvements in the end one village received eye ointment only and their levels of trachoma initially dropped but rose again 1 year later two villages with the behavior change strategy had more clean faces and less trachoma but still not enough to eliminate trachoma entirely a fourth village with the behavior change strategy showed no change at all some women persisted in shaming mothers who washed their childrens faces so the stubborn social norm proved to be an obstacle recent studies find that mass antibiotic treatment for whole villages succeed in reducing trachoma but not in eliminating it consequently without face-washing a resurgence follows case 3 latrine use eliminating animal and human feces from around the house and water sources would go a long way to preventing illness and death building latrines may go part way toward solving the problem any family with a shovel and some local material can build themselves a latrine but latrines have to be used some villages and schools like to keep their donor-supplied latrines spotless and unused one latrine promotion program was tried in rural ethiopia where only 7 of the people use latrines community leaders and health workers constructed demonstration latrines for families to view and copy oloughlin et al 2006 within 6 months 50 of households had built and 45 used their latrine social pressure is usually applied when the community gets involved in bangladesh community groups made a map of where every family defecated and this was discussed by the community at-large who then made a decision to ban open defecation in their village kar 2005 people who could not find the intrinsic motivation to comply presumably found the extrinsic motivation after being subjected to shame the combination of latrines social pressure and accompanying information seems to have led to change in most of these studies knowledge and attitudes by themselves work too slowly and are infrequently translated into behavior instead one might conclude that it is sometimes more effective to change the behavior of a critical mass of people whose behavior then sets a new social norm there is no quick fix for the health problems associated with lack of latrine use you cannot stop babies from sucking their fingers you cannot force everyone to wear shoes to protect them from hookworm there would have to be constant hand- and face-washing that is why 100 latrine use is essential malaria also relies on behavior change though a vaccine in the foreseeable future might obviate the need for nets social marketing in malawi raised peoples awareness of affordable bed nets but could not raise ownership and use above 20 however in kenya an organization called population services international psi started a subsidized program in rural child health clinics two years later the kenyan government distributed free nets to all children less than 5 years without going through a complicated explanation of why children more than adults needed the nets distributors realized that giving the nets to children ensured that they were seen as child protection within 2 years the percentage of children less than 5 years sleeping under nets rose from 7 to 67 noor et al 2007 is this sustainable students can look up kenya bed nets on the internet to find out case 4 abstinence and condom use to prevent infection by the human immunodeficiency virus also requires health behavior change because this is a topic already covered from an american perspective students will know that abstinence and condom use are the preventive measures to be taken by youth many american researchers are transporting ideas and behavior change strategies between the usa and africa simply providing knowledge to african students is insufficient according to a review of these studies gallant and maticka-tyndale 2004 for example bonita stanton et al 1998 found that abstinence was sustained for girls for boys neither abstinence nor condom use was sustained william r brieger et al 2001 found that peer educators who met youth in bars to promote condom use convinced school-going youth to use condoms but did not manage to convert out-of-school youth for the former behavior change preceded and exceeded attitude and knowledge change because hiv infections are increasing most rapidly among youth aged 1524 and because the development of africa depends on its youth social scientists are looking for behavior change strategies with hard evidence for their effectiveness jewkes et al 2006 2008 you can see from the above presentation that behavior change has not been a resounding success in developing countries yet most health experts believe that it is essential for cost-effective prevention of illness where vaccines are not an option i have outlined four cases where health would be immensely improved if psychologists identified a successful behavior change strategy for sustained change this is the new frontier for future research it is also important in the next and final topic to be covered namely feeding children while nine to ten million children less than 5 years die each year from preventable causes another 200 million are unable to reach their psychological potential because they lack food and stimulation the causes and solutions are multileveled growing more food and not losing half of it from field to home distributing food more evenly in communities and families and understanding that small bodies and small brains need more rather than less one-third of children less than 5 years are short for their age meaning they have suffered long-term hunger most of these children live in developing countries particularly in south asia and sub-saharan africa in fact in some countries such as india bangladesh ethiopia niger and zambia 50 of children are stunted stunting or being short for your age is now known to be the central indicator of long-term malnutrition although famine and hunger grab headlines chronically under-fed children go unrecognized by journalists and even by their mothers their mothers think they look about right for their age whereas we might simply underestimate their age and think they look a few years younger than they are many of these children were born low birth weight less than 2500 g because they did not receive sufficient nutrients in utero many continued to receive insufficient breast milk if their mothers did not exclusively breast feed for 6 months however the major source of malnutrition is insufficient and low-quality food after 6 months of age especially between 6 and 24 months when children need energy foods and micronutrients such as zinc and vitamin a black et al 2008 bouts of diarrhea and respiratory illness leave young children further weakened because foods were withheld during illness or not added during recovery malnutrition is therefore a problem that requires coordinated research by psychologists nutritionists and agricultural experts who 2003 we now know from neuroscience and nutrition research that the consequences of early malnutrition are long-lasting malnourished children have less resistance to infection partly because they lack vitamin a and zinc they have less energy to play and explore their world because they lack iron in their diets and lose what they have to hookworm infection many still do not receive iodine from salt fortification iodine and iron are essential nutrients for cognitive and language development even breast milk with its long-chain fatty acids allows for better brain development so there is a great deal of evidence that daily good nutrition in the early years is important for psychological development it is also important for school achievement and later productivity malnourished children also often receive less stimulating talk from parents opportunities for stimulation in the home can be measured with the home inventory which in modified form has been used around the world bradley et al 1996 children need to hear language directed at them in response to their signals and sounds children need to play with objects not ready-made toys but blocks to stack and things to push and pull they need playmates for pretend play and games one study in jamaica gave prominence to the need for psychosocial stimulation in the early years stunted children under 2 years who received stimulation at home from a play leader for 2 years with or without extra food did better on cognitive and language tests several years later than those who received extra food alone here we see that nutrition alone is insufficient the brain needs early stimulation along with food possibly the stimulation kept children mentally and physically active which in turn led them to demand more food a series of papers published in the lancet engle black behrman et al 2007 grantham-mcgregor et al 2007 walker wachs meeks gardner et al 2007 uses figures on stunting and poverty to estimate that over 200 million children or approximately 40 of children less than 5 years do not reach their mental potential the relation between stunting and poor development is so strong that they decided to include all stunted children in this group  30 of less than 5 years to that they added children who were not stunted but lived in extreme poverty ie they lived on less than us1 per day only half of these poor children were stunted including the other half raised the numbers with poor development to 40 their inability to reach their developmental potential is largely determined by malnutrition and inadequate stimulation which in turns leads to poor school achievement and early drop-out the economic prospects of these children are not likely to lift them out of daily wage work or subsistence farming two new areas of research are being conducted in the usa as well as in developing countries one concerns teaching mothers to be more responsive when feeding and stimulating their children a second is school feeding both emphasize the need for food and stimulation which separately and together contribute to child health and development what happens to a child in the first 3 years sets the stage for many years to come extensive research on secure attachment in the usa demonstrates the profound and long-term impact of early security we know that children are born with certain biological tendencies eg temperament and needs eg for warmth tactile stimulation and food research has shown that as obvious as these needs are not all children receive them in a responsive manner eshel et al 2006 kangaroo care is the method for maintaining skin-to-skin contact between a mother and newborn to respond to needs for warmth this is particularly important in places where newborns die because mothers are unaware of newborns needs for warmth and breast milk kangaroo care is promoted in the usa for low birthweight babies but universally encouraged in countries where over 40 of newborns are under 2500 g likewise stimulation must be responsive to the childs needs young children usually signal their need for stimulation by crying waving looking smiling and vocalizing they also signal the desire for a reduction in stimulation by looking away children whose signals are answered learn to continue this kind of mutual communication which eventually becomes shared conversation children whose signals are not answered stop signaling but remain distressed although responsive stimulation and responsive language has been studied extensively in the usa the american size does not fit all akhtar and gernsbacher 2008 argue convincingly that the distal form of communication studied in middle class families namely looking gaze is uncommon in developing countries and even in the usa this is because tactile stimulation is more common likewise others have shown that the american context in which responsive stimulation and language is studied namely motherchild play rarely occurs in developing countries vandermaas-peeler 2002 play is seen as a child activity adults are unlikely to play with child toys or is this necessary so we need to select other contexts to study one of these is reading or looking at pictures the concept of dialogic reading namely having a dyadic conversation about the story book has been successfully exported from the usa and adapted to other countries even if mothers are illiterate they may talk in a responsive manner with their child about pictures it even works well when adapted to the preschool setting where the teacher can generate a responsive discussion with a group of children as heshe reads the story the other context for responsive stimulation and language is mealtime a new field of responsive complementary feeding is documenting the lack of responsive feeding in many countries around the world this leads to malnutrition in developing countries surprisingly we see that the same problem leads to obesity in the usa the underlying theme might be that children stop noticing their bodily cues of hunger and satiety if caregivers feed them in an unresponsive manner it is not that the childs body tells it exactly what to eat and how much but good eating habits should start early and require motherchild coordination in some countries mothers are highly controlling and insist on feeding quickly and forcefully without consideration of the childs slower pace and desire to self-feed these mothers may encounter frequent refusals despite the malnourished state of the child eg aboud et al 2008 in other countries mothers are uninvolved and let children fend for themselves or are permissive and give children whatever they demand none of these styles is responsive this research sheds light on the style of feeding which in combination with the quality of foods can lead to malnutrition or obesity in addition to responsive feeding and stimulation in the home researchers are evaluating the benefits of providing food in a setting where childrens brains are expected to be active namely at school school feeding was common in the usa during the 1930s depression and is still common in poor districts it is now sponsored by the world food program in developing countries where some 18 million children receive a daily meal at school httpwwwwpforgfoodaidschoolfeeding education researchers examine whether it increases enrolment and attendance  it does nutritionists study the kinds of foods that will improve weight and height psychologists question whether students benefit in terms of school achievement as well as broader social and cognitive skills studies in jamaica south africa and kenya along with many others have now been conducted in a nutshell they tell us that animal source foods such as meat or fish have a stronger impact than a vegetable-based meal and the impact is greatest on arithmetic and nonverbal analytic reasoning skills neumann et al 2007 meat also results in students who are more active take leadership roles and initiate peer interactions furthermore the impact on mental outcomes is greatest for younger children in the early school years finally in line with the theme of this section the impact is greater if food is combined with a stimulating educational program this final section brings us full circle education is known to be important along with the nutrition necessary for young brains to process information and learn however nutrition must start early at birth to prepare the childs physical mental and social health nutrition is cumulative in that the body cannot fully catch up if given food at 5 years but not earlier however the effects of responsive feeding behavior and food on childrens long-term development are still being explored more needs to be done to examine how nutrition and stimulation combine to promote all aspects of health  physical mental and social  in the preschool and school years nutrition and education are also important for maternal health but future research here needs to examine how to change delivery practices and their effects on mothers and newborns survival similarly ongoing research is examining ways to change other health behaviors and sustain these behaviors in particular behaviors that prevent debilitating diseases are at the forefront of international research american researchers from many disciplines are contributing to these exciting new developments bringing ideas from the usa to developing countries and returning with strategies to improve our own lives aboud f e 1998 health psychology in global perspective thousand oaks sage lewis s 2005 race against time toronto on

httpwwwwhointnutrition  elderly people and responses to covid-19 in 27 countries j daoust -f wen-jun tu   the covid-19 pandemic has forced governments to enact drastic public health measures in order to minimize the impact of the disease these include social distancing but also clear recommendations of lockdown for the elderly that said if my grandmother was alive it would have been very hard to convince her not to go out and play cards at the social club even if the head of the government that she voted for was urging elderlies to stay home beyond my anecdotical grandmother we have seen many headlines in the media about generational differences the boston globe titled an article call your mom the generational politics of covid-19 and the telegraph wrote generation me must start thinking about others if were to stop the spread of coronavirus as a headline moreover on top of the media coverage there is a burgeoning number of data on age differences in attitudes and compliance to preventive measures in the context of the covid-19 epidemiologists are crystal clear age is the most important factor in diminishing ones chances to survive the covid-19 especially after 65 years of age 12 hence governments strategy around the world has notably focused on targeting elderly people and trying to convince them to comply with the public health preventive measures 3 given the well-known greater mortality rate among elderly people and the clear objective of the governments around the world it is very reasonable to expect the elderly people to be the most dutiful group in the population that is we should expect them to be more willing to isolate if they were told to do so and to comply with preventive measures to a greater extent than their younger fellow citizens in this research i test these expectations using the imperial college london and yougov dataset it is to my knowledge the most extensive dataset including attitudes toward covid-19 and self-reported compliance to preventive measures the results from 27 countries are unfortunately clear and quite troubling that is elderly peoples prospect to self-isolate and willingness to do so is not the greatest among the whole population it is very similar to people in their 50s and 60s despite the fact that they are much more likely to die from the disease moreover the same applies to their level of compliance with many different covid-19 preventive measures this research improves our understanding and response to the covid-19 pandemic with clear descriptions methodological implications and normative concerns i it provides the first thorough description of the most vulnerable populations attitudes and compliance to covid-19 preventive measures in a comparative perspective ii the results clearly suggest that scholars interested in the covid-19 pandemic should not take for granted the linearity of the effect of age ii it clearly shows that governments strategies are not meeting their objectives and thus should be revisited the pandemic is far from over and we need to find better ways to minimize the number of deaths while improving our understanding of elderly people is not a panacea it would help minimize the number of deaths although we should be very cautious in dichotomizing age when it comes to deciding who needs intensive care by giving the resources to young people and not to the elderly for an important discussion on the ethical considerations see monter-odasso et al 4 age is clearly the most important factor in predicting the odds of surviving the covid-19 disease 12 in fact this is among the most robust consensus among scientists in an ideal world that alone should justify the expectation that older people will be more dutiful in terms of following public health recommendations however the issue is not that straightforward covid-19 is not the only disease for which the consequences are known to be the worst among older people this is the case for invasive pneumococcal disease or heat stroke among others in both cases there are existing preventive measures however schneeberg et al 5 have shown that among canadians the relationship between age and having gotten a pneumococcal vaccine is non-linear 45 of 65-69-year-olds did so a proportion that increases to 67 among the 70-79-year-olds but decreases by 6 percentage points for the 80 year-old group 5 moreover khare et al 6 demonstrated that among english people where there was an important heat wave in 2013 older people were not more likely to have greater scores on always keeping out of the sun between 100 and 1500 the 26-60-year-olds were more likely to comply with that preventive behaviour but the 76 year-olds were not compared to the youngest 1825 group that said the mortality rate of covid-19 among elderly people is objectively speaking much greater than other diseases such as pneumococcal disease or heat stroke moreover the governments and citizens reactions and measures to minimize the consequences of that disease are of a totally different scale hence it is very reasonable to expect that older people will be more dutiful when it comes to following the recommendation of public health agencies and governments this is what one of the first studies in the united states showed older americans were more likely to perceive covid-19 as a significant crisis and as a threat to peoples health 7 the effect was quite linear in both cases the older the respondents the more likely they were to perceive the covid-19 as a threat several academic studies also examined the impact of age on attitudes toward the covid-19 pandemic and compliance with different preventive measures many studies measure the effect of age using linear models which is consistent with the raw findings of the pew research center cited above and is in fact very intuitivesee among others painter and qiu 8 for a study on the us pfattheicher et al 9 for a focus on the united kingdom and germany and brouard et al 10 for france some do allow non-linear relationships between age and covid-19 related attitudes or behaviours but they only do so as a control ie they focus other explanatory factors and thus only include age to obtain more precise estimates and do not discuss its implications 1112 in other words the majority of research does not include age as having a potentially non-linear effect on different variables related to covid-19 however two studies provide more information on age and elderlies response to covid-19 first barari et al 13 do not focus on age but display their descriptive statistics over four different age groups including those over 60 years old although the authors do not discuss thoroughly the age effects it appears that the 60 age group is the most disciplined or dutiful group in regards to all nine attitudes or measures of compliance towards preventive rules and proceduressee their figs 1 and 4 thus barari et al 13 seem to confirm the expected relationship citizens are more dutiful with ageat least in their sample of italian people another very insightful research is that of canning et al 14 who study a sample of us respondents the authors allow non-linearity in their analyses by dividing age in six different groupssee in particular their fig 3 their findings not only show a non-linear relationship among age groups but also that age has a contrary effect on social distancing than expected during the covid-19 pandemic this research while insightful is limited to a us sample includes a low number of observations among certain age groups like the 70 years of age and focuses on social distancing in this research i aim to extend the sample to include 27 countries with much more observations in each age group and study more than just social distancing below i detail the empirical strategy to do so the institute of global health innovation ighi at imperial college london and the polling firm yougov have partnered to gather global insights on citizens perceptions and responses to the covid-19 pandemic 15 the project started the first week of april and surveys have now been systematically conducted in 29 different countriesfor a discussion on timing see the robustness check section i combined all the individual country datasets that include a nationally representative sample of each population i thus excluded china and india which do not fit this criterion that is their samples were not nationally representative the following countries are thus included australia brazil canada denmark finland france germany hong kong italy japan malaysia south korea mexico netherlands norway philippines saudi arabia singapore south korea spain sweden taiwan thailand united arab emirates uae united kingdom uk united states usa and vietnam while not exhaustive this sample of countries provides a great deal of variance in terms of many important features such as quality of democracy economic development and inequality cultural diversity political institutions etc it is to my knowledge the most extensive comparative individual-level and covid-19 related dataset overall it includes a total of 72417 respondents across 27 countries with an average age of 45 years old a standard deviation of 15 and 51 of respondents being women as mentioned the samples are nationally representative of a country based on age sex and region s1 and s2 tables provides more information on the dataset and the variables finally see the sms first page on how to access the replication files the surveys systematically included measures of attitudes and self-reported behaviors related to the covid-19 the two attitudes were i prospective self-isolation and ii willingness to isolate the correlation among the two does not cause concern pearsons r of 31 the question wording and the answer choices are detailed below prospective self-isolation thinking about the next 7 days  would you isolate yourself after feeling unwell or having any of the following new symptoms a dry cough fever loss of sense of smell loss of sense of taste shortness of breath or difficulty breathing yes no not sure willingness to isolate if you were advised to do so by a healthcare professional or public health authority to what extent are you willing or not to self-isolate for 7 days very willing somewhat willing neither willing nor unwilling somewhat unwilling very unwilling not sure prospective self-isolation is used as a dichotomous variable where yes is coded as 1 and no or not sure as 0 the willingness to isolate is rescaled from 0 to 1 where 1 corresponds to very willing and not sure is coded as 05 ie the same value as neither willing nor unwilling to measure self-reported behaviors we rely on a question asking about the frequency of several preventive measures self-reported behavior regarding preventive measures will certainly entail a social desirability bias 16 that said it would prevent inference only if there is systematic bias regarding who is affected by the social desirability bias we do not have any theoretical reasons to believe sothis is confirmed by larsen et al 17 who made use of an experimental design to tackle this issue in other words the bias could ideally be reduced and let citizens more readily admit non-compliance but it should not prevent statistical inference the question was formulated as follows with the different items shown below thinking about the last 7 days how often have you taken the following measures to protect yourself or others from coronavirus covid-19 i did not include the following four items because they would overwhelmingly apply or overwhelmingly not apply to elderly people i avoided going to hospital or other healthcare settings ii avoided working outside your home iii avoided letting your children go to school university iv slept in separate bedrooms at home when normally you would share a bedroomsee the first test of the robustness checks section for details answer choices were always frequently sometimes rarely not at all we rescaled all the variables in a 0 to 1 range excluding the not sure descriptive statistics for every variable are shown in s2 table however i combined all the 16 items listed above to generate an index of compliance with preventive measures cronbachs   86 for the sake of parsimony i discuss some particular items that prove to be outliers in the findings see the robustness check section for a discussion on the operationalization of the items finally age ranges from 18 to 90 14 respondents were in their 90s but i excluded age values for which there was less than 10 observations hence the range 1890 fig 2 below shows the distribution of age beyond the scope of the dataset one of its main advantages is that the number of observations allow us to study many age values there are even several hundreds of respondents over 60 years of age i do not aim to provide a definition of elderly people for the simple reason that of course it is a socially constructed concept and can vary among individuals and across countries are findings also do not defer whether we consider an elderly to be 60 65 or 70 that said the number of people that are 80 years old or older is quite limited s3 table shows the number of observations using 10-year categories and we can see that there are only 544 respondents within the 8090 years old range as in several inquiries in social sciences it is likely that the dataset used in this research does not include a homogenous group of 80 year-olds due to the lower number of observations in that category for an example see blais and daoust 18 who mention that they are less confident about their subsample of 75 year-old respondents this should be kept in mind and explains the focus on the 1880 years old range considering our main interest one can access the distribution of age and the measures of attitudes and compliance towards covid-19 preventive measures in s1 fig the bivariate relationships of age with the prospective self- isolation and the willingness to do so are shown in fig 2 to allow for non-linearity i used local regressions with the kernel epanechnikov function and a bandwidth of 08 see the robustness checks section for a discussion of this choice in both cases using age as a linear predictor of these two attitudes toward covid-19 preventive measures would indicate a strong panel a or somewhat important panel b relationships however this interpretation would be misleading for the simple reason that the relationship is not linear in panel a the relationship is flat between 70 and 75 years of age and declines until the age of 90 for the reasons mentioned above we should be careful with the 80-90-year-olds even if the confidence intervals increase as the number of observations diminishes however it still leaves us with a quite pessimistic interpretation in the most optimistic case elderly people would not be substantially more likely to isolate compared to their fellow citizens in their 50s and 60s in panel b on the willingness to isolate the effect of age is much smaller but clearly positive until 60 years of age from that point on there is substantially no relationship for both attitudes we clearly fail to see an increased prospective disciplined or willingness for people after 70 years old panel a and 60 years of age panel b this is surprising and quite troubling given the governments strategy to publicize the fact that elderly people are much more vulnerable and more likely to need intense care or die from covid-19 i now turn to compliance with preventive measures as it is clear from eyeballing fig 3 this is no substantial effect of age on ones score of compliance with covid-19 preventive measures overall the score for every age is substantively similar and is around 12 it ranges from a minimum of 119 to a maximum of 124 for a total effect of 05 on a 0 to 16 scale put differently it represents less than a fifth of the standard deviation of the index there are thus two main conclusions to fig 3 on the one hand the baseline level of compliance with preventive measures is quite high although not overwhelmingly high especially given that the maximum is 16 on the other hand there is no substantial effect of age the index included 16 very different items in s2 fig i replicated the local regression for each item overall the main conclusion remains the same there is no substantial effect of age on compliance to covid-19 public health measures however there are some interesting variances by far the most interesting concerns wearing a mask outside the home fig 4 panel a shows the results the effect of age on wearing a mask outside is negative quite linear and the strongest among all the relationships for individual items from 20 to 60 years old there is a decrease of about 15 and there is another decrease of the same magnitude from 60 to 80 years of age before stabilizing the total effect is thus of 3 on a 0 to 1 scale it is astonishing that this particular age group 6080 years old which is much more likely to die from the disease than their younger fellow citizens comply to a lesser extent with the preventive measure of wearing a masksee feng et al 2020 for a discussion on recommendations around the world regarding face masks in community settings slightly reassuring the other three items for which the effect is noteworthy although not even close to the negative impact of age on wearing a mask outside the home are positive older people are more likely to have avoided public transportation small gatherings and having guests over these effects are of a little more than 10 in this section i test whether different choices in my approach would lead to different conclusions first i have excluded four items out of twenty in order to generate the index of compliance see footnote 3 but including them does not alter the findings as shown in s3 fig there is no substantial relationship second i have coded the not sure as people who would not self-isolate if they were told do so for the prospective isolation measure and i have put them at 05 with the neither willing nor unwilling for the compliance items s4a and s4b fig shows that excluding the not sure instead of putting them at 0 in the former case and excluding them instead of coding them at the neutral point in the latter case does not change the results second i opted for an elegant way of presenting the results and did not include covariates to keep other factors constant some might worry about the impact of the national context and time over the five weeks it is likely that respondents attitudes are shaped by what happens in their country but i cannot think of convincing mobilizing national factors or time that would affect the relationship and not the distributions of age and attitudes toward covid-19 and compliance to preventive measures that said i replicated the models for the main results using logistic and ols regressions and used age as a categorical variable with values ranging from 18 to 90 to allow for non-linear effects i then estimated the predicted probability to self-isolate for every two-years change given the number of observations among respondents in their 80s that strategy allows to include country fixed-effect and covariates for time and individual-level variables the dataset does not include the exact date of the interview but as shown in s1 table the dates of the field are included hence i included dichotomous variables capturing whether the survey was fielded the first two weeks of april the last two weeks of april or in the first week of may for individual-level variable i include gender employment status in 8 categories having children at home and living alone 20 s5 fig shows the results with country fixed-effects covariates for time and individual-level controls the patterns are substantially similar however one may also want to include region fixed-effects to adopt a more conservative approach in terms of within-country regional differences the 27 countries vary in terms of how many regions they have but yougov provides a variable indicating respondents region based on what is used for the regional quotas it can be state lnder region province etc there are on average 89 regions per country s6 fig replicates the previous figure with the only exception that i added 236 region fixed effects this kind of estimation strategy controls for the fact that people in the uk are in the uk as opposed to another country however it also controls for a respondent in for example wales a region of the uk for whom the reality related to covid-19 might be different compared to respondents in other regions in the uk such as scotland or england for example as can be seen this does not alter the substantial interpretation of the findings one could think about adding covariates like 236 dummies to capture every region minus one as a reference category in the 27 countries included also mixed-effects logistic and linear regressions could be used where individuals are nested within countriesor within regions then within countries all these approaches do not alter the main findings third i showed local regressions with the default bandwidth of 08 s7 and s8 figs replicate the findings with a bandwidth of 07 and 09 these results not only confirm my conclusions but suggest an even more pessimistic scenario that is for attitudes about prospective self-isolation and willingness to isolate the lower confidence intervals decrease among the oldest to a level that is similar to the youngest people in their 20s all in all the difference is somewhat modest but points toward an even more negative picture governments around the world are working to reduce the number of deaths caused by the covid-19 while overcoming this pandemic relies on an efficient strategy that involves the whole population the elderly people are disproportionately affected by this disease thus attitudes toward covid-19 and compliance toward preventive measures among the older citizens will have a greater effect on minimizing the number of deaths hence there is a burgeoning literature on age and covid-19 which will be crucial in improving our responses to the pandemic however we have no systematic comparative perspective and most importantly age has been conceived to have a linear impact on a variety of dependent variables related to covid-19 i am not blaming scholars as even early rigorous work has shown results consistent with this view in the us but not only 7 13 that said i provided a thorough analysis of the impact of age with a focus on elderly people allowing for non-linear effects moreover i did so using a comparative perspective including 27 countries the findings show that the elderly people ie the most vulnerable population are not systematically more responsive in terms of prospective self-isolation if they were told to do so and willingness to isolate moreover they are not more disciplined in terms of compliance with preventive measures especially with wearing a face mask when outside their home this behaviour will become especially important when social distancing rules will be loosened this is surprising because it is very reasonable to expect that those who are more likely to be hospitalized andor die from the covid-19 will be more disciplined and dutiful whether we focus on psychological reactions such as fear or rational calculus we always have the same expectation not only is this surprising but it is also troubling why do we find such results clearly it is not due to a ceiling effect there is room for improvement in every figure shown in this research and especially when dealing with compliance such as the index or wearing a face mask there may be short-term or more deeply rooted predispositions among older people that can partly explain this non-effect but either way governments must revisit their approach in order to minimize the number of deaths caused by covid-19 methodologically speaking this research is also important for scholars studying covid-19 some have put effort to capture a non-linear effect but this is not the case for the majority of the work in particular while using a us sample and focusing on social distancing canning et al 14 mention holding other factors constant people over 50 years of age have less than half the expected number of close contacts than people age 1829 this sounds like good news but we know that older people especially after 60 are more affected hence we should not see a positive effect of age until 50 but rather until 70 and ideally more all in all focusing on age is not a panacea but it disproportionately helps to minimize the number of deaths 2122 by contributing to the research on age and the covid-19 i hope to improve our response which will lead us closer to that objective  a cascade of causes that led to the covid-19 tragedy in italy and in other european union countries igor rudan   the perception of the covid-19 pandemic in my homeland croatia has been based on two main sources of information over the past three weeks on the one hand our civil protection headquarters as well as all of the experts and scientists to whom media space has been provided called for caution but without any panic they emphasized that this was not a cataclysm but an epidemic involving a serious respiratory infectious disease the cause of this disease is the new coronavirus for which we do not have a vaccine therefore it can be expected that the disease will be very dangerous for the elderly and to those who are already ill so it was an unknown danger worthy of caution but our epidemiologists remained calm they knew that they would be able to estimate the epidemics development using data and then control the situation with anti-epidemic measures and through several lines of defence 1 on the other hand the people of croatia also followed the events in italy from there day after day apocalyptic news came with incredibly large numbers of infected and dead daily reports from italy seemed completely incompatible with what the experts and scientists in croatia were saying some have concluded that a scenario similar to that in italy if not worse is inevitable for croatia the population was in a very confusing situation in this text i will try to penetrate the very core of the infodemia that has been present in the media across many european countries as well as on social networks over the past three weeks i will explain how that disturbing situation arose and offer a scientific explanation for it this seems important at this point because the italian tragedy with the covid-19 epidemic has unfortunately hindered the credible and scientifically-based communication of the epidemiological profession to the population of croatia in my article 20 key questions and answers on coronavirus posted on the 9th of march 2020 on indexhr 1 in answer to question number 18 with the effectiveness of quarantine in china can we draw some lessons from this pandemic i stated if the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the public health systems of individual countries are functioning these will be very important lessons in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerous we are now slowly entering a phase where many countries have been exposed to the pandemic for sufficiently long to be able to make some first estimates of their results from these days up until the end of the pandemic we will see that covid-19 will divide the world into countries that have relied on epidemiology and followed the maths and the logic of the epidemic as well as those in which this isnt the case and many sadly probably quite unnecessarily  will suffer an epidemic is a serious threat to entire nations during which citizens interest in other topics may vanish quite rapidly we could see that happening quite clearly in the past several weeks the task of epidemiologists is to constantly have tables in front of them with a large number of epidemic parameters reliable field figures and formulas to monitor the epidemics development and to know the laws of epidemics in order to organize the implementation of anti-epidemic measures in a timely manner and thus protect the population now lets look at the countries that we can already point out as being successful in their response to this new challenge first and foremost there is china it has completely suppressed the huge epidemic in wuhan which spread to all thirty of its provinces in doing so it relied on the advice of its epidemiologic legend 83-year-old zhong nanshan twenty years ago nanshan gained authority by suppressing sars although surprised by the epidemic they managed to suppress covid-19 throughout china through expert and determined measures they did so over just seven weeks with the death toll eventually coming to a halt at less than 4000 2 by comparison it would be as if the number of deaths in croatia as a result of this epidemic was kept at around 14 in total furthermore if at some point you find yourself caught up in the uncertainty surrounding the danger of covid-19 you should be able to learn more if you look at the state of things in singapore despite intensive exchanges of people and goods with china since the outbreak of the epidemic singapore has a total of 732 infected people as i am writing this article with two dead and 17 more in intensive care 2 for a long time this city-state has been nurturing the ambition to lead the world in all measurable parameters from this it must be concluded that the developments in singapore are a likely reflection of the real danger of covid-19 in a country that is based on knowledge technology good organization and general responsibility also singapore had a relatively recent sars experience and learned from it so they built capacity and ensured speed in their response to future challenges the situation in singapore therefore is an indicator of the effects of the virus on the population to the extent that it is truly unavoidable any deviation towards something worse than the singaporean results will be less and less of a consequence of the danger of the virus itself and increasingly attributable to human omissions in doing so human errors that can lead to the unnecessary spread of the infection are 1 omission to properly understand the epidemic parameters 2 reluctance to make decisions based on the changes in those parameters and 3 the irresponsible behavior of the population in complying with instructions from the authorities to confirm the statements about singapore lets look at the current situation in other countries that rely on knowledge and expertise and have good organization they were also the most common destinations for the spread of the epidemic from china in the first wave hong kong japan south korea the united arab emirates and qatar there were only 519 infected people in hong kong at the time of writing this article with 4 deaths and 5 more people in a serious condition in japan 1499 were infected 49 were dead and 56 were in a serious condition in south korea which had a severe epidemic behind its first line of defence 9478 were infected 144 died and 59 were seriously ill in the united arab emirates 405 were infected 2 died and 2 were seriously ill and in qatar 562 were infected 6 were seriously ill and still no one had died from covid-19 2 fortunately croatia is now up there with all of these countries with 657 infected 5 dead and 14 more seriously ill 2 as you can see pretty clearly from all of these figures in countries that rely on the knowledge and the profession and properly applied anti-epidemic measures covid-19 is a disease that should not be life-threatening for more than a tiny percentage of all infected people this conclusion can still be reached if it is properly understood that the information on the number of cases and deaths at the website httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus 2 is based on positive tests and not on everyone who is actually infected we need to do further research to understand the denominator for the case-fatality rate properly what then is happening in italy as well as in spain but to a good extent also in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and portugal i did not include germany sweden the netherlands the united kingdom and the united states in this group of countries for now this is because at least for some time during the pandemic they have clung to the idea of intentionally letting the virus spread and infect at least part of the population given all of the previous examples of a successful epidemiological response and what is now practically the coexistence of people with the new coronavirus in asias most developed countries how is it possible for italy to have nearly 85 000 infected people and over 9000 deaths at the time of this article or that spain has 72 000 infected people and more than 5600 deaths and france has almost 33 000 infected people and 2000 deaths or that even switzerland which everyone would expect to see among the most successful countries in any of these world rankings could already have 13 250 infected people and 240 deaths with 203 more critically ill people 2 the causes of all of this are however becoming increasingly clear to science first of all there was probably a premature relaxation around the real danger of covid-19 in europe the epidemic development by the end of february was already quite similar to the one seen previously with sars and mers in both of those epidemics the primary focal point was suppressed then the virus was stopped using the first line of defence  identifying all those infected tracing their contacts and isolating them all  in more than 25 countries by the end of february 2020 it was already clear in the case of covid-19 that it would be successfully suppressed in its primary focal point  wuhan it was also already stopped using the first line of defence in another thirty chinese provinces and surrounding countries in asia then on the 28th of february the first estimates of death rates were published suggesting that it was a disease with a death rate significantly lower than that of sars and mers 34 at that time it was reasonable to expect that the epidemic could soon be stopped as a result the world health organisation delayed the declaration of a pandemic until the 11th of march and the world stock markets increased by about 10 percent from the 27th of february to the 3rd of march 56 but for any unknown virus premature relaxation is very dangerous as will be shown later with covid-19 second it is possible that chinese tourists from wuhan were visiting northern italy in january and february 2020 fever does not accompany all covid-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission is possible so infected tourists could have been allowed to enter italy even where proper checks at the airports were in place 4 italy cancelled flights linking it directly with china on january 31 following the news of the epidemic spread 7 some investigative journalists hypothesized although this has not been confirmed that it may be possible that the phenomenon of the mass immigration of chinese workers to northern italy may have contributed to the early introduction and spread of the virus 8 tens of thousands of chinese migrants work in the italian textile industry producing fashion items leather bags and shoes with the brand made in italy they worked in conditions where they were cramped closely together which would facilitate the spread 8-10 reuters and the reporter d t max wrote about this phenomenon back in 2014 and 2018 respectively 910 partly as a result of this development direct flights between wuhan and italy were introduced previous reports claimed that there may be many illegal migrants among those workers 910 whether through chinese tourists textile workers or through some other route the novel coronavirus has triggered an epidemic behind the back of the italian first line of defence which remained unrecognized in the first few weeks third infected people from northern italy spent their weekends at european ski resorts although we do not know if the arrival of the warmer weather will stop the transmission of coronavirus what we can assume is that the cold helped it to spread that is why european ski resorts became real nurseries of coronavirus in late february and in early march as many media reported 1112 in this way more infected people emerged behind the front lines of defence in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and spain their first lines of epidemiological defence focused on air transport from asia not on their own skiing returnees where indeed no one would expect a large number of chinese people from wuhan to be fourth although spain may not have had as many skiers as other european countries in this cluster the virus may have been introduced to them through a biological bomb on the 19th of february a champions league football match was held between italys atalanta and spains valencia atalanta is a team from a small city of bergamo italy which has 120 000 inhabitants this was possibly the biggest game in atalantas history as it progressed through group stages to the last 16 in the european champions league the local stadium was not large enough for everyone who wanted to attend the game so it was moved to a large san siro stadium in milan the official attendance was 45 792 meaning that a third of bergamos population with around 30 busses travelled from bergamo to milan and then wandered the streets of milan before the game 1314 unfortunately for spain nearly 2500 valencia fans also travelled to the match as atalanta scored four goals a third of bergamos population was hugging and kissing in the cold weather four times and spent the day closely together this is likely why it became the worst-hit region of italy by some distance moreover at least a third of valencia football squad also got infected with a virus and later played alaves in the spanish league where further players of that team got infected this football game has certainly contributed to the virus making its way to spain 14 fifth it is very important for the early development of the epidemiological situation in each country to look at which subset of the population the virus has spread among northern italy has a very large number of very old people in the early stages of the epidemic the virus began to spread in hospitals and retirement homes 1516 they did not have nearly enough capacities to assist in severe cases among already sick elderly and immunocompromised people the virus spread more easily and faster and had a significantly higher death rate in some other countries such as germany most of the patients in the early stages were between the ages of 20 and 60 and were returning from skiing trips or were business people 17 therefore such countries have a significantly lower death rate among those first infected sixth this is likely the most important factor required to explain the current situation in italy and other european union eu countries there must have been either the omission to monitor the mathematical parameters of the epidemic or perhaps the lack of clear communication of the dangers or the indecisiveness to adopt isolation measures for the population it is difficult to know at this time which of these three causes is the most important  a combination of them all is entirely possible however the nature of the omission largely explains the terrible figures on infections and deaths that are being reported from italy and other eu countries on a daily basis to understand the tragedy in italy and europe we must first return to wuhan when the epidemic broke out the chinese first had to isolate the virus then they needed to read its genetic code and develop a diagnostic test it all took time as the epidemic spread rapidly throughout the city when they began testing for coronavirus between the 18th and the 20th of january they had double-digit numbers of infected people 3 those numbers apparently stagnated so the epidemiologists did not know what that might mean but on the 21st of january the number of newly infected people jumped to more than 100 on the 22nd of january it jumped to more than 200 3 this was a clear signal to chinese epidemiologists that an exponential increase in the number of infected people was occurring at that time they had nothing further to wait for or to think about if the virus breaks through the first line of defence  and the chinese didnt even have any since the epidemic started there unannounced  then a quarantine measure needs to be triggered this prevents the virus from spreading further and generating a large number of infected people through the exponential growth of the epidemic after such a sudden declaration of quarantine in wuhan the huge epidemic wave had actually just begun to show everyone who was already infected began to develop the disease in the next several days the maximum daily number of new infected cases was reached on the 5th of february on that day alone as many as 3750 new patients were registered in wuhan 3 this means that the jump from about 125 to about 250 newly registered infected persons signals to epidemiologists that they should expect an epidemic surge in 14 days with as many as 3750 newly infected people at the peak let us now explain the time delay between people getting infected with a virus and the health systems ability to detect those infected based on their symptoms the new coronavirus kills primarily because it spreads incredibly quickly among humans as a result it creates a gigantic number of infected and sick in a very short time period table 1 among those who are sick about 5 will require intensive hospital care if all of them could receive optimal care we would be able to save nearly everyone but if they all get very sick at the same time then we cannot offer adequate care to everyone as a result most critical cases will die this is the main reason why this virus kills so many people in those countries which allowed it to spread freely for too long this is shown in a simple way in this table based on day-to-day growth in a number of cases by 26 which was a very realistic scenario for most eu countries with this in mind let us now look at the italian and other eu countries reaction to their own epidemic in view of what croatia did in the early stages of infection spreading in a country one or two infected persons are usually detected daily personally i advised the croatian authorities and public through social networks to start seriously thinking about social exclusion measures when they noticed a first notable shift from the first 10 confirmed infections towards the first 20 infected people on the 12th of march i posted a facebook status entitled contrast is the mother of clarity which was viewed and shared by many thousands of my fellow croatians who have been following my popular science series on the pandemics  the quarantine of wuhan this status has also been shared by many online and printed newspapers and media in croatia including radio stations 18 in that status i suggested that croatia should consider a large quarantine because we had already jumped from 14 to 19 infected people the day before however i also warned them to weigh this decision carefully against economic implications and their expected long-term effects on health the very next day on the 13th of march a decision was made in croatia to close the schools 1819 that meant that up to that point croatia completed two of the most important tasks in this pandemic the first task was to hold its first line of defence this was being achieved through the identification of infected cases imported from other countries and their isolation and that of all their contacts croatia completed this first task better than the other eu countries based on an average percentage increase of cases between the 3rd of march and the 17th of march then from march 13th croatia also began to introduce social exclusion measures at the right time thus successfully carrying out the second key task in controlling its own epidemic many credits for this should be attributed to its epidemiologists who work at the croatian institute for public health but what went wrong with these two measures in italy and other eu countries on the 21st of february the number of confirmed infected cases in italy jumped from 3 to 20 as italy is a more populous country than croatia it might have still been too hasty to send all of lombardy into quarantine based on this but on the 22nd of february the jump was from 20 to 62 cases and this should lead to some serious thought about social isolation measures a couple of days later on the 24th of february they reached a situation very similar to that in wuhan before a strict quarantine the number of confirmed infections jumped from 155 to 229 this was particularly worrying in italy because they did not seem to proactively test at that time either the jump from 155 to 229 in combination with the wuhan experience should have suggested that they would have at least 50 000 infected people under the predicted curve of the epidemic wave and they were just seeing its early beginning of it such a large number would imply that about 2500 affected would require intensive care units at the time lombardy had only about 500 such units in governmentstate facilities and another 160 in private health care facilities 20 as early as the 24th of february it was clear that there would be many deaths in lombardy weeks later with epidemics everything goes awry because the infected get sick a week later and some of the patients then die ten to twenty days later this time delay is a critically important factor that needs to be taken into account however even then the italians did not declare a quarantine they did not do so on the 29th of february either when the total number of infected people rose from 888 to 1128 those figures implied that in mere days they would be having about 15 000 newly infected people each day they did not declare quarantine on the 4th of march either when the number of infected people exceeded 3000 and when the world stock exchanges started to fall again it had then become clear to most epidemiologists who have been advising global investors that an unexpected tragedy was about to unravel in italy and this was now inevitable at that point italy already had at least 30 000 infected people spreading the infection the quarantine was declared for lombardy on the 8th of march 7 the day before the number of cases had already risen and exponentially so to as many as 5883 to appreciate the problem with epidemic spread in the population behind the first line of defence this is similar to borrowing 1000 from someone on the 29th of february with an interest rate of 26 each day meaning an interest rate of 26 on top of that the next day and so on furthermore there did not seem to be enough clear and decisive communication with the public the news of the quarantine for lombardy was in fact leaked to the media before it was officially announced this led to a quick escape of many students to the south of the country to their homes carrying the contagion with them as a result on the 10th of march all of italy had to be quarantined 7 in an already difficult situation where every new day of delay meant another thousand or more people dying as we can all notice these days there were numerous media reports warning that the population may not have taken those measures as seriously as the chinese when they introduced orders to their population in wuhan 2122 any indiscipline under such grave circumstances could have allowed the virus to take yet another step quite easily with each new step another 26 of interest was added to everything before that and then 26 on everything on everything before that again that is the power of exponential growth characteristic of the free spread of the virus in the population many italians and then spaniards as well as residents of several other wealthy countries in europe had their lives cut short by their lack of recognition of the dangers of exponential function during the spread of the epidemic delaying quarantine for a week made the epidemic ten times worse than it should have been delaying it for two weeks made it a hundred times worse and after two weeks of it being finally proclaimed all those who may have not taken the orders seriously enough would have made the epidemic several hundred times worse this means that in italy and possibly in spain too we are now observing the covid-19 epidemic that is more than a hundred times worse than it should have been in a country that was much better prepared for the response such as singapore taiwan hong kong or the united arab emirates to appreciate what is happening in italy it is enough to think of this sentence alone at least 100 times fewer people would die each day if quarantine had been declared 2 weeks earlier and had the population stuck to the recommendations during those fourteen days between 23rd of february and 7th of march they allowed the virus to spread freely and infect a huge number of people  maybe even up to a million or perhaps more it is very difficult to know at this point this would mean tens of thousands of people in need of intensive care with about ten times fewer units available nationwide about half of those who fall seriously ill will not survive without the necessary support at this point whenever we hear that 1000 people died in italy in one day we should know that the casualties would only add up to 10 had the quarantine been declared just a couple of weeks earlier i appreciate that it seems implausible that the delay of a political decision like the introduction of quarantine by just two weeks may mean the difference between 100 deaths and 10 000 deaths in the 21st century however i am afraid that this is unfortunately the reality of the exponential growth of the number of infected during an epidemic what does this mean for the public in countries like croatia who were confused and in awe of the events in italy they should know that they did not observe what the covid-19 epidemic should actually look like in a country where the epidemiological service and its communication with those in power works well as it does in singapore taiwan or south korea in italy we have unfortunately noticed the consequence of a free spread of the epidemic for too long such a development was not predictable the biggest surprise of this pandemic to date to the community of epidemiologists is undoubtedly the lack of response by the authorities of many eu countries to the apparent spread of the pandemic at an exponential rate for weeks leading to a very large numbers of infected people in a very short time it is even more surprising that although the italian example exposed this problem quite clearly a similar scenario is now happening in several other european countries how and why could this happen in italy and then in other countries in the european union eu i will try to offer at least some hypotheses first eu countries have been living in prosperity for decades focused mainly on their economies aside from the economic questions they have not had any challenges that theyve had to answer to swiftly and decisively that would measure up to this one back in the 1960s vaccines were introduced against most major infectious diseases especially childhood ones malaria is no longer present in europe and tuberculosis has been treated similarly for decades the challenge of hivaids in the 1980s is now being successfully controlled with antiretroviral drugs liver inflammation is treated mainly by clinicians the impact of influenza is controlled through vaccination while rare zoonoses are resolved with immunoprophylaxis even sexually transmitted infectious diseases stds are no longer as significant since the vaccine for human papillomavirus hpv was licensed the last real epidemic that concerned europe was the hong kong flu which occurred back in 1968 and 1969 the broad field of biomedicine offers such a wide range of exciting career paths to all those students who study it these days but the epidemiology of infectious diseases is not really one of them  or at least it hasnt been in europe for a very long time it has probably begun to seem like an archaic medical profession to the majority of students and young medical doctors it seemed to belong to the past for the european continent which made it one of the least attractive things to specialize in even the rare epidemiologists who specialized in infectious diseases have begun retraining for chronic non-communicable diseases due to the aging of europes population which is particularly the case in italy and spain it seems that at least some eu countries may have fallen victims to their own decades-long success in the fight against infectious diseases they faced this unexpected pandemic with few experts that could have had any experience in these events asian countries as well as canada have had enough recent experience with sars and mers but some european countries seem to have forgotten how to fight infectious diseases if it were not for the legacy of the great croatian epidemiologist social medicine expert and global public health pioneer dr andrija tampar and the relatively recent war in croatia it is difficult to say whether or not croatia would be as ready as it has proven itself to be another factor that would understandably undermine the italian response was that no one before italy in fact could have observed how fast covid-19 was spreading among the population the greatest danger of covid-19 is its accelerated exponential spread when it breaks through the first line of defence but before italy only the chinese in wuhan and the iranians had experienced the free spread of the infection among their population after five days of monitoring the number of infected the chinese had to quarantine the entire wuhan and then further 15 cities a day later in order to contain the virus they did not know how many infected people were there outside of wuhans hospitals for iran however only a few knew exactly what was happening as that country is significantly isolated internationally due to political reasons the koreans however had a limited local epidemic but not an uncontrolled free spread  they caught the virus using their first line of defence that is how the italians ended up becoming the first country in the highly developed world to monitor their epidemic spreading uncontrollably among the population the only estimate of the rate of spread of the virus to date has been in the scientific work of li et al from the 29th of january 23 however it was difficult to subsequently determine r0 parameter on the first 425 patients in wuhan the estimate of the r0 for covid-19 in their article was 22 but with a very wide confidence interval  from 14 to 39 it is a bit of tough luck for the italians again that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 14 exactly this figure is well known to all epidemiologists its the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community it should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that with more data r0 for covid-19 would start converging more towards 14 unfortunately the more recent data suggests that r0 is more likely to lean towards 39 implying an incredibly fast spread thus the greatest danger of covid-19 remained unrecognized in italy until the 8th of march quarantine measures at least 100 times fewer people would be dying in italy these days had they declared a quarantine for lombardy two weeks earlier than they did just a few days ago an extremely useful piece of scholarly work authored by onder et al became available 24 their contribution finally provided answers to the three great unknowns about covid-19 many hypotheses have been presented in the media to explain the developments in italy since the very outbreak of the epidemic but thanks to just one simple table we can now dispel most of them the first is the question that has plagued us for a long time  how dangerous is covid-19 for younger age groups it is clear that the media will tend to single out individual cases of death in younger people as they are of most public interest however it is interesting that until recently we didnt really have decent data on this in the public domain the first reason was that the chinese centre for disease control reported all deaths in the chinese epidemic using age groups structure that contained a very large age group of 30-79 years it only separated children up to 10 years then adolescents up to 20 years then 20-29 year-olds followed by this broad age group 30-79 years and those who were 80 years or older that is why the work of onder and colleagues is commendable as they subdivided this large group from china into 10-year age groups this finally allowed a comparison between the first 1023 deaths in wuhan up to the 11th of february with the first 1625 deaths in italy up to the 17th of march the comparison is shown in table 2it gives us some very important insights first in italy more than half of the deaths initially were among people who were older than 80 years of age and a total of 88 of the deaths occurred among the persons over 70 years of age so contrary to the impression that individual media reports can easily make covid-19 is a very dangerous disease mainly for old people moreover a recent study by a and g remuzzi 25 showed that among 827 deaths in italy the vast majority of those people were already severely ill with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease diabetes and malignancies this is what epidemiologists expected because a more severe flu would have had a similar effect if there was no vaccine available however i doubt that the general public has the proper insight into this issue from the prevalent media reports second it was suggested in the media across europe that the virus in italy may have mutated and become much more dangerous however table 2 shows that death rates by the age of 70 are practically the same in china and italy then although the case fatality rate appears to be about 50 greater in italy than in china for the age group 70-79 this does not suggest that the virus may have mutated it is known that in wuhan many of the affected with a severe clinical presentation of covid-19 could rely on the two newly built hospitals and respiratory aids that the military had brought in from other parts of china 26 they also had medical teams coming in from other provinces 26 in italy however there were not enough respirators for this age group and there werent enough doctors either as many of them themselves became infected 1620 for those two reasons i would in fact expect even a larger difference between italy and china than the one we are seeing so i would not attribute this observed difference to the impact of the virus itself and finally the reported difference in case-fatality rates for the oldest age group should also not be attributed to the virus it is more likely a consequence of the fact that italians of lombardy live on average longer than the chinese of wuhan 27 therefore there are significantly more people in the oldest age group in italy ranging to much higher ages so the two oldest groups are not really comparable the average age of the italians in the age group 80 years or older is significantly greater than the average age of the oldest chinese age group therefore the table shows practically equal death rates across all age groups on sufficiently large samples meaning that the virus did not mutate in italy from the virus we see from wuhan at least not until the 17th of march 2020 third and perhaps most importantly  this chart has now made it quite clear that covid-19 does not in fact kill people under the age of 50 unless they have some sort of underlying disease or some unknown achilles heel in their immune system that makes them particularly susceptible to the virus there are such cases with every infectious disease they are also present during the flu epidemics but they are extremely rare this suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses here after this table it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available however at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years too there is another strangeness to the situation in italy that will not be intuitive to the general public the actual number of deaths attributable to covid-19 in italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends namely at present due to the sole focus on the epidemic most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to covid-19 however once the epidemic is over it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years it could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month or a year even without being infected with the new coronavirus it is possible that among some of them covid-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels and those above expected levels will then be attributed to covid-19 this article provides an explanation from the epidemiologists point of view for most of the events reported so far in italy and then followed in spain and other european countries a combination of an early relaxation over this epidemic systematic lack of expertise in the field of epidemic infectious diseases in europe likely inexperience in containing epidemic spread in this generation of health workers relaxed immigration regulations for workers in certain industries champions league football event and a series of further misfortunes and omissions have all been implied so far in the media as contributors to the late withdrawal of lombardy into quarantine this allowed through exponential growth for a large number of people to be infected in a very short time  far too large for health systems of italy and other eu countries to cope with severe forms of illness led to many deaths due to respiratory failure in 88 of cases people over 70 years of age died who had underlying illnesses in the large majority of cases this viewpoint is based on the first 1625 deaths in italy and by the time of this writing there are now more than 10 000 dead given the size of the population this would correspond to 670 deceased in croatia if croatia manages not to follow the numbers of deceased seen in italy this will mostly be attributable to social exclusion measures being introduced early enough for its health system to come with severe cases these days the people of italy spain and other european countries are suffering large losses a significant underlying cause may be the problem that the human brain simply cannot intuitively grasp the power of exponential growth nor that two weeks of delay could make the difference between 100 and 10 000 deaths any physics enthusiasts will know the quote attributed to the great albert einstein who is often cited saying that compound interest which leads to exponential growth is the most powerful force in the universe or the eighth wonder of the world he who understands it earns it he who doesnt pays it 28  they kept away social isolation of cisgender women living with hiv in hyderabad india sameena azhar sabitha gandham jason vaudrey ganesh oruganti revina samuel suhasini   the theoretical framework that guides the present study integrates an adapted version of goffmans conceptualization of stigma steward et al 2008 with gender role theory feld and radin 1982 eagly et al 2000 goffman 1963 explains that society stigmatizes on the basis of what is considered difference or deviance resulting in a spoiled identity and devalued status labeled as deviants stigmatized individuals view themselves and are viewed by others as undesirable mahajan et al 2008 stigma is a social process characterized by exclusion rejection blame or devaluation and resulting from an experience of social judgment scrambler 2009 research suggests that stigma strengthens and reproduces existing inequalities of class race gender and sexuality parker and aggleton 2003 by directly affecting individuals via mechanisms of discrimination and indirectly via threats to personal and social identity major and obrien 2005 in addition stigma can have a dramatic bearing on the distribution of life changes in terms of several health outcomes including psychosocial development income housing criminal justice involvement education and life span link and phelan 2001 gender role theory grt emphasizes the importance of ascribed positions that individuals acquire by birth in describing the context of hiv among women in india ascribed positions may refer to gender caste socioeconomic status and religion the ascribed position of gender significantly impacts the experience of living with hiv for people in india achieved positions refer to those roles earned on the basis of accomplishment or effort such as being a client of a nongovernmental organization ngo a community organizer for public access to hiv treatment or the spokesperson for a pharmaceutical company women in low-prestige ascribed positions may view the attainment of certain achieved positions such as achieving quality health care as out of their reach when ascribed and achieved positions conflict hiv discrimination can ensue role theory postulates that the social behavior of individuals can be understood in terms of societys expectations for what is considered appropriate behavior for occupants of particular social positions in specific situations feld and radin 1982 ultimately role theory posits that social dysfunction is not caused by psychopathology but rather by social context such an approach serves to shift the blame from individual choices and towards a more interactional view of health and human behavior in the context of gender individuals encounter differing expectations and experiences by virtue of their socialization as men and women gender roles explain the division of labor within the household and the ascription of varying traits to men and women agarwal 1997 in the social construction of gender roles in india economic resources are not typically equally distributed among male and female family members gender roles can negatively affect the health of cisgender women when social norms prioritize the health of men or prevent women from making independent health decisions such as traveling alone to a clinic to seek medical care shah et al 2007 cisgender women in india are generally less nourished than men less healthy and more susceptible to physical and sexual violence agarwal and sethi 2013 nussbaum 2001 lack of gender equity in sexual relationships can also constrain indian women from protecting themselves during sexual intercourse and may fuel the hiv epidemic further existing research has not sufficiently addressed the social processes by which cisgender women in india uniquely experience hiv stigma particularly in regard to gender roles social isolation and depression to address these gaps in the current research the present study explores how hiv stigma affects experiences of social isolation for women living with hiv in hyderabad india the study population is defined as cisgender women living with hiv the analytic sample was defined as cisgender women between the ages of 18 and 50 living with hiv in hyderabad india inclusion criteria for the study were 1 identify as cisgender female 2 self-report as being hiv-positive 3 reside in hyderabad or secunderabad india 3 proficient in speaking hindiurdu or telugu and 4 being between the ages of 18 and 50 a mixed methods study was conducted involving two interrelated phases that occurred consecutively with the quantitative and qualitative phases bearing equal weight leech and onwuegbuzie 2009 in phase one of the study 150 plwh were asked to participate in a survey regarding their experiences with hiv stigma depression and access to medical care one third of these respondents n  51 were cisgender women following the completion of surveys a preliminary descriptive analysis of these responses was conducted stratifying survey responses to the two hiv stigma scales used in the study jeyaseelan et al 2013 zelaya et al 2008 a subgroup was created of cisgender women comprised of the eight cisgender women with the highest hiv stigma scores and the eight women with the lowest hiv stigma scores these 16 cisgender women were recruited to participate in phase two of the study this sampling method was utilized in order to ensure heterogeneity in the interview subgroup in phase two participants were asked to complete in-depth interviews on how their experiences of hiv stigma have been influenced by gender roles interviews were intended to explore the gendered experience of hiv stigma and to contextualize the answers from the quantitative survey given that this manuscript focuses on experiences of social isolation there is a larger cluster of individuals whose stories are included here that had scored high on the stigma scales purposive and snowball sampling techniques were utilized to recruit study participants for purposive sampling participants were recruited through existing collaborations with five local ngos serving individuals living with hiv in hyderabad as well as through additional snowball sampling of participants two of these organizations focused on offering services to people living with hiv in hyderabad another two organizations focused on services to third gender or queer communities and the fifth organization focused on health services for rural communities to recruit from these four ngos a local research assistant posted recruitment flyers in hindi and telugu at the field sites of the collaborating organizations the research team visited each of the four organizations to recruit potential participants to capture those men and women who were not currently connected to social service organizations the team additionally utilized snowball sampling snowball sampling has been heavily utilized in disease prevention and public health intervention magnani et al 2005 it is particularly well suited when the focus of study is a sensitive issue and thus requires the knowledge of insiders coleman 1958 biernacki and waldorf 1981 by taking advantage of the social networks of identified respondents vogt 1999 greater variance may be assured in the sample for the purposes of this study individuals who were initially recruited from the five collaborating organizations were asked to share information about the study to eligible peers to protect confidentiality no additional contact information of these peers was elicited from recruiters interested peers had the option to directly contact the research team if interested in participating in the study surveys and interviews were conducted in both hindi and telugu to ensure translation accuracy and internal consistency all relevant documents including flyers consent forms and surveys were translated from english to both hindi and telugu and then back-translated to english a local translator conducted hindi translations a local research assistant conducted telugu translations certificates of translation were produced for the university of chicago institutional review board irb and the internal ethics committee at share india for respondents who were illiterate the interviewer read questions aloud and recorded answers for the participant these individuals consented to the study by utilizing a thumb print as their signaturea commonly accepted legal practice in india all participants who completed either the survey or interview were compensated 200 rupees equivalent to 314 usd at the time that this research was conducted individuals who participated in both phases of the study received a total of 400 rupees 629 usd this amount was determined after consulting with local staff members at community-based organizations who indicated that this is a fair incentive for research participants in hyderabad if a participant assisted in recruiting other individuals through snowball sampling the recruiter received an additional incentive of 100 rupees per completed referral interviews lasted about 90 min the interview guide was organized around eight domains 1 gender roles 2 gender nonconformity stigma 3 hiv diagnosis 4 hiv disclosure 5 hiv stigma 6 caste poverty and religion 7 utilizing medical care and 8 social isolation and depression the first section of the interview asked questions related to gender roles and gender nonconformity gender roles were addressed by asking participants open-ended questions relating to their gender role demands and stress this section also included questions regarding household dynamics such as power to make decisions regarding money and health questions concerning hiv diagnosis and hiv disclosure followed next followed by a section on hiv stigma medical care social isolation and depression some questions in this section were adapted from the hiv stigma index in india gnp icw  unaids 2011 all interviews were digitally audio recorded then subsequently translated and transcribed directly into english transcripts of the interviews were imported into the data analysis program nvivo 10 qsr international 2014 for coding using thematic content analysis krippendorff 2012 after reviewing the first ten transcripts three evaluatorsthe principal investigator a us-based research assistant and an india-based research assistantdeveloped an initial codebook of themes relevant chunks from transcribed data were assigned codes charmaz 2006 miles and huberman 1994 identified codes were placed in broad groupings the codes under each heading were clubbed together and the content analyzed for common themes quotes or passages were selected to illustrate each of these themes smith et al 2009 after initial coding the team met to discuss differences in how codes were applied code definitions were redefined and codes were combined to reflect themes found in the data codes were then clustered together by specific themes to create a codebook the refined codebook was subsequently used to code the remaining interviews with each interview being coded by at least two people whenever there was a discrepancy in a coding decision between two coders the third coder would be asked to review the coding decisions and discuss any significant differences in coding decisions or patterns after deliberation consensus was reached on all coding decisions emergent themes included difficulties in disclosing hiv status to family members gender role conflict and lack of ease of accessing medical care only themes related to hiv stigma social isolation and depression are reported here all names of participants have been changed to maintain the confidentiality of participants an irb application was approved by the university of chicago school of social service administrationchapin hall in september 2015 in november 2015 irb approval was also obtained through the internal ethics committee at share india in secunderabad india an additional irb approval was approved by fordham university in october 2018 for continued data analysis of the study findings all participants names and other identifying details were changed in this manuscript to protect their confidentiality upon disclosure of their hiv status many women expressed being ostracized from their own biological families or from their in-laws these interactions often centered on fears of contagion from both health-related and moral avenues one respondent sitara recounted how her family had stayed away from her because of the negative associations ascribed to living with hiv she also expressed that her family worried about becoming infected by hersitara i think what sin have i committed i am facing all these difficulties i am not happy madam i always think about my children i have to give them a good life when i became hiv-positive i felt so much tension madam and my small daughter is also positive people kept away from me thinking that they will get the disease from meinterviewer who kept away from yousitara we lived together as a joint family when they knew about this disease they my family kept away at that time i felt very bad thinking that everyone was healthy why has god given me this disease they kept away madam i felt very bad thinking about how i got this disease i cried a lot i felt like i was going to die tomorrow my husband and i felt horrible and thought about committing suicide only because of our children did we not kill ourselves in our family nobody is aware of this disease i have been living with hiv now for 14 years sitaras story highlights how hiv stigma from family members persists even when they have been properly educated about transmission routes women often discussed how their hiv status led them to be seen as impure or unclean even when others were aware that they could not be casually infected by socially interacting with them in terms of sexual health cisgender women were often accused of being the vectors of sexually transmitted infections even though they reported that their only lifetime sexual partners were their husbands these experiences speak to the lasting social impacts of hiv stigma and social isolation and also highlight the gender imbalances between the experiences of cisgender women and their male partners another participant layla reported similar experiences of social isolation within her family she recounted her treatment in the hospital by her family and medical providers when she was first diagnosed she was blamed for having been infected with hiv from her bad behaviori was not tested when i was pregnant only about a half an hour before my delivery was i told of my hiv status they called my husband and made him test also he too was hiv positive then they tested my son but they did not tell me anything they were talking with each other but no one was saying anything prior to this they placed me in the general ward but now they put me in a separate room we have very little money and i wondered how we would be able to pay the bills for this big room before that day doctors would come to check on me but then no one would come to see me they were only giving me medications and kept me in a separate room no one bothered me it was tense and we had little money they had put me in an isolated room and after three days i was discharged and taken directly to gandhi hospital everyone was talking but no one was telling me anything after going to gandhi i came to know about my hiv status but prior to then i did not know anything i was nervous but they told me not to worry my parents didnt say anything and my in-laws thought i got hiv from my bad behavior after my baby was delivered i was taken to gandhi hospital and then they told me we all cried a lot while experiences of discrimination within the health care system were undoubtedly traumatizing for plwh some of the most hurtful experiences of being shunned occur within participants own families layla reported how her family treated her following her diagnosis and how these experiences left her feeling rejected socially isolated and depressed she reported that she had educated her family about the ways in which hiv could be transmitted and they were aware that contact with saliva was not infectious nonetheless layla was treated differently by her family following her diagnosis and was told not to feed her niece with her own handsmy mother treated me differently when i was released from gandhi hospital my parents took me back to their house one day my mother gave me rice to eat then my brothers daughter asked me to feed her when i was feeding her with my hands my mother came and said why are you feeding her your rice she said that she would feed my niece herself i told my mother that i had not already eaten from the same plate and that is why i was feeding her otherwise i would not feed her sometimes i think that because of my hiv status and my husbands death i have lots of problems and i often get fed up with my life but i have to be alive for my children i feel sad that everyone is happy but i am unable to be happy with them my mothers sister also has the same feelings towards me she told my family members to keep my plate glass soapeverythingseparate she would say why are you always allowing her to be with you people i have suffered a lot this way laylas experience of having to use separate dishes within her own home and being advised to not feed her niece are examples that showcase how hiv stigma is based not on lack of hiv knowledge but rather on social stigma and prejudice about the cleanlinesspurity of the infected individual often these fears and prejudices persist even when people have been educated about hiv transmission routes as this family had been the stigma continues not solely out of the family members fear of being infected themselves but also out of a desire to not be socially associated with an infected and thus morally impure individual another respondent jyothi reported how she finds it difficult to move freely in the world as the tethers of hiv stigma limit her everyday experiencesyes madam every day i am very sad about myself because we cannot move freely with everyone like regular people at that time when i was first diagnosed i felt very bad about myself i thought why should i live this life if i die who will take care of my children if i didnt have children i would have died i have thought about suicide but because i have children i have not attempted suicide at the government hospital we are treated differently compared with normal people we are kept away and when they prescribe us medicine they do so without touching us as has been shown in other narratives the participants children serve as their saving grace from depression and act as a source of prevention against fatalism gender role theory offers insight into understanding this phenomenon as the demand of being a responsible mother is of critical social importance to an indian woman this sense of dharma or the completion of ones familial duties and obligations ultimately trumped feelings of depression and suicidality that many women living with hiv in india experience in this section we discuss ways in which people fear how the body will be negatively perceived by others as a result of being associated with sickness or ugliness several women reported their fears of incurring judgment from others if their hiv status became publicly known most women who worked in the formal labor sector reported being worried about losing their employment if their employer came to know about their hiv status sujatha recounts this experiencei have not told anyone at work that im hiv positive for fear i might lose my job because i am afraid that if i tell them that i have hiv they will remove me from my job thats why i did not tell anyone people would not touch me if they knew i was living with hiv and they would not even talk in close proximity to an hiv-positive person they were afraid that if they touch me they would also get the disease similarly lakshmi reports how she refrains from sharing her status with others because they will assume that she had been infected through immoral actions and that her illness was a deserved consequence of these actionsi thought people would think badly about me they would say she doesnt have a husband she must have done wrong things thats the reason she got this and i thought they would hate me because of this fear i do not tell them people in the community think that people who are hiv positive made bad choices and that is the reason they are hiv positive when we go to the hospital they will hate us and harass us i have been treated differently by my sister she did not say anything directly but her behavior changed she stores our clothes separately from her own i have been living with hiv for nine years there have been many quarrels in my home about getting this disease even today none of my in-laws in my home know that i have hiv and i will not share this with them if i tell my sisters in-laws they will quarrel with my sisters they will say your sister got this ask them where i went and how did i get this they will pick on my sisters and say you are well why did your sister get this disease and not you they will fight with my sisters so i dont want to tell them keeping ones hiv status a secret serves to protect not only the women themselves from stigma but also their family members such group associations when the action of one member of the family is reflective on the entire family are more typical of collectivist cultures like that of south asia that place greater social emphasis on family unity honor and group inclusion over individual freedom and autonomy the self-esteem and the mental health of women living with hiv were often shaped by the ways in which the progression of their disease affected their physical appearance women were concerned about how others would perceive them and then potentially discriminate against them based on their looks janaki reported how she felt ashamed when she started to lose weight and began to look visibly illi felt people didnt want to talk to me because i had this disease i felt embarrassed when i was walking on the street because i used to look so ugly i was 27 and my weight was 27 kg approximately 60 lb my hair color was black but i had lost all my hair and looked like a beggar i felt that people would be afraid of me when they saw me it was difficult for me to leave the house i used to leave the house only once a month to pick up my medication it was like this for two years i did not tell my relatives and neighbors about my hiv status i did not tell my friends when my friends asked me why did you become like this i told them i became depressed when my husband died i was fearful that if i told them they would stop talking to me and then they would tell my parents and my parents would send me out when i became part of the hiv network i heard of parents kicking their children out of the house after finding out about their hiv status that is the reason i did not tell anyone most women do not share their hiv status for fear of the negative consequences of having their condition be known and for fear of the association of living in poverty or becoming a beggar the associations of living with hiv have connotations with socioeconomic status as well as with illness throughout the interviews we found that hiv disclosure outside of ones immediate family was a rare occurrence for most cisgender women because of fears of perceived discrimination women chose to not disclose their hiv status often even to people within their own family another research participant seema shared her experience of not wanting to disclose her hiv status to others as it made people assume that she had become infected through engagement in sex worki have only told my sister and my brother-in-law some people have hiv awareness and some people do not if i tell people that i am hiv positive people will look at us like we are cheap and they will think i am a street lady sex worker because of this reason i do not tell everyone the source of hivs heightened stigma appears to be caused by its recurring association with illicit behaviorssex work injection drug use sex between menor their corresponding illicit identitiessex workers injection drug users and gaybisexual men women remained acutely concerned about how others in their community would treat them and their children differently should their hiv status become publicly known to avoid these anticipated experiences of discrimination they kept their hiv status a secret multiple cisgender women in this study reported experiencing thoughts of suicide hopelessness social isolation and severe depression janaki reported how difficult it was to maintain the desire to be alivehaving hiv is like hell for two years i saw hell on earth besides i also get side effects i thought why do all these things happen to me sometimes i think it is better to die after that i gave myself courage i dont have any problem with this and i realized why should i die for this reason i will live till i die then i will stop thinking about death the statement of living till i die is at once pragmatic and existential janaki highlights the universal human experience of mortality and the accompanying fear of death that chronic illness may instill however she is nonetheless able to use the inevitability of her death as a motivation for continuing to live for many women their children were their main motivations to stay alive sitara like many of the interviewed women in this study reported that her children offered her the sole hope for her futureat first i cried a lot and did not understand why i had this disease my mother did not know what this disease was today i feel that every person will die someday we will die a little early i have no fear because i am living a happy life with my children applying the constructs of gender role theory we see that sitara finds her purpose through the fulfillment of her gendered role as the primary caretaker for her children seema like many women in the study initially experienced feelings of hopelessness regarding her hiv diagnosis but after being informed that there were treatments for her condition and that living with hiv would not necessarily lead to an early death she regained hope for the future it is noteworthy that her sense of purpose is also obtained through the fulfillment of her role as the mother of her daughtermy husband was sick madam he got piles hemorrhoids and jaundice he was becoming very sick we took him to the hospital when the doctor did an hiv test for him we came to know that he is positive then the doctor immediately did the same test on me and we found out that i also have hiv i was very depressed and i cried a lot i thought my life was a waste because i have only one daughter i thought we all have hiv my daughter might also have this we thought to die but i gave my husband courage why should we die we have medicine we will take medicine when we came to know at first i cried a lot i did not eat rice for two days and thought why has our life become like this after that we got used to it my husband also cried a lot he might have done a wrong thing knowingly or unknowingly and he said sorry to me as a wife and husband we cannot quarrel and separate if i am healthy and separated that would be different he has hiv and i have hiv we thought to die but for our daughters sake we stayed alive once again the recurring theme of remaining alive for the sake of ones children is evident in this passage seema also highlights traditional views regarding the lasting nature of marriage and how quarrels between husband and wife need to be worked out regardless of infidelity or sickness she hints at his infidelity as she mentions her husband having done a wrong thing knowingly or unknowingly perhaps this wrong thing was injection drug use having sex with another male or female person or having solicited a sex worker seemas strong commitment to maintaining a marriage at all costs is again reflective of the importance placed in south asian culture on family unity conversely being single divorced or widowed in south asian culture are considered undesirably tragic life experiences many women reported that the reason that they were able to pull themselves out of moments of considering self-harm or suicide was because of the responsibility they felt for the well-being of their children seeking purpose only through ones children is a recurring theme reinforcing the notion of womens primary and essentialized role as mothers and caretakers one participant rubaina reportedmy husband would cry a lot we have a big family my husband has six brothers in his family and we used to think that we should die without suffering and without giving trouble we used to cry often thinking about our children we would wonder that if we were to die who would take care of our children my husband was taking homeopathic medications but he was becoming sicker by the day after seeing him become more ill for two months i stopped taking homeopathic medications at the time of his death i was very afraid but i thought i should live for my children if i died i knew anyone would be able to take care of my elder daughter but nobody would take care of my younger daughter because she is hiv positive it was then that i regained the courage to live we used to go to freedom foundation for a checkup every month people there were so friendly and would take us to lunch my daughter would come with me people said that even though my husband died i should live for my children and give them a good future i got a lot of courage from freedom foundation this example illustrates how community-based organizations play an important role in linking people living with hiv with health care and social services these settings serve as spaces where women can receive the type of social support that is often unavailable to them from their own families communities or the government health care system radhas resilience against the forces of social exclusion speaks to the strength that cisgender heterosexual women living with hiv have developed in the hyderabadi context these traits serves to protect them against the spoiled identity conferred onto them by the judgments of society another participant azmath reported her feelings upon being diagnosed with hivafter i found out i had hiv there was not one day i did not cry first i cried about my husband and when i found out i had hiv i continued to cry in the beginning i was not aware of this disease my doctors told me i had aids and i would not live for more than six months to a year they told me to not give my milk to my son nor kiss him they told me to go to hyderabad where there are many hospitals otherwise go to kurnool her village and you can get medicine for this i thought if i take medicine the disease will go away when i saw my husband i feared i would become like him and die when the doctors said to me to keep away from my son and not to kiss him i became very depressed not about my disease i was depressed about the doctors words about keeping away from my son when i felt suicidal and attempted suicide my relatives told me to get married again that my husband did not make me happy and that i would not get any property from my in-laws give your children to your mother and get married they would say wherever i would go i heard this sort of talk and i was fed up with this talk and i decided i wanted to commit suicide i took a few pills but i thought of my children and that god had taken their father if i were to commit suicide who will take care of them immediately i went to my mother and told her i took these pills and she took me to the hospital and i was given treatment once again the saving grace in this instance was the womans recognition of the importance of her children given the high cultural value placed on marriage with children this causes clinicians to question whether cisgender women living with hiv in india who are unmarried or without children like lasksmi still have the same motivations for life clinicians working with single divorced or widowed women living with hiv should take utmost care to ensure the prevention of extreme depression in their clients as these women are at increased risk for social isolation and suicidality azmaths report that her doctor told her not to kiss her son is reflective of misinformation about hiv transmission that is being disseminated by medical staff to their patients in india thereby exacerbating pre-existing social stigmas both the interviews and surveys were subject to social desirability bias where respondents answer questions or behave in a way that will portray them favorably to the researcher participants may have consciously wanted to present themselves in a way that emphasizes the challenges they have experienced as a result of living with hiv alternatively they may also have wanted to portray themselves as strong resilient and healthy and may have downplayed these same experiences these results were not intended to be generalized for cisgender women living with hiv outside of india or perhaps even outside of the city of hyderabad regional variation in cultural norms religion language and socioeconomic status within south asia confer significantly different contexts for the interpretation of gender roles and social interactions the context for cisgender heterosexual women may not be readily comparable to populations outside of south india making it difficult to make generalizations regarding plwh in locations outside of the cities of hyderabad and secunderabad given that this study was qualitative and had a small sample size no expectations regarding generalizability have been made in terms of the sampling method using a largely organizational recruiting method entails a strong source of sampling bias watters and biernacki 1989 people living with hiv who are recruited from social service organizations are by definition connected to receiving resources so we may be eschewing the very population that we are seeking to findthose individuals who are so stigmatized by their hiv status that they are avoiding medical treatment or hiv-related social services altogether although we additionally utilized snowball sampling and online recruiting to identify respondents these methods may also be considered biased because they are not random and instead select individuals on the basis of social networks who again are more likely to disclose their hiv status browne 2005 another issue with snowball sampling is whether the phenomenon being studied actually results in the formation of social networks if the phenomenon is private as is hiv stigma and snowball sampling is network dependent we can expect to encounter problems in capturing the actual variance within the population additionally the verification of eligibility and the accounts of respondents may be compromised as the sources used to initiate referral chains become more distant biernacki and waldorf 1981 in our study cisgender women experienced multiple forms of intersectional stigmafrom their hiv status to their caste position to their widowhood our research adds to a body of evidence that demonstrates how intersecting systems of oppression intimately affect the lives of women in developing contexts our findings validate previous research that highlights how people living with hiv who experience stigmatizing interactions experience higher levels of stress and distress hutton et al 2013 van hollen 2010 women in our study experienced disproportionate stigma and blame from their husbands and the families of their in-laws causing them to have painful experiences of social isolation confirming previous research kang et al 2005 we found that hiv stigma increases pre-existing social prejudice disproportionately affecting individuals already socially marginalized for other reasons such as sexual orientation gender nonconformity occupation or caste occupying multiple marginalized identities creates intersectional vulnerabilities for cisgender women living with hiv making it more difficult to obtain quality medical care and compassionate psychosocial support many participants expressed their fears regarding hiv disclosure and were concerned that social perceptions regarding people living with hiv would negatively impact their lives the majority of the women in our study hailed from scheduled castes or were living in poverty leading to the experience of multiple layers of stigma pulerwitz and bongaarts 2014 as highlighted by our research cisgender women experience unique challenges in overcoming hiv stigma because of the ways in which hiv stigma differentially impacts women women are less likely to disclose their positive hiv status to medical providers and are less likely to receive the support they need to cope with their illness wingwood et al 2007 our research has important implications for social work research and policy research on gender and sexuality in south asia suggests that a patriarchal hierarchy for decision-making is recognized by both families and communities key family decisions such as those regarding health and money are reserved for men in their capacity as heads of the household women are often assigned other responsibilities in their capacity as nurturing wives mothers and daughters kabeer 1999 the importance of this primary role as mother and wife is repeated throughout the narratives of the cisgender women in our study the primary gender role of mother is reflected in womens explanation that their children are their main justification for remaining alive according to gender role theory from the time of childhood men and women are socialized to engender specific attributes and social behaviors eagly et al 2000 in the south asian context it becomes increasingly important for women to fulfill the gender role demand of being mothers and being the primary caretakers of their children for example laylas experience of being prevented from feeding her niece creates role stress as she is unable to complete her role as a mother caretaker and nurturer within the home the inability to perform this role leads layla to suffer a lot this way an experience which we might translate as gender role stress the existing literature examining gender roles and differences in social support and well-being suggests that men and women differ not only in their social behaviors but also in the sources from which they draw support eagly et al 2000 previous research indicates that women do not want to relinquish their role as care providers and nurturers as a result of their hiv-associated illnesses gordillo et al 2009 married women in india are also likely to experience secondary claims on household resources violence at the hands of their husbands and a willingness to bear and support children to the detriment of their own health kabeer 1997 the rise of new waged opportunities and changes in gender roles in south asia may make it easier for women to demand greater equity within their sexual and marital partnerships or to gain the financial ability to leave unsatisfactory marriages without fear of living in poverty there may be important implications of these nuances in gender interactions in the south indian context for social and public health policies impacting women living with hiv our findings highlight the need for greater local and regional public health programming that focuses on the health disparities faced by cisgender women living with hiv understanding how gender interacts with hiv stigma is of critical importance for policymakers as they develop programs for hiv prevention and care van hollen 2010 in the context of hiv progression to aids delaying or avoiding medical care because of the fear of discrimination in healthcare settings ultimately leads to poor health outcomes conversely a high level of social support can lead to an improved quality of life particularly in regard to mental health strong social support has been shown to be protective against the negative impacts of depression and social isolation charles et al 2012 in our study many women reported contemplating suicide yet almost none of them had sought formal treatment for these suicidal ideations or attempts these narratives also highlight that there is a lack of publicly available programming within government hospitals and ngos to address the mental health needs of cisgender women from a cultural perspective it also reiterates how many indian women see their mental health to be a private problem and would feel uncomfortable sharing these experiences with a counselor who they perceive to be a stranger mental health professionals may be viewed as outsiders to the family and bringing up such issues to them may be viewed as causing shame or dishonor to the family from a clinical social work perspective our findings reinforce the need for greater emphasis on culturally appropriate treatments for depression particularly for cisgender women living with hiv such programs need to be made available within the context of sexual and reproductive health care as indian women are more likely to seek out obstetricgynecological care over mental health care a more holistic approach to the wellness of women living with hiv will need to pay attention to not only immunological functioning but mental health as well individual counseling and the taking of psychotropic medications for anxiety and depression are still not widely accepted practices in the indian context therefore both psychoeducation and the tailoring of social interventions for the cultural context of south india are needed to ensure the success of clinical outcomes family and community-level interventions are also sorely needed to ensure that misinformation about disease transmission does not cause people living with hiv to continue to be socially isolated from their family or community members additionally education vocational training and employment opportunities for cisgender women living with hiv are needed to help foster womens financial independence this may be especially relevant for women who have lost their partners to aids given the greater emphasis on groups and collectivism in the south asian context the practice of group therapy or social support groups may be a more appropriate intervention for women experiencing depression in a clinical pilot intervention in san francisco an hiv stigma-reducing group intervention was held in a community mental health setting to gay and bisexual men living with hiv who were currently connected with care but reported ongoing difficulties due to hiv stigma based on acceptance and commitment therapy this intervention was effective in reducing stigma among persons with substance abuse histories and in reducing internalized homophobia the intervention incorporated exercises from compassion-focused therapy to increase compassion while decreasing shame skinta et al 2015 such an intervention might be adapted for the context of cisgender women living with hiv in india in another group-based behavioral intervention for adolescents and young adults newly diagnosed with hiv four dimensions of hiv-related stigma were addressed personalized stigma disclosure concerns negative self-image and concern with public attitudes about people with hiv harper et al 2014 while results were effective at reducing stigma for males across all four dimensions females only experienced a decrease in personalized stigma and this effect was not maintained at a 3-month follow-up all other types of stigma actually increased for women at post-intervention and 3-month follow-up these findings lead us to conclude that researchers have failed to identify effective means of decreasing hiv stigma for women reiterating the need for further research on gender-specific health interventions previous research has demonstrated that women with a heightened sense of fear around health-decline and death may use avoidant coping behaviors to manage their anxiety resulting in poor self-care behaviors such as lack of adherence to hiv medications willie et al 2016 psychosocial factors are important predictors of quality of life for women living with hiv in a study of 600 women living with hiv in india an intervention led by nurses who worked as social health activists was found to be effective at increasing womens access to social resources and social support garfin et al 2019 this case management approach well known to clinical social workers may be especially useful in not only helping link women living with hiv with needed resources but also ensuring that they are connected to circles of social support in another intervention a support group used narrative therapy to help plwh process experiences of suffering and share insights connections and comfort to each other dean 1995 social workers working with plwh should incorporate the association between stigma and depression into their programs li et al 2009 and should address social support as a protective factor for mental health given the intersectional nature of hiv stigma in india it is especially important for women living in poverty to overcome social isolation in order to lead healthy and connected lives similarly for social workers who serve women living with hiv certain clinical insights may be important to consider for clinicians who have been doing hiv work for a long time there must be an awareness of the vicarious trauma and compassion fatigue that can result from having witnessed the illness and death of many clients over time gabriel 1991 in such cases of having survived ones patients it is the clinician who becomes the bereaved causing experiences of grief mourning and loss being carefully attuned to countertransference and the impacts that this work can have on clinicians may help prevent burnout and sustain a clinical social workers career longevity in the field of hiv care clinicians working with plwh may be further aided by receiving clinical supervision being in psychotherapy themselves and taking meaningful breaks away from the work smith 2007 addressing social isolation in vulnerable communities like women living with hiv in india who are experiencing multiple forms of marginalization requires clinical tenacity resilience and compassion  the uk covid-19 response a behavioural irony anne-lise sibony  the diversity of responses to the covid-19 outbreak across countries both internationally and within the european union eu is considerable and the lack of a coordinated response at the eu level is being criticised 1 within this natural experiment involving different national policies possibly the most strikingly distinct path is the one initially chosen by the uk and in which the netherlands is persevering instead of trying to avoid contamination as much as possible though drastic measures such as early lockdown the strategy is to encourage herd immunity 2 in the uk this initial policy choice was presented as being based on both epidemiology and behavioural sciences 3 behavioural fatigue a little-known phrase not found in the most comprehensive textbook 4 suddenly rose to probably shortlived fame 5 the suggestion was that people would get tired of staying home so  professor of eu law uclouvain belgium email anne-lisesibonyuclouvainbe i would like to thank lucia reisch fabrizio esposito vincent delhomme and alessandra donati for helpful

httpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfree2020mar16social-distancing-coronavirusstay-home-government lockdown would be ineffective in the netherlands the prime minister announced similarly relaxed rules about social distancing and though he did not explicitly refer to any behavioural input it is nonetheless highly likely that there was one 6 the initial moves of both of these governments met with scepticism and appeared shocking to many the association between behavioural input in the policy decision and the decision to let the virus spread by refraining from ordering lockdown is unfortunate but it is there how could a government rely merely on nudges in the face of grave danger observers legitimately asked 7 while no government relies merely on nudges even the netherlands has ordered schools and bars to close this particular episode in the unfolding worldwide coronavirus saga gives behaviourally minded analysts pause it is worth considering the proper place of behavioural insights in the difficult policy choices at hand trying to eradicate the virus through comprehensive lockdown suppression has the advantage that it appears to work as far as one can tell it seems to have worked in china 8 it has the drawback that is it hugely costly for the economy and that the number of cases will still be large enough to overwhelm even well-resourced health systems 9 this means not only that many people will die including overworked and exposed health professionals but also that morally unpleasant choices will have to be made in addition it may be necessary to prolong lockdown for months or repeat it many times over if a new wave of infection occurs as soon as measures are relaxed which is entirely likely in the absence of herd immunity 10 mitigation on the other hand aims to create precisely such herd immunity it consists in limiting isolation to groups most at risk of developing severe symptoms and letting the virus infect large sections of the remaining population the social and economic disruption is more limited with this strategy but it has the drawback that people most at risk might be misidentified thus causing deaths that could have been avoided with more drastic 6 this is not only a presumption based on the fact that the dutch government is among the most behaviourally aware in the eu but more specifically because the dutch national institute for public health and the environment whose role it is to advise the government enjoys in-house expertise on behavioural change among both senior and junior staff 7 the term nudge has been popularised by rh thaler and cr sunstein nudge improving decisions about health wealth and happiness new haven ct yale university press 2008 who define it as any aspect of the choice architecture that alters peoples behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives for helpful clarifications and a more precise definition see pg hansen the measures importantly it is also irreversible after the virus has spread widely isolation will not be as effective as it would have been in the early stages as the economist sums up the bitter truth is that mitigation costs too many lives and suppression may be economically unsustainable 11 indeed it has been estimated when then choice was made to go for herd immunity that 80 of the uk population would be infected plausibly resulting in half a million deaths 12 on the other hand the french national statistical institute has calculated that production dropped by 35 because of the lockdown 13 which means that each month of this policy costs three points of annual gdp 14 choosing the right policy in these circumstances is challenging for many reasons starting with a multifaceted knowledge problem we have only partial knowledge of the virus of exactly how it spreads and how immunity builds up or what existing drugs could help there is neither enough data 15 nor enough time to conduct serious cost-benefit analyses leaving aside ethical concerns about the utilitarian morality underpinning such analyses and the reluctance to put a price tag on lives 16 even risk analysis seems to have been neglected in addition to all that we do not know there are logistical constraints pertaining to the production of protective equipment sanitising gel or ventilators there are conflicting values and some trade-offs are becoming increasingly salient such as balancing health and privacy 17 finally the epidemic does not shut down politics just recall how france held the first round of municipal elections during the first week of lockdown after the president gave in to the opposition of the president of the senate 18 or how prime minister orbn is using the virus to advance his political agenda of an ever-tighter grip over hungarian institutions 19 in addition to scientific uncertainties painful trade-offs and economic and logistical constraints policy-makers also have to reckon with behavioural factors quite obviously citizens behaviour affects how the virus spreads getting people to behave in certain ways can literally save lives in other words the stakes have never been so high when it comes to incorporating behavioural insights into policy design yet getting things right is a tall order as the behaviour changes needed are farreaching but also because governments are under intense pressure to make decisions fast under several veils of uncertainty and in a context characterised by both rational fear of experts and irrational optimism of citizens many of whom feel they are not personally at risk all of these circumstances offer fertile ground for biases and errors in the absence of treatment or a vaccine the only way to slow down the progression of the virus is changing behaviour such change needs to occur in connection with deliberate behaviour such as going out or washing ones hands with conscious but habitual behaviour such as greeting people or standing close to them and with mostly unconscious behaviour such as touching ones face 20 initiating rapid behavioural change on a massive scale is not the usual business of governments nor is the regulation of micro-social interaction in principle the purpose of law yet in the absence of a vaccine and amid controversies on the efficacy of available drugs non-pharmaceutical interventions are initially the single most important tools to try and protect populations health leaving aside the indirect health risks generated by loss of income over time 21 things are rapidly evolving some governments have allowed use of existing antiviral drugs in hospitals a french court has recently ordered health authorities to stock up on such drugs 22 and a vaccine may be within reach 23 yet it remains that behavioural factors are crucial and there is little doubt that this dimension has a place in policy design broadly speaking the context is favourable to such an approach as governments in many parts of the world have been increasingly turning to behavioural expertise over the past decade 24 the 2019 nobel prize in economic sciences has been given to researchers who have demonstrated the potency of seemingly modest interventions to 20 such unconscious behaviours are hardest to tackle httpswwwbiteamblogshow-to-stop-touching-our-facesin-the-wake-of-the-coronavirus 21 improve health and well-being using randomised controlled trials the same experimental methodology as is recommended to test and adapt behavioural interventions 25 in addition and despite controversies among academics about libertarian paternalism preliminary empirical evidence suggests that europeans like nudges when they approve of the underlying policy aim and if governments adhere to the basic rules of good governance of nudging 26 data are as yet lacking as to whether these findings also apply to uk politicians 27 against this backdrop why did the initial announcement of behaviourally inspired interventions run up against strong criticism in the present context 28 to clarify the objection was not directed against adopting behaviourally inspired measures per se it was about not adopting at the time strict social distancing measures the critique was also not directed at the specific behavioural recommendations that were issued such as advice on how to stop touching ones face 29 or how best to nudges people to wash their hands effectively 30 such recommendations cost very little and can go some way in the right direction certainly no one objects to them the objection was that behavioural arguments that were presented as supporting the decision to wait rather than adopt drastic measures were ill-founded the fear that behavioural fatigueas the uk government called itmight kick in and undermine the effectiveness of a lockdown as people would start violating the recommendation to stay home may be intuitively plausible but behavioural scientists said is not a documented behavioural phenomenon 31 life-saving lockdown based on the mere intuition that people may get tired of it simply is not good enough it is not evidence-based behavioural policy-making importantly it is not clear why behavioural fatigue was singled out given that other better-documented behavioural phenomena mightwith equally unknown probability and distributionbe at work and either fuel or counteract it 32 besides behavioural fatigue non-compliance with social distancing measures could be the result of the optimism bias which can lead people to believe they are less likely to acquire a disease 33 another potential cause of non-compliance with stay-at-home exhortations is reactance that is an appetite for doing the opposite of what we are told when we feel our freedom of choice is being limited clearly the baseline level of reactance in a population is a cultural trait anecdotal evidence suggests for example that it is lower in belgium than in france where parisians flocked en masse to their vacation homes the day before lockdown elbowing their way through crowded train stations to packed tgvs increases or decreases in reactance from the baseline level are plausibly influenced by how politicians and other public figures behave 34 in that regard it is striking how boris johnson donald trump or emmanuel macron undermined the official message of social distancing by publicly shaking hands attending meetings or visiting factories while angela merkel and sophie wilms the belgian prime minister led by example from the beginning reactance can be mitigated by targeting different subgroups 35 such as young people which some governments have done through social media campaigns highlighting that caring for elders is cool reactance can also be mitigated by involving citizens in policy development 36 while this might prima facie seem difficult in an emergency situation it is also true that disastrous communication causes deaths and taking a little bit of time to help officials grasp the moods in the population might in fact be time well spent on the other hand behavioural fatigue might be offset by fear of the disease fear is known to be a powerful motivator though here again we lack data that are directly relevant to the current context 37 importantly sound behavioural arguments in favour of enforcing lockdown and social distancing through law rather than mere recommendations seem to have received too little consideration first we all hold conflicting voices in our minds the voice of quick intuitive emotional decisions wants us to go and see friends and the voice of reasoned decision that weighs pros and cons rationally and argumentatively will suggest that this is not reasonable and we know which one usually wins this is known as dual process theory 38 this is why it is a good idea to take decisions as to whether or not to see friends off peoples shoulders 39 once stay at home is the law rather than a recommendation voluntary compliance could be the result of citizens recognising the expressive function of the law 40 this may be a more reliable mechanism than reliance on social norms where the social norm is not well established 41 in other words there are behavioural phenomena that go in different directions and we simply do not know enough about these behavioural trade-offs 42 quite possibly individual differences are large and the net effect of these phenomena depends at least in part on demographics by way of illustration a belgian survey suggests that 25 of the population and as much as 44 of 18-21-year-olds do not observe the social distancing measures 43 in truth the behavioural and social sciences help formulate many hypotheses of what psychological and social levers might drive risky behaviour but no hard evidence that is directly policy-relevant making behavioural fatigue uniquely salient to justify a minimalist policy simply seems random why then did behavioural fatigue have the honour of featuring as policy justification could the focus on an obscure and undocumented behavioural phenomenon which may well exist nonetheless be an instance of group reinforcement in the decisional process the 2018 behavioural insights team bit report behavioural government the uk nudge units manual for de-biasing governments explains that this form of groupthink happens when people self-censor and conform to the group majority view 44 did herd immunity emerge as the best candidate for consensus among medical experts might it have received a subtle cultural push brits keep calm and carry on was the time pressure so strong that whatever would appear to bring the voice of behavioural insights in line with other disciplines represented in the expert group got picked out the fact that there was no response to the open letter from nonplussed behavioural scientists does suggest that this was not the best that the behavioural approach can offer to policy-making in general or to covid-19 response in particular the uk nudge unit may have deserved a taste of its own medicine but it should be recognised that evidenced-based policy-making is exceptionally difficult to deliver when there are precious few data and no time to gather evidence another explanation for the initial choice of herd immunity over early lockdown is the framing effect in a famous experiment that uniquely resonates with the current context kahneman and tversky showed that decisions about risks are influenced by how the choice is framed 45 in this experiment subjects were told that a community faced an unusual asian disease that was expected to kill 600 people to combat the disease the first group could choose between two options option a consisted in a treatment that would ensure 200 people would be saved and option b in a treatment that had a 33 chance of saving all 600 but a 67 chance of saving none option a was the clear winner chosen by 72 of subjects a second group was presented with the same choice but framed differently this group had to choose between option c which would result in only 400 people dying and option d characterised by a 33 chance that nobody would perish and a 67 chance that all 600 would die this time 72 favoured option d this is puzzling because option d is equivalent to option b in other words when the same choice between a certain option and a probabilistic one with identical expected utility was framed differently peoples risk preferences were reversed in the positive framing number of lives saved in options a and b subjects preferred certainty but in the negative framing number of deaths in options c and d they were willing to take risks it has been shown that politicians are not immune to framing effects they too are willing to take more risks to avoid deaths than to save lives even though numbers make the options equivalent 46 in the current context we constantly hear and read about the death toll of the virus the framing is clearly negative prospect theory predicts that this will lead to more risk-taking alas the initial decisions to delay strict social distancingwhether dressed up or not in behavioural argumentsmay illustrate this prediction we are living through a natural experiment nation-states worldwide and throughout europe have developed different policy responses to the covid-19 pandemic ranging from locked-up french and spaniards to free-range swedes within the coming months evidence will show which strategies were most effective cost-efficient and socially accepted but this is also an example of how governments can misuse behavioural arguments and tarnish a reputation for sound evidence-based policy-making those in europe who have applied behavioural insights most effectively may not be the ones who boast about it  well-being and the good death stephen campbell m   what is meant by the good death since i will make frequent use of this familiar phrase let me begin with some clarifications about how i will understand and use it first inclusion of the word the is not meant to presuppose that there is a single unique type of good death if deaths can be good presumably there will be a diversity of ways that death can go well for people this is especially plausible if there is a diversity of goods in life eg knowledge pleasure appreciation of beauty virtue as this would suggest a range of possible good deaths corresponding to the different prudential goods and various combinations of them however even if there is only one sort of thing that makes our lives go well it is likely that there are many different forms that the good can take second in talking of the good death i do not mean to restrict attention to the positive side of prudential value not unlike discussions of the good life that address both the prudentially good and the prudentially bad it is important to attend to the full spectrum of possible deaths from the very good if such a thing is possible to the very bad this is particularly important because while it is uncontroversial that deaths can be bad there is room for debate as to whether any death qualifies as all-things-considered good in any case my focus in this essay is less on the overall prudential assessment of deaths and more on features that contribute to making a death go better or worse for an individual a less misleading phrase for our topic might be the better or worse death lastly death in the present context does not refer merely to the bare event of death the event of a persons permanently ceasing to exist5 nor does it refer only to the process of dying which might be understood as a process of physical deterioration leading to the event of death instead let us understand the good death to refer to a good end of life or even a good final chapter of ones life the literary metaphor is illustrative in a biography a chapter about an individuals death is not typically restricted to the dying process much less the bare event of the death it tends to be far more inclusive encompassing relevant events leading up to the dying process and the event of death as well as events that occur in the aftermath understanding death in this broader biographical sense the good death concerns how well or poorly the final portion of a life goes for the individual living that life 

my grandmother died in the hospital it was the first time shed ever been in onethe hardest part about it was that the very last thing she asked me was to take her homein my grandmas case there was such clarity of thought and when the last thought on your mind is i want to be home then that must be the most important thing there isif you look at this landscape every day it becomes a part of who you areso how can you see yourself in the hospitala place that is so totally foreign to the nourishment of the soulful self

 a persons location at the time of death is one obvious candidate for a good death factor humans across a range of cultures express a preference to die at home8 this wish is not universal but it is relatively common it often manifests itself as a desire to die in ones homeland rather than abroad or to die in ones home rather than the unfamiliar setting of a hospital no doubt one reason why one might have a preference to die at home concerns the quality of ones experience while dying people may predict that their experience leading up to death will be more tranquil and less alienating if they are in a familiar setting in that case dying at home might be valued instrumentally inasmuch as it is seen as a means to a more positive state of mind however in some cases what would lie behind that positive experience is the perception that being in ones home is something that directly makes for a better death this might be grounded in the fact that you bear a special relationship to your homeit is where you belong it is where you experienced so many valuable and intimate moments it is connected to your identity these are properties of dying at home that might explain why many people desire it if it is doubted that people ever really care about such things apart from their impact on their experience let us keep in mind that people often have strong preferences about where their bodies are buried or where their ashes are scattered such preferences obviously need not be about ones own mental states even atheists who reject the idea of an afterlife often have preferences about this

 arguably ones company in death has prudential significance as i write this the world is in the throes of the covid-19 pandemic one of the prominent reasons why covid-19 hospital deaths are widely regarded as tragic is that infected patients often die alone isolated from their family members due to hospital policies that prohibit or strictly restrict visitation10 many people have a deep fear of dying alone and it is quite common for people to want their loved ones to be with them at the end there may be specific individuals you would especially hope to have at your deathbed and specific people you would especially not want present peoples preferences about who surrounds them in their final days or moments might be purely instrumental hedonic considerations often lie behind such preferences and one can instrumentally desire others presence in order to repair or nurture relationships even so a preference to have certain people present at ones death can be grounded in the thought that their very presence makes for a more desirable or less undesirable death this point applies to other kinds of significant life-events my brother was unable to attend my wedding due to illness i wanted him to be there and this was not merely a desire to make us both happier if asked to choose between having him at my wedding or both of us receiving a pleasure-inducing drug that would have guaranteed a more positive experience i would have preferred the former his presence at my wedding would have had value for me apart from any hedonic effects similar points apply to death just as we can have a special relation to our homes that makes it more desirable to die there a person can have a special connection with others such that their presence at the end arguably makes for a better death11

 for many how one approaches death has prudential significance one might hope to face death contemplatively like socrates or hamlet or with a sense of levity and good humor like voltaire who when his bedside lamp flared up is said to have remarked what the flames already or with defiance like susan sontag who fought to stave off death by blood cancer until the bitter end15 as with the other three factors what constitutes the ideal manner of facing death is a subject of normative disagreement in a 2000 survey a majority of subjects which included terminally ill patients doctors nurses and family members thought it important to maintain a sense of humor at the end of life16 yet otherslike james boswell who was disturbed by humes cheerfulness in the face of deathwill see humor on ones deathbed as inappropriate and lacking the proper gravity some will value the defiant struggle against death that was preached by thomas and practiced by sontag others will see such resistance as futile or pathetic while there is room for normative debate about this good death factor many people believe that there are better and worse ways to face ones death hedonism maintains that what makes something good or bad for us is its effect on the pleasantness or unpleasantness of our experience thus the only things that are basically non-instrumentally good and bad for us are pleasure and pain broadly construed18 hedonistic theories do not recognize our three good death factors as being basic components of well-being none of the factors under consideration pertain directly to the quality of ones experience nor does hedonism fully recognize them in the second way for pleasure and displeasure are not essentially linked to these good death factors there are countless cases where these features of death are not attended by an increase or decrease in pleasure or suffering dying at home and the presence of loved ones at death pertain most fundamentally to the physical or perhaps virtual location of the dying person in relation to a certain place and certain people19 these things can obtain irrespective of the mental states of the dying person further in talking of an embarrassing cause of death i am not referring to a cause of death that leads a dying person to actually experience the unpleasant state of being embarrassed what is being referenced is a cause of death that is worthy of embarrassment an event may be embarrassing relative to a certain party irrespective of whether that party ever actually feels embarrassed and indeed there are plenty of examples of embarrassing deaths where the person in question feels no embarrassment including but not limited to sudden or instantaneous deaths cases where the embarrassing features of death are unknown to the person dying and cases where the person is well positioned to experience embarrassment but simply fails to have the fitting response hedonism cannot account for the prudential value of the good death factors in these cases where there is no hedonic difference furthermore if our good death factors have non-instrumental prudential value in these cases they presumably also have some prudential value that cannot be explained by hedonism in the cases where there is a hedonic difference consequently it appears that hedonism cannot fully accommodate our three good death factors though it may partially account for their prudential value in some cases desire-fulfillment theories center around the idea that well-being consists in getting what one wants according to the simplest form of desire-fulfillment theory a state of affairs is good for you if and only if you desire it and it obtains since our actual desires can be distorted by ignorance false beliefs and bad reasoning some have proposed more sophisticated idealized desire-fulfillment theories which focus on the desires that a person would have if they were fully informed and rational on these theories if you or your idealized counterpart desire something for its own sake then it is good for you in and of itself20 the first thing to note is that desire-fulfillment theory is remarkably flexible and can recognize virtually anythingany state of affairs that can possibly be desiredas having prudential significance since people commonly do have desires regarding the features of death that we are considering it is tempting to suppose that desire-fulfillment theory accommodates them if i desire to die at home or in the company of my family or to avoid some embarrassing end and that comes to pass desire-fulfillment theory deems this good for me however desire-fulfillment theories make space for our good death factors in a way that does not do justice to how many people will view their prudential significance a distinguishing mark of desire-fulfillment theories is that they imply that each individuals well-being is partly grounded in their psychology what is good for a person depends crucially on what they desire since peoples desires about their own deaths vary this theory implies that the contours of a good death will also vary from individual to individual there is much plausibility to the idea that what impacts the goodness or badness of a death will depend to some extent upon the particular context and circumstances of the individual including various psychological facts for instance if someone has not forged a positive connection to their home perhaps it was the site of domestic abuse or other traumatic events then presumably dying at home is not good for that person likewise it might be that the best manner of facing death will be different for different people and must have a certain fit with their temperament and the overall character of their lives yet many people will reject the idea that these features of death are good for a person if and only if they or their idealized counterpart desires them and they occur imagine a man who dies from accidentally shooting himself with a gun that he himself just loaded most people will think the embarrassing nature of his death makes it worse for him and this apparent badness does not dissipate if it comes to light that this particular man would in no way have minded dying in this pointless and embarrassing way or for some reason desired that kind of death if anything this may suggest a kind of evaluative insensitivity on his part that provides a further reason to think him badly off this example draws out the fact that desire-fulfillment theory has implications that are counterintuitive for many people it can only recognize our good death factors in those instances where they happen to be desired by the dying person actually or under hypothetical idealized conditions in sum if our working assumption is true and our examples of good death factors do have non-instrumental prudential significance it appears that the two leading subjective theories of well-being cannot fully accommodate this fact this result does not seem particularly surprising nor will it generate much worry among subjectivists while it is possible that some will want to argue that their favored theory can fully accommodate these popular good death views most committed subjectivists will simply reject our working assumption perhaps supplementing that rejection with a debunking explanation as to why people have these objectivist intuitions21 what is more interesting to investigate is whether proponents of objective theories of well-being who tend to take objectivist intuitions more seriously are able to recognize our examples of good death factors let us now turn our attention to the most prominent objective theories perfectionism about well-being holds that the good life for humans consists in the development and exercise of capacities or excellences that are distinctive of our kind22 precisely which capacities those are is a matter of some debate some perfectionists rely on an account of human nature as a guide while others do not the most popularly cited capacities include theoretical rationality practical rationality and autonomy23 for our purposes we can follow richard kraut and think in terms of some broad categories of capacities physical sensory affective social and cognitive24 how might perfectionism account for our good death factors it might be thought that desiring or choosing a certain kind of death reflects some excellence of character to be sure the desire or choice to die at home or have loved ones present in death may indicate a healthy and fitting sentimental attachment to the places and people of ones life the desire to avoid an embarrassing end might also reflect some excellence of character but our examples of good death factors concern the actual circumstances of ones death desiring or choosing these aspects of a good death is neither necessary nor sufficient for them to actually occur perfectionism may be able to partially account for the prudential significance of dying at home with loved ones nearby or from some embarrassing cause for there will be cases of each kind where that feature of death is bound up with the exercise of ones capacities dying at home might involve reminiscing about ones personal history with that place or taking stock of ones life cognitive capacities and feeling various emotions that arise affective capacities having loved ones present at death can be good for individuals insofar as it involves the exercise of their affective and social capacities and sometimes the cause of a death is embarrassing because it stems from a persons failure to exercise their capacities well in the grand canyon case mentioned above it is possible that the man who fell to his death in an attempt at humor exhibited practical irrationality and clumsiness even so there are instances where these good death conditions cannot be explained in perfectionist terms dying at home and having loved ones present may seem to make for a better death even in cases where the dying person is unconscious or is conscious but unable to meaningfully engage because they are heavily medicated or in severe pain likewise dying for some embarrassing reason might seem to make a death worse even in cases where the person exercised their capacities to the fullest consider another embarrassing cliff death in september 2010 the owner of the company that makes segway motorized scooters died by accidentally going off a cliffon a segway25 for the sake of argument suppose that he was fully justified in believing that the path was safe and that he was operating the vehicle with expert skill i suspect most would agree that even if he did exercise his capacities perfectly well to the very end the cause of his death is quite embarrassing and made for a worse death than if he had simply fallen off a cliff while taking a walk an embarrassing cause of death need not stem from a failure to exercise ones capacities well or any lack of excellence in the person who dies hence as traditionally understood perfectionism seems unable to account for these cases where a good death factor obtains apart from any success or failure in exercising ones capacities26 and if it cannot account for the prudential significance of the factors in these cases it presumably also fails to fully account for it in cases that do involve the excellent or poor exercise of perfectionism-relevant capacities we turn finally to objective list theories where one might most expect to find some recognition of the distinctive goods and evils of death we have been considering objective list theories are objective and pluralistic these features create a hospitable environment for our good death factors pluralism allows for multiple factors that directly impact well-being and the objective dimension allows for factors that have some independence from the attitudes of the person who dies objective list theories are sometimes portrayed as explanatory theories which purport to identify the things or properties that are basically good or bad for us and explain why anything else is good or bad for us and sometimes as enumerative theories which list various things that are good or bad for us without any commitment about whether they provide the deepest explanation of prudential value27 this difference is neatly illustrated in essays by guy fletcher 2013 and christopher rice 2013 these philosophers present very similar overlapping objective list theories but fletcher regards his list as enumerative while rice presents his as explanatory if an objective list theory is merely enumerative it may be compatible with a range of explanatory theories including hedonism desire-fulfillment theory perfectionism or an explanatory objective list theory in contrast an explanatory objective list theory is a rival to all other explanatory theories for that reason our interest is in explanatory objective list theories with this interpretive groundwork in place it may be asked do our three examples of good death factors find a place on objective list theories what i wish to establish in this section is that although an objective list theory could in principle recognize these good death factors by and large the objective list theories discussed in the philosophical literature have not recognized them to ground this discussion consider a representative sample of objective lists proposed over the past four decadesfinnis 1980 life knowledge play aesthetic experience friendship practical reasonableness

2013 achievement friendship happiness pleasure self-respect virtuerice 2013 achievement meaningful knowledge loving relationships pleasure autonomy28 the first thing to notice is that our three examplesdying at home having loved ones present in death an embarrassing cause of deathdo not appear on any of the nine lists indeed there is no mention of anything explicitly death-related thus our three good death factors have not been acknowledged as things that are basically good or bad for a person this rules out one way in which the lists might have accommodated our examples the other way they might do so is by recognizing other things that are essentially linked to our three examples and explain why they have non-instrumental prudential significance let us examine whether the above lists recognize the good death factors in this way since i have already discussed hedonism at length i will not discuss happiness or related hedonic notionspleasure suffering etc objective list theories that include these goods will generally recognize our good death factors at least to the extent that hedonism does29 our first example of a putative good death factor is dying at home the fact that one bears a special relationship to ones homewhich could be based on a certain fit shared history or its role in ones identitymay explain the prudential significance of this factor while most of the above objective lists speak to relationships they appear to be gesturing toward reciprocal relationships with other sentient beings friendship loving relationships deep personal relations there is no indication that special relationships with places or objects might serve to enhance the desirability of a persons life or death it might be thought that dying at home is a form of self-expression which appears on jean kazezs list though that seems wrong since the phrase suggests a kind of activity perhaps it is self-expression to choose to die at home or to struggle against obstacles to ensure that that happens but setting aside cases of suicide and active voluntary euthanasia dying at home itself doesnt seem to be appropriately regarded as an act of self-expression even so one may regard it as making for a better death even when the person plays no active role in bringing it about the second example is having loved ones present at your deathbed at first glance it may seem obvious that friendship and loving relationships adequately account for this good death factor but on reflection it is not so obvious when friendship or deep personal relations appear on an objective list what prudentially significant property or properties are being indicated presumably the idea is that what is ultimately good for us is having loving personal relationships acquiring them maintaining them and perhaps also developing and deepening them having loved ones at your deathbed could serve to maintain develop or deepen your relationship with them but it need not30 nor must the absence of a loved one at the end of ones life have an adverse effect on the relationship if your spouse or child is physically unable to reach you due to weather conditions or transportation restrictions this need not diminish the quality of your relationship in any way nonetheless it remains a natural thought that being in the company of loved ones makes for a better death turning now to an embarrassing cause of death it might be thought that respect or self-respect addresses this issue but a loss of self-respect or the respect of others is not an essential feature of an embarrassing death presumably the man who died at the grand canyon did not have the time or mental clarity to lose self-respect as he fell in any case embarrassing deaths can be instantaneous and some embarrassing deaths never become known to other people and therefore do not weaken others respect for the person who died a much more plausible candidate is an item that appears on derek parfits list of prudential bads being deprived of dignity arguably this helps to explain why an embarrassing cause of death is bad for the one who dies it constitutes a loss or diminishment of ones dignity whether or not the one who dies or others are aware of this fact in summary none of the nine objective list theories we have considered seem to be successful in capturing all three good death factors those theories that include happiness or some related notion might be able to partially account for some instances of our good death factors in the way that hedonism can only one of the lists parfits appears suitable to more fully capture just one of our good death examples an embarrassing cause my investigation thus far suggests that if our three examples are indeed good death factors then hedonism perfectionism desire-fulfillment theory and most of the proposed objective list theories undergenerate inasmuch as they cannot fully recognize the prudential value of all three good death factors even if they might account for some instances what i now wish to suggest is that hedonism perfectionism and objective list theories may also have the further shortcoming of misgenerating with respect to the good death factors a theory can be said to misgenerate when it correctly identifies that a given thing is prudentially significant though it does not accurately capture how it is prudentially significant for instance it might misidentify what it is about something that makes it good or bad for us or it might misidentify the degree to which it is good or bad i will now suggest that three of the leading theories may misgenerate in the second way many people seem to attribute greater axiological weight to goods and bads that occur at the end of a life for instance imagine a person experiencing a migraine headache at some otherwise uneventful point in the middle of their life and then imagine them experiencing it at the very end of their life for many the latter seems worse and presumably what explains this is the proximity of the suffering to ones death even if the amount of suffering and opportunity cost would be the same it seems worse that ones life should end on that note likewise for happiness the experience of joy contentment and other pleasant emotions seems better to have at the end than at some less significant earlier point in our lives and similar points can be made about exercising ones capacities and facing embarrassment and a loss of dignity if goods and ills that occur at the end of a life do indeed carry greater prudential weight it is not obvious that hedonism perfectionism or the typical brand of objective list theory have a principled way of accounting for this fact nothing internal to hedonism seems to explain why pleasures and pains at lifes end would carry greater weight than otherwise equivalent pleasures and pain occurring earlier in life nor is it clear that perfectionism can make sense of the idea that the very same type and level of capacity-exercising has different prudential weights at different points in life finally while an objective list theory might in principle include some goods or bads that could account for this difference in axiological significance the nine objective lists given above seem to contain no such items consequently it appears that most of the leading theories have trouble accommodating one aspect of commonly held views about the good death31 i have now surveyed the most popular and widely discussed theories of well-being to see whether they recognize some paradigmatic good death factors my preliminary investigation suggests that if my working assumption is true each of the theories undergenerates by failing to fully account for the goodness or badness of all three good death factors moreover hedonism perfectionism and the popular sort of objective list theory seem to misgenerate insofar as they cannot account for the greater axiological significance commonly associated with goods and bads at the end of life all of this lends support to the following conditional conclusion if our three examples are indeed good death factors the leading theories of well-being are inadequate insofar as they do not fully recognize them granted this investigation has only been preliminary i have left many stones unturned so it is quite possible that proponents of the leading theories will find inventive ways to honor these commonsense convictions about the good death still the present investigation should at least suffice to shift the burden of proof to those who are inclined to think that the leading theories can fully accommodate these popular views of the good death one partial explanation for the neglect of the good death has to do with methodology well-being theorists tend to take as their starting point such broad all-encompassing questions as what does human well-being consist in or what makes a life go well for the one who is living it the most widely debated theories of well-being are broad answers to these broad questions such simple broad questions encourage us to take a wide-angle view of the topic and may foster the expectation that there is a simple broad answer to be discovered they nudge us away from an approach that takes a close look at particular dimensions of our lives our exploration of the good death shows that a narrower in-depth focus on a certain portion of human life can reveal greater complexity and richness in the realm of prudential value it helps us see and appreciate what is easily missed from a birds eye view of human well-being this is not to say that the good death provides the only avenue for learning this lesson the philosopher anthony skelton 2014 has argued that the leading theories of well-being are not well-suited to address the well-being of children skeltons critique of the extant well-being literature has affinities with the present critique the main difference is that skelton is focusing on the beginning of life rather than the end of it still both projects arguably reveal oversights in the well-being literature that are attributable to a methodology that focuses on human well-being in general there is nothing wrong with taking an interest in ambitiously broad questions about well-being yet if narrowing our focus to some restricted dimension of well-being such as the prudential value of death or the well-being of people with autism32 yields new insights about the good life and reveals shortcomings of the most popular theories we should be wary about theorizing only at the most general level ideally philosophical work will draw not only upon our reflections and intuitions about what is good for human beings in general or what makes for a good life in general but will also examine well-being in narrower dimensions of human life this could constitute a kind of reflective equilibrium methodology for the philosophy of well-being another part of the explanation for why well-being theorists have not recognized the four good death factors may be an overly restrictive understanding of objective list theories to date the sorts of objective list theories that have been proposed tend to acknowledge only a relatively short list of prudential values achievement friendship happiness loving relationships knowledge and so on while these lists may hit upon the prudential goods and ills that matter the most in our lives they might neglect a wide range of goods and bads that matter to a lesser extent33 i assume that many of the good death factors we have considered qualify as minor goods and bads dying at home having an embarrassing death and facing ones death with good humor are the not the sort of things that are likely to make the difference between a good life and a bad life they are not typically regarded as having anything close to the prudential importance of such things as life-long loving relationships major achievements long-term life-satisfaction and happiness and so on still even if these good death factors are not sufficient to make or break a persons overall well-being arguably they do have some significance and should sometimes figure in peoples prudential deliberation particularly as they approach the end of their lives to capture the subtleties of peoples views about the good death and in all likelihood many other aspects of our lives we may require a different kind of objective list theoryone that incorporates both major and minor goods and bads of life and thereby constitutes a more radical form of pluralism this may be an unwelcome development to philosophers who are eager to arrive at complete and digestible answers to our normative inquiries and perhaps because of this are drawn to simple elegant theories completeness in a theory of well-being might be attainable if prudential value can be boiled down to a single property or some small set of properties however it is possible that the prudential landscape is far more complicated and nuanced than any monistic or modestly pluralistic theory is able to capture to repeat a popular misquoting of einstein our theories should be as simple as possiblebut no simpler34 if there are minor prudential goods and bads there is a real possibility that a complete and plausible theory of the good life will always remain beyond our reach this would not mean that theorizing about well-being is futile or that we can never arrive at worthwhile knowledge proponents of this new brand of objective list theory might reasonably hope to increase their knowledge of the major goods and bads of life and perhaps also their understanding of some of lifes minor ones but they should expect their understanding of the good life to always remain a work in progress35 philosophical discussions of the good life have been relatively silent on the topic of the good death and it appears that the leading theories of the good life cannot do justice to certain widely held views about the good death this is explained at least in part by a methodology that focuses on providing broad answers to broad questions and does not attend to narrower domains of life and by an overly restrictive understanding of objective list theories this suggests two recommendations for future work in the philosophy of well-being first the dominant methodology needs to be counterbalanced by attention to narrower domains of human life and experience second there is the need to explore and develop more nuanced and complex objective list theories that make room for minor goods and badsincluding though certainly not limited to all of the features that make for a better or worse death  the covid-shock doctrine under the tutorship of cov-2 the voices from poland oskar

 compassion in a time of covid-19 sandro galea   the verdict on the success of the global response to the covid-19 pandemic remains to be written but the consequences of the disease are indisputable and rapidly coming into focus in many countries efforts to contain covid-19 have resulted in an economic recession pushing millions out of their jobs and creating previously unprecedented unemployment in many countries worldwide in addition to the millions of people infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 hundreds of thousands have diedand will diefrom covid-19 an anticipated wave of mental and behavioural problems is beginning to be documentedcompounded by social and economic stressors and uncertaintiesthat will likely present a population health burden for months and years to come covid-19 has also triggered enormous displays of pro-social behaviour with neighbours coming to the aid of those isolated by the containment efforts and of support for front-line workers including doctors nurses and other health-care personnel whose responsibilities keep them at risk of infection in the public conversation about this pandemic an admirable empathy has been evident for those who have been affected and for those who have died from covid-19 in some ways the pandemic has brought populations together generating an understanding that our health is interlinked and that we could all be at risk that understanding made it possible perhaps in an unprecedented way to empathise with those with the disease and to wish them well out of a clear sense that they could also be us infectious diseases have always been the paradigmatic example of diseases that show how our health is interlinked we take vaccinations and make sure our children are vaccinated both to protect ourselves and as a social good this impulse is laudable and indeed useful it has helped for example ensure that during this pandemic an enormous number of people worldwide have followed guidance and orders to physically distance with relatively little demonstrable social disturbance in fact the opposite quickly became true in many countries social norms shifted to encourage physical distancing casting opprobrium on those who may have flaunted physical distancing norms and expectations public apologies by prominent figures who were found to be flaunting these guidelines became a feature of national media coverage and yet it is worth reflecting on the extent to which our response to the covid-19 pandemic has been informed by an understanding that we are all in this together that the virus does not discriminate and that as a result it benefits us all to comply with physical distancing guidelines to protect others and ourselves our empathy our capacity to envision that we too could be affected has been a powerful tool in the public health arsenal but in large part it is hard not to notice that our empathy is informed here as it often is by an appreciation of our own personal risk we feel regret and feel terrible about those who are suffering in no small part because we can imagine that suffering being our own but is it true that this suffering is our own is it true that covid-19 does not discriminate evidence is emerging that the effects of covid-19 far from being indiscriminate follow deeply entrenched patterns of health inequities mirroring burdens of disease that are near universal those with resources money and power often majority racial or ethnic groups are better able to physically distance work from home and retain their employment those same groups then have lower risks of becoming infected or dying from covid-19 probably reflecting a combination of factors including better access to health care and a lower underlying burden of morbidity that predisposes to worse covid-19 outcomes it turns out that covid-19 does discriminate and that those who are already vulnerablefor example the unstably housed people on low income those with poorer education and individuals with less access to reliable nutritious foodare more likely to both become infected with the virus and die from covid-19 and this is where empathy fails empathy in the context of health is largely predicated on our appreciating the risks of a disease because we can imagine getting the disease ourselves when we imagine we can also be infected we are then willing to take the steps necessary to protect ourselvesand othersfrom the disease and that force has been powerful and contributed to the dramatic change in how we live and in a shutdown of large parts of the worlds economy informed by fear of a novel disease and the need to protect ourselves and others around us 

 but what if those efforts contribute to health divides what if those efforts also result in economic consequences that are inevitably going to be borne principally by those who are vulnerable and marginalised to begin with what if those efforts are therefore going to result in the long-term widening of health inequities consigning many people to worse mental and physical health for years to come how do we account for this eventuality and how do we factor this into our thinking this calls ultimately for compassion as the animating force behind our thinking about health and our thinking about how we go about informing the decisions we make to contain a novel threat like covid-19 compassion extends beyond empathy it does not motivate our action because we too may be harmed compassion motivates action because the phenomena we observe are unjust not worthy of the world we would like to live in martin luther king jr spoke often of compassion enjoining us to see that compassion ultimately motivates not to fling a coin to a beggar but to see that the edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring compassion pushes us to understand how we have structured the world and to ask how we can structure it better not because we may suffer but because others are suffering and that is not how the world should be what would such a world look like it would be one that is grounded in the principles of justice and the equitable distribution of resources an approach to health that is rooted in compassion would help us see beyond ourselves and place the good of others first a world rooted in compassion would embrace health as a public good this means treating health the way we do parks education the post office fire stations or our environmentin essence as a crucial piece of the global commons supported by our collective investment for the benefit of all i recognise that this might seem theoretical but such an approach would have concrete implications for our approach to health that can shape all our actions be they in times of crisis or in other times in some respects the current overwhelming investment in doctors and medicine has pushed a vision of health as a private commodity something we can buy and sell particularly in countries like the usa that do not have access to universal health care but what we can buyhealth carecan only help us after we have become sick and what we have been buying in the time of covid-19 is largely an approach to bludgeon an epidemic into submission informed by strict prioritisation of the biological imperatives of viral transmission but our focus should always have been and more importantly should now be on building a world that is resilient to these challenges our focus should be on health as a state of not being sick to begin with grounded in an approach that balances the health of all in all our actions we must recognise that unless we invest in the preventive conditions of healthlike safe housing good schools liveable wages gender equity clean air drinkable water and a more equal economyany action we take during this and any future pandemic is likely to widen entrenched health gaps and that situation should be unacceptable to all of us would our approach to covid-19 have been different were we accustomed to seeing health through the lens of compassion i would argue yes first we would have long invested in the conditions that make people healthy aiming to remove the underlying disproportionate burden of preventable illness that accrues to vulnerable populations worldwide second our response to covid-19 would be informed in equal parts by efforts to contain the spread and to mitigate how the consequences of our efforts to do so can bring about disproportionate harm to those who are removed from the decision making around this pandemic third our response would recognise the global differences that characterise a world that puts the burden of disease squarely on countries with fewer resources often driven to that condition by centuries of cross-national injustice and would push us to redouble our efforts to do everything in our power to help those countries perhaps before our own surely this moment calls for careful reflection and a reinvestment in compassion as a foundational approach to health calling attention to compassion in this way is not sentimental it is pointing out a tangible good without which health for all is impossible in a sense covid-19 has shown us that a healthy person and a healthy world are the same and healthy people and a healthy world are both strengthened immeasurably by having compassion at the heart of health  why challenge trials of sarscov2 vaccines could be ethical despite risk of severe adverse events nir eyal   
fair and beneficent treatment of participants in a challenge trial depends not simply on reducing the likelihood of severe clinical outcomes such as fatality in the study for participants might have experienced similar or worse events anyhow and it makes no sense to hold such outcomes against the protocol the trial should reduce for each participant and for the entire cohort how much that likelihood exceeds that of commensurate bad outcomes for the same people under two alternative scenarios delineated below which do not involve participation in that particular study the idea is straightforward doctors offer patients surgeries and toxic drugs that may result in severe clinical outcomes or they experiment with new interventions all the time these approaches are perfectly justified when the doctors thereby save these same patients from greater likelihood of similar bad events without the treatment or the experiment one thing that is worse than getting your belly cut for an indicated operation is not undergoing that indicated operation because say you are uninsured the operation injures you and puts you at risk but it usually brings a net benefit to move from the fact that an injured belly would in itself be a harm and a source of risk to the conclusion that being uninsured is a blessing would be fallacious in assessing the risks and the benefits to study participants research ethics heeds not simply the risks of study participation it also heeds the balance of incremental risks and incremental benefits from participation which matters much more
10

 this calculus applies to human challenge trials as well what matters in assessing the offer that researchers make to candidate participants is not simply the socalled absolute risk
11
 better described as the raw or contributing risk that comes with the challengewhether viral exposure poses only minor or controllable risks or alternatively more serious onesbut the net risk the risk from participating in that trial minus the risk that the same person would face otherwise in other words what matters is the full balance of personal risk and benefit the evaluation of a challenge trial ought to look at the difference the trial would make to the participants health or life an institutional review board for example should heed the change in risk exposure that would apply to the participant because she would be in the trial and not in some alternative scenario for judging the ethics of a sarscov2 challenge trial two alternative scenarios to participation in the challenge trial are especially pertinent in one a person declines to participate in any sarscov2 vaccine efficacy test that scenario helps identify how trial participation may affect that person overall for good and for ill in another the same person participates in the competing form of trial namely a standard efficacy trial for the same vaccine the latter would result in delay but it may be tempting to argue that it is kinder to study participants and hence more ethical to compare personal risks between the two studies we shall look at the participants average counterpart in the efficacy study whether or not the participant of the challenge trial can herself join a standard efficacy study 
it turns out that compared to either of these two alternative scenarios both for each individual and for the cohort the net risk from participating in a sarscov2 vaccine challenge would be negative small or unclear the net risk could not be clearly very large differently put a sarscov2 challenge trial may turn out to constitute indirectly beneficial research for study participantsso that they would be medically disadvantaged if ultimately excluded from it or if they were admitted to a standard efficacy trial instead properly done a challenge trial certainly would not expose participants to a known far higher prospect of net harm than would either of these alternatives how might introducing a sometimes deadly and incurable pathogen into the body of a perfectly healthy person improve that persons health and welfare prospects the explanation lies in the peculiarities of the current pandemic which features a highly transmissible virus and overwhelms health systems worldwide for any individual the probability of incurring death or disability from an infection is a x b where a stands for the probability of getting infected and b stands for the probability of either dying from or developing a longterm disability as a result of the infection what is a x b if an individual participates in a challenge trial what is it if she declines what is it if she participates instead in a standard efficacy trial is the probability largest in the first case and by enough to justify blocking willing and decisionally capacitated adults from enabling highly valuable trials to gauge the magnitude of a x b in a challenge trial versus outside any trial versus in a standard efficacy trial let us look separately at a and at b in each of these three scenarios when people assume that challenge trials are very dangerous to participate in they usually focus on a the probability of getting infected under these three scenarios for any candidate participant the likelihood of getting infected is clearly greater with the challenge trials artificial challenge than if the person either declines to participate in any trial or participates in a standard efficacy trial however in the sarscov2 case the research team can and should select participants for whom the probability of infection is least larger in a challenge trial recent models predict widespread worldwide exposure to this coronavirus some areas are likely to experience infection rates of greater than 50
12
 and the proposal is to recruit only from areas with ongoingly or expected high transmission rates
13
 since the world is a large and variegated place and candidate selection can be careful and targeted there should be many outlier areas among which to choose where the probability of getting infected later would be very high at the time of candidate selection because expedited vaccine trials could shorten the current global economic recession and prevent many deaths worldwide it would make perfect sense to invest in carefully selecting and then safely transporting a few hundred healthy candidate participants from hightransmission areas to the isolated research centerseven across international borders in light of the public health emergency related red tape should be removed if participants are selected in that way the challenge trial is much likelier to hasten participants exposure than to impose an exposure that they would have otherwise avoided in the rare event that exposure kills a participant the earlier exposure could mean that the individual dies a few months sooner than if exposed to the virus outside the trial design but this temporal factor seems less significant than the substantial effect trial participation could have on how likely the person is to die with appropriate trial procedures and smart participant selection b the probability of dying or developing disability if infected would be smaller in a challenge trial it may be much smaller first the proposed trial design includes frequent monitoring that may catch disease and enable participants to receive supportive care and any therapeutics proven by that point very early probably before any complications develop
14
 outside the challenge trials by contrast testing could be scarce and many carriers could remain asymptomatic which impedes a testandtreat approach that may be deemed promising for some patients any therapeutics proven by then might not be universally available yet
so long as challenge participants are selected and supported as recommended the prospective harms properly understood as the incremental harms are unlikely to far exceed the benefits for individual participants they could actually be smaller
it would be only prudent and fair toward trial participants to prioritize them for any novel therapeutics
15
 challenge trials for a sarscov2 vaccine should also offer guaranteed access to standardofcare lifesustaining treatments including immediate assistance during cardiac arrest as lifesupport services reach capacity in many parts of the developed world over the coming months patients from hightransmission areas who develop severe disease will often die outside trials it is true that according to reports published so far most covid patients who rely on critical care do not survive
16
 but crucially here younger covid patients who need critical care tend to survive
17
 in the united kingdom for example of the covid patients aged 16 to 39 whose critical care outcomes were reported by may 15 2020 819 had been released from critical care
18
 it is also true that a period in intensive care for covid19 treatment may leave patients physically or psychologically disabled
19
 but the option of receiving critical care which significantly helps prevent the very worst outcome of shortterm fatality is clearly a substantial medical benefit because for young patients with severe covid19 the absence of lifesustaining interventions makes a big difference between likely survival and no chance at all the probability of averting death in the event of infection would be substantially better inside a challenge trial than outside any trial and this probability would be somewhat larger than in a standard efficacy trial which would find it somewhat harder to provide that full guarantee of support to its thousands of participants in short if researchers conducting challenge trials act as recommended admittedly the probability of getting infected would remain larger inside a challenge trial than either outside any trial or in a standard efficacy trial but the probability of death or disability is likely to be much smaller inside a challenge trial than in these alternative scenarios overall a x b could be smaller for any individual inside the challenge trial than either outside any trial or in a standard efficacy trial what the individual would lose in the probability of averting infection with that probability rising she could gain in better protection from death even if eventually with more data and calculations a x b turns out to be equal under these alternative scenarios or slightly better under them here is what is unlikely to be the case dynamic and uncertain data notwithstanding that a x b is much much smaller if a properly selected and treated individual does not participate in any trial or if she partakes in a standard efficacy trial instead this matters in espousing a limit on how risky participating in a trial may justifiably be contemporary research ethicists usually describe what exceeds that limit in terms of extremely high net risk to the participant the limit is surpassed only when the overall balance of prospective medical harms and medical benefits to the participant is highly adverse
20

 there is another important welfare or borderlinemedical benefit from participation some potential challenge participants simply could not extinguish risk of getting exposed say because they have to leave home for essential work they could not extinguish it either by declining to participate in any trial or by participating in a standard efficacy trial instead among them those who live with others would understandably worry about infecting household members including in some cases old or frail relatives they would know that if reinfection is rare or impossible something that scientists are still examining they would not infect them as long as their own infection and infectious period take place in isolation putting at least a temporary end to the risk of infecting others would help keep their loved ones alivesurely a substantial benefit
21
 by contrast if they do not join any study or if they participate in a standard efficacy study the probability of infecting those dearest to them could remain substantial all in all so long as challenge participants are selected and supported as recommended above the prospective harms properly understood as the incremental harms are unlikely to far exceed the benefits for individual participants they could actually be smaller to sum up so far the answer to the right question about the appreciation in net risk is that on balance challenge trial participation could be either prospectively beneficial or neutral or slightly prospectively harmfulcertainly not highly prospectively harmful therefore it cannot justify paternalistic protection when adults with the requisite decisionmaking capacity wish to help researchers do enormous good one objection is that my argument compares participation in a challenge trial to the wrong scenarios the correct comparison it could be objected is to idealized circumstancesof greater justice otherwise a vaccine producer might exploit unjust background strife of candidate participants to offer them less safety than it should
22

 to exploit someone is roughly to use their unjust disadvantage to ones unfair advantage leaving them with less than they should have
23
 for example a sweatshop owner makes to potential workers a worse offer than she should the pay is unfairly low and the degree of safety is not what it should be exploiting their alternatives which are unfairly even worsestarvation for instance the fundamental problem here may have to do with the distributive consequences say that the owner winds up with too much and the workers too little or with the workers effective inability to decline the offer or simply with the perverse relation in which the owner stands to them whatever the fundamental problem may be we usually consider this problematic and inasmuch as widespread infections and lack of access to critical care flow from injustices one could claim that recruiters for human challenge trials or the societies they serve are likewise exploiting an unjust disadvantage instead one could argue the appropriate comparator of participating in a challenge trial is living in a world free of these injustices or their disadvantageous sequelae indeed two senior french doctors were recently condemned for having proposed testing coronavirus vaccines in african patients based on assumptions about african nations financial inability to fight the virus effectively
24
 while the backlash probably had more to do with unsympathetic and somewhat racist suggestions that these doctors made on the occasion the potential exploitation of background economic injustices may also have been a concern the challenge trials i discuss here would probably take place in leading research centers in the richest countries but inside these countries transmission rates and the need for unavailable critical care services may typically end up being worst in impoverished minority and undocumented migrant neighborhoods among the uninsured and underinsured and among other victims of societal injustice some unethical historical challenge trials were done on such participants improving these participants overall risk exposure compared to their unjust alternatives
25
 while these historical comparisons are obviously inappropriate given that these abuses also involved violations of consent of independent review and so forth
26
 their unethical nature may also have involved the exploitation of background injustices
27
 does the potential for that kind of exploitation undermine my case for testing sarscov2 vaccines through the challenge trial design there is a simple answer to the concern about exploitation to avoid preying on victims of injustice likely to live in certain areas all research teams need to do is recruit elsewhere the world is a big place and unfortunately there will be plenty of areas with ongoing and expected high transmission as well as devastating demand for critical care services even absent grossly unjust background poverty disparities lack of insurance and the like some locales are experiencing or can expect a surge in covid19 cases for reasons other than preexisting systemic injusticesimply because of bad luck or even warranted choices that panned out poorly for example governments may not have invested a great portion of health care funds in intensive care units and supplies in the years before the pandemic in favor of investing in costeffective interventions that over time promote population health and longevity more researchers could always focus recruitment on such locales indeed although researchers should recruit from hightransmission areas those need not be areas of the very highest transmission rates if the latter locales correlate closely with background injustices some other areas that are generally betteroff would do of course it is impossible to project which locales will have become hightransmission areas when it is time to test the efficacy of each candidate vaccine for illustrative purposes however consider middleclass areas of stockholm if social democratic swedens recent choices to avoid social distancing turn out to have been epidemiologically mistaken not quite the same thing as unjust
28
 again transporting a few hundred candidate participants from afar even across borders to the research center is a rational financial and administrative investment toward alleviating a deep recession a second answer is that in this instance research teams may be able to recruit volunteers driven not solely by promoting their own health but also by altruism the nonprofit 1day sooner is collating contact details of potential volunteers for live sarscov2 challenge trials and reports over 21000 applications at the time of this writing
29
 many potential volunteers study or teach at elite academic institutions many are selfidentified effective altruists who recount past altruistic acts while selfreports ought to be taken with caution it may turn out that enough participants would volunteer with full comprehension of the medical risks perhaps out of altruism and not because of misunderstandingand not because they have suffered systemic injustice that makes them vulnerable to exploitation avoiding financial incentives for participation would further help select volunteers with the best motives
30
 the causal route to their participation would not exploitatively rely on offering benefits to thwart major injustices toward them a third answer is that the ethics around nonexploitation is complex avoiding exploitation as defined above would mean that some victims of injustice are denied any benefits of trial participation and that many people like them of the same racial minority for example or as undernourished as they are are denied the benefit of the vaccines having been tested in people like them the upshot of showing that an action would be exploitative is therefore unclear sometimes it is much better to be exploited than not to be exploited finally even if exploiting unjust strife were unavoidable in challenge trials of sarscov2 vaccines concerns about exploitation would not be strong enough to unseat the otherwise very strong case for these trials it is true that even with a study volunteers willing consent and even given the need to thwart a public health disaster some research ethicists not all
31
 would consider high likelihood of grave harm to a volunteer to remain forbidden
32
 but no one i know seriously argues that worries about beneficial perfectly consensual research that is marred merely by an exploitative route to benefit and consent is enough to ban a study that can be expected to save an inordinate number of lives remember that the challenge trial design could cut several months in the wait for vaccine rollout translating into thousands or millions of lives spared from exponential growth in direct covid deaths
33
 true only a third to one half of all vaccine efficacy trials lead to vaccine approval
34
 and there is some chance that none of the over 100 extant vaccine candidates will work or that an approved vaccine will not be rolled out widely but even a portion of the potential lives that might be spared thanks to sarscov2 vaccine challenge trials from covid death from death or serious harm from other diseases that are neglected during the pandemic and from famines and halted economic development during months of delay could be a very large number of lives spared put more dramatically the main factor resting on one side of the moral scale is a significant chance at averting a great number of deathsprobably vastly more than in the 20142016 ebola outbreak with 11315 deaths or even the 2004 indian ocean tsunami with around 250000 deaths what stands on the other side is not averting serious net harm to an individual which is the consideration that some research ethicists count more the complaint on that side is that while admittedly challenge trial participation could benefit that individual on balance and she could rationally and autonomously choose to enroll the causal roots of that benefit are impure this is not a balance that would stop any serious research ethicist from approving a crucial trial for all these reasons the concern about exploitation even if applicable and cogent cannot unseat the initial case for conducting challenge trials this is not to say that researchers should ignore that concern it may affect how best to conduct the trialssay by recruiting from areas with high transmission rates but no blatant injustices still some form of challenge trial remains permissible and to accelerate vaccine rollout highly recommended ethically challenge trials should enroll individuals only with their fully free and informed consent
35
 but with some medical trials just or unjust background circumstances are so dire that they leave candidate participants no reasonable option except to enroll perhaps that is what troubles ethicists who consider challenge trials and warn about dire background injustices it may also be part of what worries some about the quality of consent in trials of novel cancer therapeutics which give terminal patients a last hope to fight off a cancer that is irresponsive to approved treatments
36
 in a sense these desperate patients cannot because they cannot afford to say no and are forced to participate in english when one chooses the less bad of two bad options one is often said to have been forced or compelled to make that choice
37
 all this may seem to invalidate any consent that people in dire circumstances may give to trial participation and may make their inclusion in the trial unfree and one could argue wrongful and given the effects of the current pandemic anyone joining a challenge trial for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus may be said to be forced to participate this argument that bad alternatives to trial participation invalidate consent to participate cannot work it would forbid many ordinary participant selection procedures for cancer therapy research it could even absurdly invalidate consent to advanced cancer care on the parallel ground that the patient cannot afford to say no but the argument is even more questionable when applied to vaccine research the risk profile of someone who knows that she has advanced cancer is very different from that of someone wholike vaccine trial recruitshas not been infected and is therefore at far less dramatic risk especially if research teams recruit only young and healthy individuals for whom even infection is highly unlikely to translate into severe disease recruits should not feel desperate or compelled to participate in the trial for their own healths sakes what i argued above is only that there are health benefits from participation not that recruits should feel desperate for them if some persistently do they should be excluded in the consent process for misunderstanding relevant facts or on psychiatric grounds in that respect since we should permit these cancer studies we should also permit human challenge studies of novel coronavirus vaccines some vaccine candidates may turn out only in efficacy testing to be toxic
38
 some may turn out only during efficacy testing to enhance covid19 severity manifold
39
 the greater the chance for vaccine safety issues the better in that respect for individuals to decline to participate in trials
40
 this may suggest that participating in the challenge trial is prospectively harmful after all let me offer four responses first challenge trial participants would prospectively benefit in other ways and so may still prospectively benefit overallthis risk notwithstanding second that chance for vaccine safety issues is as likely per person to arise in standard efficacy trials assuming that some form of efficacy testing of vaccines is legitimate in this crisis this factor should not weigh against challenge trials third in standard efficacy trials toxicity and severe disease are much less safe for participants because they erupt in the field not in a controlled medical environment with frequent monitoring and guaranteed medical help
41
 therefore vaccine unsafety is far more dangerous to a participant in a standard efficacy trial than to one in a challenge trial fourth in standard efficacy trials any risk of toxicity or enhanced severity accrues to 10 to 50 times as many participants for the simple reason that such trials require 10 to 50 times as many participants in short appropriate concern about enhanced severity cannot constitute an advantage of standard efficacy trials over a human challenge trial quite the contrary it only strengthens the ethical case for challenge trials to replace standard efficacy testing of vaccines against the novel coronavirus i have argued that if challenge trials are done right the incremental risk from participation in them may be smaller than the incremental benefit from it the main benefit invoked was priority access to critical care and therapeutics in the event of severe covid19 however that benefit may seem irrelevant or tertiary to some either because harm allegedly matters more than benefits or because this particular benefit is indirect contempt for mere benefits merits only a short response researchers as well as clinicians appropriately offer countermeasures known to be riskier when the expected benefits exceed the expected risks while some benefits such as mere enhancement and mere financial benefit might be less important than a trials primary benefit to the participant others are clearly as important the benefits discussed here are in terms of avoiding covid19 fatalitythe main risk under consideration indeed it is not even clear what counts as reduction in incremental risk and what as increase in incremental benefit
42

 what is worth further discussion is the worry that these lifesaving benefits are nevertheless merely indirect because they would not arise from receiving the intervention being studied
43
 nor is treatment for covid19 among the clinical benefits of the procedures that are scientifically necessary to test the experimental intervention under study
44
 an anonymous reviewer of an earlier version of this article thought that indirect benefits should not count toward the assessment of study participants balance of personal risks and personal benefits lest researchers address any major risk with financial compensation or still other indirect benefits however for the purposes of this article we can set aside the question whether money can ever adequately compensate for acute medical risk again priority access to covid19related critical care is a medical not a financial benefit it directly addresses the main risk of challenge participation namely premature covid19related mortality how can such an indirect benefit not count in addition some benefits from participation in a covid19 challenge trial would be direct benefits consider potentially better protection for ones family if infection provides longterm immunity and a safer environment for episodes of enhanced disease severity compared to the environment for standard efficacy trial participants these benefits emanate directly from the best scientific way to hold the study furthermore scholars who have looked at indirect benefits usually propose including them in institutional review boards riskbenefit calculations
45
 or even on informed consent forms
46
 in fact the questionable in my view regulatory block on invoking indirect benefits pertains in the united states only to research on people who cannot provide informed consent such as children
47
 and is irrelevant to the present case of challenge trials on decisionally capacitated adults
48

 even the benefit of better access to critical care and therapeutics in a challenge trial than in ones hightransmission area is borderline direct while not strictly speaking scientifically necessary to test the experimental intervention under study this care would be part of trial safety it is not ancillary care or retroactive compensation for a trial that risks covid19 fatality instead it preempts high risk of covid fatality resulting from the viral exposure in the study access to critical care is also ethically owed to study participants per most accounts of research ethics anyhow critical care is not experimental treatment that as such might not be owed nor is it in rich countries so exquisitely rare that despite participants especially strong claim to it they should be denied it not to offer critical care would be preposterous in a challenge trial for a deadly disease that critical care helps treat far from an afterthought to appease those protesting an unfair riskbenefit ratio critical care is owed in the first place what if a candidate participant who hails from a hightransmission area actually has low risk of getting infected for a reason that sets her apart from her neighbors such as being personally willing and able to isolate herself extraordinarily well then there is an important sense in which trial participation could harm that individual greatly in the trial exposure would be certain whereas outside the trial it would remain unlikely

 researchers should go some way toward identifying and excluding such individuals for example by asking about candidate participants work and household arrangements or even surveying them on risk behavior perhaps informed consent forms should exhort candidate participants to consider personal risk factors and avoid participation if they are highly unlikely to get exposed naturally however just as some participants would have less risk of natural exposure than researchers could know others would have greater risk of natural exposure than researchers could know researchers should ascribe to candidates the average risk level for the risk category package they investigate by sticking with the average nonomniscient researchers are as likely to introduce more net harm than expected as they are to introduce less net harm than expected it should all balance out and the risk exposure that researchers are ethically responsible for is arguably the one that they know or could with reasonable effort find out about not the objective one discussed here 
as i have argued the right ethical question about human challenge trials for sarscov2 vaccines is not the commonly raised one about their likelihood of leading to deaths and other severe adverse events given the diseases seriousness and the current lack of proven therapeutics the right question is whether challenge trials would increase study participants likelihood of similar bad outcomes compared to two alternative scenarios nonparticipation in any trial and participation in standard efficacy trials for the same vaccines as shown surprisingly compared to these two alternatives human challenge studies would on balance probably benefit or at least not dramatically harm study participants challenge trials could also reduce the overall prospect of harm in the participant cohort with respect to sarscov2 ethicists should not advocate a ban on a trial design that may accelerate a proven vaccines rollout by months just because risks were calculated the wrong way let us not miss our chance to quash the current global crisis earlier through perfectly permissible research a further conclusion follows based on the ethical requirement to give participants a fair balance of risks and benefits it need not be important to recruit individuals or a cohort who would be at low risk of bad outcomes in the trial the balance of risks and benefits may turn out to be similar for participants who would be at low risk in the trial such as young and healthy individuals and for ones who would be at high risk such as older people and individuals who have relevant underlying health problems it may turn out that compared to these alternative scenarios challenge trial participation is prospectively beneficial or not very harmful for all potential recruits including highrisk ones if and when that is indeed the case it would seem compatible with sensibly calculated riskbenefit requirements to recruit for a challenge trial not only young and healthy people
50
 for whom both risks and benefits are low it would also seem permissible to recruit old people and people who live with health conditions that make them especially vulnerable to covid19 people for whom both risks and benefits are high all could benefit or at least not lose a lot in their prospects compared to if they do not participate and compared to if they participate in a standard efficacy trial recruiting an ample number of participants from several such vulnerable populations may allow us to skip further testing for vaccine safety
51
 or efficacy in populations earlier excluded from the efficacy study and move straight to conditional approval and alongside further rigorous testing in broader populations wide rollout additional months would be saved in the race to a universal vaccine rollout other ethical considerations may be thought to weigh against recruiting older patients and patients with conditions that increase risk from infection one is that their recruitment could increase the risk that some patients would die from trial procedures undermining public trust another is that for these higherrisk populations the benefit of guaranteed access to therapeutics and lifesustaining interventions in the event of severe infection might be crucial enough to force them to participate in the sense expounded above whether these two considerations are sensible and weighty enough to forgo cutting additional months from the process is a question that i shall leave for another day funding for this work comes from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases through grant ai11461706 hiv cure studies risk risk perception and ethics for helpful comments i am grateful to paul firth scott halpern samia hurst gregory kaebnick peter k lee marc lipsitch alex j london harisan nasir dan wikler and an anonymous reviewer  sars-cov-2 will continue to circulate in the human population an opinion from the point of view of the virus-host relationship volodymyr oberemok v kateryna laikova v kseniya yurchenko a irina fomochkina i anatolii kubyshkin v   genomic alignments suggest that the covid-19 virus sars-cov-2 from the genus betacoronavirus may be the result of recombination of genetic material from two different viruses one similar to the chinese horseshoe bat virus 1 and the other closer to the pangolin virus two divergent viruses could have infected the same organism simultaneously to date aside from bat coronavirus ratg13 962 similarity the pangolin-cov 9102 similarity is the coronavirus most closely related to sars-cov-2 2 even though the exact origin of the virus remains unclear it is possible to infect a chinese horseshoe bat or a pangolin with the sars-cov-2 and evaluate the success of the infection to determine the origin of the new virus responsible for the pandemic did it come from animals or from a laboratory while the absence of disease symptoms in these animals may be due to the effectiveness of their immune systems the intensity of viral proliferation can be easily detected using the real-time pcr technique however the genie has already escaped from the bottle and now we need to deal with the result not the cause moreover a hand-made virus is likely to be effective against both animals and humans investigations suggest that sars-cov-2 may bind human ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor with high affinity but computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal and that the rbd receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is optimized for binding to human ace2 receptor with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted 3 4 this evidence is strongly arguing against culture-based scenarios thus the high-affinity binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to human ace2 receptor is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ace2 receptor that permits another optimal binding solution to arise however more scientific facts are needed to answer the question about the origin of the virus obtaining related viral sequences from animal sources would be the most definitive way of revealing viral origins 1 the possibility of the existence of a potential intermediate host of sars-cov-2 a missing link between a bat and human or a pangolin and human can also shed light on the current pandemic to date however there is no credible evidence to support the claim that sars-cov-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered coronavirus 5 in early december 2019 the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were identified in wuhan the capital city of hubei province in china 6 the pathogen has since been identified as a novel enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna betacoronavirus 7 this virus which has a phylogenetic similarity to sars-cov 8 has been given the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 also covid-19 virus to date among the total number of patients with covid-19 globally the case-fatality rate ratio between the dead and total number of infected ranges from 51 to 52 and is constantly increasing this is ten times more than from the usual seasonal flu also sars-cov-2 is supposed to be more contagious and environmentally stable than seasonal flu viruses since seasonal flu usually ends by april in northern hemisphere in addition it seems that the virus is also more likely to affect the heart than any other similar viruses so although pneumonia is often the main cause of death cardiologists and infectionists for example in russia are seeing infected patients whose worst symptoms are not respiratory but cardiac and many people infected with covid-19 are dying from heart attacks as a possible complication of sars-cov-2 infection high expression of the ace2 receptor via which covid-19 virus enters cells using its spike glycoprotein was identified in type ii alveolar cells at2 of the lung 911 esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon 11 cholangiocytes 12 myocardial cells kidney proximal tubule cells and bladder urothelial cells these findings indicate that those organs with high ace2 expressing cells should be considered as a potential high risk for sars-cov-2 infection 9 investigations suggest that the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 is the result of the combination of a bat sars-cov with an unknown beta-cov 13 probably a coronavirus of pangolin origin the s1 subunit containing the receptor-binding domain region of the spike protein of pangolin-cov is much more closely related to that of sars-cov-2 than to that of the bat coronavirus ratg13 moreover while five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 mainly expressed in a small subset of cells in the lung called type 2 alveolar cells 8 are completely consistent between pangolin cov and sars-cov-2 four amino acid mutations are present in ratg13 2 the spike protein of sars-cov-2 contains a 3-d structure in the receptor-binding domain region to maintain the van der waals forces 14 the 394 glutamine residue in the receptor-binding domain region of sars-cov-2 is recognized by the critical lysine 31 residue on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a key receptor for virus penetration it is also believed that the single n501t mutation in the sars-cov-2 spike protein corresponding to the s487t mutation in sars-cov may have significantly enhanced its binding affinity for human ace2 and subsequent penetration 3 for the human population this is the third significant coronavirus infection to occur in the twenty-first century following severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 20022003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2011 both sars-cov and mers-cov were newly identified coronaviruses of zoonotic origin in the genus betacoronavirus with a much lower incidence than sars-cov-2 8096 cases for sars since 2002 mortality rate  10 and 2494 cases for mers since 2012 mortality rate  35 oddly enough sars-cov-2 is not very similar to the genomes of sars-cov about 79 or mers-cov about 50 7 15 despite the initial reports stating that most of the laboratory-confirmed infected patients 27 of 41 cases had links to the wuhan seafood market where different animals including bats snakes birds pangolins and other small mammals are normally traded within the market 6 it is now obvious that the newly identified coronavirus sars-cov-2 is transmitted with enormous efficacy from human to human via respiratory droplets or close contact the highly contagious nature of sars-cov-2 is probably due in large part to the virus spreading via asymptomatic infected individuals 16 which is exacerbated by an un-usually long incubation period of up to 1114 days based on data from hospitalized patients the majority of covid-19 cases about 80 presented as asymptomatic or with mild symptoms while the remainder were severe or critical 6 17 most covid-19 patients developed lymphopenia and pneumonia with characteristic pulmonary ground-glass opacity changes seen on chest computed tomography 6 17 18 sars-cov-2 is believed to dampen anti-viral interferon responses resulting in uncontrolled viral replication for sars-cov and mers-cov the response to viral infection by type i ifn is suppressed the influx of neutrophils and monocytesmacrophages results in hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines 19 the study of 41 hospitalized patients revealed high-levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-2 il-7 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf in the most severe cases of covid-19 6 this so-called cytokine storm can initiate viral sepsis and inflammatory-induced lung injury which lead to other complications including pneumonitis acute respiratory distress syndrome ards respiratory failure shock organ failure and potentially death 19 individuals particularly susceptible to covid-19 are elderly people with underlying diseases including diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease 6 since sars-cov-2 mutates constantly and more frequently than other rna viruses coronaviruses possess the longest genomes of all known rna viruses so more errors are made when they are copied also viral rna-dependent rna polymerases do not have a proofreading nuclease activity it is likely that strains of the virus will appear whose host preference will change for instance by reducing the average age of patients with a severe course of the disease as global infection has progressed we are now more frequently seeing young patients dying from covid-19 tang et al found single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in sars-cov-2 at location 8782 orf1ab polyprotein t8517c synonymous and 28144 orf8 protein c251t s84l non-synonymous among the 103 sars-cov-2 virus strains in genbank 101 of them exhibited complete linkage between the two snps 72 strains  71 exhibited a ct haplotype defined as l type because t28144 is in the codon of leucine and 29 strains  29 exhibited a tc haplotype defined as s type because c28144 is in the codon of serine at these two sites although the l type  71 was more prevalent than the s type  29 in the sars-cov-2 viruses examined the s type is actually the ancestral version of sars-cov-2 nucleotides of the s type at sites 8782 and 28144 were identical to the orthologous sites in the most closely related viruses the ratio observed 7129 suggests that the l type has a higher transmission rate than the s type or was more prevalent at the start of the pandemic interestingly while the l type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan 963l37s the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 possibly because human intervention efforts may have caused severe selective pressure against the l type 20 what about reinfection earlier a pivotal role for virus-specific memory t-cells in broad and long-term protection against sars-cov infection was elucidated 21 22 indeed the crucial protective role of t-cell immune responses in coronavirus infections has been clearly documented in several animal models eg feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv mouse hepatitis virus mhv and avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv 2325 moreover reinfection did not occur in sars-cov-2 infected rhesus macaques with the same strain 26 what about reinfection with other possible strains of people who recovered from initial infection with one strain at present it remains unclear whether convalescing patients are at risk for relapse or reinfection it is also worth noting the theory that coronavirus infections might play a part in multiple sclerosis it is known that mouse hepatitis virus a murine coronavirus is a close relative of common human coronavirus hcov-oc43 which causes a multiple sclerosis-like demyelinating disease in the central nervous system of rodents 27 some studies have suggested that human coronaviruses in particular hcov-oc43 may be involved in gastrointestinal disease coronaviruses can be detected in stool samples and antibodies directed to hcov-oc43 have been observed more frequently in children with gastroenteritis 28 thus the future health of people who have recovered from covid-19 may be accompanied by complications it should be noted that in nature the number of host organisms is regulated by parasites including viruses outbreaks are eventually replaced by a population decline lotkavolterra system of equations as an example of a kolmogorov model it is necessary to consider the r-strategy of virus survival in which a large number of descendants as well as mutants are formed based on the lotkavolterra equations when the human population declines as the result of the action of a virus following a delay the overall population of the virus also decreases thus in the human population during the decline phase the majority of individuals have genotypes adapted for the virus strains prevailing at the moment under these circumstances the human population will start to grow until the virus genotypes capable of suppressing the human population significantly appear again the same line of reasoning can be applied to a medical drug-virus system except that a drug cannot change by itself therefore it is necessary to control viruses constantly with new drugs developed for use against both new strains of viruses and new species of viruses to save the lives of virus-sensitive people taking into consideration the natural genetic mechanisms of mutations and recombination it is impossible to imagine how to deprive a virus of the opportunity to generate new strains and time to time threaten our world with new pandemics it must be understood that the short-term relationship between the virus and the host is always the result of darwins microevolution individuals who do not die in the fight against the virus will form a generation that is more resistant to the virus over time the virus will continue to reproduce in these individuals but will not pose a great danger to them on the other hand humanity is capable of inventing drugs against viruses and slowing down the progress of darwins microevolution saving the lives of those who otherwise might die without treatment would covid-19 patients after successful treatment or recovery again become severely infected with other strains of this virus there are no guarantees at the moment but it is clear that the virus will continue to circulate and kill the people who are most susceptible to it thus based on the facts accumulated so far it is clear that while the new coronavirus is more aggressive it does not have mortality rates as high as those seen with sars-cov and mers-cov humanity will definitely survive drugs and vaccines will save the lives of some virus-sensitive people deaths among people of reproductive age will gradually lead to a human population in which the next generations will be more resistant to this virus fig 1 this is one of the primary reasons why pandemics of spanish flu h1n1 subtype did not last for many years because the overwhelming majority of people who died were aged 1845 individuals genetically resistant to the virus survived it and formed the next virus-resistant generation published studies indicate that 2040 of populations in some areas have been infected by the h1n1 virus and thus have some level of protective immunity 29 the origin of sars-cov-2 is not completely understood if this virus is man-made then it is necessary to go back 45 years and rethink the results of the asilomar conference on recombinant dna held in 1975 when scientists met to discuss the potential biohazards and regulation of biotechnology and banned some potentially dangerous experiments including cloning of recombinant dnas derived from highly pathogenic organisms if the virus is of natural origin then it is necessary to understand how new coronaviruses are transferred from animal reservoirs to humans and reduce the likelihood of a person coming into contact with them in addition it is imperative to develop new vaccines and drugs against coronavirus infection in case of emergency is it important today to stop the spread of infection as quickly as possible yes if possible it must be stopped however is it in our power to do so when the official number of diagnosed cases has already exceeded 1 million people worldwide probably not in some cases the human population has been able to completely obliterate a viral disease by enacting successful anti-epidemiological measures as happened with the smallpox virus 30 but smallpox virus had no animal reservoir apparently covid-19 is not one of these cases in our opinion the high contagiousness of sars-cov-2 and the ability of coronaviruses to persist for a long time in host organisms 31 32 will allow the covid-19 virus to continue to circulate in the human population until the fall of 2020 when a new pandemic wave seems to occur again the most likely outcome is that this new coronavirus as occurred with the four other well-known non-severe acute respiratory syndrome nonsars-related human coronaviruses hcovs including hcov-229e -oc43 -hku1 and -nl63 will take its place next to the seasonal flu viruses where the infection rate is high and the mortality rate is very low in the near future your doctor will routinely prescribe you something like covidol and say that in the coming days you are likely to recover interestingly after the discovery of non-sars hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 several groups reported infections by these viruses in different countries illustrating that these viruses have spread worldwide 3339 the viruses can be detected in 110 of patients with acute respiratory tract infections and double infections with other respiratory viruses are common 37 of note for sars-cov a close relative of sars-cov-2 there is evidence of at least seven potential regions of recombination in the sars-cov genome in the replicase- and spike-coding regions with possible recombination partners that include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev bovine coronavirus bcov hcov-229e mhv and ibv 40 a similar study involving the human coronavirus hcov-nl63 likewise demonstrated that hcov-nl63 exhibited signs of having arisen from multiple recombination events from its nearest relative over the course of hundreds of years 41 thus it is possible that sars-cov-2 through multiple recombination events can trigger an outbreak of respiratory diseases caused by new strains of nonsars-related human hcovs now as a century ago during the spanish flu pandemic the emphasis on washing hands frequently avoiding crowds and wearing masks are recurrent in newspaper records and on websites as is disdain for people flouting the rules in the meantime when we wash our hands with soap we should thank providence that the sars-cov-2 does not have the same mortality rate as mers-cov as the situation stands right now it is better to become infected with covid-19 as late as possible to allow vaccines and drugs to be developed and tested as there are no guarantees yet concerning who is at risk of a severe course of the disease and who is not apparently the bitter and unpopular truth is that most of the worlds inhabitants need to make contact with the sars-cov-2 before we can all return to normal life quarantine slows down this process gaining time for doctors and scientists who through their professional activities can save virus-sensitive individuals so often we have to choose quickly but painfully or gently but slowly today we find ourselves in a zugzwang situation a greater number of deaths or the collapse of the global economy we are on the second path so far but soon we will need to reach a compromise because sars-cov-2 will continue to circulate in the human population this coronavirus is with us forever perhaps we can learn from the seasonal flu viruses that kill hundreds of thousands of people every year since we are used to these viruses they do not scare us anymore so we have reached the compromise that lets us all move forward  from diversity to coordination a european approach to covid-19 alessio pacces m maria weimer  the covid-19 pandemic is changing the face of europe member states divergent responses to this crisis reveal a lack of unity in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe at best this undermines the effectiveness of health protection within the european union eu at worst it risks breaking up the union altogether divergent national responses to covid-19 reflect different national preferences and political legitimacy and thus cannot be completely avoided in this article we argue that these responses should be better coordinated without coordination the price for diversity is high firstly there are damaging spill-overs between member states which undermine key pillars of european integration such as the free movement of persons and of goods secondly national policy-making is easily captured by local interest groups our proposal is that the eu indicatesnot mandatesa european exit strategy from asymmetric containment policies of covid-19 in particular the eu should help member states procure and validate tests for infection and immunity the eu should also indicate ways in which testing could be used to create safe spaces to work thereby restoring the free movement of persons and of goods we see a great advantage in such eu guidance it could improve mutual learning between member states which have faced different timings of the epidemic and learned different lessons although the local political economy has so far delayed learning and undermined cooperation the eu can mitigate both effects and indicate the way for europe to resurrect united from the ashes of covid-19  the covid-19 pandemic is rapidly changing the face of europe in a european union eu founded on the idea of free movement borders are being erected in an interconnected world countries are trying to shield themselves from a threat that is global and does not respect border checks nor carry a passport the covid-19 pandemic is a transboundary challenge of proportions unseen since the creation of the eu arguably challenges like these are why we have the eu in the first place to enable effective collective action in the face of transboundary problems that no member states can address on their own the eu is a global regulatory power especially in the field of risk regulation and has an institutional structure in place to address public health emergencies however paradoxically in the current situation national governments are calling the shots their divergent responses to this crisis seem to reveal a lack of unity in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe at worst they risk breaking up the eu altogether what explains the diversity of national public health responses to covid-19 1 and what is the price europe is paying for it moreover what is the appropriate role of the eu in this crisis in this essay we will address these questions by combining two perspectives on the pandemic a risk regulation and an economic perspective our analysis reveals certain uncomfortable truths about the interplay between science and politics on the one hand and the need to balance european unity with pervasive diversity when it comes to national attitudes to risk on the other the main argument is this there are good reasons for why member states are in charge of public health responses to pandemics and other health threats the eu does not have legal nor a sufficiently strong democratic-political authority to take the lead on covid-19 especially given the current scientific uncertainty however decentralised and uncoordinated crisis management causes significant spill-overs that are damaging to eu public health the economy and to core european values the eu must turn diversity into a strength and do what it does best enable coordination and mutual learning and organise solidarity after initial mistakes and weak coordination in the first weeks of the crisis the eu must now take the lead in orchestrating a coordinated and safe european exit strategy with a focus on testing the eu offers the necessary tools to accomplish that member states must use them containing the spread of covid-19 is an exercise of emergency risk regulation on an unprecedented scale under normal circumstances eu risk regulation is a challenging task 2 the current crisis takes these challenges to a new level before taking measures policy-makers have to understand the nature and magnitude of a given risk for which they rely on scientific advice science is also required to identify a risk ie the likelihood of harm in the first place covid-19 for example is an invisible risk 3 because only special tests can identify who is infected and our lack of understanding of the real numbers of infections is an enormous challenge while science is crucial it is often uncertain and inconclusive there is substantial uncertainty with regards to the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 eg how the disease spreads whom it affects death rate etc 4 as a consequence policymakers must make decisions in the face of incomplete and rapidly changing scientific knowledge this exacerbates the political challenge of risk regulation as is painfully illustrated by covid-19 as containment policies entail enormous economic social and human costs policy-makers must weigh trade-offs and make political choices about how these costs ought to be distributed this produces conflicts and tests european solidarity as we will discuss further below the eu has experience with navigating such challenges eu law provides a number of principles that aim to address them public health responses to covid-19 have to follow the principle of risk analysis 5 this principle ensures a balance between science and politics by dividing decision-making into two stages first a risk assessmentcarried out by scientific expertsensures the scientific objectivity and quality of regulation 6 second risk managementa task assigned to policy-makersensures the political responsibility and democratic legitimacy of regulation while scientific advice is crucial it remains advisory in nature risk managers can deviate from it with good reasons and must take a range of non-scientific considerations into account to paraphrase a famous pronouncement of the eu general court in pfizer the risk managers public authority derives from their democratic legitimation ie control by and accountability towards representative democratic institutions scientific risk assessors although they have scientific legitimacy have neither democratic legitimacy nor political responsibility scientific legitimacy is not a sufficient basis for the exercise of public authority 7 this does not diminish the importance of scientific advice but recognises a core dilemma science while performing crucial cognitive tasks cannot provide answers to political and hence normative questions 8 risk managers carry the political responsibility of deciding whether action is warranted and what kind of action this entails difficult political economic and ethical choices which vary from one society to another which risks societies are willing to accept and what the levels of protection should be are decisions for democratically accountable institutions 9 risk managers are however not fully free to determine how much health protection is desirable both the eu and member states when managing covid-19 risks must ensure a high level of public health protection 10 they must also respect the precautionary principle which is triggered by the scientific uncertainty around covid-19 the principle requires early and anticipatory action while a zero-risk approach is not allowed the precautionary principle requires policy-makers to protect public health without having to wait until the reality and seriousness of risks become fully apparent or until the adverse effects materialise 11 it also requires them to prioritise public health over economic interests 12 with pandemics the need for early action even before cases start to go up is extremely important 13 even if they seem like an overreaction at first while precautionary measures must be proportionate it is questionable how much room for proper proportionality there is in emergency situations 14 to paraphrase a world health organization who expert waiting for perfection when containing a pandemic means being too late 15 eu law of public health emergencies assigns the tasks of risk assessment and risk management to different levels of government while the eu ensures a more or less harmonised risk assessment of covid-19 national governments are primarily responsible for managing the pandemic including for the application of the precautionary principle this has to do with eu competences it is well knownyet worth stressingthat the eu is a union of conferred powers according to the eu treaties health policy is a national competence 16 member states as the signatories of the treaties have granted the eu only limited powers for public health emergencies under the current eu regulatory framework 17 the role of the eu is to support national crisis management it mainly acts as a hub for rapid information exchange and coordination of national crisis responses there are in principle good reasons for this division of tasks between the eu and the member states the organisation of national health systems is complex and varies across member states different approaches are rooted in national culture and history in federal member states such as germany competences for public health are a matter of subfederal entities eg the lnder national governments are best placed to assess the availability of resources and critical infrastructures training of staff and equipment as well as the expected behaviour of citizens in a crisis after all trust in doctors and governments is shaped by cultural attitudes and is a factor in determining the effectiveness of emergency measures such as social distancing and lockdowns it is therefore not surprising that member states adopt different responses to covid-19 18 11 bse case c-15796 httpseur-lexeuropaeulegal-contenthrtxturicelex61996cj0157 and

the political responsibility for their crisis management vis--vis their citizens eu institutions especially the european commission do not possess the same level of political authority 19 nor are they subjected to the same kind of democratic accountability as national governments the lack of proper eu risk management powers in health emergencies could be seen as a weakness in contrast we hold that under certain conditions this could become a source of strength if used effectively by the member states eu mechanisms of coordination and support can foster very powerful mutual learning and solidarity while respecting legitimate diversity 20 how well this potential is realised depends on the political will of national governments divergent national responses to covid-19 cannot be avoided yet they can and must be better coordinated without effective coordination there is a high price to pay for diversity an issue to which we turn next according to the economics of federalism which level of government should decide on covid-19 depends on the tension between different criteria 21 for instance diverging local preferences support decentralised solutions but may result in cross-border spillovers different responses to the epidemic may allow countries to learn from each other but also result in conflicts of interest that undermine cooperation in this section we discuss the drawbacks of decentralised policy-making on covid-19 because different communities attach different values to health protection and face different costs from containment measures decentralised risk management meets the preferences of a society more efficiently even under uncertainty 22 the understanding of the precautionary principle varies considerably across countries for example at the time of writing 23 the netherlands and sweden have laxer containment policies than the rest of the eu admittedly reflecting a lower risk and uncertainty aversion than other countries this variation was higher in the beginning of the outbreak the disadvantage of decentralised containment policies is cross-border spill-overs for instance if a dutch resident can freely travel to belgium having stricter containment measures belgian residents bear the effects of dutch risk management 24 the response to this problem has been to reintroduce border controls within the eu with the exception of countries having comparable containment policies this admittedly temporary measure may not seem harmful when most people in the world are encouraged to stay at home however border checks and restrictions are here to stay for some time because when measures are lifted in some countries they will still be in 19 weimer supra note 2 20 on the diversity challenge in eu risk regulation see ibid 21 place in some others and this dissonance might be repeated in several rounds as part of a gradual exit strategy until a vaccine is found the significant restriction of the free movement of persons is likely to undermine everyones sense of belonging to the eu moreover closing borders reduces interstate labour mobility which is part of the bigger problem of covid-19 as a global supply shock a second cross-border spill-over of different risk management choices stems from the disruption of supply chains 25 covid-19 is not only a medical but also an economic emergency compared to a normal recession output will fall also because some production must be halted or reduced to prevent excessive contagion inputs such as equipment and labour incompatible with social distancing get scarcer and reduce the supply of certain goods 26 this already affects countries differently depending on their specialisation and openness to trade but the difference will be exacerbated by the different timing of containment and exit policies countries in lockdown must cope with shortages of goods and impose them on others not only because of underproduction but also due to hoarding export bans and other restrictions reduced mobility of scarce inputs is not only inefficient from a global perspective but also incompatible with the eu internal market it undermines the free movement of goods such freedom has already been restricted with respect to medical equipment prompting a response by eu institutions 27 we expect an increase of these protectionist reactions as more goods become scarce with the spreading of the disease this reflects a more general problem asymmetric covid-19 policies create conflicting interests that in turn undermine cooperation between states diversity in approach and timing of policies against covid-19 could lead countries to compete with each other and learn the optimal reaction also considering local preferences faster than if they were to coordinate given the uncertainty around covid-19 the benefit of a spontaneous convergence towards optimal solutions would outweigh the drawbacks of cross-border spill-overs and conflicts of interest because these would also quickly disappear 28 we doubt however that effective solutions would emerge from regulatory competition soon enough firstly scientific information is produced too slowly compared to the speed of the outbreak secondly policy-makers react to the saliency of the outbreak rather than to scientific information as a result the optimal amount 25 of convergence occurs with a delay if at all leaving countries to deal with unnecessary conflicts of interest and spill-overs between them because covid-19 spreads so rapidly scientists lag behind with the generation of relevant information about the virus data on contagion hospitalisation and deaths come in imprecisely and with delay nevertheless a team of epidemiologists at imperial college london icl has recently modelled contagion and the impact of policies thereupon in the absence of widespread testing or a vaccine there are two policy options for containment mitigation which seeks to slow down contagion by moderate social distancing to build herd immunity and suppression which seeks to avoid contagion as much as possible including lockdowns until a vaccine is found one icl study found that in the usa and the uk mitigation policies would still lead to a sheer number of secondary deaths as the healthcare system becomes congested people who would otherwise survive die lacking access to intensive care units icus 29 the lesson for countries having a similar icu surge capacity is that suppression policies are the only way to avoid congestion in the initial phase of contagion another finding from icl is that the suppression policies implemented in italy averted up to 80000 deaths in a month 30 there is a method in economics to calculate how much a life is worth for a specific society the value of statistical life vsl 31 however coarse and controversial it may be particularly because it consistently underestimates the value of human life for lower-income people 32 the vsl gives an idea about the economic benefit of averted deaths in italy where the vsl is approximately us5 million and the gdp about us2 trillion one month of lockdown was worth up to 20 of gdp confronted with covid-19 politicians worldwide have initially argued that there is a trade-off between protecting health and protecting the economy 33 this sounds odd in light of the above back-of-the-envelope calculations even assuming that the epidemic does not change the behaviour of individuals the life-saving benefit of containment policies largely exceeds foregone output at least in situations comparable to italy moreover the abovementioned trade-off reflects a misconception it wrongly assumes that people adopt social distancing only if the government tells them to do so 34 this reasoning neglects that facing widespread contagion along with the likely congestion of the healthcare system many individuals would implement social distancing anyway and fail to produce output because they get sick die or are afraid of either compared to government intervention 29 n ferguson d laydon and g nedjati-gilani report 9 -impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions npis to reduce covid-19 mortality and healthcare demand imperial college london preprint 16 march 2020 individual reaction and panic would have a much worse impact on the economynot to mention issues of inequality and social unrest even in the absence of precise estimates of contagion and mortality rates there is no economic reason to delay containment moreover delays are also contrary to the precautionary principle 35 however policy-makers invariably delayed action until congestion of the healthcare system became a foreseeable problem in their own country policy-makers have not learned from the experience of other countries political economy explains these delays 36 politicians tend to react to an emergency rather than anticipating it this is particularly the case with non-linear phenomena such as epidemics contagion starts very slowly but becomes politically salient only when it escalates people would consider unwarranted any restriction introduced before the spill-overs from contagion become visible in that phase interest groups bemoaning the economic cost of containment prevail in the political discourse 37 this undermines policy-makers learning from scientists and from the experience of other countries denial is only reversed when the gravity of the situation becomes salient the prospect of letting citizens die because of icu congestion is not politically palatable but then the disease spreads exponentially and there is no time to ponder the policy options as convergence has not happened quickly enough coordination would seem preferable to regulatory competition unfortunately delays have undermined the incentive of countries to cooperate countries may be pursuing mitigation or suppression of contagion these strategies are incompatible and for the time being unstable mitigation without massive testing may have to turn into suppression when icu capacity nears saturation as happened in the uk suppression is not sustainable both psychologically and economically for as long as it seems likely to take until a vaccine is found 38 countries that have suppression in place such as italy will have to suspend it and reinstate it depending on icu inflows therefore countries facing covid-19 have different interests at different times exacerbating spill-overs and potential conflicts yet because containment policies are unstable every country needs an exit strategy coordinating on the exit strategy would remedy spill-overs and conflicts while improving the effectiveness of the response to covid-19 in the next section we argue that the eu could play a decisive role in such coordination the eu offers important tools and institutional structures for coordination mutual learning and solidarity given these tools at no other time in history could the 35 see section ii above 36 see eg l

pandemic such as covid-19 yet they were not the success of the european fight against covid-19and probably the survival of the european project as suchdepends on member states making the most out of europe under the current circumstances let us first look at the tools that the eu makes available drawing lessons from previous outbreaks such as sars and bird flu h1n1 the eu has established a legal framework for public health emergencies the cross-border health threats decision 39 this aims to contribute to a high level of public health protection in the eu by ensuring the coordination of both risk assessment and risk management in public health emergencies an eu agency the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc ensures the coordination of scientific advice between the eu and national risk assessors it monitors the disease outbreak produces continuous risk assessments for the eu population as a whole and provides guidance for risk management it is also an important source of comparable epidemiological data for the member statesan aspect crucial for mutual learning about what may or may not work in the fight against the virus 40 moreover the commission has created a new expert group the eu advisory panel on covid-19 41 the panel directly advises commission president ursula von der leyen on measures to be taken at the eu level it also helps in coordination with the ecdc the commission develop guidance for member states to ensure consistent sciencebased and coordinated national risk management since the panel took up work on 17 march 2020 the commission has published the first eu-wide recommendations for community measures testing strategies and health systems resilience 42 in terms of risk management member states are obliged to coordinate their covid-19 measures in the so-called eu health security committee composed of national health ministers and chaired by the commission 43 the health security committee is a crucial forum for mutual consultation and regular information exchange among member states ideally scientific advice from the ecdc and the covid-19 panel and national risk management should be linked here with national health ministries explaining how they have considered eu advice as well as the reasons for their choices of containment policies this should also allow for some degree of external accountability for spill-overs 44 member states being made aware and considering the effects of national policies on other member states moreover member states should use the health security committee as a site to report both successes and failures of national approaches to covid-19 and be willing to adjust their policies accordingly this is where diversity can turn into a strength sharing national experiences in the 39 see above n 17 40 see g pisano r sadun and m zanini lessons above n 13 41 httpseceuropaeutransparencyregexpertindexcfmdogroupdetailgroupdetaildocid39740no1 42

security committee may improve mutual learning 45 which is key in the fight against covid-19 the committee is also crucial for informing the commission about national healthcare capacities and needs thereby triggering mechanisms of eu-wide public health solidarity the eu health threats decision foresees such mechanisms via the possibility of voluntary public procurement of medicinal countermeasures and medical equipment preventing harmful competition for vaccines and medical equipment between eu member states is crucial and addresses the spill-overs resulting from the disruption of the free movement of goods and of supply chains 46 a joint eu procurement of these goods gives member states a strong bargaining position towards manufacturers it also allows for the distribution of such goods to places where they are most needed across europe currently the eu has launched four joint procurements of personal protective equipment eg masks ventilators and testing kits 47 because eu law only foresees voluntary public procurement only 25 member states are participating in these initiatives the voluntary participation is a problem as it undermines the eus capacity to act quickly and in the common european interest calls for more eu powers to purchase store and allocate medicines and equipment to fight infectious diseases are therefore justified 48 they are not in conflict with national responsibilities for risk management but rather are in support of them there are other ways in which the eu can address the spill-overs of decentralised risk management of covid-19 while at the same time strengthening the idea of europe as a schicksalsgemeinschaft 49 defining common criteria for legitimate border restrictions is key as the commission has done 50 the eu-wide scheme for export authorisation for medical equipment has helped with lifting national export bans initially imposed by some member states the creation of so-called green lanes 51 to ensure the free flow of critical goods and personnel contributes to public health protection and helps overcome supply problems in the eu this shows that the eu can be very creative with how it uses its powers and can also protect public health by using competences in other fields of policy above all the internal market 45 see g pisano r sadun and m zanini lessons above n 13 46 see section iii above 47 it has also used an eu civil protection mechanism resceu to set up a stockpile of medical equipment see https eceuropaeucommissionpresscornerdetailenip20476 48 things are moving quickly and it is difficult to assess how well coordination in the health security committee actually works at present 52 judging by the initial cacophony of us first responses until approximately mid-march 53 there was little coordination things do seem to have improved however national containment measures and approaches still differ but they are converging with most member states having adopted a combination of social distancing school closures public events bans and more or less stringent lockdowns 54 this is partially due to timing the more the virus spreads across the eu the more member states move to stringent measures figure 1  yet this also signals improved cooperation at the eu level the covid-19 advisory panel seems to have given scientific guidance more weight across the eu the commission recommendations drafted with its input are discussed in the health security committee and member states are asked to provide feedback and to report on how they have implemented the guidance the commission also asks member states to identify priorities for the future work of the panel thus steering its scientific work towards more responsiveness to local needs which is likely to improve the uptake of its advice in the future the committee also coordinates the redistribution of patients and health professionals across the eu in order to address more acute needs in some regionscountries 56 there are positive signs that although delayed the work of the health security committee is going in the right direction going forwards all efforts should be aimed at designing and implementing a european exit strategy on how to lift social distancing measures in a safe way testing the wider population to determine contagion and immunity is key to any such exit strategy 57 on the one hand creating a safe space to work in which people are either immune or not infected and distanced from anyone who could be is crucial to restarting the economies after the contagion is under control without risking a second peak of the outbreak on the other hand having an eu approach to labour mobility and physical production could overcome the current and foreseeable restrictions to the free movement of persons and goods for instance workers from different member states could participate in eu green zones that are free of contagion and so produce scarce goods 58 solutions of this kind would complement national approaches to the exit strategy but also promote more solidarity between member states although we have not addressed this economic solidarity between eu member states is in fact a precondition to restarting the european economies by way of exit from the containment measures 59 after initial mistakes and weak cooperation with regards to putting containment measures in place it is now high time and not less crucial to agree on a coordinated european approach to the exit strategy the commission and the health security committee will have to play an important role in this regard 60 the eu must help the member states obtain the equipment for extensive testing ie assessing eu-wide needs and availability of testing organising joint procurement of testing kits negotiating with industry and funding acquisition moreover test validation and the criteria for relaxing the containment measures must be coordinated between member states in order for the exit strategies to avoidand even remedythe negative spill-overs of the past as this paper went to press the commission published a roadmap for a coordinated eu exit strategy 61 member states initially resisted the publication of this document 62 some such as austria and denmark announced unilateral plans to relax covid-19 lockdowns that differed from the plans of other eu countries 63 the insistence of the commission addresses our key concern the longer the eu waits the less room will there be for coordination this could result in long-lasting damage to free movement and eu solidarity public health protection is equally at risk if national lockdowns are relaxed too quickly and are based on political opportunism or economic lobbying rather than commonly agreed science-based criteria differently from the former the latter take the still pervasive scientific uncertainty surrounding the virus into account 64 the initiative of the commission addresses these concerns it is a commendable first step towards delineating a common european framework on how to gradually lift confinement measures based on common principles of scientific advice coordination and solidarity at the same time however the roadmap still leaves ample margins for member states to continue restrictions of free movement in the presence of asymmetric situations and policies 65 more eu leadership seems to be in order particularly in the design and mutual recognition of testing and tracing policies 66 ultimately the ball is now in the member states court they must act in the common european interest and follow the commissions lead the fight against covid-19 is a marathon not a sprint europes survival will depend on how it handles the exit from this crisis in this article we noted the challenge stemming from different health policies in the eu while this difference reflects national preferences and political legitimacy it has produced negative spill-overs between member states we propose to turn this challenge into an opportunity our proposal is that eu institutions indicatenot mandatea european exit strategy from asymmetric albeit gradually converging containment policies of covid-19 in particular the eu should help member states procure and validate tests for infection and immunity the eu should also indicate ways in which testing could be used to create safe spaces to work thereby restoring the free movement of persons and of goods we see a great advantage in such eu guidance it could improve mutual learning between member states that have faced different timings of the epidemic and learned different lessons although as we showed the local political economy has so far delayed learning and undermined cooperation the eu can mitigate both effects and indicate the way for europe to resurrect united from the ashes of covid-19  evaluation of stratify and shield as a policy option for ending the covid-19 lockdown in the uk paul mckeigue m helen colhoun m  although population-wide lockdowns have been successful in slowing the covid-19 2 epidemic there is a consensus among disease modellers that keeping the load on critical 3 care services within manageable limits will require an adaptive social distancing 4 strategy alternating cycles of relaxation and reimposition until a vaccine is available an alternative strategy that has been tentatively proposed is to shield the elderly and 6 others at high risk of severe disease while allowing immunity to build up in those at low 7 risk until the entire population is protected we examine the performance required from 8 a classifier that uses information from medical records to assign risk status for a such a 9 stratify-and-shield policy to be effective in limiting mortality when social distancing is 10 relaxed we show that under plausible assumptions about the level of immunity required for 12 population-level immunity the proportion shielded is constrained to be no more than 13 15 of the population under varying assumptions about the infection fatality ratio 14 from 01 to 04 and the performance of the classifier 3 to 45 bits of information 15 for discrimination we calculate the expected number of deaths in the unshielded group 16 we show that with likely values of the performance of a classifier that uses information 17 from age sex and medical records at least 80 of those who would die if unshielded 18 would be allocated to the high-risk shielded group comprising 15 of the population although the proportion of deaths that would be prevented by effective shielding does 20 not vary much with the infection fatality ratio the absolute number of deaths in the 21 unshielded varies from less than 10000 if the infection fatality rate is 01 to more than 22 50000 if the infection fatality rate is as high as 04 for projecting the effect of an optimally applied stratify-and-shield policy studies 24 now under way should help to resolve key uncertainties the extent to which infection 25 confers immunity the prevalence of immunity the infection fatality ratio and the 26 performance of a classifier constructed using information from medical records it is 27 time to give serious consideration to a stratify-and-shield policy that could bring the 28 covid-19 epidemic to an end in a matter of months while restoring economic activity 29 avoiding overload of critical care services and limiting mortality  the sars-cov-2 epidemic will be over only when the level of immunity in the 32 population reaches a level where the effective reproduction number falls below 1

measures termed lockdown were imposed in the uk so as to prevent the 36 epidemic from overwhelming the national health service and to reduce immediate 37 impact on deaths modelling studies for the scientific pandemic influenza group on 38 modelling spi-m have suggested that an adaptive strategy alternating between 39 periods of more and less strict social distancing measures may be needed to keep the 40 number of critical care cases within capacity until the epidemic ends 1  concern about 41 the economic and social costs of this intermittent lockdown strategy has motivated 42 exploration of other approaches for managing the epidemic from this point forward 43 one suggested strategy for exit from the lockdown has been to undertake weekly 44 testing of the entire population for sars-cov-2 rna followed by isolation of those 45 who test positive and their contacts until the epidemic is suppressed 2  another option 46 that has been tentatively proposed is to shield those at high risk while allowing 47 immunity to build up in those at low risk 3  a a briefing dated 26 february from the 48 scientific advisory group on emergencies sage alluded to this stratify-and-shield 49 approach 4  50 an additional strategy would be to apply more intense measures on those age 51 or risk groups at most risk of experiencing severe disease eg household 52 isolation of those over 65 special measures around care homes the has not looked at the likely feasibility or effectiveness of such methods 56 in subsequent modelling studies for spi-m interventions including less stringent 57 social distancing of those over 70 years of age were assessed based on assuming modest 58 reductions in contacts with people outside the household but no reduction in household 59 contacts 5  the models predicted that although this partial shielding would be one of 60 the most effective measures in reducing total deaths and severe outcomes under the 61 assumption of an infection fatality ratio of 09 it would not be enough to prevent 62 critical care facilities from being overwhelmed 63 a key objective of the emerging discipline of precision medicine is to use risk 64 stratification to assist clinical decision making this has driven forward methodological 65 developments for instance in privacy-preserving analysis of information from medical 66 records and quantifying increments in predictive performance in ways that are relevant 67 to decisions as researchers in this field we have examined how risk stratification based 68 on using information from medical records to quantify risk of severe or fatal covid-19 69 might lay the basis for a stratify-and-shield policy we do not advocate a particular 70 course of action but instead investigate the theoretical dependencies of the 71 stratify-and-shield approach its possible impact on mortality and workload for the 72 health service and discuss how to resolve some of the key uncertainties upon which the 73 effectiveness of such an approach depends ratio the classifier is applied to the susceptible population considered as a mixture of 84 cases individuals who are destined to die if unshielded during the epidemic and 85

075 and we assume also that the final 149 proportion i u of unshielded individuals who are immune will be driven to 09 by 150 overshoot of new infections after the threshold for population-level immunity has been 151 reached it follows that for i t to be at least 075 p must be no more than 017 we 152 have therefore set 15 as an upper limit for the proportion of the original population to 153

up 172 to 18 april and population data for england and wales the odds ratio for death 173 associated with a ten-year increase in age was 3 and the odds ratio associated with male 174 sex was 21 the log-likelihood ratio favouring correct over incorrect assignment was 175 computed by subtracting the log prior odds from the log posterior adds taking the 176 average of this ratio as the average of

critical care the average duration of stay of such 221 cases is about one week in the icnarc data additional cases would be expected in the adaptive social distancing policy is intended to limit the

the nhs 265 we have shown that a stratify-and-shield policy would be constrained to shielding no 266 more than 15 of the population but that even if a classifier using medical history 267 provided only a modest increment in predictive performance over one using only age the level of risk that might be considered acceptable at a collective level in exchange 277 for resuming economic and social activities is a policy decision we note that the annual 278 risk of accidental death in england and wales for men and women aged 30-64 years is 279 about 1 in 5000 and we do not stop the economy to prevent such deaths and neither do 280 individuals stay home to avoid such a risk we note also that the projected mortality 281 risks in the unshielded are averages over the group a risk classifier could of course 282 output not simply a dichotomous classification but a continuous risk score that would 283 be the basis for individual choice any shielding strategy involves issues of ethics and 284 equity in that those in the unshielded group are asked to accept a low risk so that not 285 just they but those shielded from infection can emerge from isolation sooner it is to be expected that an epidemic in a susceptible population will overshoot the 287 threshold for population-level immunity as even when the reproduction number falls 288 below 1 transmissions will continue for a few more generations till the epidemic is 289 extinguished this overshoot is usually considered undesirable 3  but for a 290 stratify-and-shield policy it is desirable to drive the level of immunity as high as 291 possible in the unshielded so that when shielded individuals resume mixing the level of 292 immunity in the total populatio is not diluted below the threshold for herd immunity this in turn implies that the epidemic in unshielded individuals should be allowed to 294 run as fast as is compatible with not overloading critical care services so as to maximize 295 the overshoot keeping the duration of the shielding period short will also help to 296 minimize the costs of shielding both to providers and to those shielded the effect on 297 the epidemic of lifting social distancing restrictions after a lockdown is hard to predict 298 and it is possible that the epidemic could peak rapidly such that half the severe cases 299 expected in unshielded individuals arrive within one month in this scenario 20000 is 300 an upper limit on the total number of deaths during the shielding period that would not 301 overload critical care services for projections of the impact of a stratify-and-shield policy the key uncertainties are 303 whether a single infection confers immunity the infection fatality ratio the predictive 304 performance of the classifier and the effectiveness of shielding over the few months 305 required to allow the epidemic to run to completion in the low-risk group we briefly 306 consider what is the extent of these uncertainties and how they might be

immunity to coronaviruses has been reviewed 309 elsewhere 14  a study of seasonal coronavirus infections based on the flu watch 310 cohort found no cases of reinfection with the same strain of coronavirus in a cohort of 311 216 adults with a first confirmed hcov infection 0 of 8 individuals with two confirmed 312 infections 15  in a study of 18 patients with sars igg antibodies to sars were 313 reported to persist for at least 2 years 16  reinfection with sars-cov-2 could not be 314 induced experimentally with macaquess 17  antibody-dependent enhancement of acute 315 lung injury has been documented in experimental studies of sars vaccines 18 19 but 316 not with antibodies induced by infection with the sars virus as tens of thousands of 317 people have now tested positive for sars-cov-2 the most direct way to establish 318 whether repeat infection occurs is to link records of positive tests to identify recurrences 319 after recovery from the first infection estimating the infection fatality ratio 321 the only direct estimate of the infection fatality ratio based on a population where all 322 individuals were tested and followed for mortality is from the diamond princess cruise 323 ship 20  where there were 7 deaths among 634 passengers who tested positive april that public health england was testing samples of the population and is in the 330 process of analysing the first 800 samples collected 21  but the results had not been 331 published as of 25 april preliminary results of other seroprevalence surveys in europe 332 and the us have been reported though the reliability of some of these studies has been 333 questioned 22 their findings are mostly consistent in showing seroprevalence levels 334 around 3-4 in the first week of april 2020 as the time from sars-cov-2 exposure to 335 seroconversion is estimated to be from 15 to 20 days 23  the proportion infected by 336 late april is likely to be considerably higher than the seroprevalence in early april practical feasibility of a stratify-and-shield policy 338 a detailed examination of the practical feasibility of a stratify-and-shield policy is 339 beyond the scope of this paper compliance assumed to be voluntary with shielding in 340 the high-risk group must be high enough that severe cases among those who forgo 341 shielding do not overload the health service but unlike the adaptive social distancing 342 policy the stratify-and-shield policy would not require coercion it does however require 343 that support for shielding is adequate to protect high-risk individuals from infection 344 while the epidemic in the unshielded group continues if this support were implemented 345 in a half-hearted manner the outcome for those who rely on social care would be poor 346 intense shielding is already recommended in uk guidance for more than 1 million 347 people who are clinically extremely vulnerable because they have received organ these individuals are advised to adopt rigorous shielding measures including staying at 351 home at all times isolating themselves from others in the same household and not going 352 out even for food or medicine assistance with delivery of food and medicines is offered 353 to people in this group the logistic challenges of providing this level of shielding to 15 of the population 355 are formidable but not necessarily insurmountable if the duration of shielding is only a 356 few months for instance high-risk adults in crowded households might have to be 357 offered alternative accommodation until low-risk household members are immune and 358 paid caregivers who are not already immune would need to be trained and equipped to 359 use reverse barrier precautions serological testing could be used to identify individuals 360 who are no longer susceptible as focal points for sustaining safer interactions with 361 those who are shielded 25  shielding of individuals who are in employment would 362 require guarantees that their employment status would not be jeopardized by isolating 363 themselves for a few months a stratify-and-shield policy using a classifier based on medical records has the potential 366 to save lives

remaining to arm the youths who were helping us ward off thieves even before the boko haram invasion no one has ever supported us with anything interviewed on 19 october 2019 in borno state most local level conflict and recently covid-19 stabilization campaigns depend on the nigerian military ensuring access to main roads as a result humanitarian efforts have been confined to those local government areas that are physically accessible such as maiduguri mafa and biu about 800000 poor people are still stuck in areas in northern borno that are beyond the reach of humanitarian assistance a senior united nations development programme undp official charged with implementing an integrated community stabilization program in northeast nigeria noted that everything hinges on security as all of our work requires access our first question is is the community accessible brechenmacher 2019 14  the situation is not helped by reports of the governments withdrawal of troops from far-flung outposts in

armed insurgents in some cases soldiers burnt their villages and chased them away olaleye 2019  the crisis of displacement deeply intertwines with immobility and inaccessibility on the one hand mobility is the ability to move or to be moved and mobility and immobility unfold in a pas de deux mobility is also a primary source of power and inequality as beverly skeggs 2004 49 argues mobility and control over mobility both reflect and reinforce power mobility is a resource to which not everyone has an equal relationship accessibility on the other hand reflects the potential of

nigerias un humanitarian coordinator edward kallon called attention to the worsening insecurity on major highways and supply routes across borno state i am extremely worried by the increasingly insecure environment that humanitarians are working in to provide urgent and vital assistance to civilians affected by the crisis the humanitarian community is troubled by the increasing trend in vehicular checkpoints set up by non-state armed groups along main supply routes in the states of borno and yobe these checkpoints expose civilians and humanitarians to heightened risks of being killed or abducted i urge all parties to the conflict to protect the civilian population including aid workers from such grave violations of international laws especially women and children who are among the most vulnerable and are caught up in the violence haruna 2020  the nigerian military has warned motorists in northeastern nigeria against stopping at unofficial highway checkpoints however the major problem facing drivers in the region is determining whether a highway roadblock has been mounted by the official nigerian military semi-official pro-government militias ie vigilantes and hunters or the unofficial boko haram insurgents since the rise of boko haram checkpoints have increasingly become part of a duplicitous world in nigeria in which the real and the imaginary are interchangeable in short a radically uncertain world in which there is hardly a reality without its double mbembe  roitman 1995 340  this phantasmagoric giddens 1990 18-19 nature of checkpoints reproduces the nigerian

afraid less mobile or less free to move ahmed 2004 128  for transit workers in northeastern nigeria such as commercial tricycle-taxi keke napep drivers and truckers the main threat to their pursuit of survival and access to opportunities is neither boko haram nor the imminent covid-19 crisis but endless security checkpoints mounted by soldiers who eat their sweat this adds weight to recent comparative surveys which show that among some populations corruption is considered to be a more serious problem than unemployment poverty and terrorism rothstein 2018 36 holmes 2015  locally imagined

death thus checkpoints reflect the omnivorous potentialities masquelier 2001  268 of the nigerian state especially its seemingly infinite capacity to prey upon its citizens during recent fieldwork in

said another keke napep driver in maiduguri in the past a driver can negotiate his way out of certain bribes but now the soldiers simply blackmail you saying you better dash bribe us something or else we finish kill you and report to our bosses that we killed a boko haram you noticed the car ahead of you has given us something but you want to prove tough security men now appropriate the name of boko haram to intimidate us into paying bribes interviewed on 23 october 2019 in northeast nigeria hardly a month passes without media reporting on commercial drivers who have been severely beaten or worse still shot to death by nigerian soldiers for refusing to pay cash bribes generally coded as water money with new covid-19 government restrictions on the number of passengers in public transport

to maiduguri complained that they pay between n30 77 usd and n40000 103 usd in water money at checkpoints these frustrated drivers lamented that soldiers at these checkpoints do not hesitate to extract heavy bribes from them despite the fact that charcoal and firewood are essential fuel for the common man to cook food more so in the time of covid-19 the urbanist abdoumaliq simone 2010 38 tells us that the pursuit of survival involves actions relations sentiments and opportunities that are more than survival alone as the covid-19 crisis in nigeria gathers momentum and the pursuit of life becomes increasingly difficult for marginal people it is important to explore how the novel pandemic is overlaid by preexisting conditions of displacement food scarcity local immobility and predatory checkpoints conditions that combine to reduce people to bare life in the battle of lives against livelihoods there can only be a pyrrhic victory yet nigeria enters into the eye of the covid-19 storm with lessons gained from previous experiences of effectively managing the 2014 ebola virus disease and other animal-born acute viruses like lassa fever this should give nigerians some confidence in the uncertain times ahead  covid-19 time for paradigm shift in the nexus between local national and global health elisabeth paul garrett brown w valery ridde   the who declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 an emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 and a pandemic on 11 march according to whos situation report - 79 as of 8 april 2020 the epidemic has caused 79 235 deaths worldwide1 while it is seemingly nearing its end in china where it was first reported it is still on the rise in europe in the usa and in other parts of the world including in many low-income and middle-income countries lmics the pandemic has triggered unprecedented measures worldwide many countries have installed travel bans confinement and lockdown policies these responses have been adopted in an emergency mode and are largely reactionary aimed at mitigating the spread of the disease while waiting for a specific cure andor vaccine to be developed here we do not want to underestimate the risks caused by the pandemic nor to question the measures taken by the who and governments but we would like to express our concerns regarding four covid-19-related issues and advocate for a paradigm shiftthat is a scientific revolution encompassing changes in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline2to prepare for future crises it is important to remember other acknowledged and preventable health conditions when compared with the focus that covid-19 has triggered at global and national levels respiratory diseases have been leading causes of death and disability in the world before covid-19 it is estimated that globally four million people die prematurely from chronic respiratory disease each year in particular one million die annually from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pneumonia kills millions of people annually and is a leading cause of death among children under 5 years old each year 14 million die from tuberculosis and lung cancer kills 16 million people a year and is the deadliest cancer3 the who estimates that seasonal influenza kills up to 650 000 people a year4 in 2018 an estimated 405 000 people died of malaria5 in 2017 about 295 000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirththat is approximately 810 women each day6 in the usa alone a lower limit of 210 000 deaths per year was associated with preventable harm in hospitals7 whereas infectious diseases seem to inspire the most terror among the public and policymakers non-communicable diseases are responsible for almost 70 of all deaths8 depression affects 300 million people globally and is the leading cause of disability worldwide and nearly 800 000 people die from suicide every year9 the global boom in premature mortality and morbidity from non-communicable diseases has now reached a point where some have even suggested it to be a pandemic10 moreover climate change through increased heat waves and disasters and atmospheric and environmental pollution are expected to increase deaths and injuries especially in lmics11 in some debates climate change has become more than a risk factor with increasing calls for the who to declare it a public health emergency12 from a public health perspective covid-19 needs to be appraised as part of a much bigger health picture for instance beyond the lethality and direct mortality rates of covid-19 attention should be paid to the interaction with other pathogens as well as to the more indirect effects of its mitigation measures13 indeed the pandemic and its containment measures interact with and impact on other health conditions and will have system-wide effects highlighting the importance of adopting a systems approach to its resolution14 the global health community national security agencies and all governments have known that a pandemic like covid-19 was likely to come yet global health policy has remained woefully unprepared nor fit-for-purpose in 2015 the g7 members proclaimed that ebola had been a wake-up call for the need for better global cooperation it was also recognised that antimicrobial resistance amr threatened to kill 300 million people by 2050 thus demanding urgent action yet little has been done to address these existing global health governance shortcomings15 for example the lauded g7 and g20 response the global health security agenda httpsghsagendaorg continues to speak in the terms of costly counter-measures versus prevention and health system strengthening moreover the pandemic emergency financing facility pef httpswwwworldbankorgentopicpandemicsbriefpandemic-emergency-financing-facility meant to deliver up to 500 million in epidemic assistance to curb expansion into a pandemic sits idle as a complicated loan mechanism at the world bank available to only a few countries eg china and india do not qualify for the money there is also serious ambiguity about how the pef intersects andor complements the whos contingency fund for emergencies cfe httpswwwwhointemergenciesfundingcontingency-fund-for-emergencies the cfe is available to more countries for more risks and more quickly but represents far less money than the pef which in theory should come after the cfe if you happen to prequalify for the loan16 the one health approach which was meant to offer a more responsive research and policy agenda to combat zoonotic diseases remains sluggish at best and underdeveloped in terms of including environmental factors such as soil and water which play a crucial part in amr and other threats17 in terms of pathogen monitoring and response the 2005 international health regulations which are meant to help the international community and governments prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide18 are not fully implemented by many countries due to limited financial resources and political will and have been violated in response to the covid-19 outbreak19 what is more confounding is that many high-income countries like france have failed to fully implement the international health regulations particularly in their overseas territories16 in addition other disease control mechanisms like the who global influenza surveillance and response system httpswwwwhointinfluenzagisrslaboratoryen remain inadequate and underfunded with too few who laboratories and a market-based model where a global public good pooled influenza knowledge is turned into a private good pharmaceutical profit with historical inequities in terms of public health20 moreover many countries like china are incentivised not to raise the epidemic alarm too soon due to fears of diminished direct foreign investment like with severe acute respiratory syndrome h7n9 and now covid-19 and fears that the government will be perceived as weak21 these conditions of incapacity at the international level are exacerbated by a weakened who whose budget has been radically reduced and ring-fenced for example the who used to receive three-quarters of its financing from assessed contributions levied on members however a change to a zero real growth policy for its regular budget in the 1980s has meant it now only receives a quarter of its budget from member contributions as a result the who is dependent on extra-budgetary ring-fenced pet project funding from donors to fill an increasingly shrinking budget22 as the money flows to other multilateral health initiatives the whos authority dissipates with numerous organisations like the institute for health metrics and evaluation the bill and melinda gates foundation and mdecins sans frontires able to command greater epistemic authority23 financial influence24 and response effectiveness25 however this expansion of initiatives creates a condition of policy fragmentation which significantly weakens coordinated global public health26 27 one real result of fragmentation of global health governance is an inefficient division of labour where hundreds of actors such as the who global fund presidents emergency plan for aids relief united nations programme on hiv and aids united states agency for international development world bank the gates foundation and the clinton foundation to name only a few produce parallel programmes or bric--brac vertical health silos that have neither generated overall system strengthening in high burden countries nor allowed for effective global health policy27 28 this creates two failures first contrary to sector-wide approaches29 vertical pet-project global initiatives often fail to promote sustainable long-term local health system strengthening which is the best preventive defence for disease control of all types not just infectious diseases second the global level is woefully unprepared for epidemics since global policy has remained reactionary symptom-based and dependent on vaccine discoveries without full appreciation of other upstream determinants of disease and access to those vaccines given the state of global health governance and inadequate investments in health system strengtheningas well as the failure by many actors to adopt a systems approach to problem resolution14the spread and danger of covid-19 is not surprising what is required we argue is to shift global health policymaking from a specific reactional paradigm to a systemic holistic and preventive paradigm there is no doubt that this approach will require serious resources governance reform and political will nevertheless the global economic costs of covid-19 have already reached into at least a trillion dollars30 thus serious efforts to improve global and local health systems would be a small fraction of this cost with a tried and true cost-saving philosophy that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure the emergency responses to covid-19 so far are based on the so-called pasteurian paradigm which states that each disease is due to one pathogen thus for each disease there is one cure targeting the responsible pathogen in this case laboratories are racing to find the cure or the vaccine against covid-19a vaccine which will come too late for the current epidemic and will have limited efficacy if the virus mutates in the coming months or years yet it is easy to see how the more pathogens there might be in the future which there will be the less this paradigm makes sense moreover the pasteurian paradigm has imposed its preferred research methodnamely randomised control trials that try to isolate one variable from all possible variablesas the gold standard of science relegating other approaches as near charlatanism however there is a multitude of evidence indicating that beyond a single pathogen the development of a disease as well as its outcome is considerably affected by the physical and social parameters in which it operates and that this is considerably affected by social political environmental and individual factors31 32 this seems widely known by the public as far as chronic non-communicable diseases are concerned but is also the case for infectious diseases especially for emerging infections in which the pathogenic role of social inequalities is recognised33 moreover the traditional frontiers between communicable and non-communicable diseases are being blurred by evidence of biosocial contagion34 in this light the globalised world is now facing a syndemicthat is a synergy of epidemics that cooccur in time and place interact with each other to produce complex sequelae and share common underlying societal drivers35 covid-19 is no exception since its mortality rate varies significantly according to age sex and comorbidities36 as an alternative we argue that it would be more effective efficient and equitable to adopt a holistic approach to health how to tackle the silent killers and how to prepare populationsincluding the most vulnerable37against future epidemics should be on the top of national and global health policy and research agendas this should reflect both a security approach fighting symptomatic issues and a health development approach tackling upstream causes and determinants in doing so the objectives should not be merely be the response mode but a more concerted effort to limit environmental factors protect biodiversity38 reduce social health inequities strengthen local health systems for preventive health help populations reduce their individual risk factors and augment their natural immunitynotably through various healthy behaviours and diets that are proven to strengthen the general immune system3946 like what recently took place in the field of evaluation of complex systems and policies47 a realist revolution of medical research is probably needed to help support this it is ultimately important that the resulting policies are not copy-pasted from other countries but adapted to each context and backed by strong local health systems by definition preventive health policies must be tailored to local specificities including local environments and health systems must be strengthened at the local level so as to be able to respond to a populations needs and expectations this is also the case for the response to covid-19 viruses and epidemics have always existed and will always exist and should be anticipated48 49 coronaviruses are a well-known family of viruses and even if this one is particularly aggressive its genome has been rapidly identified the difference with this epidemic which is causing the semicollapse of health systems is that it has revealed a profound lack of national prevention and preparedness in response to the epidemic the most hit countries so far have faced a lack of equipment and critical care beds in the uk and france as just two examples decades of austerity policies and an obsession with evaluating health facilities based on technical efficiency ie minimising inputs and increasing outputs have considerably decreased the capacity of health systems to respond to above-average frequentation50 the covid-19 emergency responses of many states have revealed important inconsistencies in many european countries the authorities have adopted a one-size-fits-all policy and imposed the same measures everywhere more worryingly some governmentsnotably in africahave not performed their own adapted risk assessment before copy-pasting strategies from abroad51 this is problematic since it makes little sense to use a predictive model developed from a country where the median age is 47 and translate it to a country with a median age of 18 without adjusting the parameters in addition current policies fail to account for regional or transborder contextual parameters where either more stringent or relaxed measures could be more suitable depending on geographical determinants the universal lockdown of a whole country may not be necessary when there are only one or two epidemic outbreaks separated by hundreds of miles especially if containment is quick and determined what we suggest in order to be effective is that policies should fit each context and be adaptive at the territorial or ecosystem level versus being unreflectively and uniformly bounded by national jurisdictions this is the best way to not impose measures that are too coercive which may face legal constraints and may be counterproductive eroding public trust and cooperation52 53 in the post-covid-19 recovery phase we hope the lessons learnt from local national and global responses to this pandemic will foster support by policymakers and by the public for tailored policy responses that support stronger and more integrated local health systems in summary the current crisis calls for a paradigm shift in public and global health policies we will not be prepared for the next epidemic unless we take bold steps first global health policies should not be designed on a response mode to case-by-case threats but should adopt a systems approach that can support a holistic picture of global disease burdens risks and health conditions as well as better consider the system-wide effects of adopted measures second countering current fragmentation in global health governance will require a substantial shift in global health policymaking from a reactional paradigm to a systemic and preventive paradigm with meaningful commitments to human health security third there is a need to shift our focus from short-term curative policies based on the pasteurian paradigm to long-term preventive and promotional policies based on a holistic view of peoples health which notably implies limiting environmental factors reducing social health inequities helping populations reduce their individual risk factors and augmenting their natural immunity lastly such holistic preventive policies must be adapted to local contexts and implemented through strong local health systems able to have the cushion capacity to respond to emergencies   victor wang  this paper presents a simple mathematical model that answers how much testing and tracing we need to do to suppress new surges of covid-19 infections after reopening we derived the model by modifying the seir model taking into the effects of testing and tracing the following equation is one of the essential outcomes of the model where r is the percentage of infectious people that have to be detected per day r0 is the basic reproduction number sn is the percentage of the susceptible population over the entire population d is the length of the infectious period and h is the percentage of close contacts that have to be traced if the above equation is satisfied we can bring the effective reproduction number re to below 1 to get the transmission suppressed this model demonstrates that together with social-distancing measures such as wearing masks in public with a reasonable amount of testing and tracing we may suppress the covid-19 transmission for good for example if social distancing measures can bring r0 to below 12 for d being 10 days in places where 15 people have developed antibodies we can suppress the transmission by detecting only 013 of the infectious population daily while tracing 50 of their close contacts the model provides intuitive insights and quantitative guidance for policymakers and public health practitioners to deploy the testing and tracing resources optimally  as countries reopen their societies and economies from the covid-19 lockdowns the biggest concern is whether we will have new waves of infections before we have effective drugs and vaccines the only measures we can rely on to suppress the transmission are social distancing such as wearing masks testing to detect the infectious people to isolate them and tracing their close contacts to quarantine them this paper presents a simple mathematical model for the amount of testing and tracing needed to suppress the transmission under the condition that certain social-distancing measures are in place such as wearing masks in public the critical parameter of any infectious disease is its basic reproduction number r0 the average number of people can be infected by an infectious person during his entire infectious period without any intervention or mitigation measures with various intervention and mitigation measures in place the reproduction number changes the literature often denote rt as the reproduction number at a given time t the literature further defines re as the effective reproduction number taking into consideration of the effects of all the measures that can be taken including social distancing testing and tracing with isolation the goal of suppressing the transmission is to make re  1 one of the most widely used math models for infectious diseases is the seir model 1 2  as depicted in figure 1  the total population in consideration is divided into four distinctive compartments denoted as s-susceptible e-exposed those contracted the disease but not yet infectious i-infectious and r-removed in figure 1  s -the size of the population of susceptible e -the size of the population exposed to the disease and infected but not infectious yet i -the size of the population of infectious r -the size of the population of removed from both susceptible s and infected population e i including the recovered all of the above four variables change over time as an infectious disease progresses n -the size of the entire population in consideration n  s  e  i  r which is a constant if without considering natural births and deaths and the deaths due to the disease are negligible compared with n b --the average daily number 1 of people to be infected by an infectious person when sn d --the latent rate  1 2  where l is the average length of time from being exposed to being infectious 2  g --the remove rate g  1 3  where d is the average length of the infectious period this model makes the following assumptions it ignores the effects of both natural births and deaths and the deaths due to the disease in consideration ii it defines exposed as those who already contracted the disease but not infectious yet ie they are in the latent period 1 note here we use daily number to make it easy to understand in rigorous math terms the daily number should be the number occurring in unit time we use daily number throughout the text without further noting 2 here we assume the exposure time is the same as the infection time although in general that may not always be true note also that the latent period is not the same as the incubation period unless the patients become infectious exactly when they start to have symptoms 3 4  but in any case these differences do not affect our final result since it does not depend on this parameter d the removed are not infectious nor to be subject to another infection the removed are those who no longer infectious whether recovered clinically or not since b is the daily number of people infected by an infectious person the transfer rate from s to e is b 5 6  note even though each infectious person can infect b persons daily if sn as the population of s shrinks they have fewer to infect thus the daily number of new infected is scaled by the factor of 5 6  the transfer rate from e to i is reversely proportional to the length of the latent period similarly the transfer rate from i to r is reversely proportional to the length of the infectious period with the above transfer rates between the compartments we can have the following set of differential equations given the above set of equations with a set of initial conditions we can have the populations size at any given time t however what we are most interested in here is whether the infected population will increase or decrease the rate of change of the infected population is to suppress the transmission we need the population of  to decrease over time that is cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

b g as an infectious disease progresses s keeps decreasing when  eq 1 is satisfied thus the disease will die out the literature refers to such a scenario as the population reaches the herd immunity without intervention measures the infected population can only decrease as people naturally recover the effects of testing and tracing are to artificially decrease the population of the infected by detecting and tracing then isolating them so that they can no longer infect other people the seir model depicted in figure 1 can be modified considering the effects of testing and tracing as shown in

variables as below r --the percentage of infectious people that are detected per day h --the percentage of close contacts that are traced per day by definition the number of infectious people detected per day is r i hence the transfer rate from i to q due to the detection is r i the number of close contacts made by each infectious person per day is b then the number of close contacts made per day by the infectious people detected is br i thus the total number of close contacts made by these infectious people during their entire infectious period d days is bdr i  therefore the total number of close contacts that are traced per day is the close contacts can be in any of the three boxes s e and i depending on when they had close contact with an infectious person those who had close contact with an infectious person within the l days are not yet infectious thus in either box s or e  while those who had close contact more than l days ago become infectious thus are in box i 3  now we have the following transfer rates due to the tracing from box e to c h1-ablr i from box i to q in addition to the transfer rate due to the detection is 4  we assume the infectious people in box q are removed at the same rate as those in box i then the transfer rate from box q to r is gq in box c where there are both infected and non-infected those who are infected start to become infectious after their latent period thus the transfer rate from box c to q is 3 here we assume the length of the infectious period d is equal or longer than the length of the latent period l which is the case for covid-19 4 we assume testing every close contact as soon as they are traced so we know who is infectious to be isolated  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

determined only by the effects of social-distance measures in place in the following discussion we assume the social-distance measures remain the same over time so that rs does not change with time note that r0  328 is among the highest values observed so far mostly derived from the studies in large metropolitan areas like wuhan in china where population density is among the highest in the world in the us however much lower r0 has been observed as indicated in the websites httpsrtlive and httpscovid19-projectionscominfections-tracker the websites quoted that the average r0 in the us is 222 before any intervention measure was taken in all the states only new york had r0 366 while all other states had r0 lower than 25 when we calculate the amount of testing and tracing needed we need to consider the effects of social-distancing measures already in place thus we need to use the reproduction number with social distancing rs rather than the basic reproduction number r0 in the following discussion we replace r0 with rs in eq 3 to have since s changes over time so too k 5 6 which is the reproduction number at time t as defined in 8  similarly eq 6 can be represented as now re is the effective reproduction number taking into consideration of the effects not only testing and tracing but also that of social distancing it is clear here that re changes with time since m or equivalently 5 6  changes with time our model depends on the value of d which is the average length of the infectious period to suppress the transmission it is critical to understand when infected

rs increases the quantity of detection required increases quickly when rs  20 if we can trace 50 of close contacts we would need to detect 5 of infectious people per day it is also worth noting that when rs is small eg close to 10 tracing does not make as much a difference as when rs is larger for the given costs of the detection and the tracing we can find the optimal quantities of testing and tracing to minimize the total cost for example as the testing becomes more available and its cost drops if tracing is too hard to do we may choose to do more testing than tracing in both figure 3 and figure 4  we assume 5 6  1 that is a conservative bound since as the disease progresses s keeps decreasing as of may 28 2020 both infection and seroconversion 5 surveys have been conducted in many places in the world the uk government published data that as of may 24 2020 678 95 confidence interval 521 to 864 of individuals from whom blood samples were taken tested positive for antibodies to the coronavirus 16  the survey results from studies in spain and france indicate that 50 and 44 of their populations respectively have ever contracted coronavirus 17  in many metropolitan areas of the world the seroconversion rate is much higher for example that of boston is 1018 madrid 11 19  moscow 14 20  london 17 19  and new york city 199 while new york state 12321 with the above data as of may 28 2020 it seemed that for many european countries the nationwide seroconversion rate had reached about 5 while in many metropolitan areas it has reached about 15 that implies the 5 6 has been reduced

tracing the first question we have in implementing the testing and tracing is how do we know the detection ratio and tracing ratio achieved let us first discuss the detection ratio one way to estimate the detection ratio is to do a largescale random infection survey over the population in consideration except for those recovered and those tested positive with antibodies to come up with the attack rate the test-positive rate of the survey with the attack rate established we can know the detection ratio achieved to estimate the tracing ratio we can count those close contracts traced who eventually become infectious for per infector denoted as i ct  then the tracing ratio is h  sm m while we can know the detection ratio right after the daily detection is done we may have to wait for a few days the average length of the incubation period of covid-19 is 51 days before we can count in all the close contacts who become infectious assume we only test them when they have symptoms unless we test them every day the second question is how to optimize testing and tracing for example if our goal is to detect 1 of the infectious population per day we can use a brute-force approach to accomplish such a goal to test 1 of the entire population except for those who tested positive or with antibodies this approach assumes the infectious people are randomly distributed in the entire population which is certainly not true thus we can do a better job than the brute-force approach with a given testing capacity we can test the groups in the population with the highest risk of contracting the virus first for example we should test anyone who has suspected symptoms and encourage everyone who suspects themselves having symptoms to come to a test the survey 16 in the uk showed that the test-positive rate of those with specific symptoms reporting having cough fever and loss of taste or smell is 67 that of people without symptoms is only 04 while that of those with any one of the symptoms is 26 in the same survey the attack rate was given as 043 if we apply all the testing capacity to those with specific symptoms we can detect 1 of infectious people with testing only 04367100  006 of the population if we apply the testing capacity to those with any one of the symptoms we need only to test 04326100  017 of the population to detect 1 of infectious people these represent much improvement over the brute-force approach in practice we need to categorize the entire population into groups according to their risk levels for example in the uk those who reported

professionals such as nurses and doctors as well as social care workers such as nursing home or home care workers in comparison the percentage of people reporting not working in these types of roles testing positive rate was much lower at 038 16  we need to do more of such surveys for different groups of the population we can detect more infectious people with the minimum testing capacity if we can apply limited testing capacity to the highest-risk groups the third issue in implementation is how to estimate rs of the region of the consideration or equivalently how to estimate rt since we can estimate 5 6 by doing a seroconversion survey we can have rs when we know rt from eq 7 the estimation of rt has been discussed extensively in the literature and tools are also provided 8 22 23 24 25  websites such as httpsrtlive also provide the real-time estimation of the rt for all 50 states of the us the model developed in this paper is the most appropriate for situations where there are already a large number of infected people spread out in the community like in the us and many other european countries for countries like china where after a period of strict lockdown the new cases come to almost zero or taiwan where they did excellent job suppressed the infections from very beginning to a minimal number 26  they do not need to do a large amount of testing to detect the infectious people from the population given there are so few new cases in these places all they need to do is pay close attention to any new cases including screening out all imported cases and tracing all close contacts of these new cases this model should apply to any relatively isolated communities such as a country a state a metropolitan area or even a remote town as many private employers are taking the testing into their own hands this model may or may not apply to a company where their employees have frequent interactions with members outside the company with social-distancing measures in place the reproduction number of covid-19 has been significantly reduced in all places it might have been reduced to below 1 in places where more disciplined social-distancing is practiced such as in japan in such places extensive testing and tracing may not be needed however in other places of the world depending on the scale and degree of the reopening the reproduction number may come back to be higher than 1 in these places we can rely on conducting a reasonable amount of testing and tracing to suppress the new waves of infections before any effective drugs and vaccines become available the model developed here can provide quantitative guidance on how to deploy the testing and tracing resources optimally  cc-by 40 international license it

most cases of covid-19 are asymptomatic but some are severe and lethal mortality is the simplest marker of covid-19 vulnerability covid-19 vulnerability can be defined as a chance of death from covid-19 once infected age in all studies conducted in all countries the mortality rate from covid-19 increases exponentially with age 111 exact mortality rates varied in hundreds of studies because they depend on testing and therapeutic interventions but the rule is clear the mortality rate is increasing exponentially with age age-related diseases mortality is especially high in patients with pre-existing conditions 6 9 10 1223 in italy 99 of patients who died had at least one illness
httpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles2020-03-1899-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says in other words infected people without pre-existing diseases do not die this may seem paradoxical because we just discussed that age is sufficient to increase mortality exponentially this is because pre-existing conditions are manifestations of biological age whereas aging and diseases are two sides of the same coin 2426 these conditions are typical age-related diseases hypertension diabetes obesity ischemic heart disease ihd and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and other diseases 9 1223 of course not all only some patients with age-related diseases die from covid-19 in other words age-related diseases are necessary but not sufficient for mortality from covid-19 age and pre-existing age-related diseases are interdependent a number and severity of diseases correlate with age an average 60 year old person has more age-related diseases than an average 50 your old person yet a particular 60 year old person may have no age-related diseases whereas a particular 50 year old person may have multiple diseases including hypertension diabetes obesity and cancer in this case it is a chronologically younger person who is biologically older and it is the biological age that determines the likelihood of death from covid-19 male gender at the same age the mortality rate is twice higher in men than in women 9 27 28 in part because men age faster than women and at any chronological age men are biologically older than women 29 so three rules can be combined in one covid-19 vulnerability is determined by biological age biological age combines chronological age age-related diseases and gender a combination of all age-related diseases and pre-diseases is a biomarker of biological age figuratively sars-cov-2 can measure biological age which is thus the best predictor of mortality from both covid-19 and other diseases aging can be measured as an increase in the probability of death with age mortality increases exponentially starting from age 8-9 men have a higher normal age-related death rate than women because men age faster than women 29 covid-19 mortality rate parallels the expected aging-related death rate supplementary figure 1 and see second graph in
httpsmediumcomwintoncentrehow-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196 chances to die from covid-19 are proportional to chances to die from aging itself at any age the only discrepancy between natural and covid-19 mortality is observed below the age of 8 years old whereas natural death rate is relatively high covid-19 mortality is low no mortality 11 this discrepancy will be discussed later but first how do animals including humans die from aging humans and other animals including the worm 30 and the fly 31 do not die from aging itself but from age-related diseases such as ischemic heart disease ihd hypertension diabetes cancer alzheimers and parkinsons diseases age-related macular degeneration osteoporosis and sarcopenia as we will discuss even seemingly non-deadly diseases such as osteoporosis can lead to deadly complications the incidence of these diseases increases exponentially with age some diseases such as obesity hypertension and diabetes develop earlier in the course of aging other diseases such as alzheimers disease and macular degeneration are usually diagnosed later 32 33 age-related diseases may also occur in younger people with genetic predisposition and environmental exposure hazards but even without these factors diseases develop because they are quasi-programmed see quasi-programmed aging section these diseases are not diseases of civilization as it may seem humans simply now live long enough to develop them of course hazards of civilization can accelerate them at a younger age aging and its diseases cannot be separated healthy aging or aging without diseases is merely a slow aging when biological age is less than chronological age during a period of seemingly healthy aging pre-pre-diseases and pre-diseases are progressing until they eventually reach clinical manifestations thus healthy aging progress to unhealthy and pre-diseases become diseases 34 age-related diseases and covid-19 vulnerability are highly intertwined patients who die from covid-19 otherwise would die from age-related diseases such as heart disease cancer diabetes hypertension just a year later covid-19 approximately doubles a patients aging-dependent risk of dying during one year for example numbers are very approximate a sixty year old woman has 1 chance to die from aging before her 61st birthday at that age if infected the death rate from covid-19 is around 1 for females if infected a patient has approximately doubled chances to die compared with usual age-related mortality during one year as david spiegelhalter put it getting covid-19 is like packing a years worth of risk into a week or two
httpsmediumcomwintoncentrehow-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196 children and young adults have a very low risk of death from aging-related diseases so that risk remains extremely low even when doubled although natural mortality is relatively high in the youngest age group especially in infants they do not die from age-related diseases of course instead infants are vulnerable to bacterial infections and candida infections due to underdeveloped immune system 35 low covid-19 mortality in the pediatric age group 11 is consistent with the notion that covid-19 vulnerability is not due to a weak immune system in contrast as we will discuss in the next section it is hyper-functional immune response that leads to death from covid-19 in the elderly by causing cytokine storm severe covid-19 is characterized by hyper-inflammation cytokine storm acute respiratory distress syndrome ards damage to the lung heart and kidneys 3639 in response to viral replication hyperfunctional monocytes and macrophages infiltrate the lung causing hyper-inflammation and hyper-secretion of cytokines such as interleukin il-6 il-2 il-7 il-1ra interferon- inducible protein ip-10 tumor necrosis factor tnf- ferritin monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip 1- granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf c-reactive protein crp and procalcitonin 22 3642 this leads to leukocyte recruitment vascular permeability edema and further pulmonary damage in vicious cycle 37 38 41 43 44 hyper-inflammation becomes systemic in turn causing hyper-coagulation and thrombosis disseminated intravascular coagulation 45 this causes injury of distant organs such as the kidneys pre-existing organ damage late stages of age-related diseases exacerbates organ damage caused by cytokine storm 42 43 46 in addition cellular hyper-functions and systemic hyper-inflammation may lead to cellular exhaustion such as exhaustion of lymphocytes lymphopenia 4749 hypercoagulation is associated with hyperactive fibrinolysis and increased d-dimer blood levels 23 cytokine storm is a systemic hyperfunctional response figure 1 of course age-related hyperfunctional response such as cytokine storm is not caused by lifelong accumulation of molecular damage aging is not caused by molecular damage after all instead its a continuation of developmentalgrowth programs that lead to hyper-functions and in turn eventually to dysfunctions quasi means resembling or seemingly but not really quasi-program of aging is not a program but a continuation of developmental programs that were not switched off upon their completion 24 50 they purposelessly unfold leading to age-related diseases secondary organ failure and death quasi-programmed program-like aging is associated with higher than optimal cellular and systemic functions which eventually via cellular exhaustion and organ damage lead to functional decline figure 2 for example starting from birth blood pressure increases and continues to increase after organismal growth is completed therefore hypertension is the most prevalent age-related disease in turn hypertension can cause organ damage stroke infarction and renal failure similarly obesity develops in post-development as a continuation of growth yet it can be prevented by low caloric diets illustrating that quasi-program of aging can be decelerated hyperfunction is an excessive normal cellular function contraction by smooth muscle cells smc adhesion and aggregation by blood platelets insulin secretion by beta-cells lipid accumulation by adipocytes secretion by stromal and immune cells oxidative burst by leukocytes just to name a few when higher than optimal they cause vasoconstriction and hypertension thrombosis hyperinsulinemia hypertrophy hyperplasia obesity hyper-secretory phenotype or senescence-associated secretory phenotype sasp hyper-inflammation and so on hyper-function is not necessarily an absolutely increased function it may be also insufficiently decreased function relative hyperfunction levels of igf-1 and growth hormone decrease during lifespan despite this decrease igf-1 levels are still higher than optimal relative hyper-function because further genetic decrease in igf-1 levels by genetic means extends health span and lifespan in mammals 5153 cellular hyperfunctions may eventually switch to cellular exhaustion and loss of functions at late stages during the course of type ii diabetes mtor overactivation and hyperinsulinemia eventually lead to beta-cell exhaustion and insulin insufficiency from pre-diabetes to diabetes 54 55 as another example after puberty hyperstimulation of the ovary eventually leads to oocyte exhaustion and menopause see figure 3 in ref 29 depletion of nave lymphocytes is another example as reviewed here later age-related alterations are mostly noticed when they switch to functional decline which is a late event in some cases functional decline can be primary and programmed for example thymus involution replacement of t cells by adipocytes starts early in life accelerates at puberty and continues later still loss of thymocytes and their niches may be in part due to adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy 56 in fact obesity accelerates involution whereas calorie restriction decelerates it 57 58 furthermore the oblation of sex hormones decelerates or even reverses thymus involution 59 thus involution is triggered by adipocyte hyperplasia and increased production of sex hormones during puberty 56 quasi-programmed aging is not driven by molecular damage it is driven by nutrienthormonecytokine-sensing and growth-promoting signaling pathways such as target of rapamycin tor mtor which are involved in developmental growth and later cause hyperfunctional aging and its diseases 24 26 what is the cause-effect relationship between age-related diseases and covid-19 lethality do patients die from age-related diseases complicated by covid-19 or in contrast do these various diseases make covid-19 infection lethal both scenarios take place to some extent however the relationship is mostly indirect both age-related diseases and covid-vulnerability result from the same underlying cause figure 3 this is why they are highly correlated the cause is aging itself aging is manifested by a sum of deadly - and not so deadly - diseases and conditions ranging from cancer to grey hair although not all diseases seem to be deadly they can cause complications such as stroke ventricular fibrillation renal failure lung edema even sarcopenia and osteoporosis lead to falls and broken bones culminating in a deadly sequence of events cosmetic manifestations such as aging spots and wrinkles while not deadly by themselves can be manifestations of other diseases for example baldness correlates with prostate enlargement 60 and the later can lead to urinary obstruction and renal failure diseases occur together for example chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd is associated with diabetes cardiovascular disease and hypertension 61 if a person has one disease eg diabetes this patient has higher chances of having other diseases eg hypertension ihd cancer or conditions including covid-19 vulnerability which is revealed only during infection but can be predicted by pre-existing diseases aging is initially driven by an increase in cellular and systemic functions hyperfunction leading to age-related conditions for example hypertension is a systemic hyperfunction due to hyperfunction of multiple cell types such as arterial smooth muscle cells asmc similarly covid-19-vulnerability is associated with hyperfunction of inflammatory cells that in response to covid-19 infection causes cytokine storm hyper-coagulation and damage of the lung and distant organs the covid-19 vulnerability syndrome is an aging-related disease strictly dependent on biological age associated with other age-related diseases and exemplified by hyper-functional response to infection with hundreds of cell types acting in concert the immune system is so complex that we cannot discuss age-related alterations without oversimplification the most noticeable alteration is that memory t and b cells replace naive t and b cells 62 this seems natural since life-long exposure to pathogens replaces nave cells by memory cells replacement of nave immune cells decreases adaptive responses to novel antigens such as sars-cov-2 in contrast immune protection by memory t cells from viral re-infection with known pathogens is usually increased with age 62 immune responses are roughly divided into a innate responses carried mostly by neutrophils macrophages and nk cells which react to pathogen rapidly and nonspecifically and b adaptive responses carried by t and b lymphocytes which are delayed slower and specific eg antigen-specific clonal expansion of t and b lymphocytes and antibody production by b lymphocytes 6365 in the elderly immune responses to sars-cov-12 are stuck in innate immunity with insufficient progression to adaptive immunity 37 however decline in adaptive response such as antibody production plays little role in covid-19 mortality it is hyper-functional innate immunity hyper-inflammation cytokine storm and hyper-coagulation that lead to organ failure and death in agreement hyper inflammatory response rather than high virus numbers leads to death of sars-cov-infected old nonhuman primates 66 aging is associated with diseases of immune hyper-function such as autoimmune disorders with paradoxical increase in certain signaling pathways and cytokine levels 6769 in the elderly innate immune cells are in a state of sustained activation producing pro-inflammatory cytokines 67 7072 increased pro-inflammatory activity by the innate immune system especially by monocytesmacrophages is a state of alertness and hyper-reactivity on the cost of potential age-related inflammatory diseases 67 7072 whereas some functions are decreased others are increased according to the inflamm-aging concept innate immune system overtakes adaptive immune system in aging cause-effect relationships are bi-directional immunosenescence namely a decrease in adaptive response is a cause and consequence of inflamm-aging 67 7072 we can consider inflamm-aging as an example of hyper-function while some functions are decreased others are increased hyper-function is damaging in analogy increased electric power without an adaptor would damage a laptop damaging hyper-functions can lead to loss of function and cellular exhaustion and vice versa loss of function may cause compensatory hyper-functions of another components cellular senescence is a continuation of cellular growth when actual growth is completed 73 74 in proliferating cells cellular mass growth is balanced by cell division cells grow in size and then divide when the cell cycle is blocked eg p21 and p16 then growth-promoting pathways such as mtor and mapk drive conversion to senescence geroconversion 24 74 75 during geroconversion cells become hypertrophic and fat cellular functions increase hyper-secretion and lysosomal hyper-function are manifested by sasp and beta-gal staining hyper-activated growth-promoting pathways cause compensatory resistance to growth factorsinsulin permanent loss of re-proliferative potential 74 rapamycin everolimus pan-mtor and mapk inhibitors slows down geroconversion maintaining reversible quiescence instead of senescence 73 7688 geroconversion is a continuation of cellular growth 73 74 similarly aging is a continuation of developmental growth see figure 1 in ref 89 when the developmental program is completed it becomes a quasi-program of aging as discussed in detail chronically activated nutrient-sensing and growth-promoting pathways drive age-related diseases culminating in organismal death 24 26 age-related diseases are quasi-programmed aging is a common cause of age-related diseases a sum of all age-related diseases they are diseases of hyper-function secondary hypo-function and compensation reactions 25 they are deadly manifestations of aging from activation of cellular functions to systemic hyperfunctions from diseases to organ damage and death hyperfunction theory of quasi-programmed aging describes the sequence of events 26 and as discussed in 2006 suppression of aging by gero-suppressants such as rapamycin will prevent and treat all age-related diseases 24 this point of view is becoming widely accepted and in recent literature quasi-programmed model of diseases 2006 is called geroscience hypothesis 2 90 if aging were functional decline due to accumulation of molecular damage then it would be near to impossible to restore functions and rejuvenate the immune system in contrast if functional decline is secondary to hyperfunctions see figure 2 in ref 89 these hyperfunctions can be suppressed pharmacologically to restore lost functions typical drugs are inhibitors of their targets rather than activators so they decrease functions of their targets by decreasing hyper-functions which otherwise lead to secondary loss of functions rapamycin may restore lost functions figure 4 rapamycin improves vaccination against viruses such as influenza in old mice monkeys and humans 92100 importantly rapamycin increases pathogen-specific but not graft-reactive cd8 t cell responses 95 101 therefore rapamycin and everolimus can both be used to prevent donor organ rejection and improve adaptive immunity against new pathogens 96 differentiation is an increase of tissue-specific cellular functions terminally differentiated b t and nk cells can rapidly react to already known pathogens 102 decrease in nave t and b lymphocytes and thus diminished response to novel antigens results in part from cellular hyper-differentiation in the immune system 64 103 hyper-functional differentiation can be counteracted by rapamycin 98 as another example age-related exhaustion of stem cells is partially due to loss of quiescence caused by growth over-stimulation 92 104106 in general senescent cells characterized by hyper-proliferative drive coupled with cell cycle arrest 77 in young mice mtor hyper-activation causes senescence of hematopoietic stem cells hsc and decreases lymphopoiesis 92 in old mice rapamycin rejuvenates hematopoiesis and improves vaccination against influenza virus 92 third production of lymphoid cells may be decreased because of disruption of hypoxic niches due to adipocytes hyperplasia 56 107 hypoxic niches can preserve hsc 108 109 probably because hypoxia inhibits mtor and cellular senescence 110 in agreement rapamycin preserves hscs 92 98 111 112 reduces the proportion of memory cells and maintains a pool of nave t cells 92 98 fourth growth factor gf- and insulin-resistance is loss of function because cells cannot respond to gfinsulin but it may be caused by over-activated mtor which via s6kirs feedback loop blocks insulin and gf signaling rapamycin abrogates the loop restoring signaling 113118 a high prevalence of age-related diseases often called diseases of civilization is a success story of modern medicine in the past most people did not live long enough to develop age-related diseases and those who developed them died soon after due to medical advances people survive to 85 on average despite suffering from age-related diseases standard medicine preferentially extends life span without necessarily affecting health span see figure 3 in ref 119 for example defibrillation and coronary stenting can save life but not cure heart disease it is anti-aging interventions that extend health span delaying diseases thus extending lifespan aging is a common cause of all age-related diseases by suppressing aging anti-aging interventions may delay all age-related diseases 119 as a well-known example low calorie diets such as calorie restriction intermittent fasting and low carbohydrate diets extend both health and lifespan figuratively low calorie diets prolong life by improving health nutrients and obesity activate growth-promoting pathways eg mtor thus accelerating development of quasi-programmed age-related diseases obesity is associated with all age-related diseases from cancer to alzheimers and from diabetes to sarcopenia covid-19 vulnerability is also associated with obesity 9 19 20 22 according to hyperfunction theory obesity accelerates aging and all age-related conditions including covid-19 vulnerability diabetes is one of main risk factors of death in covid-19 5 6 12 13 15 21 can type 2 diabetes an age-related disease be reversed in remarkable studies it was shown that a brief course 6-8 weeks of very low calorie diets vlcds can reverse type ii diabetes in one study vlcd reversed diabetes in 46 of patients with up to a 6-year history of diabetes 120 vlcd is most effective for its prevention and at early stages of diabetes 121 this anti-aging modality is so simple that remission can be achieved at home by health-motivated individuals 122 simultaneously it treats other age-related diseases such hypertension 123 obesity is associated with other diseases of hyperfunction from diabetes and sarcopenia to cancer and alzheimers disease since age-related diseases are predictors of covid-19 mortality vlcd in theory may decrease covid-19 vulnerability in the soil of easter island a complex bacteria produces anti-fungal antibiotic rapamycin to suppress yeast growth but as a by-product it also suppresses yeast aging quasi-programed aging is a continuation of growth approved for human use in 1999 rapamycin sirolimus and its close analog everolimus are widely used in several diseases including cancer and organ transplantation hundreds of clinical trials and twenty years of clinical practice have ensured their safety and good tolerability especially in healthy older adults 119 currently several anti-aging clinics prescribe rapamycin out of label to prevent age-related diseases and slow aging hundreds of recent reviews discussed rapamycin and everolimus in detail so i will just emphasize a few points as soon as covid-19 epidemic started it become clear that covid-19 vulnerability is an aging-dependent condition and the use of rapamycin sirolimus was immediately suggested by independent researchers 1 3 133137 these proposals were based on a mixture of several rationales which need to be clearly distinguished in theory there are at least three independent applications of rapamycin and everolimus for covid-19 currently they all are still hypothetical 3 potential suppression of cytokine storm and hyper-inflammation figure 1 as we discussed in

good  wootton 2017 while there is a growing body of research focused on select aspects of peoples
experiences with advanced cancer there is a dearth of research attending to
the process of living with advanced cancer across the trajectory towards
death one exception is the work of olson and colleagues olson morse smith
mayan  hammond 2001 who were concerned about the lack
of theory linking the living-dying experience of people with advanced
disease these researchers asked the question what is the experience of
people with illness who expect to die and used the answer to modify the
illness constellation model a recent metasynthesis garca-rueda carvajal valcrcel saracbar-razquin 
arantzamendi solabarrieta 2016 resulted in a model that
suggests people with advanced cancer desire to live normally while also
being aware of the closeness of death suffering is inherent in the context
of advanced cancer which people seek to reduce and at the same time live
life with new meaning this entails a process that has an impact on family
dynamics because the sick person not only needs to be cared for but also has
the need to care for his or her family the model addresses the importance
of the support network and the health context in which the person lives specific aspects of living with advanced cancer that have been explored include

et al 2015 walshe and colleagues 2017
emphasized that useful strategies for coping well with advanced cancer are
only generated through engagement in the process of living with disease but
that process requires articulation it is clear that there is a much bigger
story to the process of living with advanced cancer than we currently
understand the limited studies transmit the underlying idea that it is possible to live
well with advanced cancer but little is known about this process nor how to
support it however there is a theory that captures the process of living
well with chronic illness developed through grounded theory research
conducted with 43 participants who perceived themselves to be managing well
with a variety of chronic illnesses robinson 2017 the theory
explains that there is an iterative healing process of moving on through
which people revisit five interconnected phases the fight accepting
living with the chronic illness sharing the experience and reconstructing
life the iterative phases revolve around a core category of making hard
choices this model shows a dynamic process that occurs as the chronic
condition or the responses to it change and people develop new ways to live
well moving sometimes back and forth between the phases multiple chronic
illnesses were represented among the participants which was an intentional
decision to enhance applicability the first author was familiar with the theory of living well with chronic
illness and during data analysis for the primary study was struck by
possible intersections between the participants accounts and the theory
the stories of the participants made us reflect on how well the participants
lived with their serious illness which was congruent with the theory this
was discussed with the team and we became curious about whether the theory
might be relevant to people living with advanced cancer considering that
this stage of the cancer journey is often prolonged and can be considered
chronic due to treatment advances moghaddam et al 2016 in
addition we wondered whether the theory would be applicable within a
different culture that is spain versus canada this led to the secondary
analysis that is reported here the aim of the study was twofold a to
explain the process of living with advanced cancer to enhance understanding
and inform the ability to effectively support people when time is both
uncertain and short and b to determine the applicability of the theory of
living well with chronic illness to the more specific scenario of advanced
cancer within a spanish sample and if appropriate refine the theory
theory testing refinement and development is recognized as one way to
advance applied disciplines such as nursing swanson  chermack
2013 the study is a secondary analysis of qualitative data originally collected in a
phenomenological study designed to gain a deep understanding of the
essence of the lived experience of having advanced
cancer garca-rueda
2017 the original study was focused on the punctual
narrations of experiences and not on the experience as a
process secondary analysis enables the researcher to
change the aims and focus of the original study heaton 2008 while capitalizing
on the richness of the data oliver et al 2018 that are
collected in qualitative research hinds vogel  clarke-steffen
1997 this study is an analytic expansion according to thornes 2012
classification analysis focused on a new question the
process of living with advanced cancer and used the
method of constant comparison glaser  strauss 1967
secondary analysis is appropriate for clinical inquiry in nursing
particularly with vulnerable populations such as those with advanced
illness because it reduces respondent burden szabo  strang 1997 one of
the limitations of secondary analysis is the appropriateness of the data for
reanalysis hinds et
al 1997 our new question fitted well with the data as the
central concern life with advanced cancer was similar for both studies in
addition during analysis of the primary study the researchers noted how
well the participants lived with their serious life-limiting illness the
approach that was taken here was to reanalyze all of the data set while
attending to a concept the process that seemed to be present but was not
specifically addressed in the primary analysis hinds et al 1997 p 410 the original data were collected by the second author in conversational
interviews with 22 spanish adults purposefully selected from three different
centers promoting variation on sociodemographic characteristics who had
been living with advanced cancer for a minimum of 3 months twelve
participants were men and 10 were women who ranged in age from 45 to 83
years nine were married six single five widowed and two divorced they
lived in urban n  15 or in rural environments
n  7 and most lived with family members four
people lived alone the time interval between the interview and
participants death varied from 22 days to almost 2 years open-ended questions were used to initiate the interview such as would you
describe your life with this disease and the interviewer then followed the
participants stories which were audio-recorded the data for the current
study were comprised of 22 verbatim transcripts of interviews as well as a
vignette of each participants characteristics and story that provided
valuable contextual information to facilitate interpretation of the
transcript constant comparative analysis was conducted by two members of the research
team one researcher had been involved in the original study and is fluently
bilingual in spanish and english which enabled culturally appropriate
translation of the spanish transcripts the other researcher was conversant
in spanish and intimately familiar with the research underpinning the theory
of living well with chronic illness this relationship reduced the
limitations implicit when there is lack of detailed contextual knowledge
about the circumstances of the data collection in this case for both
studies coltart
henwood  shirani 2013 seale 2011 both researchers were familiar with the theory of living well with chronic
illness but set this temporarily aside so as not to impose an analytic
framework on the data the researchers independently read and coded one
transcript at a time and then met to discuss the coding before proceeding to
the next transcript initial open coding was directed by two basic
questions what is this about and what is going on here in relation to
living with advanced cancer this enabled the data to be fractured and
labeled with a name or code that was close to the data ie at a
relatively low level of abstraction the second step of coding focused on
comparing the evolving codes with the theory based on the questions does
this code fit the theory if so how if not what is going on that is
different the transcripts were sequentially coded by hand in this two-step
fashion and through consensus a coding framework was developed by
constantly comparing one piece of data with another both within and between
transcripts as well as with the theory we questioned tested and
challenged if the coding fit with the phases of the original theory and
whether the theory provided an adequate complete explanation for the
process of living with advanced cancer for example it was evident that the
participants living with advanced cancer had difficulties with the diagnosis
and subsequent illness problems in the original theory the first phase is
termed the fight this did not seem to fit what we were learning about the
beginning of the process of living with advanced cancer through careful
constant comparative analysis of the transcripts we came to understand that
these participants experienced a unique phase of difficulty that we called
struggling indeed it was surprising to us that fighting often viewed as
key to living with cancer was minimally evident thus every code needed to
earn its way into the conceptualization of the process theoretic memos were
used to keep track of ideas questions and concerns as the analysis
proceeded and a new core category was identified finally the theory was
confirmed with two of the primary researchers who had not participated in
the secondary analysis they were asked to judge whether the new theory
resonated or fit with the data and whether the theory presented a
credible explanation of the process of living with advanced cancer as a way
to enhance the trustworthiness of the findings as suggested by thorne
1998 ethical issues were considered and the secondary
analysis was approved by the university research ethics board identifier
2016104 this was where each participant began their experience with advanced
cancer by struggling with the diagnosis this was a process of
resisting the presence of advanced cancer in ones life that was
colored by a sudden awareness of the possibility of dying
participants described emotional responses of shock anger anxiety
and fear cognitively they expressed disbelief and uncertainty while
questioning am i dying the first thing you think is that youre
going to die behaviorally this was accompanied by crying shouting
and for some quiet withdrawal 
at first it was worse because i did not understand that this
could have happened to me i felt good    and it was a
very hard blow moreover what i have is a pretty ugly
serious serious tumor    so i was very scared   
i thought i was going to die the day after tomorrow
 for some participants who were aware that something was wrong struggling
began before the diagnosis 
i knew something was wrong with my body for example i could
hardly swallow and its like you do not want to see i
knew something was wrong but i was feeling well
 the duration and intensity of struggling varied among the participants
however there were very few accounts of aggressively fighting the
disease over time participants realized that struggling created
additional life difficulties and was not useful in fact they
understood it was counterproductive to moving forward with living so
they made a pivotal choice to let go of struggling participants
talked about it being the only choice and some even
talked about there being no choice however this realization took
time to evolve they felt stuck in their struggling and needed to
stop which enabled them to move on toward accepting the advanced
cancer in some measure 
well i did not want to believe it im going to have to
mourn and all     so its like that you rebel against
cancer right that you rebel i needed my time to
internalize accept
 as discussed participants chose to stop struggling however struggling
did not end with this first decision instead over time when new
challenges such as treatment failure or difficult illness problems
arose struggling reoccurred for example one participant poignantly
described returning to the struggle when physical suffering increased
and when awareness of dying was more present 
and then i start thinking about things i like to    avoid
   to thinkid rather be dead than be like this i try
to think of things i like to avoid that thought but i
think about it imagine if you were really like that every
day i would rather die than be suffering continuously
like this if there is no hope
 another participant quietly described balancing between awareness
of dying that arose when symptoms increased and
forgetting he has advanced cancer 
i stand it the best that i can inside of course now i give
a little more to my head which before you have cancer
bah it will be cured but now seeing myself with less
strength and less vitality well of course you give more 
  a little more thought but oh many times i forget
that i have cancer eh    so either    laughs no 
  and the truth is that i see that there is a pretty
good progression    now it has stopped again its
stopped by now for the moment then when he cancer
wakes up again until there is no solution and when there
is no solution what are we going to do this is   
this is my life
 again as struggling was revisited it called for a new choice to let go
rather than to be stuck in turmoil which enabled moving forward into
the next phase of accepting accepting was a process of acceding or agreeing to the presence of
advanced cancer in ones life along with the problems it brought to
attain some level of peacefulness about the situation this could only
occur after struggling stopped most participants used the word
accepting and described it as the only choice because it was
viewed as essential to being able to move forward with living 
why has this touched me for that god knows and and i have
accepted it of course i have accepted and also    is
that i see that this is what i have to do what do you get
not accepting it if its there    you have it    
take it to your best silence
 another participant highlighted the hard work of learning how to let go
of struggling and move into accepting 
theres no more struggling im not very much a resigning
person really its not my character but i learned i
guess i do what i can and what i cannot do cannot be
done if it cannot be done there is no other way than
assuming it and taking your best i do not want not to
accept it i dont want that because i would be embittered
all the time
 it is important to recognize that accepting was also a process that was
revisited many times when life got challenging because of such things
as new information or illness problems it is the acceptance of what
you have and what you have to do depth of accepting varied widely
and was navigated over time it involved coming to some level of
agreement about the situation for example that there was a diagnosis
of cancer or that the cancer was not curable or that life might be
shorter or that the person was dying achieving some degree of
accepting was not only influenced by awareness of
dying but also it involved it as illustrated below
participants moved from awareness of the possibility of dying toward
accepting that they were dying 
now i think more but im not thinking all day that im going
to die i mean thats not it because when it has to be
that is    no i do not    i mean its not that i
want to die no please but if it has to arrive it
should arrive
 accepting in turn enabled a degree of peacefulness that contrasted
sharply with the turmoil of struggling accepting involved making
pivotal choices about what to agree to include as part of ones life
for example several participants talked about not fully accepting
that their cancer was incurable instead they hung on to the hope
that even though the cancer was advanced there was still a
possibility of cure one strategy that facilitated accepting was making sense of ones
situation which enabled answering the hard questions of why me or
why now or did i do something wrong or is this my fault the
belief shared by many of participants that their situation came from
god and god would take care of them was particularly helpful in
making sense of their situation in a way that supported accepting
they described being in gods hands for some this was an active
choice to turn toward god while for others it was automatic and a
reflection of a strong ongoing relationship with god accepting
enabled movement into the next phase of living with advanced cancer
rather than against it this was a process of figuring out how to integrate advanced cancer into
ones life which entailed working to accommodate or mitigate illness
problems so their impact on life and living were minimized all the
while taking awareness of dying into account
accepting to some degree enabled the development of a negotiated
coexistence with advanced cancer because struggling against it had
stopped and there was willingness to consider making necessary life
adjustments illness problems were the everyday problems of living
that arose from serious illness for example problems moving
incorporating demanding treatment regimens or difficulty caring for
ones children due to pain or fatigue taking awareness of
dying into account had to do with the possibility of
time being shorter and the need to focus on what mattered most in
life 
what happens is that i think of this as a bit    a little
obstacle race in which i first said to myself ill see
if i get to my daughters communion and then a little
more and then another   
 in some instances living with advanced cancer involved very challenging
priority setting and choices for example one mother of young
children highly valued being a good mother however this meant that
she needed to let go of having her children close by her because she
was not physically able to care for them she needed to let them go to
other family members to receive the care they needed which was
heartbreaking for her but enabled her to hang on to the fact that this
is what a good mother did being a good mother in this way was what
mattered most four strategies facilitated the phase of living with advanced cancer when
time may be short making life adjustments maintaining a positive
attitude normalizing and hoping making life
adjustments occurred to accommodate illness problems or
treatments for example one couple living in a small village found
social interactions on the street with neighbors to be a problem
because of the constant focus of others concerns on the illness the
couple adjusted their life by going to the next village for coffee
allowing them a pleasant outing together where they could attend to
life rather than illness many participants spoke of the need to
balance dependence and independence in making necessary life
adjustments which was a tricky endeavor it was important to accept
assistance but at the same time it was essential to maintain a sense
of being worthwhile and to reduce the perception of being a burden as
one participant explained you depend on someone when you have never
depended on anyone and now need to silence and thats the most
complicated maintaining a positive attitude was often expressed as
choosing to see the positive which facilitated living well this
strategy enabled participants to choose where they put their
attention for example one participant was no longer able to work but
this was quickly dismissed with expressions of gratitude for the small
things that were still possible such as being able to shop for
groceries enjoy a coffee with friends or see beautiful flowers
another participant emphasized it this way there is no need for big
things the little things of everyday life    i depend on those
   well i guess you learn to value things every day right
maintaining a positive attitude was recognized as a powerful influence
on the experience of living with advanced cancer by all the
participants and at the same time many acknowledged that sometimes
it was difficult which caused them to return to struggling from time
to time normalizing was also a focusing strategy like the lens
of a camera participants focused on the normal aspects of their
life setting aside the not normal aspects by ignoring them which
minimized the impact of advanced cancer on everyday life 
i make an effort to continue having a normal life like any
person i achieve it and it gives me strength to say im
normal as my life is like the one of any other person i
feel alive in the sense that i make a normal life as any
person who is not sicki understand that this disease is very present in our society
and i happened to get it and i accept it in the sense of
normalizing it trying to live with the disease not
denying it or not to be angry all day because it has
touched me but try to cope and become a little friend of
what i carry with me    i mean to accept to normalize
it to cope with it
 significant illness problems such as treatments or being unable to work
which could not be put aside were reconstructed as ones new normal
again minimizing their impact some participants even spoke explicitly
about the normality of their own death and dying awareness of
dying constructing this as a natural part of
life 
before i did not think it seemed that you were going to last
forever or you did not have death in mind but now its a
matter of course that you think about that and there are
times when you talk about it normally and other people are
not prepared to speak with that normality
 another participant stated it this way i told the doctor the other day
that i know we were born to die the final strategy was hoping which involved being open
to possibilities this was particularly important when normalizing was
not possible for example during extended hospitalization when
holding onto the hope of feeling better leaving hospital and
resuming enjoyable activities was critical as one participant
explained if one treatment did not work there was the possibility
that another one would i take    strength from myself i choose
to hold onto possible treatments being thankful for treatment
options this piece of the puzzle of living well with advanced cancer and
awareness of dying involved maintaining family
and social relationships such that the ill person experienced being
supported having a sense of being loved and accompanied in the
experience was critical but needed to be balanced with protecting
loved ones from unnecessary suffering participants deeply appreciated
that family members also experienced awareness of
dying and that this generated suffering therefore they
made pivotal choices about how much information to share and with
whom we have called the two characteristics of this phase of sharing
the illness experience as a having someone to count on and b
protecting loved ones table 1 having someone to count on to share the experience was
highly valued and generated immense gratitude as well as a sense of
well-being despite serious illness participants counted on different
people for different things often expanding their circle of support
beyond immediate family the caring physical presence of family was
central to the participant feeling accompanied and did not necessarily
include talking together about the situation as one participant explainedmy life is now calmer my wife is here all day    every
night remains one of my children every night    
which is very nice for me it is bad to have the disease
but it is    very nice things that come with it sharing the experience and having someone to count on often meant
relationships deepened however the participants worried about the
fact that suffering was also shared and they were concerned about
being a burden which led them to protect those they love protecting loved ones was primarily focused on selective
communication that involved carefully choosing what to tell how to
tell and who to tell setting limits aimed at preventing or
alleviating suffering most participants talked about limiting sharing
as a way to protect in the moment and a way to enable loved ones to
continue on over time as illustrated below while awareness
of dying may have been shared with family members
discussion of this awareness was not 
from the first day i knew it was this bad disease what will
i say if i already know what it is    i have not
wanted to ask a lot so they family do not suffer i do
not want them to suffer gets excited because every time
i raise the issue they say forget it forget it thats
not going to come its the only thing    what am i
going to tell him interviewer would you like to talk
about it    it would hurt me to have to say son
im going to die of this it is an uphill    struggle
it would be a hard time    do you get me this is
complicated for me they already know because we are not
fools as i know they know it
 thus participants used two strategies a balancing giving and
withholding information and b relying on themselves as much as
possible such as in problem solving or doing self-care for example
one participant who needed to talk about his illness situation but did
not want to burden his family explained that he turned to others who
were diagnosed with the same disease without fear of increasing
suffering participants were resourceful in their caring for self and
others awareness of dying was a process within the larger
process and as has been discussed influenced all the phases
for example struggling could involve resisting
awareness of dying even if advanced
cancer was accepted participants awareness of
dying changed in relation to two dimensions the
first being time and the second being the position of the
awareness in relation to the finitude of self time was about
whether dying was viewed as close or far away while time was
always uncertain and something that participants struggled
with there were aspects of the experience that brought
awareness of dying into the near rather
than distant future dying took on more immediacy in the
circumstances of increased intensity of illness and
hospitalization however the ability to make meaning of the
situation such as the illness being within gods hands eased
struggling and facilitated accepting how the participants positioned their awareness of
dying determined how it influenced the process of
living well with advanced cancer sometimes the awareness was
foreground occupying their day-to-day thoughts and actions in
this situation some participants struggled against the
awareness while others were motivated to plan for their
families well-being by preparing wills or negotiating child
care envisioning a future for their family that was
characterized by their absence brought awareness of
dying firmly into the foreground the pain and
preoccupation that participants experienced when envisioning
their absence resulted in actively putting the awareness
of dying in the background where thinking about
it could be avoided at least for a time this active and pivotal
choice took energy but enabled a focus on living and living well
as time was perceived to be short and precious finally some
participants seemed to carry the awareness of
dying comfortably beside them which arose with
deep accepting that supported reconstructing life for all the
participants awareness of dying led them to
focus on living well with advanced cancer they were aware that
did not have time to lose the original theory of living well with chronic illness was based on family
interviews and therefore represented the family perspective the study
being reported was based on interviews with individuals diagnosed with
advanced cancer and represents the perspective of the person with advanced
cancer although frequent references were made to family family clearly
played an extremely important role for the participants but the theory does
not reflect a family perspective it is well recognized that the diagnosis
of advanced cancer affects and is affected by family badr 2014 furthermore the
spanish cultural context is relatively homogeneous it would be interesting
in future studies to explore the family perspective and different cultural
contexts to further assess theory applicability and support theoretical
development in addition the data were comprised of a single interview with
each participant we note that olson and colleagues 2001
utilized multiple interviews and found a stage of enduring to die which was
characterized by withdrawal that was not represented in our data therefore
where possible repeated interviews over time may be helpful to further
refine the conceptualization of the process of living well with awareness of
dying the aim of the study was twofold a to explain the process of living with
advanced cancer to enhance understanding and inform the ability to
effectively support people when time is both uncertain and short and b to
determine the applicability of the theory of living well with chronic
illness robinson
2017 to the more specific scenario of advanced cancer within a
spanish sample and if appropriate refine the theory we found that the
theory of living well with chronic illness was indeed useful to
understanding this situation but required refinement to adequately explain
the process of living well with awareness of dying the adjusted theory
illuminates a five-phase iterative process struggling accepting living
with advanced cancer sharing the experience and reconstructing life that
revolves around awareness of dying which captures the
challenges as well as resilience of the participants as they grappled with
life-limiting illness and the desire to live life fully table 1 as walshe et al
2017 have recently suggested the strategies for coping well
with advanced cancer which are the focus of several studies coyle 2006 dale  johnston
2011 lobb
et al 2015 sand olsson  strang 2009
walshe et al
2017 are only generated through engagement in the process of
living with disease which is a bigger story than has previously been put
forward this study offers one explanation of the process of living well
with advanced cancer that addresses the bigger story and enables us to
understand the findings of previous research in a new and integrated
context awareness of dying is the core category around which the
larger process revolves and like each of the phases is a process unto
itself that was revisited over time awareness shifted from initial
recognition of the possibility of dying to ultimately for some accepting
that i am dying awareness of dying centers on the
meaning participants gave to being sick with advanced cancerit meant that
time was uncertain and more limited than they had imagined which colored
the process of living the time between the crisis of diagnosis of advanced
cancer with accompanying knowledge of death and the point of death which
has been termed the living-dying interval may be months to years due to
medical advances colosimo et al 2018 in this context of a prolonged living-dying interval double awareness broadly
refers to the capacity of individuals with advanced cancer to sustain and
negotiate the dialectical tension that arises between remaining engaged in
the world while preparing for impending death colosimo et al 2018 p 1 this double awareness was clearly evident for the participants in our study
whose primary focus was on remaining engaged in the world of the living the
tension that colosimo and colleagues so aptly describe resulted in
struggling and required some degree of accepting to move more fully into
living rather than dying however as these authors point out the tension
was negotiated or navigated and was not resolved based on our findings and
the work of others awareness should not be viewed as a stable attribute
field  copp
1999 mamo
1999 rather it varies over time which challenges the more
traditional idea that awareness that one is dying is relatively stable
glaser 
strauss 1965 our theory contributes to understanding the
nuances and dynamic nature of awareness within the concept of double
awareness furthermore it highlights the centrality of the process within
the larger process of living well with advanced cancer people diagnosed
with advanced cancer are confronted with their mortality in a way that does
not allow for evasions and requires hard work to find a way to live without
a clear future coyle
2006 willig 2015 the heightened concern about living and dying
accompanying a diagnosis of advanced cancer creates an existential plight or
crisis that requires time to adjust bai et al 2015 our findings
address the gap identified in the literature about the ways in which the
dying person engages with the challenges posed by the living-dying interval
mcsherry
2011 willig 2015 the larger process began with struggling and was characterized by discomfort
emotional distress as well as suffering which has also been identified by
research conducted by olson and colleagues 2001 participants were challenged with
uncertainty about the future etkind bristowe bailey selman 
murtagh 2017 shilling starkings jenkins 
fallowfield 2017 but did not get stuck in struggling and give
up as found by olson et
al 2001 or put plans on hold for an extended period to live
one day at a time as found by shilling et al 2017 loss of
control etkind et al
2017 shilling et al 2017 was not a significant focus for the
participants in our study instead they moved past struggling and into
accepting by making an active choice to stop resisting the illness and
awareness of dying accepting entailed coming to some level of agreement about the presence of
advanced cancer in ones life it is important to note that we have used the
term accepting rather than acceptance to emphasize that
accepting is a process that can occur in many forms and in relation to many
facets of the experience such as accepting the diagnosis the worsening of
the situation or dying accepting is embedded in the findings of olson et al
2001 but not explicitly identified as critical to moving past
the initial phase of distress this is one of the contributions of the new
theory through accepting suffering was mediated thompson et al 2009 and our
participants gained a sense of peace that has been identified as an
important contributor to quality of life for people with advanced cancer
bai et al
2015 furthermore accepting was facilitated by spiritually
making meaning of the illness which also positively influences quality of
life bai et al
2015 the importance of accepting is supported by the research
of nipp and colleagues
2017 who found that accepting the reality of the situation
something that many of our participants emphasized was associated with
enhanced quality of life and mood accepting enabled movement into the next phase of living well with advanced
cancer where participants got to know the illness and made adjustments to
accommodate both the illness and illness problems in their daily lives
olson and
colleagues 2001 have conceptualized this phase as enduring to
live keeping going our participants seemed more focused on living a life
than enduring to stay alive by fighting death olson et al 2001 as already
noted there was very little evidence of fighting in our data although
participants did return to struggling from time to time when significant
challenges arose so this phase may be more akin to stage 5 of the illness
constellation model learning to live with the altered self the importance
of living a meaningful and productive life now has been
identified as critical for people with advanced cancer cottingham et al
2018 these researchers term it living in the face of death
maintaining a positive attitude one of the strategies that participants
emphasized is akin to positive reframing or looking for something good in
the situation which has been associated with enhanced quality of life and
mood nipp et al
2017 this supports the notion that the participants in this
study were indeed living well with advanced cancer and awareness of
dying sharing the illness experience comprised the next phase here participants
highlighted the importance of family relationships which have been linked
to a sense of belonging and enhanced quality of life nipp et al 2017 peoples nissen brandt
 la cour 2018 social belonging is nurtured through
shared emotional connections and the ability to contribute to the lives of
others peoples et al
2018 both highly valued by participants shilling and colleagues
2017 noted that people with advanced cancer and their family
caregivers seldom discussed their concerns about an uncertain future with
each other see also olson et al 2001 our theory offers one way to make sense
of this phenomenon at least from the perspective of the person with
advanced cancerthat constraining conversation is protective and aimed at
limiting suffering this challenges the assumption that complete open
awareness is the most adequate way of dealing with awareness of dying glaser  strauss
1965 lack of open awareness has been perceived as an
indication of nonacceptance thompson et al 2009 as a
barrier to adequate planning of dying careers seale addington-hall  mccarthy
1997 and as a negative influence on the quality of life of
the dying person lokker van zuylen veerbeek van der rijt  van der heide
2012 however timmermans 1994 challenged the
original concept of open awareness proposing a subcategorizing to include
a suspended open awareness where the patient or family has heard
information about the terminal condition but do not believe it b
uncertain open awareness where information is given about the terminal
illness but it is qualified by expressions of uncertainty to make room for
hope and c active open awareness where the patient and family understand
the situation fully we propose that perhaps rather than these being
different kinds of awareness they represent different phases of awareness
that occur over time and may be revisited limited sharing enabled the
participants to balance the need to be supported and the need to protect
loved ones people with advanced cancer may need assistance achieving a
supportive balance between communicating and protecting that does not
perpetuate a conspiracy of silence and also respects varying needs within
the family the next phase in the theory is reconstructing life where life and living fully
in the moment was foreground and illness as well as awareness of
dying was background participants experienced joy and beauty
in moments of being fully present to life and the tension inherent in the
living-dying interval was temporarily suspended these five phases of living
well with advanced cancer were revisited as illness progression and
awareness of dying along with uncertain time shaped
the process of living with advanced cancer this study offers an integrative explanatory theory of living with dying and
refines the theory of living well with chronic illness the healing process
of moving on robinson
2017 it is clear that in both chronic illness and advanced
cancer living well involves an iterative process that is revisited over
time one difference is that quite quickly the participants with advanced
cancer chose to let go of struggling to move into accepting because they
experienced the negative consequences of resisting a situation that could
not be changed resisting got in the way of living which became more urgent
in the context of awareness of dying and knowledge that
time might be short the other phases of living well are similar for
advanced cancer including the same underlying ideas but with nuances in
the case of the people with advanced cancer accepting entailed making space
for the awareness of dying which was a new core category
and not a facet of the original theory current study participants did not
identify themselves and were not selected based on the idea of living well
instead the data supported the idea that the participants wanted to live
and to live well awareness of dying underpinned moving on
toward living a life rather than living an illness it may seem incredible
from the perspective of someone who is not in this situation how well these
people lived with advanced cancer but as one of the participants said
its not that im a brave ive never been they helped us understand that
living with advanced cancer involved a process requiring deep engagement
time and effortand that it is indeed possible to live well even if it is
in moments several things stand out in terms of potential implications for practice it is
evident that accepting is key to moving forward in the process of living
well with advanced cancer it may be tempting to promote accepting and to
judge lack of accepting negatively however accepting takes time and as
has been explained can take many forms furthermore it is not stable over
time it is conceivable that prematurely focusing on accepting might
interfere with building a supportive therapeutic alliance careful
assessment of where the ill person is in the process based on an
understanding of the phases and levels of awareness will likely be most
useful to effective therapeutic alignment maintaining a positive attitude eg finding the positive in the situation
was a helpful strategy for living well and should not be viewed as an
indication of lack of awareness of dying the participants
in this study worked hard to live a life rather than live an illness all
the while being aware of dying so the implication here is to support the
positive it has been found that hoping for a cure when cancer is advanced
is also not evidence of lack of awarenessit can be a choice in focusing on
positive possibilities robinson 2012 it also must be noted that awareness of dying was pervasive
and was something that participants were willing and able to discuss early
introduction of palliative care temel et al 2010 along with
advance care planning bernacki  block 2014 has been shown to enhance quality
of life for people with advanced cancer awareness of dying
and willingness to discuss it will likely facilitate acceptance of
palliative care and serious illness conversations finally the importance of family love and support cannot be underestimated
this should be assessed and supported in particular people with advanced
cancer may need assistance balancing the sharing and withholding of
information in relation to their desire to protect loved ones from
suffering  avian preparedness simulations of bird diseases and reverse scenarios of extinction in hong kong taiwan and singapore frdric keck   in the last twenty years techniques of simulation have multiplied in the world of disaster management revet 2013 the stated objective of these exercises is to rehearse a disaster situation in order to better prepare for it armstrong 2012 actors in a simulation treat the expected disaster as if it had happened in order to immerse themselves in the reality it should produce seligman weller puett  simon 2008 as such simulations offer opportunities for social anthropology to combine science and technology studies with the ethnography of rituals enacting the imaginary of coming catastrophes simulation creates an extraordinary setting for performances separated from ordinary life two kinds of simulation can be distinguished desktop or tabletop exercises relying on computer programs and occurring indoors and realground or fullscale drills involving actors in an outdoor setting both techniques use worstcase scenarios written by disastermanagement professionals trained in fiction writing if simulation is a regular activity for scientists working on computers it also shapes the stage of extraordinary performances for ordinary citizens involved in drills sismondo 1999 however the distinction between these two forms of simulation is not between reality and fiction since those who write scenarios for these two kinds of simulation constantly play on the shift between virtual and actual they rely on the memory of previous catastrophes and the anticipation of future disasters to inform a realistic engagement in the present of the simulation if scenarios are considered as shared forms or schemes of action simulations can be described as ritual performances displaying relations between humans and nonhumans in extraordinary settings this article starts from observed simulations of an avian influenza pandemic in china influenza viruses emerging from birds have been considered as potentially causing future pandemics because birds particularly waterfowl in south china have been identified as the reservoir in which flu viruses mutate before spreading successfully between humans shortridge  stuartharris 1982 among other techniques such as early warning systems and stockpiling vaccines preparing for the next pandemics therefore involves simulating the transmission of pathogens from birds to humans caduff 2015 lakoff 2007 arguing that a human pandemic is a symmetrical threat to the extinction of a bird species i then consider another bird disease for which chinese experts organize simulations botulism this disease which doesnt affect humans is considered a potential disaster for blackfaced spoonbills because it kills migratory birds when they concentrate in wetlands on their flyways wilson 2010 76 bringing together simulations of avian influenza and botulism this article questions the ethnography of simulation from the perspective of animal studies how does preparedness transform relations between humans and birds what does it mean to include birds and more generally animals in exercises simulating coming disasters how does the description of animals as victims of disasters transform them into actors of simulations keck  ticktin 2015 i will show that animals become in a paradoxical way passive actors when they carry the signs of diseases that can potentially affect humans techniques of preparedness have been included in the set of tools for global health initiatives either in humanitarian actions or in biosecurity interventions which have shaped contemporary affects and anticipations of the future adams murphy  clarke 2009 lakoff 2010 global health has been extended to animals and the environment  an approach called one world one health  thus requiring an interspecies approach towards the ethical issues involved hinchliffe 2015 one of the most debated questions in the anthropology of pandemic preparedness is the adequacy of the notion of sacrifice to describe how some populations are separated from others and killed or left to die for the sake of public health in exercises of triage some patients are prioritized over others through the framework of urgency nguyen 2010 redfield 2013 in the management of human populations migrant workers are considered as a threat by educated experts using viral connectivity as a metaphor of modernity macphail 2014 mason 2016 in the management of zoonotic pathogens the notion of sacrifice seems even more obvious since animals are massively killed to eradicate the reservoir of emerging infectious diseases and in the management of wild animals some individuals are sacrificed to protect the species van dooren 2014 other descriptions however have been proposed of the entangled relations between animals and humans in the hotspots or sentinel devices where emerging pathogens connect them in productive ways brown  kelly 2014 fearnley 2015 keck  lakoff 2013 lezaun  porter 2015 lowe 2010 while sacrifice separates some living beings from others to eradicate pathogens sentinels instantiate relations between living beings through the anticipation of future pathogens simulations of bird diseases shift perspectives between humans and animals through the use of fiction to support this argument i rely on the anthropology of hunting societies by contrast with pastoral societies while public health relies on pastoral techniques of power combining sacrifice and surveillance to contain the threats coming from outside in a population foucault 1981 the one world one health approach uses techniques from birdwatchers and wildlife managers to monitor data about changing relations between humans and animals1 whereas pastoral techniques are asymmetrical relying on the pastors superior gaze over the flock manifested by sacrifice cynegetic techniques are symmetrical as hunters and prey constantly change perspectives when displayed in rituals chamayou 2012 most analyses of simulation have placed it in a genealogy starting with the cold war using notions of ritual performance and play davis 2007 galison 1997 gusterson 1996 lakoff 2007 masco 2006 but they dont take the perspective of animals because they consider simulations as pastoral techniques of biopower therefore bypassing what the anthropology of hunting societies shows about ritual action in this article i define a cynegetic practice of simulation that is always mixed with forms of planning combining two different forms of anticipation i call avian preparedness this mix of cynegetic becominganimal and pastoralist care for populations initiated by microbiologists considered both as virus hunters perrey 2012 and as microbe farmers caduff 2015 76 to analyse simulations of bird diseases i combine the notion of reverse scenario schull 2015 with the notion of reflexive ritual pandemic or extinction scenarios i argue connect humans and animals in realistic ways to play on the imagination of what could happen if a pathogen emerges using animal reservoirs as mirrors in which anxieties about pandemics are reflected humans exchange their perspectives with animals in an imagined future where their relations are reversed simulations can thus be situated in an anthropological space between play and ritual roberte hamayon 2015 97 has called simulation the way shamans in mongolian hunting societies imitate the movements of animals in a ritualized setting to prepare for the uncertainties of hunting in an article entitled dissimulation and simulation as forms of religious reflexivity michael houseman proposes to move away from a definition of ritual as a collective action based on a shared secret to study the emergent properties of ritual simulation generally 2002 77 he draws on two cases taken from hunting societies of central africa one in which male novices are symbolically killed and the other in which a goat is actually sacrificed he asks how do participants come to believe in a series of speeches and actions  the novices death and the goats consent to sacrifice  that are obviously false he answers that ritual action creates an extraordinary space of reflexivity with regard to the ordinary relations that constitute the group while the ritual for male novices is a dissimulation in which the relations between initiated and uninitiated are constantly reversed in such a way that the moment of death becomes uncertain the ritual of goat sacrifice says houseman is a simulation of consent in which the silencing of the goat through the consumption of herbs mimics the consent of male hunters to their initiation the ritual is reflexive in the sense that it stages the condition of the ritual itself  the secrecy known by initiators and unknown by the initiated  through the manipulations of daily relations between humans and nonhumans whose asymmetries are reflected as in a mirror similarly i suggest that we call reverse scenarios the ritual performances by which simulators reflect playfully on the relations between humans and birds in the imagination of a disease that could affect them both simulations i argue are far more than mere rehearsals of a pandemic drama they are catalysts in the transformation of humannonhuman relations into asymmetrical biopolitical and ontological processes to support this argument i will describe three ethnographic cases in hong kong taiwan and singapore these three territories have competed at the global level since the sars crisis in 2003 to be the best sentinel posts where pandemic pathogens coming from china can be detected abraham 2007 as hubs for the intense circulation of persons and commodities in asia but also as repositories of chinese traditional relations between humans and birds they have prepared for the catastrophic effects of a bird flu outbreak but while the hong kong government regularly culls its poultry and sends warning signals from the chinese border taiwan and singapore rarely had to cull their poultry and rather invested in scenarios for the simulation of pandemic taiwan on the other side shares with hong kong the monitoring of blackfaced spoonbills considered as one of asias most threatened and charismatic species this article thus connects the rationalities of preparedness with the economies of humananimal relations in three different but interconnected settings it will examine indoor and outdoor simulations of avian influenza in singapore and hong kong and compare them with simulations of botulism in taiwan however my analysis is not restricted to simulations of bird diseases in east asia but highlights general traits of disaster simulation as a technique of preparedness by looking at the relations between humans and birds in these three contexts through their common exposure to emerging pathogens this article also analyses the relations between national states in asia as they have to manage a common disaster since simulations of bird diseases connect relations at different scales from the microbiological to the biopolitical this article combines science studies ethnography of rituals and political economy through an anthropology of morethanhuman relations helmreich  kirksey 2010 kohn 2013 sagan 2011 in july 2013 i was visiting gavin smith who was then an associate professor at the duke graduate medical school of the national university of singapore nus i had known gavin in hong kong while he was working in the state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases at the department of microbiology of the university of hong kong born in australia gavin had studied botany and ecology at the university of melbourne and then moved to hong kong for a phd in molecular systematics gavin had first analysed the genome of fungi then of the sars coronavirus then of bird flu viruses he described this development of his research as a reduction of the size of the living beings he was sequencing and a refinement of the data and results he could produce gavin and his team relied strongly on the collaboration between the state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases and the university of shantou this university had been created by the hong kong tycoon li kashing who opened it in 1990 in his native guangdong with the approval and administrative support of the chinese authorities it provided the state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases with samples collected in poultry markets in fujian province thus offering a realtime surveillance of influenza strains emerging in this epicentre of pandemic flu but after the publications of gavins team showed the role of the chinese poultry industry in the emergence of these new strains smith et al 2006 the guangdong authorities had severely restricted hong kong virologists access to these samples gavin then moved to singapore in 2012 where he had more freedom to continue his fundamental research and more funding from international institutions he had shifted from the sentinel post where the new strains of avian influenza emerged such as the h5n1 virus in 1997 keck 2010 to a place where he could simulate the evolution of flu viruses in hightech computers there was no need to be close to the site where viruses emerge he explained to me as he could simulate viral emergence through the use of genetic data banks singapore was then considered the new pole of excellence for biological research the small citystate founded by lee kwan yew in 1965 at the end of the malay peninsula had converted its industrial and financial power owing to its position on the commercial trade routes between east and west into an economy of knowledge and information with high investment in biotechnologies ong 2010 2016 the nus graduate medical school was located just next to the ministry of health and the singapore general hospital in the centre of the city it had been created in 2005 to train hightech medical leaders on the model of the duke university school of medicine in north carolina the programme in emerging infectious diseases for which gavin had been hired to work was headed by wang linfa who was also leading a team on bat viruses at the australian animal health laboratory in geelong his programme was running projects for the surveillance of emerging infectious diseases particularly influenza and other respiratory diseases in singapore and the rest of southeast asia gavins career took a meaningful turn when his team published two major articles at the height of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic the first one entitled dating the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses was published just after the emergence of the h1n1 virus in mexico in april 2009 it showed that genetic components of the 1918 h1n1 pandemic virus circulated among pigs and humans as early as 1911 thus challenging the commonly held view that spanish flu jumped from birds to humans in 1918 in the context of the new h1n1 swine flu this article stressed the need for intensified surveillance of pigs to detect emerging flu viruses before they become pandemic if future pandemics arise in this manner gavin and his team concluded this interval may provide the best opportunity for health authorities to intervene to mitigate the effects of a pandemic or even to abort its emergence smith bahl vijaykrishna et al 2009 11712 this conclusion was immediately reinforced by gavins teams second publication entitled origins and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 swineorigin h1n1 influenza a epidemic published in nature at the end of 2009 in which they showed that a twin virus bearing the same genetic sequence as the pandemic h1n1 had been identified in pigs in hong kong in 2004 gavins conclusion was not that the asian swine industry was to blame for the emergence of h1n1 but that there was a better surveillance of the animal reservoir for influenza viruses waterfowl and pigs in hong kong than in the united states the teams paper ended despite widespread influenza surveillance in humans the lack of systematic swine surveillance allowed for the undetected persistence and evolution of this potentially pandemic strain for many years smith vijaykrishna bahl et al 2009 1125 in july 2009 i took a course at the hong kong university pasteur research centre in bioinformatics during which gavin and his team partners vijay and justin explained to virology students how to obtain this kind of result bioinformatics is a method to analyse the massive amount of biological data available on the web  particularly through the website of the us national center for biotechnology information genbank  with the help of dedicated software this software called blast basic local alignment search tool or msa multiple sequence analysis calculates the probability that genetic sequences derive from one another such a procedure called alignment aims at approximating the real descent relationships between viruses through a calculation of the optimal tree of life based on the darwinian hypothesis that life expands in a rational manner to maximize fitness capacities mackenzie 2003 for gavin and his team however bioinformatics was not only about probability calculation in the construction of a phylogenetic tree biological knowledge is necessary because some correlations proposed by the computer make no sense in an evolutionary perspective as they can be due to errors in sequencing or genetic deletion to decide which correlations to take into account and which to consider as irrelevant virologists use other software such as bootstrap jukes cantor or tamura providing the probability of correlations based on a given scenario as for other techniques of preparedness probability is not enough to simulate a coming disaster it requires a work of imagination lakoff 2007 peter galison has shown that computer simulation emerged in the field of particle physics as a subculture among experimenters and theoreticians under the monte carlo programme funded by nasa in the 1960s to simulate a nuclear explosion simulation replaces experimentation when the data needed for the theory are too numerous and complex to be processed with traditional instruments creating a trading zone in which different professional groups share a common language or pidgin galison 1997 50 similarly bioinformatics produces new images shared by microbiologists computer scientists and public health executives in the anticipation of epidemics software such as bootstrap can be considered as an accessory or decoy to trap the live bird viruses through the sequences that have been stored in genbank gavin opened the course with a simulation of the work his team had done a few months before on the h1n1 virus presented as a desktop exercise of what to do when a new virus emerges imagine weve received this new sequence from atlanta paste it to blast and take as much information as possible make a tree so big you can never print it on a sheet of paper it will be good starting material before reducing the inquiry gavin and his team explained that in contrast to other virologists working on flu viruses they had decided to use the eight segments of the viruss rna2 not just the two segments that shape the h and n proteins usually considered to be the most significant markers of antigen evolution they could thus build eight parallel evolutionary trees which by their similarities gave an indication of the real evolution of the whole flu virus there was nothing secret in the images of pandemic viruses built by these microbiologists unlike simulations of nuclear explosions built indoors by particle physicists gusterson 1996 all the phylogenetic trees produced by gavin and his team were publicly available on websites drawing back the molecular clock based on the estimated kinship relations between viruses virologists could see the branches where evolutionary ruptures occur and pathogens jump from one species to another such as the emergence of the h1n1 pandemic in 1918 and 2009 following continuities between genetic sequences they exhibited the discontinuities between evolutionary niches gavin said that when a virus jumps from one species to another it inaugurates a new set of lines as the immunity pressure of the environment creates an evolutionary bottleneck in which this mutation can replicate drawing back these lines then lead him to what he named the most recent common ancestor i love those trees he added the amount of information provided in a single image was correlated to the unity of an evolutionary hypothesis drawing this information back to a common ancestor historians of science have shown the power of evolutionary trees in the books through which darwinism came to be accepted as a new worldview bredekamp 2005 helmreich 2009 and their reframing in global health under the notion of an animal reservoir in which emerging pathogens spill over from animals to humans king 2002 lynteris 2017 but i was mostly intrigued by the way gavin and his team turned sequences into images through an anticipatory mode of reasoning that i call reverse scenario natasha schull proposes the term in her work with online gamblers to describe the way they cope with the necessarily uncertain futures of any hand by returning them to a point in the past and confronting them with a branching diversity of outcomes that might have emerged from it 2015 56 it applies well to the practices of virus hunters who use reverse engineering to reconstruct potentially pandemic pathogens such as the 1918 h1n1 virus caduff 2015 105 napier 2003 2 just as a gambler speculates how much he could have won if he had played this or that card gavin imagines what could have happened if the h1n1 virus had been detected in pigs prior to 1918 or 2009 virus sequencing allows him to trace potential connections between birds pigs and humans and to imagine other futures of crossspecies transmission yet we dont know how birds and pigs are actually involved in the construction of pandemic scenarios because we dont see how virologists take virus samples from birds we thus need to turn from desktop simulations to realground exercises organized by public health officials and birdwatchers after my visit to gavin smith at nus duke graduate medical school i went to a nearby building to meet jeffery cutter at the singapore ministry of health trained as an epidemiologist jeffery cutter was the director of the communicable diseases division of the ministry of health coordinating preparedness for emerging infectious diseases in singapore there are 50 million passengers every year at singapore changi airport he told me so there is a high probability that emerging infectious diseases will come to singapore we need to be prepared during the sars crisis in 2003 he said 238 people were infected by the new coronavirus with thirtythree deaths they were all treated at the tan tock seng hospital which had been designated by the government as an isolation hospital for sars patients at the peak of the crisis all schools in the country were closed for ten days and home quarantine was established for more than 6000 people known to have come into close contact with a sarsinfected person prime minister goh chok tong said publicly that sars could possibly become the worst crisis singapore had faced since independence when a journalist asked him if he was being alarmist goh responded well i think im being realistic because we do not quite know how this will develop this is a global problem and we are at the early stage of the disease zolli 2012 jeffery cutter introduced me to yoong cheong wong head of the emergency preparedness  response division at the ministry of health mr wong was a former policeman in charge of organizing exercises for emerging infectious diseases in hospitals the first national exercise for influenza in singapore was organized in 2006 after the first cases of humantohuman transmission of h5n1 were suspected in thailand called sparrowhawk it was organized in two stages a tabletop discussion and assessment of pandemic response plans among six hospitals in the country between april and june and a practical exercise on 212 july in which the six designated hospitals had to manage potential patients and share information about their circulation mr wong explained that a thousand people were involved in the realground drill mostly volunteers from grassroots organizations and nurses from training institutions while patients moved from one hospital to another some hospitals assessed the behaviour of others and gradually raised the number of casualties the main question according to mr wong was if there are 200 casualties in one hospital which resources do they need the goal of these exercises is officially the identification of unplanned gaps in coordination between the actors who manage epidemics but the actual criticism of planners most often focuses on the drills lack of realism we try our best to do it as real as possible said mr wong but everyone knew it was just an exercise to explain the improvement between sparrowhawk exercises in 2006 and 2008 in singapore an official leaflet notes the exercises were activated unannounced to inject greater realism the ministry of health emergency medical staff turned up without prior justification at the general ward of the exercise hospital and triggered the simulated case of human infection with avian influenza unsic 2008 56 realism in this case came from the fact that people were surprised and yet they knew that they were faking the epidemic what does it mean for a simulation to be realistic here the notion of reverse scenario is useful just as microbiologists imagine what could have happened if viruses had been stopped in their animal reservoir public health planners imagine what would happen if contagious patients were stopped before entering hospitals but in both cases death is not performed in the scenario by contrast another type of exercise conducted in singapore was very real on 17 july 2013 the agriculture and veterinary authority ava organized a drill in one of the poultry slaughterhouses on the border with malaysia there are no authorized poultry farms on the territory and only five chicken farms for eggs which constrains singapore to import and slaughter 40 million live chickens from malaysia every year malaysian farmers need to be licensed by the ava to import their poultry to singapore and are always regarded with suspicion by border authorities and yet no case of h5n1 has been found in singapore i was able to watch the drill online because it was streamed widely on a number of websites the name exercise gallus vii referred to the fact that it was the seventh avian influenza exercise conducted by the ava since 2002 it took place in the biggest of the ten slaughterhouses in singapore run by soonly food processing industry which processed 80000 chickens daily providing 25 per cent of the fresh chicken meat in singapore asia one 2013 the scenario for the exercise was the following 1500 chickens had been infected with h5n1 and should be killed and destroyed according to emergency response plans about 100 employees of the slaughterhouse mostly indians had to be screened for their temperature take an antiviral drug and then wear personal protective equipment boots cap mask glasses gloves on the back of which their name was written the affected chickens were placed in green cages on belts immersed in water and electrocuted their cadavers were then placed inside two layers of biohazard bags to be incinerated dr yap him ho director of the quarantine and inspection group declared on television to make sure that ava is prepared for any incursion the main thing we want to do for this exercise is to train our officers as well as the other parties that are involved in the contingency planning to be familiar with the steps of the procedures straits times 2013 although much could be said on the paternalistic ethnic gender class and age divides that structured these exercises i want to focus on the distinction between humans and animals while the simulation at the clinic was animated by a sense of urgency and scarcity of resources confronted with a fake pandemic the simulation at the slaughterhouse was quietly following the procedures in actually killing false positive chickens i was also intrigued by the fact that while the hong kong government organized many such exercises on the human side they had never simulated bird flu in poultry farms because outbreaks occurred regularly in farms on its territory while singapore authorities actually killed poultry for a disease that remained virtual hong kong authorities simulated the transmission of bird flu from chickens to humans because it was already circulating among birds although avian influenza kills birds as well as humans the reverse scenario of a pandemic represents massive death in a different mode for humans and for birds depending on past experiences of pathogens crossing borders between species i now turn to the simulation of bird flu in hong kong on 13 november 2006 hong kong coordinated a desktop exercise called great wall which simulated a virtual cluster of three human infections with h5n1 in a family returning to hong kong and macau after their visit to a poultry market in mainland china the goal of the exercise was to synchronize the three systems of pandemic preparedness to engender an effective response among them unsic 2008 18 the exercise opened with a ceremony attended by the viceminister of the chinese ministry of health wang longde it was considered as a success in creating good relations between mainland china and the former british and portuguese colonies while the sars coronavirus had caused a division between china and the former colonies in 2003 because of beijings reluctance to share information abraham 2007 great wall unified the country against an imagined enemy pandemic avian influenza but it instantiated ruptures between humans and birds in january 2009 after long discussions with the centre for health protection i was allowed to participate in an exercise in a hong kong hospital the centre for health protection was created by the department of health after the sars crisis to anticipate outbreaks similar to sars through active surveillance and communication leung  baconshone 2006 within this centre the emergency response branch headed by a police officer was in charge of writing scenarios and organizing simulations twice a year a field exercise was held in hong kong with observers from china and overseas bearing the name of natural entities maple cypress chestnut redwood eagle jadeite and so on there was no epidemic simulation in hong kong in 2009 because the emergency response branch considered the management of the h1n1 virus in the spring and autumn to be a reallife exercise exercise redwood took place in the clinic of shau kei wan located in the workingclass district of hong kong island the following scenario was distributed to the participants and posted at major public buildings confirmed human cases of bird flu had been reported in hong kongs neighbouring countries as well as a rising trend in patient attendance with influenzalike illness in hong kong hospitals live poultry had tested positive for avian influenza in hong kongs markets and were then culled at farms and markets a member of the staff participating in the culling was reported to carry the h5n1 virus as was an 8yearold boy who had played with live poultry four clinics were designated in hong kong for triage only the final part of the scenario was held in shau kei wan the first part was meant to provide a plausible context the official purpose of the simulation was to coordinate hospital services in the management of patients with influenzalike illness eighty actors playing patients came in through the front door of the hospital and were sent to different departments depending on their symptoms pulmonary conditions tuberculosis etc twenty players treated them in the services and two simulators communicated with other hospitals on a hotline those who were diagnosed with h5n1 were evacuated by ambulance through the back door of the hospital where the media took pictures the head of the department of health gave a press conference after visiting the hospital but the journalists asked him about new bacteria found in a private jacuzzi not about the exercise itself the drills success was not questioned it was successful because it had been held the scenario was designed in such a way that no surprising event could happen the only reality that came up was the bacteria in the jacuzzi not the virus in bird markets all the actors i saw looked young and relaxed wearing blue caps and casual clothes their symptoms were described on a tag they wore around their necks indicating their name address nationality sex and age these cards were red or green depending on whether they had bird flu or only influenzalike symptoms they did not have to fake illness their only role was to move to the designated departments in another exercise organized by the centre for health protection a plane was evacuated because a patient had been found with influenzalike symptoms those who sat next to the patient received a red tag and those who sat at a good distance received a yellow tag what was remarkable in exercise redwood was the absence of tension or anxiety in the medical staffs behaviour although humanitarian ngos consider triage to be an ethical issue when a higher number of patients is met with limited resources nguyen 2010 redfield 2013 the medical staff of the shau kei wan clinic only separated symptomatic and asymptomatic patients to avoid the spread of the disease the tension of the situation  who would be considered a spreader who would receive treatment first  was delegated to objects tags and caps people were reduced to bearers of signs that circulated fluidly in the hospital under the gaze of the media while the medical staff of the hospital played their own role the actors playing patients with influenzalike illness came from a humanitarian association the auxiliary medical service ams this association created in 1950 to deal with the influx of chinese refugees was registered in 1983 under the security department of the hong kong government its 4000 members are trained for disaster management in hong kong and outside one of them described it to me as afterwork entertainment a place to meet other singles it is an elite association where similar people express and share moral values during their own exercises performed every month they train how to rescue victims of car accidents or fires they simulate heartbeats on dummies with fake hearts patients cannot fake the heart rate or the respiratory rhythm said the organizer so they have tags tags have an indirect realistic effect while dummies can actually simulate the heartbeat of an injured victim members of the ams who describe their own exercises as significant moments in the life of the association were frustrated by exercise redwood from their perspective there is a sharp difference between regular accident rescue exercises and extraordinary epidemic evacuation drills that coordinate several departments one of the actors said he felt passive playing on the ambivalence of the term
as we had experienced sars in 2003 we all can forecast how we would behave in another similar situation like avian flu being a citizen we are quite passive i believe that we should follow the guidelines and the governments advice so as to prevent ourselves from getting affected but in the exercise we were being passive3

 it can be said consequently that when they simulate patients in an epidemic exercise members of the ams literally act as if they were dummies there is thus a fundamental distinction in the realground exercises between actors and players while actors are passive reduced to the objects that act or speak for them players and simulators introduce uncertainty by the way they combine these objects in the scenario if actors have to appear real to produce good images in the media the simulators play on the fictional possibilities of the scenario the distinction between simulators and actors in realground simulations runs parallel to the distinction between virologists and public health planners in desktop exercises while actors and planners only follow their roles in the exercise simulators and virologists explore the potentialities of reverse scenarios another example shows how realground exercises combine the virtual and the actual as desktop simulation does in an exercise called jadeite organized in january 2007 members of the emergency response branch were simulating the evacuation of a residential building on computers and the scenario specified that they had to evacuate the simulation room to a fallback room the simulation room from which the vulnerability of vital infrastructures in hong kong was virtually assessed thus came to be seen itself as a material environment under threat the head of the emergency response branch who described this exercise to me said it was more fun than a movie as if images had suddenly burst through the screen in this reversal of the scenario simulators became actors and fiction reality neither a ritual performance nor a scientific model of prediction the simulation was for this former policeman a game he enjoyed playing animals take part in simulations in a general category that can be called passive actors if there was no need to simulate the culling of poultry because it regularly happened in hong kong markets simulators for the evacuation of residential buildings in hong kong planned that some residents were accompanied by pets that should be handled with care by the agriculture department because their reaction to the evacuation was unknown just as simulators of the evacuation of planes planned how to handle reluctant potential patients the real opposition in simulations is thus not between humans and animals but between poultry handled as commodities that can be destroyed ordinary citizens and pets considered as passive actors that should be handled with care and simulators changing the rules of the game more than sharp ontological distinctions between fiction and reality or between animals and humans there is a virtual gradient of actors in the anticipation of massive death produced by simulation the use of accessories and animals in simulations of disasters is indeed an essential part of their realism tracy davis has shown that people coming from the world of theatre were hired by cold war experts to implement scenarios of nuclear blast through the design of accessories simulation designers were therefore less concerned with the participation of the public than with the realism of the objects after an exercise organized in coventry in 1954 prime minister winston churchill complained about the high degree of realism of the simulations which he considered a waste of public money who thought of the bloodstained old woman with the birdcage i hope there is not going to be any more of this sort of thing at government expense quoted in davis 2007 51 women were the main targets of civil defence after the second world war as they had been the targets of public health campaigns against microbes at the beginning of the twentieth century because they were in charge of the household with children and pets animals were portrayed as good accessories of nuclear blast simulations not only because they were good laboratory models masco 2006 305 but also because they were part of a familiar landscape disrupted by an extraordinary event the extraordinary context of the simulation thus provides the opportunity to display a series of apparent contradictions people become objects animals become people actors turn out to be passive fiction enters into reality this capacity to displace oppositions in an extraordinary context through reverse scenarios brings simulations close to rituals however if simulations can be considered as rituals of public health administration justifying the work of virus hunters who sound the alarm about future pandemics it doesnt mean that there is a secret worldview shared by simulators gusterson 1996 rather simulations display openly contradictions that public health administrations have to solve often by the use of sacrifice in operations of culling of infected poultry or triage of suspected patients they create a tension between two techniques of power those of biologists and simulators who follow viruses as they mutate between species which i describe as cynegetic and those of public health officials who have to protect some populations against others which i call pastoral to support this hypothesis i will now turn to simulations organized by birdwatchers can we say that birdwatchers take the perspectives of threatened wild birds as virologists take the perspective of poultry infected with flu viruses how do humans in charge of the protection of animals cope with the oppositions we have seen in reverse scenarios of pandemics birdwatchers have been involved in the surveillance of the avian reservoir of influenza viruses public health and agriculture authorities realized that they could not follow the mutations of flu viruses in wild birds and collaborated with birdwatching associations to monitor potential cases in wild bird reserves and natural environments in hong kong and taiwan birdwatching practices a privilege of british and american expatriates until the 1980s have become popular among chinese middle classes with the development of a leisure society the commercialization of camera equipment and the awareness of the vulnerability of the environment choy 2011 birdwatching has taken the form of a citizen science with the opening of websites where amateurs post their observations and experts turn them into statistical data every year bird races offer opportunities for birdwatchers to compete in observing the highest number of birds on a designated territory thus birdwatching practices like simulations have virtual and actual aspects orientated by the imagination of a disaster the extinction of bird species in hong kong and taiwan the introduction of birdwatching was linked to techniques of preparedness and concerns for biosecurity the main wild bird reserve in hong kong mai po is situated on the estuary of the pearl river delta and on the border with mainland china after 1949 british officers used to sit there with their binoculars to trace chinese refugees or to signal an attack by the chinese army and took this opportunity to inventory the more than 500 bird species in hong kong hong kong and taiwan were part of the migratory animal pathological survey a programme of surveillance of pathogens carried by birds particularly japanese encephalitis through this programme british and american ornithologists trained chinese workers to band birds and collect samples transforming birds into data and following the evolution of their numbers has been a way to simulate threats coming from birds since the second world war keck 2015 methods derived from us wildlife management have changed the perception of birds in the last twenty years in taiwan and hong kong with the introduction of the concept of the flyway species that fly from japan and korea to australia along what came to be called the east asianaustralian flyway have been shown to have declined owing to the urbanization and development of the chinese coast climate change is also supposed to damage the places where wild birds feed and roost on their migratory routes among the bird species affected by these changes one of the most charismatic is the blackfaced spoonbill a waterbird breeding in japan and korea in the summer and migrating to south china in the winter in the 1990s the number of these birds was estimated to be 2000 but thanks to the conservation efforts shared by the countries to which they migrate it increased to 3000 at the end of the 2000s wetlands have been developed in hong kong taiwan and fujian as shelters on their flyways images of spoonbills abound in schools environmental agencies and natural reserves often portrayed as funny birds smiling to the public to understand how reverse scenarios of disasters enter the management of spoonbills in china we have to go beyond these anthropomorphic images and look at how they actually perform in simulations in the winter of 20023 seventythree blackfaced spoonbills were found dead from botulism in taijiang national park the wild bird society of tainan consequently organized a campaign to vaccinate spoonbills against botulism and used decoys to train their staff on how to safely handle the birds since then drills have been regularly organized for bird protectors to learn how to manipulate fake spoonbills with caution these decoys are also used to attract spoonbills for gps monitoring carved in wood and painted in black and white they are posted in the wetlands close to traps decoys are different from images of spoonbills on posters wildlife managers interact with them as if they were alive because of their accurate mimicking the use of decoys is a traditional feature of bird hunting by contrast with lures which attract birds based on their appetites decoys attribute intentions to prey schaeffer 1999 64 in england duck decoys take the form of pondside wooden houses into which ducks are attracted by a fake dog because hunters have observed that ducks swim towards the dog to signal that it has been seen in the same way the fake spoonbill is used as a decoy because it creates a situation of communication with the bird but at the same time the fake spoonbill is used as a dummy by birders who train to manipulate spoonbills in risky situations as in epidemic simulations the use of spoonbill decoys mixes hunting techniques and pastoral techniques because decoys are considered both as intentional agents and as objects that should be manipulated with care this hypothesis was confirmed on 29 april 2013 when the wild bird federation of tainan led me to a site where three blackfaced spoonbills had been trapped  a very rare event which i was considered lucky to have witnessed birdwatchers had found shelter in a taoist temple on the banks of the marshes and they turned on some buddhist music to soothe the birds with very calm gestures a man equipped with gloves and a mask sewed a gps satellite tracking device around the waist of the spoonbill while a woman held it gently but firmly five other birdwatchers watched them with amusement taking pictures and making comments on the birds reactions the man explained to me that he had to be cautious because it was a young spoonbill so the weight of the satellite tracking device had to be imposed on its body in such a way that it would not hamper its growth or unbalance its flight how to build techniques of monitoring that do not kill animals considered as indexes of the fate of their species is a major concern for wildlife managers who often talk about the sacrifice of individual animals when they die as the result of an improper monitoring device benson 2011 but taiwanese birdwatchers focused the discussion on how to properly release these birds so that they would not be sacrificed but become sentinels of a threatened species the release of birds is a major ritual concern in south china known as fangsheng literally let live this practice finds its roots in aristocratic practices of opening the cages of birds who sang well and was codified in taoist rituals as a specific sequence of releasing a live animal but it has developed massively in recent centuries with its qualification by buddhists as a practice of compassion that increases the merits gongde of those who release live animals handlin smith 1999 in hong kong and taiwan buddhist associations entered into discussion with birdwatching societies because many birds were found dead after they were bought in bird markets and released in surrounding natural parks these associations had to warn through posters that releasing birds could cause the death of birds because they were released in an improper environment and the death of humans since some of the birds found dead after the release carried avian flu severinghaus  chi 1991 consequently when they released a bird equipped with gps that they had learned to manipulate through the use of decoys taiwanese birdwatchers inserted a ritual sequence into a simulation practice while the ritual introduced the bird into a cycle of life and death the simulation used the decoy to produce signs of future threats for birds and humans the blackfaced spoonbills were released in the taijiang national park with the hope that they would fly over to hong kong or the fujian coast where their signals could be captured it should be noted that the taiwan straits are also the sites of military exercises or drills through which threats coming from china are mitigated to prepare for an attack from the peoples republic of china the taiwanese centers for disease control was organizing exercises simulating the use of bioweapons in a public space such as sars smallpox and avian flu virus rollet 2010 311 the release of a blackfaced spoonbill in the same chinese straits mimics and reverses the scenario of an avian flu outbreak from china instead of carrying information on the potential war between two longterm enemies it produces signals on the changes of bird habitats that concern birds as well as humans while in the public health simulations birds are considered as carriers of infectious diseases birdwatchers simulations frame them as living beings with which humans share pathogens as signs of communication another practice with birds in taiwan clarifies by contrast their role in simulations according to peta more than a million pigeons are released every day from boats in the taiwan straits by pigeonracing clubs and only 1 per cent survive to come back to their shelter huge amounts of money an estimated us2 billion are spent in bets on those which will return welcomed as heroes if they are first killed if they are too slow4 this is neither a ritual nor a simulation but a gambling practice through which birds crossing the sea between china and taiwan are qualified as political signifiers the reverse scenario of the game producing strange identifications between humans and birds tells the story of a pigeon successfully returning home while others fail and die in the taiwan straits releasing a bird in taiwan can thus appear as a simulation when it is embedded in the framework of an environmental flyway as a ritual when it mobilizes a cosmological view of the circulation of souls between humans and animals or as a game when it is organized on the border separating two competing territories simulation ritual and play are three frameworks to mitigate the uncertainties of catching and releasing a potentially sick bird i have considered three stages where bird diseases are simulated computer simulations of avian influenza by microbiologists outdoor performances of pandemic influenza by public health administrations and exercises of manipulating threatened birds by birdwatchers these three types of simulation displace the problem of sacrifice that is the definition of those who deserve to live and those who will die microbiological surveillance of viruses moves away from the site of emergence where birds are killed to prevent the spread of pathogens to humans and traces continuities between humans and animals as a reservoir where viruses silently mutate simulations of epidemics dont address the problem of triage between humans in a situation of exception but rather configure new relations between humans and animals through accessories in a performance exercises of vaccinating and releasing potentially sick birds dont raise the issue of how many birds can die for the sake of the species but rather reflect on how to handle a bird with care in a political environment where they carry signals of threat in the reverse scenarios of simulations birds appear not as sources of infection that must be eradicated but as sentinels with which humans can communicate to imagine potential futures simulations therefore should be analysed not only as a pastoral technique of power as ways to mobilize populations under a common threat in which some are sacrificed for the sake of others but also as a cynegetic technique of power creating relations of identification between humans and animals around a perceived uncertainty at the borders between species in the world of databased science and transparency of communication simulations of bird diseases imply playing like animals or with animals to anticipate the impossibility of a mass extinction thus mobilizing elementary forms of identification in the cases i have considered the question of the realism of exercises is a way to draw attention to the circulation of objects that recast relations between humans and birds by simulating the diseases they share the use of computer software accessories and decoys in the three types of simulations i have analysed blurs the sharp opposition between humans and nonhumans these objects can be considered as decoys because they carry the intentions that humans attribute to animals and shift their perception from inanimate objects to living beings while scenarios of birdgenerated epidemics play on the asymmetries between humans and birds the horizon of the simulation the extinction of the human or of a bird species integrates them as common actors of a game simulations can thus be considered as reflexive rituals because they display the uncertainties of the beings they play with and help to mitigate their threats framing simulation as an operation unfolding between the spheres of mimetic play and reflexive ritual and at the same time performing a series of subjectobject reversals i have argued for the need to approach this key apparatus of preparedness through a lens that allows for the mixing of pastoral and cynegetic techniques what i have called in this article avian preparedness takes place in a long history of simulating bird movements from classical divination by roman augurs to medieval bird hunting and modern birdwatching the specificity of contemporary forms of anticipation through sentinels simulation or stockpiling is that the distinction between cynegetic techniques of preparedness taking the perspectives of birds on future threats through imagination and communication and pastoral techniques of prevention protecting human or nonhuman populations from external dangers through risk calculation has become more difficult to make and yet more urgent this article has argued for such a distinction while opening the stage for future analyses of simulations as forms of play and ritual  pandemic and macho organizations wakeup call or business as usual 1 running title pandemic and machismo rafael alcadipani  the covid-19 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges for our generation the global spread of the virus is affecting societies gender dynamics in general and in organizations in particular based on ethnographic research being carried out in a police organization in brazil this piece discusses how covid-19 is impacting hegemonic masculinity in organizations police organizations are prototypical hegemonic masculinity organizations i argue that the covid-19 pandemic at first encourages the performance of the police typical macho masculinity but as the disease progresses it creates a situation that challenges it i explore that even though the pandemic threatens macho masculinity in organizations it is still unclear if an alternative gender dynamic will emerge from this crisis in macho organizations  different world leaders are positing covid-19 as the greatest challenge of our time the effects on peoples lives are immense and profound as covid-19 is impacting one of the central core stones of all human societies social interaction it is also affecting the economy and a myriad of taken for granted assumptions in our lives it has changed our lives very rapidly and it still unclear how the world will emerge once the covid-19 situation is under control the covid-19 pandemic is affecting gender dynamics and bringing gender gaps to the surface in many societies the pandemic has been surrounded by a macho discourse of war all over the world in some places domestic violence against women is on the rise besides while many are being forced to work from home the uneven distribution of care work between men and women becomes more evident eg care of the elderly and homeschooling young children however at the same time new forms of gender and inter-gender solidarity are emerging making the covid-19 pandemic an important time for gender-related research if on the one hand the pandemic affects minorities and the vulnerable more seriously it can also have impacts on the performance of macho dominated organizations i realize this due to ethnographic fieldwork that i have been carrying out in a police force in brazil police officers a highly hegemonic masculine group are one of the key front-line workers in this pandemic as a result they are also suffering high levels of covid-19 contamination some of which have resulted in death to raise some questions concerning covid-19 and hegemonic masculinity i am writing this piece to shed lights on how covid-19 is impacting hegemonic masculinity performances in organizations i am calling this an opinion piece because i would like to share my impressions of covid-19 and hegemonic masculinity in these rather uncertain times most of the studies on gender in the police have focused on women and little is known about mens experience of policing through a gendered lens as men or through a theoretical lens of masculinity silvestri 201703  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved to reflect on the impacts of covid-19 on masculinity first i discuss that the police is a prototypical hegemonic masculine organization then i discuss how covid-19 is impacting the ethnographic fieldwork i have been carrying out in the police in brazil and also how to keep doing research in a pandemic later i discuss how the police macho masculinity has been displayed in the pandemic to later show how covid-19 threatens police macho masculinity finally i argue that the pandemic situation is potentially putting in danger macho masculinity in organizations however i also hypothesize that it is still unclear if the covid-19 will give place to alternative gender dynamics in organizations writing this piece has been important to understand and also to deal with several threats covid-19 poses to all of us the pandemic vanishes away any possibility of knowing what will happen to us to our loved ones and also to society seeing the hundreds of deaths every day by covid-19 makes our finitude even more salient and transparent social isolation makes more difficult to provide care to our elderly parents furthermore i am facing this disease from brazil where the far-right proto-fascist president is possible one of the worst world leaders responding to this pandemic he defies social isolation publicly almost every day and every week he takes part in public demonstrations against the already fragile brazilian democracy bolsonaro the brazilian president is the typical tough and forceful macho who thinks he knows it all that problems can be solved by public displays of strengths and by farright bravados when asked by journalists about the covid-19 increasing death toll bolsonaro replied so what he shows no solidarity to people at all and is a macho role model of careless and stupidity brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world and social isolation is an impossibility to most of poor brazilians be it due to lack of adequate housing and sanitation be it due to the need to work sometimes making delivery of goods and services to the rich there are reports that poor woman who works for providing care for the rich are the most susceptible to die from the virus in brazil i think writing this piece in these this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved extraordinary times is a way to challenge macho masculinity in organizations and also to process all the rash environment we face in brazil research on masculinities and organizations eg ackroyd  crowdy 1990 alcadipani  tonelli 2014 cheng 1996 collinson  hearn 1996 collinson  hearn 1994 collinson  hearn 1996 kerfoot  knights 1998 knights  kerfoot 2004 pullen  knights 2007 knights  clerke 2017 analyzes mainly how problematic performances of masculinities aids in the perpetuation of institutional inequalities and violence and hegemonic masculinity is rather present in governing work organizations knights  pullen 2019  in so doing the concept of hegemonic masculinity has been crucial in the development of studies of masculinities in organizations collinson  hearn 1994 knight  tollberg 2012  the term hegemony comes from gramsci see donaldson 1993 and hegemonic masculinity signifies a culturally idealized form of the masculine character connell 1993  this is the conventional dominant form of masculinity constructed in opposition to femininities and related to other subordinated marginalized and colonized modes of masculinities connell 1987 connell  messerschmidt 2005  forms of masculinities can be seen as stemming from power relations and can be characterized as either hegemonic or subaltern in relation to one another collinson  hearn 1994  i depart from the view that gender is continuously performed knights  tollberg 2012 and i depart from the assumption that masculinities must be accomplished they are not static connell  messerschmidt 2005 knights 2019  masculinities are therefore in a constant process of being

masculinities cheng 1996 collinson  hearn 1996 kerfoot  knights 1998 ackroyd  crowdy 1990 as well as where hegemonic masculinities can be challenged peukert 2017  historically hegemonic masculinity has been strongly tied to social institutions such as the family religion and work connell 1993  similar to the military karazi-presler 2020 lee et al 2019 and fire departments perott 2019 hegemonic masculinity is distinctively prevalent in police organizations see oneill mars  singh 2007  this makes police organizations an overwhelming masculine institution willis 201380 where the cult of masculinity is the defining characteristic of the police occupational culture fielding 1994 smith  gray 1985  even though there are places of resistance dick 2015  police occupational culture has been portrayed as essentially masculine with an emphasis on virility toughness masculinity and masculine interests such as sexual triumphs sports outdoor life and so forth van maanen  manning 1978 249

version of masculinity is a central element of police organizations even for those who advocate a more nuanced view on masculinity in police organizations see silvestri 2017  it is recognized that masculinity is a key element of police occupational culture both amongst patrol officers eg manning  van maaanen 1978 and detectives eg ericson 1981 innes 2003  despite attempts to reform and make police organizations more gender-equal and less masculine brown 2007 argues that machismo is a fundamental characteristic of police occupational culture and has become a core and basic assumption that informs the nature of police work and their work environment if machismo and masculinity are cornerstones of police occupational culture how will these elements play out in the extreme context of pandemic times when police officers need to be deployed to the front line in this reflection i will discuss this issue based on ethnographic research i have been doing with police detectives in brazil in brazil there are mainly two police forces at the state level one responsible for patrol and crime prevention activities the military police and the other in charge of investigating crimes the detective police the research for this paper was conducted in the detective police force brazil has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and uncountable public safety concerns the police force also face several problems such as high rates of suicide and occupational diseases among detectives much of equipment they use is obsolete and detectives this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved face severe difficulties in managing basic aspects of their work such as logistics managing people and financial resources the research that inspires this paper adopts an ethnographic approach spradley 1980 van maanen 1979 2006 2011  despite the fact that this research has been on-going for almost 8 years and i have observed police activities in various police district areas the homicide division the anti-kidnapping division the police academy and tactical units for this paper i use data gathered during the first month of the covid-19 pandemic in brazil i also teach pro bono regularly at the police academy as a way to report back to the police on my findings and impressions from my research i shall report a confessional tale that emphasizes fieldwork as a social construction van maanen 1988  due to the long-term nature of this research i developed a strong relationship of trust in the police force today i commonly receive phone calls from police personnel who reach out to me to tell stories they are detectives with whom i would exchange daily smartphone instant messages and before the pandemic had lunch with or went out for a drink with at least once a week the perception that the covid-19 pandemic was a real problem started as news arrived portraying the grave situation in italy especially because many brazilians often travel to italy and on a regular basis it was then that i started to wonder when the virus would arrive and spread in brazil and as front-line workers how the police would be severely impacted i was very enthusiastic about doing fieldwork under pandemic times as all over the world police forces are enacting containment measures and facing great the difficulties that this crisis poses in brazil officers have already been contaminated and there is an ongoing need for the police worldwide to stay on the streets to either enforce lockdowns or even to collect samples for testing for covid-19 moreover when the covid-19 pandemic arrived in brazil i had just this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved moylan et al 2015  i am part of some police detectives instant messaging groups and i can also easily reach police detectives via instant messaging and phone calls each day i have been writing very detailed field notes and memos fretz et al 1995 about the impact of covid-19 on police detectives i follow an inductive research process that originates from my thick description of the field to generate an account that is both analytical and integrated into theory van maanen 1979  i have also been inspired by spradley 1980 14 who suggested before you impose your theories on the people you study find out how those people define the world since my thoughts about being a researcher and not indiana jones and from the dialogues i was having with police detectives it became this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved evident that the pandemic was challenging the heart of the police detectives to force masculine assumptions i decided to write this because it helps me to deal with the social distance situation my distancing from the ethnographic real-time fieldwork and as a way to think about the unprecedented challenges this pandemic situation will create for all of us moreover i think that doing police research has been linked to my masculine identity and having time to step back and be reflexive is always important on march 11th 2020 the world health organization who declared covid-19 a pandemic two days later i was meant to give a talk to 215 sworn-in police detectives at the management school where i work this was part of a management module that i organize pro bono for the police detectives academy given that the police force has severe mismanagement issues i thought that bringing new detectives to be taught at this institution one of the most renowned management schools in the country would make a positive impression of the benefits of good management among the detectives starting their careers this impression i reckoned would help them to remember the importance of good management for their institution in the years to come on march 12 th  2020 the head of my school decided to cancel all activities due to the fear of covid-19 spreading among our community and all our teaching activities migrated on-line our school was one of the first educational institutions in brazil to cancel all classes concerned about cancelling my talk altogether the senior management at the police academy and i decided to give the talk at the police academy headquarters even though the small auditorium would be crowded two important cultural issues were at stake here first i learnt from police culture maaning 1977 rubinstein 1973 that you have to keep your word to preserve your reputation if you say you will do something you had better do it second displays of fear are not taken well saying that i would not teach due to personal concerns over this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved covid-19 would be seen as a sissy behavior and i would be the butt of little jokes however i knew if i cancelled the presentation the police people would be completely fine about it i was pressuring myself to do this i felt that i had to keep my word even if this would mean i could be contaminated by covid-19 upon arriving in the academy to give my talk i was informed that students were concerned about being in an overcrowded auditorium in times of covid-19 at the time this seemed to be an overreaction in mid-march even though covid-19 was already a global threat brazil was just two weeks into the aftermath of carnival when millions of people took to the streets of the country to party and there were fewer than 20 covid-19 cases confirmed in the country people were just starting to get worried about the virus but life was going on as usual when i was going to the lecture theatre a police detective who works at the academy approached me and said professor there are some students concerned about attending your talk due to covid-19 i dont understand we are the police if there is a zombie apocalypse we are the ones who will need to get our weapons to hunt zombies down how can they be afraid of a microscopic harmless creature for most of us it is good this is happening it is an opportunity for them to learn how to be a proper police detective earlier on the idea here is that a proper police detective should not be afraid of any danger and also in face of danger needs to act moreover when i was discussing whether my talk and all other courses at the police academy should still go on police detectives of the educational institution were telling me this is the police not university our mindset is different they are not just studying they are working they are being paid to take classes they need to be ready as soon as possible should we need extra manpower due to the pandemic situation more importantly we need to face the danger here not run away from it while giving my talk and facing an overcrowded room i this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved start to ask myself what on earth i was doing there in pandemic times being reflective of my practice i began to realize that i was trying to show that i was also brave strong and macho in the eyes of the police detectives and myself i realized that my need to display a hegemonic masculine identity had put myself in this risky situation i apprehended how the police macho culture was stronger on me than i was aware of and this made me to completely realize how the police macho culture creates internal pressures for people to face risks i also learnt that some detectives were complaining to the president of the detectives union about the classes going on and also that non-urgent police activities were also going on the union even requested legal help to force the police detective leadership to take action to protected detectives health on the same day this happened some high-profile people from the military police contacted me saying this is totally absurd we are the police and we need to be out there fighting crime a warrior does not stop because of a virus the masculine ideal of the warrior that does not fear the virus is explicit here the military and the detective police engage in strong disputes and this was taken as a way to suggest that the detective police is less engaged than the military talking to a senior manager of the detective police he said this legal request is embarrassing for us the underlying idea here is that macho detectives should not be stopped by the virus some of the detectives i spoke to from different police departments were starting to get worried about the total lack of occupational health and safety personal protective equipment ppe appropriate to protect detectives from being contaminated by the virus while working the police mismanaged the purchase of ppe for some units and had to ask local businesses for donations of ppe supplies to the police this is a common practice in brazil police officers and chiefs ask a business to donate work equipment when none is available antonio one of the detectives complaining about the lack of ppe is well-known for using his social media to show off pictures of him using heavy rifles and other symbols of hyper-masculinity when this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved another detective told me about antonio he mentioned this is interesting antonio shows off in his social media as if he was the top macho detective in the world now he is complaining that there is no ppe for him to work come on is he afraid now what a sissy showing concern about covid-19 was being perceived as not appropriate for someone who likes to show off as the macho detective even though the wearing of bulletproof jackets is obligatory for police detectives when using marked police cars very rarely do they wear such protective gear there is an underlying idea that using a bulletproof jacket is a display of being fearful and a proper police detective has no fear the same was said by some concerning the use of ppe for covid-19 i need no gloves or masks to work i am a policeman this was said at the very early stages of the pandemic in brazil even a senior official of the police replied to a colleague when asked about the police plan for dealing with covid-19 well we finally guaranteed the necessary ppe for all police detectives there is not a lot more we can do everyone will be contaminated and we all will have to face the virus the underlining idea is the police job is to face danger apart from ppe no other plan to protect the police force was being considered most probably due to the prevailing mindset that police face danger anyway so why would a plan be necessary while covid-19 was not a strong reality in brazil police detectives were working on a business as usual mode under their macho police culture facing danger making displays of hegemonic masculinity such as avoiding showing fear was their reaction towards the virus threat those who were showing fear or concerns over the virus were being challenged by their peers as if they were not macho enough to honor the police badge they had even my researcher self was feeling under pressure from the police culture to display masculinity by teaching in an overcrowded auditorium however once the virus became a closer reality in the police detectives started to change their behavior with regard to covid-19 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved on march 19th 2020 i was informed that 906 detectives were on sick leave with suspected covid-19 i could not confirm the veracity of those numbers but some people i spoke to said there are a lot of contaminated police detectives to make things worse brazil did not have enough covid-19 tests and also the test results were taking more than 15 days to be released as a detective told me we are in the dark here no one knows who is really infected i dont know if the person who i work with is infected it is rare to see a detective saying she does not know what is going on they usually talk in such a way to show that they know what is happening i was also informed that some students of the police academy had been admitted to hospital even though they were less than 35 years old i was later informed they had returned home safely this led people from the police academy to comment that the virus was not as harmless as some were trying to picture it as the presence of the virus became more pronounced in the detective police force people started to get much more concerned a senior detective told me i have never ever seen this in my entire career for the first time ever i feel people are afraid of what is going to happen till now our problems have been similar we need to investigate and lock people up that is what we know how to do best now we face an enemy we cant see and we have never dealt with before everyone who i know is afraid i dont know what is going to happen i heard this and similar comments from several people also some years ago the police forces of the state were attacked by the drug gang that monopolizes crime in the region many policemen were killed but many more allegedly criminals were killed by police compared to the times of the attacks a detective said to me when we were under attack it was much easier to detain the virus washing hands using masks and gloves is not what they usually do when facing a threat moreover a detective talking to me said very worriedly i am coming here to work every single day like everybody else on my team do we all really need to come here every day why they dont make some people come for 15 days and leave others at home then the ones who are home come to work this could be a way to protect all of us another police detective said there are regulations that people over 60 should be working from home however my chief is ignoring this and is not sending anyone home i have a friend who has just finished having chemotherapy and she is coming to work every day how is that possible another detective contacted me to say i go in and out every day i can get the virus and die or even kill my family the tone of detectives talking to me has changed completely they do not usually open show concern for their own or colleagues safety because of covid-19 they were all talking as if they were afraid of what would happen to them when someone dies at home the police have to investigate the death the first response is usually made by the police district areas once the police are informed that a person has died outside a hospital a police squad goes to check the circumstances of the death either the squad produces a formal report to say this was not a murder or they call the homicide department to start a murder investigation it is only when this procedure has been followed that the corpse can be removed from the place where it is with covid-19 the prospect of various deaths at homes made the police central management designate the homicide department in charge of checking all deaths members of this department were fuming one said to me they are putting us and our families in real danger why do we need to deal with this shit we have no appropriate ppe we have nothing we will end up with this fucking virus this particular detective never once wore a bulletproof jacket when i was following his squad on police operations and was terrified about coming into contact with the virus this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved i also spoke to some detectives in the district areas they were all very concerned about the virus and the means of protection against it i have never once seen any detective complaining so harshly about the lack of ppe over my 8 years in the field i spoke to a detective who said in my district there are not enough gloves and masks also we keep our door closed to stop people coming in now people can report crimes using the internet there is no need to come to us however our general boss came to our station and told us off because the front door was closed he says we need to keep working and he is making everyone turn up on the same day if one gets the virus we will all be contaminated he also said the regional boss had a meeting in the station of one of my friends the station boss had covid-19 and turned up to show off to the boss can you believe he was afraid of losing his chief position moreover a detective who assists a senior detective phoned me very worried saying professor people here are crazy we have no serious plan to deal with this pandemic situation how will we deal with the high amount of contaminated police detectives how are we going to process all the bodies that will be in the city how are we going to deal with organized crime in this pandemic situation what is our plan to deal with domestic violence i am exasperated no one says anything we are completely lost no one knows what to do this is a recipe for disaster i asked if he had spoken to this boss he replied well you know what they are like here my boss thinks he is always right he does not listen to anyone the police have a very aggressive and non-collaborative management style macho managers panayiotou 2010  are all around the feelings of the police detectives on the ground are that the men at the top believe they know it all as it is typical of macho leadership styles in the pandemic situation some chiefs are using a strong hand to make police to turn up to work while at the same time they do not feel protected to perform their tasks the situation makes it even more explicit to police detectives how negative the aggressive management style they are under is this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved when the death toll was approaching 1000 deaths of covid-19 in brazil a detective phoned me up to let me know about an argument he had had that day due to the behavior of one of his colleagues he said the person came into my office and wanted to shake hands i asked if he was crazy and smiled he got angry and said i am police i shake the hands of my friends i replied that this was very dangerous he replied that he was a policeman i got very pissed off come on it is no time to shake hands he went on to complain about the behavior of his colleague he also said that other people complained about that colleague claiming he was mad not shaking hands is a display of fear and it was perceived by other police officer as the most appropriate reaction the brazilian president jair bolsonaro has always used tough-on-crime and pro-police violence discourse during the elections he got massive support from police officers across the country among the detectives i research it was no different the vast majority of police detectives who i spoke to had made positive comments about bolsonaro far right populists exert hegemonic masculinity and machismo performances knights  pullen 2019  this type of public personality embodies crucial elements of the police occupational culture bolsonaros son is a police officer as the covid-19 situation evolved in brazil bolsonaro tried to minimize the situation and was also against social distancing measures he even said on a tv interview that we need to take coronavirus like a man with his attitude of denial towards covid-19 bolsonaro started to lose respect and also popularity in brazil a trend which has reverberated in the police a detective who voted for bolsonaro said to me this guy is crazy he wants to kill all of us also a military police sergeant died of covid-19 the first police officer to die of the disease in the region where my research has been taking place the news of this death rapidly spread in the police instant messaging groups with phrases like many thanks bolsonaro your reckless behavior will kill a lot of police officers in brazil many detectives were saying that the presidents attitudes were putting police officers welfare at this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved risk covid-19 was even challenging polices massive support of bolsonaro this can be seen as a signal that in the pandemic situation the macho role model is undermined even in an organization that is a prototype of the hegemonic masculinity organization in this piece i discuss the impacts of covid-19 on a prototypical hegemonic masculinity organization the police traditionally a police force is an organization where the cult of masculinity is performed in everyday work wilson 1968 dick 2005 oneill mars  singh 2007   the macho heroic police identity who fights crime rubinstein 1973 maaning 1977 van maanen 1980 bayley 1994 is continuously performed through displays of virility courage to face danger toughness showing interest in sexual triumphs sports and outdoor life van maanen  manning 1978 249 as well as the masculine favoring of reason over emotion fassin 2017  machismo is a central element of police occupational culture up to the point of becoming a core and basic assumption informing the nature of police work which can be very difficult to change in the pandemic situation at first police were in the machismo business as usual mode the core police machismo values of facing danger and avoiding displays of fear were initially the police reactions towards the virus threat police detectives who were showing fear of the virus were criticized as if they were not proper police officers i was even feeling this pressure in my interactions with police detectives and it took some time to decide that i am not indiana jones the adventure hunter and that i should hold back my police research fieldwork this shows how masculine values run deep and how this impact on people taking unnecessary and meaningless risks is just to display a type of masculinity however as the covid-19 situation in brazil worsened police detectives started to feel the threat of the virus getting closer and closer an important issue here is that often police face dangerous criminals with weapons ammunition and helicopters however all these key this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved artefacts in the police performance of police macho masculinity to fight the war on crime are totally useless to the police detectives engagement on the war on the virus to make matters worse the virus is confronted by washing hands wearing nurse-like masks and gloves and performing all different types of hygiene care care is perceived in the police macho perspective as a non-macho masculinity attribute and wearing even worst on the face nurselike artefacts can be perceived almost as if you are non-macho in addition during the pandemic engagement with criminals should be avoided as much as possible however arresting criminals is how police officer display to each other how macho good they are the covid-19 situation is not only making detectives to have to engage on culturally under valuated care-like activities but it is also making the traditional police macho mindset redundant in the pandemic and causing an existential dilemma for policemen to be protected against the virus the police officer need to give away at least part of the embedded macho culture the virus respects no occupational culture values for many police officers it is like if for protection against the virus police officers cannot be who they have always been in so doing the virus ends up helping to undermine the traditional police macho culture because care does not resonate well in machism settings police detectives have changed their natural macho behavior as they face this unknown situation they indicated that they feared not knowing how to act in relation to the virus and that they were concerned about the use of ppe something very atypical until the outbreak of covid-19 this was perceived as a display of fear and lack of masculinity furthermore subordinates were critical of stubborn macho leaders who did not listen and pretended to know it all even hand shaking was being problematized and those who were trying to keep the same old macho habits were being criticized the reaction against the president a role model for machos in brazil is also striking as he was severely criticized even among his many of his supporters the macho management style either in the police or in the this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved country as a whole was perceived as a recipe for disaster that would endanger the lives of the police officers police detectives were shown to be frightened by the disease and displayed fear something that is a no-no in macho organizations either the pandemic situation seems to be putting police macho masculinity in danger for the good or at least it shows how problematic it can be for organizations this piece indicates that the early stage of the pandemic is revealing how complicated machismo can be for organizations especially during a pandemic as it can literally put peoples lives in danger it also shows how an extreme situation can impact gender perceptions performances and identities however as i finish this paper the pandemic in brazil is still not as bad as in other countries such as the uk the usa and italy for example however the tendency is that the situation will get far much worse this is a call for researchers to focus on how the pandemic can affect masculinity in particular and gender issues in organizations in general the question we are left with is once this pandemic is over will organizations go back to business as usual or will they be able to learn from this pandemic back to the detectives police the police academy has developed a training program to make police detectives offer a better and less judgmental approach to victims of domestic violence the police macho culture has made detectives struggled to offer decent care for victims of domestic violence this training involves role-playing in which the need to care for the other becomes clear many police detectives seem to experiment a real change of behavior after taking part of the training program the changing of a macho culture involves the need of people realizing the importance of care both to the members of the organization and to the people they daily interact police tend to see their jobs as fighting-crime however as the first respondents for crime victims what police actually need to realize is that an important part of the police work is to care for people who just faced violence covid-19 is making the need for care to be central in our  coronavirus disease 2019 utilizing an ethical framework for rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources in transplant allocation decisions anji wall e timothy pruett peter stock giuliano testa   the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has upended health care in the united states and around the world
1
 as the first wave of surges hits the coasts of the united states the rest of the country is likely to follow and most of us will be faced with challenging decisions at personal professional and institutional levels as transplant professionals we will encounter even more limitations in donor organs as well as personnel capacity and equipment limitations in our hospitals these limitations will differ among states cities and programs making it exceptionally challenging to come up with national guidance on how to approach transplantation during the covid19 pandemic while transplants have been categorized as tier 3b by the centers for medicare and medicaid cms recommendations for limiting nonessential surgical procedures meaning they are of the highest acuity and should not be postponed we all know that there is nuance to which transplant patients and procedures truly meet this standard
2
 we therefore must prepare ourselves to make difficult decisions about which patients to transplant when to limit transplant capacity and how to best care for those patients who have undergone transplantation
3
 transplant capacity is being constrained by limited resources beyond that of donor organs and absolutely constrained in areas where resources are not available eg if there are no icu beds transplants requiring postoperative icu beds cannot be done
4
 as resources become limited our decisions about who to transplant will need to be guided by both the practical reality of each centers capacity as well as underlying ethical values in this manuscript we discuss the ethical standards and values that we can use to guide the transition into making decisions regarding transplantation in each of our centers and programs as we are faced with the covid19 pandemic as transplant professionals we have significant experience with allocating scarce resources most of us make listing decisions regularly considering not only medical factors but also financial and psychosocial factors all needed to make a transplant successful
5
 the balance we have tried to strike is between justice or providing an equal opportunity for transplantation and utility or ensuring acceptable benefits from transplantation
6
 the way that we currently put allocation into practice is a twostep process to achieve utility if a patient is deemed to have an acceptable potential to benefit from transplantation he or she is listed to ensure justice when an organ becomes available for transplant a match run determines the order in which listed patients are prioritized for that organ what the covid19 pandemic is forcing transplant programs to do is determine which of the patients who have met the bar for utility or have been deemed acceptable for transplantation in general should continue to be considered for transplantation given the new concerns of increased limitations on our ability to transplant patients as well as the risks of covid19 infection
4

 as we move into the era of covid19 it is time to think beyond our traditional use of the two principles of justice and utility for organ allocation and begin to think in terms of the ethical values framework for rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources described by dr emanuel and colleagues to make the transition from usual practice to increasingly resourceconstrained practice
7
 the four ethical values that guide rationing of absolutely scarce healthcare resources are to maximize benefit treat people equally promote and reward instrumental value and prioritize the sickest patients maximizing benefit can be conceptualized as saving the most lives and saving the most life years treating people equally is based on the principle of justice which sets rules for how to treat people with the same need for a scarce resource in the same way eg first come first served as done with kidney allocation or random selection so as not to advantage those with quicker and easier access to hospitals promoting and rewarding instrumental value means giving priority of treatment to those who have made contributions eg healthcare workers those involved in research or to those who are likely to make contributions in the future eg healthcare workers who can return to the workforce and treat patients finally prioritizing the worst off requires determining who is the worst off and what they should be prioritized for the following sections apply each ethical value to transplantation making the argument that we will have to transition our mindset from the simple utility vs justice calculous of organ allocation to the more nuanced ethical values approach of rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources during the covid19 pandemic this paper is not a call to abandon the already established ethical principles of justice and utility in organ allocation but rather to add the consideration of the ethical values framework for decisions that deviate from standard transplant practice due to capacity constraints risks of covid19 transmission and transplant team safety maximizing benefits to our transplant patients is a delicate balance in the setting of covid19 just looking at a match run and determining if the donor and recipient pairing is a good combination will not be enough and continuing to apply the dominant mindset that the more patients we transplant the more lives we save and the more life years we gain will not be adequate we have to pivot and think about what patients will truly benefit from transplantation in each program during this pandemic
4
 
8
 there are several ways in which we can answer this question based on the local environment
4
 in severely resourceconstrained areas the answer is to transplant only the sickest patients who are already using medical resources and most likely to die in a short time frame without an organ transplant for example patients with fulminant hepatic failure who will die without a liver transplant or status 1a heart patients who are nondischargeable on biventricular assist devices both of whom are already occupying an icu bed in less affected areas maybe the answer is to transplant the moderately ill patients who still have significant shortterm mortality but are likely to have better outcomes shorter icu stays hospital stays and use less blood products and other scarce resources in minimally affected areas we may broaden this to patients who will benefit from transplant use fewer resources and are low risk for exposure to covid19 one example that comes to mind is a straightforward kidney transplant recipient who will have a 2hour operation 3day hospital stay will be able to go home and selfisolate and has a low risk of readmission in order to answer the question of who we can benefit from transplantation we must begin by determining the resources that are needed for a successful transplant and if those resources are available if we start with the donor we have a dead person who is utilizing an icu bed nursing staff and mechanical ventilation after the icu the donor utilizes operating room resources including personnel surgical masks and gowns here we must consider the competing needs of the donor hospital for these resources after donation the organ transplantation is also resource intensive recipients utilize operating rooms blood products and icu beds albeit to different extents depending on the organ transplanted again this requires personnel ventilators and personal protective equipment that may be needed in other areas of the recipient hospital maximizing benefit goes hand in hand with minimizing risk therefore we must also consider the parallel risk of covid19 transmission to the recipient either through donorderived infection nosocomial spread or community transmission pre or posttransplant

 kumar et al

 suggest that transmission of covid19 in lung transplantation is high risk as the virus is primarily isolated from the respiratory tract but that there is evidence of viremia in 15 of cases making donor to recipient transmission possible in any transplant in areas of high rates of community spread it is essential to screen all recipients for covid19 risk and may be ideal test some or all recipients prior to transplantation currently only south korea is testing all asymptomatic recipients with np swabs prior to transplantation
4
 moreover as part of patient screening we must determine if patients can enact a postdischarge quarantine or physical distancing plan including virtual clinic visits to minimize the risk of exposure to covid19 patients who are unable to physically distance from others after transplantation due to living arrangements may need assistance from the transplant program to secure alternative housing for to allow for this or be given supplies such as masks to assist in decreasing the risk of covid19 transmission if postdischarge housing arrangements are high risk and cannot be changed then transplant programs may need to consider not transplanting these highrisk patients acknowledging that this type of policy may affect lower income patients more harshly than higher income patients and should only be a consideration if there is truly no alternative strategy for risk minimization moreover as a transplant community we should strive to test all donors so as to minimize the risk of transmission from donors to recipients as has been done in italy canada switzerland spain and korea
4
 even with universal donor testing there will be false negatives so a negative test does not guarantee zero risk of donor to recipient transmission

 just as we discuss the risk of infectious disease transmission from increased risk donors with recipients we have an obligation to discuss the risk of covid19 transmission with recipients even if that discussion is focused more on the unknown rather than known risk table 1 provides a series of questions to address the resource limitations and risk minimization capacity to consider prior to transplantation when considering the limitations and risks we have to recognize that each solid organ transplant is different with respect to the risk of transmission of covid19 anticipated icu and hospital stay level of immunosuppression needed to prevent early rejection and intensity of postoperative monitoring a standard kidney transplant from a good donor for example will not require intensive care and be discharged within 3 days of the operation while a decompensated lung transplant patient will require both postoperative icu care and a longer duration of hospital stay a frail heart transplant candidate with a high likelihood of needing postdischarge inpatient rehabilitation afterward is at higher risk for covid19 infection than a robust candidate who can quarantine at home after discharge each donorrecipient scenario will have different considerations when it comes to resource limitations potential benefits and risks in our assessment of the ethical value of maximizing benefit we must acknowledge that there are many unknowns
9
 
10
 we currently do not have the supplies to test for covid19 on a large scale and therefore do not know the true prevalence in our communities we do not know the risk of transmission of covid19 to solid organ recipients from donors who have the disease as there are no known donor to recipient transmissions at this time
4
 moreover we do not know how transplant patients who acquire covid19 postoperatively or who undergo transplantation while infected will fare given their immunosuppressed state we are entering a time of uncertainty and have to acknowledge this uncertainty to ourselves and also to our patients as we try to make the best decisions to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of transplantation the section above addresses the consideration of assessing the potential benefits and risks for each individual transplant scenario however as programs become more resource constrained they will have to make decisions about categorically excluding certain groups of patients from transplantation even if patients are currently active on the transplant waiting list
4
 the ethical value underpinning these decisions is that all people must be treated equally
7
 for example many programs have made the decision to discontinue living donor kidney and liver transplantation that means all living donor operations are discontinued regardless of patient desire to proceed some programs have had to limit liver transplantation to only high meld patients lung transplantation to unstable patients and heart transplantation to higher status patients some programs are refusing to consider donors who are not tested for covid19 each of these decisions is made at the level of the program and not at the level of the patient they do not consider whether the patient is willing to take a risk on a donor that is not tested or if a patient with a lower meld than the cutoff would still like to be considered for transplantation as programs are forced to make decisions that set more stringent criteria regarding who will be considered for transplantation it is essential that these decisions are made in a transparent and equitable manner one way to ensure this is for programs to communicate their decisions to patients who do not meet the new criteria and make these patients inactive so that they do not receive offers for transplantation the discussion thus far regarding maximizing value and treating patients equally has focused primarily focused on transplant recipients as we transition to a more global assessment of transplant practices within the context of a pandemic we have to think beyond the recipients promoting and rewarding instrumental value in the framework of rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources is aimed at ensuring the protection of the healthcare workforce who both take on personal risk by treating covid19 patients and who have the potential to continue to provide societal benefit with their expertise after recovery
7
 the idea of instrumental value can also play into transplantation in at least two ways broadening the scope of consideration beyond the transplant recipient the first is the instrumental value of the deceased donor a deceased donor has the potential to save the lives of several patients who are suffering from end organ disease this is a huge societal contribution which should be generally be rewarded by prioritizing the utilization of critical care and operating room resources however the scale can be tipped against prioritizing deceased donors if the donor is suboptimal a dcd unlikely to pass within an acceptable time frame or the donor or recipient hospitals are too overwhelmed to have the capacity for organ donation or transplantation during a surge there will likely be a live person with a competing need for the resources being utilized by the donor can we as the transplant community recommend that a donor takes priority over a live individual in need of icu care and mechanical ventilation we might if that donor will save more lives or more life years with their organs thereby maximizing overall benefit but we must be selective about which donors will truly maximize benefits to transplant patients through donation and be expedient in our donor evaluation and timing so as to minimize the utilization of these scarce resources we must keep in mind that in a severely resourceconstrained scenario the donor has the potential to save many lives while there is a patient or multiple patients whose real lives are in jeopardy awaiting a ventilator a second consideration in the framework of instrumental value is that of the transplant team members most transplant physicians surgeons and advanced practice providers are ready to jump in and do what is necessary not only to take care of their transplant patients but also to care for any patients where they are needed many of us have the training to be versatile in our roles for example abdominal and thoracic transplant surgeons generally have critical care acute care surgery and trauma surgery training if we cannot do transplants due to a covid19 surge we can step in to assist our acute care and trauma surgery colleagues as they will have to continue to operate even in the face of the pandemic we can also offer to do donor operations at our own hospitals so as to minimize donor team travel

12
 an area in which we have to be thoughtful is who should take on the role of direct patient care of covid19 patients it is essential that those of us caring for immunosuppressed transplant patients are not also caring for covid19 patients thereby putting our immunosuppressed patients at risk
12
 in a surge situation we must all have a plan for how our groups can care for our transplant patients while supporting the needs of our institutions a final more global consideration that must occur as resources become further constrained is how to prioritize the worst off in general the concept of prioritizing the worst off is secondary to and supportive of the first concept of maximizing benefit
7
 it requires defining who is the worst off and how the worst off are prioritized this value is useful in determining who should be prioritized for vaccines experimental treatments icus and ventilators we must specifically consider transplant patients in these scenarios should for example transplant patients or waitlisted patients get priority for vaccination if one becomes available so as to protect those who are already immunosuppressed or those likely to become immunosuppressed should they receive priority for experimental treatments as they are potentially more vulnerable due to immunosuppression for icus and ventilators should a transplant patient who suffers a complication and is likely to have a prolonged resourceintensive recovery take priority over a young patient with covid19 and respiratory decompensation in addressing these types of questions we have to determine which patient is worse off and then balance the worse off patient with the value of maximizing benefits and favor the individual who will meet our first goal saving more lives or life years these global decisions about prioritization of the worst off within a hospital are not decisions that physicians in the united states are used to facing moreover the culture of transplantation is that of pushing the limits and getting patients through their postoperative course even when it will be a long resourceintensive process our desire to do everything for our transplant patients may conflict with the competing interest of other patients in the hospital and may end in triage decisions that go against our nature as transplant physicians ultimately we must be willing to consider what it means to be the worst off in a pandemic and make or allow our institutions to make prioritization decisions in light of the larger picture of all patients in need of scarce resources the transplant enterprise is wellversed in allocating scare healthcare resources because of the limited supply of donor organs and we are now facing new challenges with the covid19 pandemic while the examples we provide in this manuscript come from abdominal transplantation our area of expertise the general principles values and processes for determining who we should transplant applies across organ types we cannot afford to continue business as usual when we are faced with more limitations in donors personnel supplies and hospital capacity we must begin thinking of transplantation in the context of the covid19 pandemic and apply the framework of ethical values for rationing absolutely scare healthcare resources to this transition so that we can be thoughtful stewards of donor organs honest advocates for our patients and continue to add value to our institutions moreover this is unfortunately unlikely to be the last time that we face a pandemic or largescale disaster situation and this framework is not just applicable to covid19 but can guide us in future scenarios the authors of this manuscript have no conflicts of interest to disclose as described by the american journal of transplantation  coronavirus disease challenges for psychiatry brendan kelly d   in late december 2019 a patient in wuhan jinyintan hospital in hubei province in china was diagnosed with pneumonia1 the illness was caused by a novel coronavirus disease named covid-19 by 20 february 2020 there were over 75 000 cases of covid-19 in china the median age of those infected was 51 years but ranged from just 2 days to 100 years over three quarters of cases were aged between 30 and 69 years just over half were male covid-19 was quick to spread beyond chinas borders on 11 march the world health organization who declared a pandemic by early april the who reported that there were 125 million confirmed cases worldwide and over 69 000 deaths it is now clear that covid-19 presents two major health problems the first problem is the illness caused by the virus itself which is usually self-limiting but can be fatal especially in the vulnerable the elderly and people with underlying health conditions the second problem is the anxiety and panic that the virus triggers in the minds of virtually everyone who hears about it both problems present substantial challenges to psychiatry regarding the first problem the illness itself much of the solution lies in the hands of public health authorities the governments that fund them and citizens all around the world who adhere to public health advice about hand washing coughing etiquette not touching our faces physical distancing and staying at home when advised to do so these methods work to reduce community transmission of the virus in addition medical staff around the globe are using established methods of infection control and treatment that were developed during previous outbreaks and are being adapted to this new challenge ultimately covid-19 will be controlled albeit at very considerable cost to health mental health and economies around the world the physical illness caused by covid-19 is an urgent concern for psychiatry we already know that people with mental illness have a lower life expectancy and poorer physical health outcomes than the general population2 this means that our patients appear less likely to access public health advice about covid-19 more likely to contract the virus and less likely to receive prompt diagnostic and treatment services vulnerable populations are at particular risk the homeless people with disabilities the chronically ill prisoners and all who live in institutional settings people in these groups often have accumulations of risk factors including poor physical and mental health impaired access to services and diminished control over their day-to-day lives as a result there is a clear need for greater focus on providing care to the mentally ill and other vulnerable groups at this time and a clear need to question any proposed re-deployment of mental health staff to other duties during the crisis unless absolutely necessary3 this is a mental health emergency as well as a physical health crisis one of the challenges with providing enhanced psychiatric care during the pandemic is the high risk of infection among psychiatrists and other mental health workers careful awareness of risk judicious rostering and remote working where possible can help reduce this risk this concern applies not only to fully trained psychiatrists and other mental health professionals but also to trainees and students whose education needs to progress as best as possible in the current radically altered circumstances they too need our assistance fortunately the website of the royal college of psychiatrists provides excellent information advice and support wwwrcpsychacuk it is important that this continues and that we support the colleges tireless work on covid-19 the second problem with the covid-19 pandemic is the anxiety panic and other mental health issues that are attributable to or worsened by covid-19 among the public health professionals our patients people with the infection and their families many of these problems are understandable in the context of a pandemic but they still require careful consideration accurate diagnosis and active management where necessary among the public free-floating anxiety can be helped by advising people to manage their use of media especially social media and focus on reliable sources of information such as the who wwwwhoint this will help combat false information and conspiracy theories that simply stoke anxiety and cause enormous distress to many good diet exercise and sleep are also important at times of heightened emotion along with practices such as mindfulness and reaching out to others for mutual support ironically some of the public health measures required to control this infection can have negative effects on mental health quarantine for example can be associated with fear of infection frustration boredom and anxiety owing to lack of information4 there can also be problems with stigma and finances afterwards these problems can be mitigated by terminating these public health measures when they are no longer necessary providing adequate information and basic supplies reducing boredom and improving communication using technology where possible children require particular attention to maintaining structure in their day and providing schooling as best as feasible children respond to honesty practical suggestions such as hand washing and their parents setting a good example for people infected with covid-19 there can be feelings of guilt anxiety and despair compounded by the physical effects of infection cough fever hypoxia and prolonged hospital stays for the families of those affected there can be feelings of guilt remorse and loss following bereavement grief is likely to be complex owing to limits on visiting the sick or dying in hospitals uncertainties about the spread of infection and complications about the conduct of funerals in this emotionally charged setting psychological support is vital both at the time of death and into the future the best strategy is to give people the time and space to rely on their informal networks to cope but also ensure they know that the door is open to mental health services if they need them at any point now or in the future regrettably there is already evidence that in china at least psychological and psychiatric care have been neglected in the context of covid-195 although this is partially understandable in the white heat at the epicentre of a pandemic it would be deeply unwise to neglect mental healthcare at this time never before has there been greater need for multidisciplinary mental health teams clear communication about psychological supports and use of new technologies to provide diagnostic and therapeutic services where and when they are needed as with virtually all outbreaks of infectious diseases many of the people who die during the current pandemic will in truth die of a combination of covid-19 and poverty although there is already considerable morbidity and mortality in high-income countries these problems will inevitably be worse in countries with underdeveloped health systems inadequate sanitation and poor nutrition that is why on 5 march 2020 tedros adhanom director-general of the who emphasised the importance of global solidarity in addressing the pandemic
ultimately how deadly this virus will be depends not only on the virus itself but on how we respond to it this is a serious disease it is not deadly to most people but it can kill were all responsible for reducing our own risk of infection and if were infected for reducing our risk of infecting others theres something all of us can do to protect vulnerable people in our communities thats why we keep talking about solidarity this is not just a threat for individual people or individual countries were all in this together and we can only save lives together6for psychiatrists this means solidarity with our patients solidarity with their families solidarity with our multidisciplinary colleagues and perhaps most of all solidarity with each other we need each other now covid-19 is the greatest public health challenge that most of us have ever encountered and hopefully it will be the worst that we ever encounter in the future how psychiatry responds to this situation will play a large part in defining the nature and role of psychiatry in the years to come the message from psychiatrys history is clear we can rise to this challenge the core values of the royal college of psychiatrists are courage innovation respect collaboration learning and excellence the covid-19 pandemic requires that we translate all of these values into actions as a matter of urgency covid-19 demands no less our patients need us now more than ever  compartmental models of the covid-19 pandemic for physicians and physician-scientists anas abou-ismail   the current outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection has reached most countries around the world and has had a devastating impact on several of them physicians of various specialties have found themselves in the eye of the storm of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 physicians and physician-scientists are working around the clock to treat infected patients educate the public about social distancing measures and test potential treatments and vaccines to fully understand the nature of the pandemic and the impact of social distancing measures one must understand the mathematics behind it one of the most relevant mathematical models relating to the spread of a pandemic is the susceptible-infectious-removed sir model and its variants unfortunately the mathematical depth of this model can seem daunting to some physicians and physician-scientists in this paper we will try to explain and simplify the mathematics behind some of these epidemiological models epidemiological studies that divide a population into compartments are called compartmental models the most commonly used of these models is the sir model this type of model has been used in several studies analyzing the spread of covid-19 58 these models help us understand how covid-19 spreads predict the regional peaks of the pandemic and understand the impact of various quarantine measures all the epidemiological models which we will discuss in this paper are based on analyzing systems of differential equations differential equations focus on the rate of change of a variable or group of variables as time passes they are found in almost all aspects of medicine they help us in dose medications understand disease spread and even dialyze patients when more than one variable is involved we usually need more than one differential equation to model a given situation these are referred to as a system of differential equations let us begin with the most basic form of sir models during a pandemic some of the most important factors to know is how fast it will spread and what measures can be taken to slow it down these impact public health policies including quarantines travel restrictions and resource allocation the sir model divides a given population into three groups susceptible infectious and removed as time passes by the number of people in each of these groups changes the number of susceptible people is highest at the very beginning of a pandemic since everyone who is not or has not been infected is considered susceptible in most cases on the other hand the number of infectious individuals is at its lowest during the beginning of a pandemic as time passes by the number of susceptible people decreases and the number of infectious people increases these changes can be modeled using differential equations let us assume that the independent variable t stands for time measured in days time is the only independent variable in this case in other words all other variables evolve as a function of time let us use s to refer to the number of susceptible individuals at any given time t another way to indicate that s is a dependent on time is to call it st similarly i or it represents the number of infectious individuals as a function of time r or rt represents the number of removed individuals as function of time removed means that they are no longer contagious either because they recovered or because they died the three dependent variables s i and r represent the three possible segments of a given population with n number of people this means that the sum of all three variables is equal to n 13 8documentclass12ptminimal

hemisphere winter and spring of 2020 we were forced into lockdown mie lives in copenhagen and alison in sydney and whilst we recognized that we were fortunate to be living the lives we were living we experienced dramatic reactions to work and school closures as mothers of children our immediate reaction was how is this going to work we took to social media to discuss our emotional outburst questioning the way in which confinement and enforced withdrawal from public life impacted us our busy family homes became busier as our children could not attend school and daycare and we were now expected to be schoolteachers and daycare teachers on top of our normal jobs it was the start of the academic year and our home became a battle ground for knowing how to manage the homework divide how do we care for our children whilst working how do we work without disruptions how do we teach from home what does it feel like welcoming our students into our homes how does flexibility work now that we are in times which on the one hand requires utmost flexibility and on the other hand reduces flexibility through confinement where are we what does being a working mum mean in the chaos that we were caught up in what are the opportunities for resistance available to us what happens if we get sick structural inequalities were being made visible in terms of paid and unpaid labour and we recognized our privilege the pandemic has surfaced and widened global structural inequalities presented through various forms of data on unemployment access to health poverty and well as inadequate sanctions and protection and health and safety provisions for workers and those most vulnerable such as the incarcerated those living in immigration detention centers those facing domestic violence and those living in densely populated slums without sanitation people were being turned away from hospitals front line workers lack safety provisions and governments were failing to enforce restrictions resulting in devastating death rates in the us italy spain uk and brazil people continue to die at astronomical rates in some countries and evidence from the usa and the uk show that bame are particularly vulnerable australia and denmark were proactive in closing borders and ensuring lockdown had good health provisions but we desperately wanted to connect with others we knew of women having to give birth alone could not travel to be with family and for us connection albeit via social media was vital a virtual space where we gathered and which provided much needed solidarity and support for some and gave a sense of purpose to our working lives where we could struggle together whilst being apart and we reflected on corona-life during these times we experienced individual and collective moments of embodied disgust and discomfort as well as new sparkles and shapes of feminist care and resistance in our socially distanced new worklives in this contribution we offer the experiences and reflections of colleagues across different geographies times and spaces which emerged from social media discussions around issues related to the inequalities and the transgressive politics that saturate our early experiences with becoming humans and living during the pandemic ironically adding to already busy work home lives we called for and collated the accounts submitted keeping their raw honesty and emotional intensity intact we present them below together and yet apart with respect and sensitivity we are grateful to each colleague for sharing their experiences experiences that matter to and are now imprinted in this text and embodied in a disconnected new academia stories snapshots vignettes images thoughts photos and other reflections of everyday life with all the struggles involved speak for themselves these accounts catch a glimpse of corona-life and its micro-politics portray the multiple often contradicting claims on practices emerging as many of us live work and care at home these days building on earlier collective powerful writing as well as writing differently ahonen et al 2020 amrouche et al 2018 just et al 2018 pullen 2018  this collective project is a coming together an entangling of multiple voices and feelings bodies within this moment this unprecedented time acutely challenges and affects not just economic markets demographic statistics or health care systems but indeed also the micro-politics of organizing and becoming in our new everyday lives at home -as partners parents employees neighbours this collective contribution elucidates and reconfigures the living working caring we are performing at home -interweaved and intersecting subjectivities and agencies embodying concerns dreams anger hope numbness passion and much more as this pandemic continues to spread across our shared globe and new worldings are in the making barad 2007 p 394 haraway 2008 pp 3 92  we feel a necessity totogether apartenact and explore constitutive relations of resistance care and solidarity in these disorganizing times of contested spaces identities and agencies as we are living-workingcaring in our homes in what follows we meet this worlding in time and space characterised by multiplicity contradiction resistance embracing and diverging meanings and matters we acknowledge that our activity could contribute to another burden of productivity in the name of a neo-liberalized academia which is also enhanced during this crisis but we hope that our contribution facilitates a collegial act of speaking up of virtually reaching out listening to and withnessing this obscure moment in time and first and foremost as an act of caring -in one way or another this was about caring to be with one another bachs st matthew passion i will sit in front of my screen turn on the video and mute my microphone and my friends will put on a recording of the passion and we will all sing along to the recording there are more than 30 of us and we look at each other a bit funny some are struggling with the technology i have spent hours in front of my screen in numerous meetings supervisions and teachings so i admit i was starting to feel a bit annoyed more people join obviously we cant hear each other but we can see each other we wont hear the music exactly at the same time so we are not as synchronised as we would normally be but we are more or less hearing the same music at the same time and adding our voices to a wonderful recording so we begin i hear the familiar intro to the theme i start moving my body to the music and then i join in with kommt ihr tchter helft mir klagen  seht wohin auf unsure schuld come daughters help me lament see where our guilt i am rusty i have not been singing so much lately so while i remember the music well my body does not remember i sit up straight trying to reconnect to my core in order to reach the high notes more beautifully and carry the phrase to the end on this good friday i seriously consider changing to singing the alto instead but i decide that though my singing is by no means beautiful i need to keep doing this and hope that the neighbours dont complain too much singing the soprano at least allows my neighbours to hear the melody rather than a middle voice this is a strange way to make music with other people i can see their faces and in some cases their whole bodies i see the mouth moving the head nodding but i dont hear them sing i cant feel them breath the sensation of other bodies in proximity is necessary for making music together to sense the person next to you preparing for the next phrase the concentration the way they inhale tells you how well they know the music in what shape their voice and body is in that moment and it tells you when they will begin and how they will end alone at home i sing i sing despite my voice being scratchy and not as solide as it used to be i sing with effort the high notes and i breathe in the middle of phrases my body is really not up for this and i am glad no one is listening actually i dont mind really it is easter im confined to my home and this is music about life and death about suffering and love about hope and despair im not religious as such but the easter narrative is powerful st matthews passion is more about the anger of a mob the injustice in society and the immanent death of christ than about resurrection and deliverance the following day we meet again in front of the screen this time much less hazzle about technology we are anxious to get started this time i sing much better and it makes me happy i can carry phrases again and hit the high notes without much effort i realise at some point we are coming close to my small solo part as the wife of pilate habe du nichts zu schaffen mit diesem gerechten ich habe heute viel erlitten im traum von seinetwegen for a moment i am transferred to my cathedral and our performance of this music in 2017 we reach the end of the passion wir setzen uns mit trnen nieder und rufen dir im grabe zu ruhe sanfte sanfte ruh tearfully we sit down and call to you in your tomb rest gently gently rest we look at each other on the screen smiling making music together even in this strange way is healing for a moment i belong to a community then i close my computer and i am home alone again its basically a serene experience because i am among the few lucky ones working at a traditional polish university true most of us do not even realize how lucky we are -instead many believe that we are old fashioned unlike the excellent anglo-saxon universities and should be changed fast to catch up there are plans to reform us to improve us starting from next academic year we should be as excellent as warwick or swansea but we are still here frozen in time not there yet not anywhere in limbo we have been working from home since 113 our rector decided about the lockdown of the university and it was announced in the middle of class by radio the students all went home then we went home too on the next day we received an email from the dean a collegially elected post by all the professors and elected senators representing more junior academics as well technical personnel and administrators addressed to all the professors asking us to use our best professional knowledge and judgement in order to teach our students to the best of our abilities under these extreme circumstances we are after all the professionals employed to solve problems including the unforeseen ones he made a list of resources and technologies available at the university as well as contacts such as it personnel and librarians the institute director also collegially elected asked us to provide assistance to the less experienced teachers should they need any he asked us to report regularly to the vice-director for teaching and so we work from home the administrators work limited hours and are asked not to share office space during the lockdown they do not work in open plans but each administrator has their own room our cleaning personnel are people employed on permanent contracts by the university they also work limited hours and in sparse shifts and are asked not to mingle i try to think of ways to engage the students without me being physically present they know me so they respond to my requests personally i know them so i know what to expect what to ask for it works i try to think of puzzles for them to solve and send them texts images films different material to dive into and use i also made sure to declare that i will be pleased to offer extra support to those who wish it a few students asked for extra literature some occasionally we send greetings to the administrators and they respond sending us pictures of empty liminal buildings its a difficult time but we are doing our best to keep the human flame alive instead of chat and coffee this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved i wake up with 34 full years on my shoulders am i wiser than yesterday no clear signs of it yet grey hair has already started appearing many years ago i take a hot shower i dont immediately remember upon waking up that we are in quarantine i had some intense dreams last night that helped attenuate the over-reflexive nostalgic mode of these last days i start realizing what is happening around me i have a look from the window but the streets look empty we have breakfast with my partner and a little after we realize we have to go to work an itinerary that has never been shorter home office is now the new routine for both of us i usually work from home anyways when i am only on research but not him so we have to re-evaluate the space and make a new routine for ourselves these last days he has been working in the living room around 17-20sm the biggest and more luminous space of our 40sm apartment we have very limited space and have to adjust as yesterday i occupy the small kitchen space to work i share the table with fruits vegetables and the indispensable kettle as long as there is hot water to make tea i i am not sure i have not seen them been much considered in the neoliberal society now they suddenly become important but many of these others still continue to put their lives and bodies at risk by going to work to provide for our groceries internet and phone connections emptying our trash etc some of them do not even have homes to go to or stable internet connections to work from home are there new inequalities emerging in this situation i wonder do these others exist do they have names bodies breaths anyways it does not seem to matter anymore now we should not touch each other nor share our breaths we are all suspects potential carriers of the killing virus is the fear of contagion what makes us important to one another do we really care for each other what are the ethical implications of this discourse this thought makes me worry about the notion of solidarity that seems to be crucial in this situation can we really be solidary if we see suspects everywhere if we embody fear for us and for others fear is a poor advisorbut it has been extensively used to shape our new routines are we maybe enemies in solidarity friends or enemies it doesnt seem to matter luckily there is technology behind our screens we can hide all of these tendencies or maybe it is the era of technologically mediated solidarity conditional upon the constant tracking of our bodies sensations expressions the words that we share in our exclusively digital ways of belonging to each other and to our new realities indeed the condition for working now is having our bodies wired all day long in front of a wi-fi-connected computer all meetings and classes pass online zoom has become the magic word these days the neoliberal academic cannot survive without this this connects isolated bodies and fits them in limited screens bodies experiencing back pain sat on a chair all day long bodies hurting sick or healthy it doesnt really matter as long as they fit the computer screen some of them appear still almost like porcelains others move some mothers appear with their kids others breast-feeding their infants others eating lunch men are usually undisturbed no surprise i sometimes avoid sharing my screen as i am not sure i am able to deal with the invasion into my private space on top i am usually in my pyjamas and dont look very professional what is this i wonder are we being daily more accustomed to the systems of surveillance that are imposed on our bodies luckily i can still write i remind myself i write these thoughts on the paper as i feel this is they only form of resistance to this technologically mediated world but a little after i read the call to this collective piece and my body shivers this is solidarity i tell myself i want to join i contact my colleague to ask for further information about the call so i now have to pass these reflections to the computer to share them with her in the other part of the ocean technology is here to save me again my body and sensations tracked again and through this care express love embody and make sense accept recognize feel share dream and connect from afar in meaningful ways for me and for otherswith others in solidarity today is the first day of home schooling-23 rd march 2020 i had all good intentions we had a schedule posted which detailed the lesson plan for the morning afternoon was to be free play in the garden like they do at school did that go well no it did not firstly i put on the joe wicks -pe at home live broadcast on you tube this was received with we dont do pe on a monday morning we do it on a monday afternoon and a thursday morning and i am not doing it after coercing them to do this on the basis i joined in unfortunately my childbearing bladder couldnt cope and after 15 minutes we gave up we then sat down to do some handwriting with the 4 year old twins while my 7yr old had time to work online with task set to him by school the girls were absolutely fine they worked well for all but 2 minutes until they wanted their snack and told me they were due play time the computer crashed after 2 minutes resulting in tears and then followed by a chorus of its not fair by all of them followed by we hate henley home school notice how i have not mentioned yet i am doing any of my work that is because i havent yet and it is now 1030am we left the house to go and do a quick shop got home to im hungry and whats for lunch served up cheese sandwiches and tomato soup to be told school dont serve this at 1230 when it should be garden and outdoor play time they are watching tv nothing educational but something that will keep them entertained for half hour-i hope i have now sat down at 130 to do some work but i have been asked no joke 600 questions ranging from -what is your favourite colour to can we make a growing chart to will you wipe my bum ive had a poo tomorrow i have online tutorials set up from 9-12pm i also have an online conference call with colleagues at 3pm wish me luck as i am going to need it any suggestions to keep the children entertained for more than 5 minutes would be gratefully received the schedule well that lasted all but an hour tomorrow maybe a bit more free flow play is required also to top my day off a speeding ticket came through after being put on hold what felt like half the day it was found that i have to take the 3 points and 100 fine on the chin because the speed awareness classes are cancelled for the foreseeable ffs update it is now 1458pm we have been for a short bike ride after connie crashing into 2 parked cars she is still learning and no damage we sacked that off too they are currently in the garden shooting waterguns at each other-it is 8 degrees outside is it too early for wine in the shower this morning i felt relief that my grandmother died before all this so we could sit by her side until the end as i think of her last days in the hospital i am hit by the risk of my 10-year-old nephew with an immune system dysfunction catching this virus my body shivers under the hot water out of the shower i walk into our bedroom dressed in underwear only to realize that the bedroom has momentarily become an office space in which my partner is in the middle of a video conference as i am standing there in underwear in my bedroom and simultaneously in a virtual meeting room of an international business corporation i wonder how to exit should i try to play it cool just excuse myself smile embarrassed instead i just turn around and disappear i want to disappear often these days but i have nowhere to disappear into i am in the middle of everything in our home that capsules our present now our living room our work space our meeting room class room supervision room technical room playroom bedroom its a materialized grey zonean intense disorganization of contested spaces that at the same time come to mean and matter a multitude of contradicting sayings doings feelings and things barad 2013  in this mix we unfold and enfold ourselves and reconfigure what and how we are becoming family members colleagues care givers it is a sense of continuous collapses and conflations of times spaces and subjectivitysinfused with anger loss devotion laughter and strangeness as i try to both be a parent a worker a lover a daughter my partners work is suffering economically from this crisis so he has to attend a lot of meetings during the day time and i have to be with the kids and do most of the home schooling and home caring like many other women currently while i feel i should be solidarity to my husbands company and its financial issuesor at least support his professional and personal investment in that i also hate the capitalist nature of this mess and the demands for a heteronormative gender-stereotypical family construction although i still am grateful for our yet stable income it hurts my feminist self-image and identity work as well as counter-produces the norm-critical ideals of gender partnership family and work organization i want my kids to grow up knowing i hate corona for this and i hate myself for thinking so much about my egocentric issues as others are battling a deadly disease shameful struggling in many ways it is as if i work all the time and none of the time as our living-working-caring spaces collapse and conflate the days usually start between 5 and 6 am the kids have been sick so most nights we have been up a few times already to offer drinks dry a nose or just for comfort my oldest daughter has had quite a few corona-related nightmares too as i get up dress the kids cook breakfast i also check my e-mail to see if there is anything urgent i need to attend to or if it can wait until laterevenings are often my working time if so the kids sometimes play other times draw listen to music or watch ipad as i steal some working time in the living room it feels like i am stealing because it demands that i ignore my kids and i sometimes snap at them if i need quietness and they are loud i hear my oldest telling my youngest dont ask her anything now she is not listening anyway and i hate the mother i am becoming likewise i wake up in the middle of the night remembering something important at work that i had forgotten and so i hate the scholar i am turning into living onoffline as co-worker parent and partner all the time in the same space i both feel a distance and nearness to everyone and everything at once in trying to make sense of the multiple selves relations and performativities i experience during these moments within the walls of our home i thinkwith fear and hopeof sara ahmeds feminist killjoy manifesto and of diversity work as banging ones head against a brick wall ahmed 2017 what to do and think when the brick wall becomes our own walls allowing outside disciplining discriminating gendering forces in or when the walls keep us inside a domestic violent suppressing or otherwise harassing home keeping you trapped or when this forces us to not just multi-task as always that is women responsible for both full time work and house hold work are used to that but also to multiply ourselves through intersecting but contradicting positionings of self and others that produces pressures and demands of practices to multiply ones identitys and agencys across social relations and gendered norms and expectation of parenthood partnership professionalism and more this leaves me both distressed and related to something more than the walls of my trying to remain productive in the press i see images of those who give care dying because of a lack of reciprocal concern my professional and personal life have been blurred by covid-19 not practically but conceptually the guiltier i feel about occupying this lucky liminal space the more i bake i wonder have i become the albatross myself and my wife are both in two risk categories for the effects of the virus age and underlying conditions so we decided to self-isolate and because of that decided to do grocery etc shopping with home delivery for the first time that was beginning of last week unfortunately the promise of that system is failing due to demand we have so far tried two retailers and having got to the stage of booking a delivery slot on three occasions on each system both had no slots available up to and including the point when options ceased to be offered in three weeks time after the first occasion we had to do as usual and physically shop in store as we needed food supplies those supplies will last for maybe another week but as of today we are still unable to book a slot for a home delivery as both retailers systems are still showing no available slots up to the point options cease to be offered if you accept the distinction a difference between rhetoric and reality in relation to official advice on what to do in the current situation another part of our story happened yesterday my wife noticed a neighbor walking up our drive and waited for the knock on the door it didnt come instead the neighbor slipped a leaflet through our letter box the leaflet describes and gives contact information for a local to our village volunteer group set up to provide help to elderly and vulnerable households an example is doing shopping for households that are self-isolating such initiatives are springing up all over the uk according to the leaflet our local group is being sponsored financially supported eg paying for printing the leaflets and for fuel for shopping runs by a local company we have yet to contact the group but it might well be our only means of accessing future food supplies this group and others like it are i think an example of communities taking action and control outside of established and formal leadership and power structures noun the characteristic of being homesick a strong sad feeling of missing ones home often left-behind loved ones such as family and friends when physically away retrieved 12 april 2020 from httpswwwyourdictionarycomhomesickness as i sit here to write this piece trying to explain how i feel all i can think about is how much i miss being home tomorrow april 14 2020 marks the beginning of my 4 th month living in canada away from brazil away from home my journey to canada started with my phd in brazil since when we begin our phd we hear how wonderful and important for our career and for our personal growth is to spend some time abroad so since i started my phd living abroad brazil was a goal as an academic however being someone coming from a very simpleand far away from the elitesfamily was a dream spending time abroad would allow me to experience a new culture a new life and to develop my skills as a critical researcher since last year this dream was coming true when i got a scholarship to spend six months in quebec canada i moved from brazil to canada in december coincidentally in a friday 13which can be read as a bad sign for those who believe it and everything was amazing -even better than i ever dreamt of in order to fulfill this dream i knew there was a price to pay spend time away from home from my family and from my friends family may have different meanings to different people but for me a family is a group of people who you can count on no matter what is a group of people you love and love you back in my opinion and experience family doesnt necessarily need to share the same dna or blood the price i knew was high but i thought it would be ok to pay it after all it would be only six months and i live away from my parents house since 2012 so i thought it would be an affordable price for the amazing experience everyone always talked about it i arrived in quebec in the morning of december 14 2019 it was a cold and rainy day i was exhausted from the trip but at the same time i was excited for the new thing that were waiting for me this first day was a really nice day my brazilian phd supervisor was also in quebec for a post-doctoral stage and picked me up at the airport drove me to the airbnb i would spend my first nights took me out to have lunch and to know the neighborhood i was staying and by night to have dinner with some brazilian friends the next day early in the morning my canadian phd supervisor took me out shopping for winter clothes after all i was coming from brazil that in december is usually 35c so i needed new clothes to a city that it reaches -30c after we were done shopping we had a hot chocolate and a quick view of the citywhich was amazing the journey was being wonderful new friends new language new culture discovering new things about myself learning a lot but then march 11th happened we have covid-19 pandemics since then the dream became a nightmare im in a good country with a good health system but im away from my family canadas government is taking serious measures to handle covid-19 but the brazilian government isnt bolsonaro the brazilian president called covid-19 a little flu and isnt dealing with it as he should since march 11th i felt lonely i wanted to go home i cried i felt anxious and a lot of mixed feelings i worry about myself being in another country that its not mine but at the same time i worry about my family and friends and everyone else who are living in a country where the president doesnt give a fuck about peoples health some big company owners are even saying in the media that 5000 to 7000 deaths are a low price to pay compared to the damage brazilian economy will suffer from people getting quarantined -and both the president and economy minister feels the same since everything started i see people going from someone to numbers this situation has put everything into a new perspective because i think that sometimes we forget how fragile a life is and covid-19 is here to remind us i also think that sometimes we care so much about work that we forget to tell people around us how much they mean to us at the same time this situation has put me in some tensions i should take care of myself but im also worried about others so how can we take care of others and of ourselves at the same time i feel that im also facing this tension because im privileged to be in canada while my dad goes to work every day since he works in a factory that didnt stop im privileged enough because while canadian politicians are treating the pandemic with due seriousness some brazilian politicians are calling it a chinese conspiracy to dominate the economy im privileged enough to be in canada while the brazilian president when asked about the thousands of covid 19 related deaths answered to the media so what this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved in order to occupy my mind and not to think about the what ifs im reading a lot im writing a lot but some days like this weekend -easter a very dear day for so many people and families mine including - i feel hopeless and overburdened  among my coping strategies i decided to write a paper about covid-19 trying to make sense of it i also call my dad every day among my strategies are also talking to friends and trying to focus on my ongoing research projects despite all my efforts its been a hard time because at the same time i want to go home i know that i shouldntor either canbecause i can get covid-19 during the trip back home since march 11th all i can think talk read and write about is covid-19 because its all over the internet and at the same time im trying to make sense of everything that is happening and everything that will and may happen no matter how much i talk about it no matter how supportive people have been in trying to understand my situation i feel like no one is going through the same pressures and worries i am so since march 11 th i feel a lot of things but most of the time i feel homesick we wait and we wait life suspended and still grateful for the slowing down of usual routines the days blur days become strangely and intensely busy  i thought i would manage working from home because academics are supposed to be used to it but this does not feel like working from home its more like being at home and trying to do your job but without the infrastructure sharing the kitchen with three other household members also trying to do their jobs andor study or cookeat while i talk means i must move to our bedroom for meetings so as not to disturb everyone else perched on the end of the bed with my feet resting on a shoe box and the computer propped up on a stand in front of me i spend hour after hour staring at zoom i had thought of the bedroom as a quiet space for reading and relaxing no screens but that is no longer true -and not just for me the bedroom has ceased to be a relaxing place for my partner too because i am in it in meetings and in the semi-darkness with the blinds down so i can focus on the tiny faces on the screen in front of me work and home boundaries have become truly blurred i had thought corridor chats and coffees at work were an opportunity for social time -i did not appreciate how important these were in supporting the work we do and i miss them struggling with the small screen my eyes sting as i try to manage large documents on a lap top i miss the monitors in my office but i may not go and fetch them i thought i would manage working from home because i am supposed to be used to it but it turns out this is not quite the case i did not realise how reliant i am on library space to write now closed or how used i had become to working at home alone while others were at work or school sharing the space and limited internet bandwidth between us all at home is not quite the same thing i thought with so many in person meetings and conferences cancelled i would have more time i did not allow for the proliferation of zoom meetings that would so quickly take up our lives tying us literally with the wire that connects headphones to the computer and as for students -i am so sorry their university experience is spoiled and no amount of on-line anything can make up for this how many imagined they would take their degrees and exams and celebrate the end of exams sitting at their parents kitchen table no summer balls or barbecues for this generation somehow we are getting on with it it doesnt feel like we have a choice but i hope this is not the way forward for the future as i sit with the blinds drawn talking with colleagues and students also hunched over screens it feels as if we have become moles living underground and in the dark i hope we may soon come up for air and that this way of working wont become a blueprint for our or our students future the first day of spring 21 march two days ago on thursday evening we got the news that my fatheran alzheimers patient in a nursing homehad a high fever 394 degrees celsius he had symptoms of the coronavirus as programme director i had been working all day to manage the implications of the virus for our department eg i sent a letter to the 300 masters students who are currently conducting their thesis research and another to their supervisors i received 115 emails and managed to answer most of them i had been on the phone skype a conference call and zoom in between those activities i talked with my son and two daughters one of them possibly had the virus but didnt feel so bad i tried to convince my teenage daughter to hold off on declaring her summer holiday in favour of her homework i was worried and because i couldnt sleep but felt physically well i worked on a tell a story forcing her to pause halfway through a longer sentence to catch her breath it turns her fingernails blue it feels like a brick weighing down on their chests my oldest daughter has been self-quarantining in our house and my wife now shares the virus in solidarity its odd theyre cheerful and dont look ill but a few days ago when things seemed to take a turn for the worse my wife packed a bag in case she had to go to hospital and we had the what-if conversation without our usual jokes but she somehow rose from the grave and this morning they both walked 400 meters back home however they looked like they had run a marathon after dinner we watched a film house arrest can be good for family life now im feeling guilty for persuading them to watch a film that made them cry the aeroplane-free air in amsterdam seems so much cleaner these days and still i find myself wondering who are these people the ones who actually have time to think and reflectto enjoy this luxury i guess latour didnt get a chance to talk to my neighbour ascension day may 21 in an online meeting earlier this week a colleague suggested we draw lessons from the crisis we all agreed which lessons we settled on fewer and shorter meetings that day we not only used the full two hours scheduled for our meeting we also failed to finish in time in a private chat message a colleague joked such an efficient meeting in the post-war reconstruction of continental europe after wwii the hope for a better world that had built up during the war eventually vanished in the hard work that was needed to restore the economy am i now immune to postalgic views of a better world this crisis simply seems to be a lesson in appreciating what carlos drummond de andrade called a lesser life a minimal essential life no distant horizons just the foreseeable future no big leaps for mankind sometimes quite literally today i went for a walk with my daughter she still cant walk 400 meters but todays 260 is 10 small steps more than yesterday well get there eventually what does a safe space look like weve been homebound for the last six weeks or so although its tremendously difficult to know when the blurring of days started and what day were actually experiencing at the moment the usual time demarcations are no longer functioning the signals we get around when its time to work to play to relax and so forth frankly these demarcations never seem to apply to some people anyway those who have more than one shift at home or at work the second or even third shifter there are many right now who have to leave their home to work out there given theyre deemed essential workers what does essential mean im still not quite sure it is a type of work that allows other work to take place or the type of work that sustains us as humans like food or artyet it seems that what constitutes essential differs between different states in the us which is where we live the news constantly shows how people are dealing with their various situation including those who are literally protesting to continue working to get haircuts to go to golf clubs-there is an upheaval going on around the role and meaning of government and the ways we think democracy should work in the us tyranny is being brought up often by white people with firearms who claim that their individual rights are being trampledi have family members who are black and they do not feel safe going to stores with masks for fear of being labeled criminals ive also married into an asian-american family taiwanese to be specific and they fear being targeted as well for bringing the virus from china this all seems like systemic tyranny no these thoughts consume me daily and are broken up with the sound of a door opening from the garage theres collective breath-holding in our home as my husband enters the house and declares i had to intubate covid patients today and starts his disinfection routine hes staying in a different part of the house now it seems no matter what we do the virus can potentially come to us to our home ironically through the very person whos helping patients during a terrible time intubation is risky business it is also incredibly difficult and violent the sort of thing they cant show you on tv or on social media due to privacy laws and its what my husband does now hoping to be safe while doing it hoping he will have enough gear it makes me angry to know that we the collective kind of we were unable to prepare for the virus because science and scientific knowledge are now looked upon with suspicion the utter failure of our educational systems to create critical thinkers on fully display globally anxious thoughts thats what i have on a daily basis-so i bake i write i spend time with my children 247 and sometimes i get work done the elderly and the at risk are vulnerable to covid-19 in the uk the government this week will write to 15million people considered to be at particular risk advising them to selfisolate my older sister is one of those 15million as she has leukemia knowing that though is only one of my concerns my mum is in her 90s and needs care and attention and her risk is exacerbated as she does not understand or perhaps does not think that the governments requirement that we stay at home apply to her my daughter who is in her early 20s is undergoing testing for crones disease or she was until the lock down happened crones is on the list of that defines the 15 million who must self-isolate but with her diagnosis incomplete we do not know if she is at risk three generationsmy entire nuclear familymay be at risk but where we only know that one is considered so by the government and national health system we know too much whilst knowing too little i know this knowing this is repeated every day and i cant escape knowing it but that is not all that i know i also know that my elderly mother needs help and care i provide that care and in doing so i cannot self-isolate i need to see her and may contract the virus on the one journey i make beyond my front door each day a journey where i may unwittingly contract the virus and in turn infect my mother knowing that if she contracts it she may well die but if i dont go she can not cope and she will have to go outside if i see her i may be the cause of her death if i dont my neglect may be the cause of her death i know this knowing this is repeated every day and i cant escape knowing it i was diagnosed with inherited emphysema some 15 years ago the consultant told me my diagnosis and ended with the words well you now know what will kill you unless you get hit by a bus in a state of shock i mumbled my thanks for his crass behaviour each year i receive an annual flu jab because i am on an at risk list every few years my lung function is tested and i am asked if i want to start taking a steroidal inhaler each time i refuse i do not need a daily reminder of what may kill me and so far it has not drawn close enough for me to be on a list of serious emphysema cases i am not one of the 15 million but i am still advised to self-isolate this i know five years earlier i had visited my father in a south african military hospital where he lay dying of emphysema yeats told us that we are but a bunch of sticks and that is what i saw my father brought down to grey parchment stretched thin over a frame of sticks already dead whilst not yet quite there still sighing by mechanical intervention breath drawn out and pumped in by tubes in a cyborg intervention he asked me to forgive him for how he had treated me as a young child i did not then and i do not now i did not want to know then this ungrateful child still does not forgive what i did not know 20 years ago was what i now know my future my most likely death parchment and sticks inflated mechanically as air sighs out and death rushes in this i know the university that i work for posts a covid-19 update daily for staff it now informs staff to work from home unless they are essential to operations it also advises staff at risk to selfisolate and work from home work during covid-19 was moving on-campus to off campus delivery but now just a few days later it has become anything palpably different anything you can do is now regarded publicly as sufficient work living surviving coping managing risk just being here are all defined now not just as work but enough work am i churlish if i ask why that was never regarded as work before covid-19 why was it that when i was homeless rough sleeping unemployed in poverty and at risk of abuse and assault that just surviving was never regarded as work let alone enough work we are so fucked up as a society that we need a pandemic to realise that merely surviving precarity is hard work we are so fucked up as a society that knowing this now still does not stop us regarding this as exceptional work that requires specific acknowledgement tolerance and official acceptance and when this pandemic is over i know that society will most likely return to an abhorrent normality where the precarious marked as lazy and feckless in their exceptional non-work this may come to pass teaching and supervising on-line is not new to me i have spent ten years designing and delivering distance learning what is different is that others now receive training and support and anything is regarded as sufficient what was once exceptional becomes the norm in a centripetal rush from the marginalised to the centre that does not track a processual movement but an orbital decay where to paraphrase yeats the margin may not hold will this come to pass it already has come to pass in one uk university which having moved its teaching on-line now seeks to dismiss its temporary academic staff the work having been done that university no longer has need for those who worked so hard in these dark days it instead amplifies their precarity and establishes it work as precarious for many now deemed not as exceptional but as a fungible excess to be removed but must it come to pass do we accept as feminists that this return to precarity for the vulnerable is an acceptable state to bolster the privileges of the few do we accept the deaths of our loved ones as collateral damage required to save capitalism or do we know different i know i will die i know how i most likely will die what happens between now and my death however can be different to what has passed a better world is possible this i know it is a privilege to write these words this archive is important as a way to thinking through to document as well as to share and to care for how we embody and experience this time glimpses into our academic communitythe ways in which home and work private and public spaces collide our lives have sped up and slowed down the covid-19 virus may not have infected us yet but it certainly has affected our worlds the words offered here are connecting yet suspended in time allow us to use words to suspend doing knowing and unknowing silences and screams of frustration the power of collective writingwords gathering momentum sitting alongside each other with each other for each other  how lethal is the novel coronavirus and how many undetected cases there are the importance of being tested ugo bastolla  there is big concern for estimating the lethality and the extent of undetected infections associated with the novel coronavirus sars-cov2 outbreak while detailed epidemiological models are certainly needed i suggest here an orthogonal approach based on a minimum number of parameters robustly fitted from the cumulative data easily accessible for all countries at the john hopkins university database that became the worldwide reference for the pandemics i show that after few days from the beginning of the outbreak the apparent death rate can be extrapolated to infinite time through regularized regression such as rescaled ridge regression the variation from country to country of these extrapolated death rates appears to depend almost only r 2  091 on the ratio between performed tests and detected cases even when the apparent instantaneous lethality rates are as different as 9 in italy and 04 in germany extrapolating to the limit of infinite number of tests i obtain a death rate of 0012  0012 in agreement with other estimates the inverse relationship between the extrapolated death rate and the intensity tests allows estimating that more than 50 of cases were undetected in most countries with more than 90 undetected cases in countries severely hit by the epidemics such as italy finally i propose to adopt the ratio between the cumulative number of recovered and deceased persons as an indicator that can anticipate the halting of the epidemics  the pandemic spread of the novel coronavirus sars-cov2 is causing thousands of fatalities creating a tremendous threat to global health 1  in this situation the society is strongly concerned by the lethality and the true extension of the pandemics see for instance 2 3  in the media but also in some non-specialist scientific circles it is frequent to find that lethality is estimated as the cumulative number of deaths divided by the cumulative number of confirmed cases data that are easily accessible to everyone in the internet this quantity changes rapidly and systematically both in time and in space generating doubts and concerns regarding its interpretation of course epidemiologists can estimate the lethality rate in a less biased way with additional data on the dates in which the infections of the persons that die or recover were detected and better sampling of the population however these data are not easily accessible for all countries therefore here i set up to obtain an estimate of the lethality rate and the detection rate only based on the data reported for all countries in the john hopkins university database 4  this extrapolation of the data shows that when the time course of the disease is controlled for the lethality estimated for all countries for which reliable data are available depends only on the intensity of the performed tests ie the number of tests divided by the number of positive case extrapolating to infinite number of tests i estimate a lethality rate of 0012  0012 which is very noisy but consistent with the estimate of 001 that is frequently mentioned in the media inverting the relationship between apparent death rate and number of tests it is possible to estimate that in all countries except south korea and perhaps germany at least at the beginning of the spread the vast majority of positive cases went undetected with more than 90 percent undetected cases in some countries such as italy these cases that went out of the radar and were not isolated are likely to have contributed strongly to the rapid spread of the virus finally i propose to adopt the ratio between the cumulative number of recovered and the cumulative number of deceased persons as a potential indicator that can anticipate whether the spread of the epidemics is halting the ratio between the number of death and the number of confirmed cases is clearly an underestimate of the lethality because it assumes that all the presently infected people will eventually recover but it is also an overestimate because it assumes that all the extant infections are detected to mitigate the first problem it is possible to extrapolate the lethality to the infinite time when all the infected cases are resolved the asymptotic lethality rate d is the fraction of present confirmed cases n  that are already deceased d plus the presently infected persons i  n  r  d that will eventually die d  d  d 1 in  dn  d  d 1 n  r  dn here r is the cumulative number of recovered persons if we assume that d 1 is constant we can estimate the parameters d and d 1 through linear regression of the apparent death rate dn versus the infected fraction 1  r  dn  the assumption of constant d 1 is not realistic in the initial stage of the epidemics but it becomes more and more accurate as time passes as the data from china shows a technical point i regularize the linear regression with the method of rescaled ridge regression 5  this regularization produces accurate fits while limiting the values of the fitted parameters without regularization the extrapolated death rate d would be rather large while the assumption of constant d 1 is expected to lead to overestimate d in particular in the initial stages of the epidemics the fitted value of d 1 is similar to but always smaller than d which appears reasonable in fact the persons that die first belong to the classes with higher death rate such as the elder and the sick figure 1 shows the curves of dn as a function of the infected fraction these curves are reasonably linear for large time for most countries the apparent death rate dn 2  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity strongly depends on the number of performed tests as i shall show below and since this number is not constant as for instance data from italy show therefore i fit the lethality rate at the time t12 march at which data on the tests are available for most countries 6 solid lines in fig 1  from these fits i extrapolate the parameter d at the date of 12 march provided that two conditions hold at t the ratio between cumulative recoveries and cumulative deaths rd is at least 09 and dt  10 when these conditions are not met the asymptotic death rate d is clearly overestimated if the above conditions are not met i perform a regularized fit over the whole time range dashed lines in fig 1  and again i accept the result only if rd  09 and d  10 at the last available time for only seven countries i could find data on the number of tests and at the same time i could extrapolate the death rate fulfilling the above conditions japan south korea malaysia italy spain france and switzerland the extrapolated d is plotted in fig2 as a function of the number of confirmed cases n divided by the number of tests t for the seven countries for which d can be reliably estimated you can see that all countries fall on the same straight line d  d 0  ant  this means that the huge apparent differences between the low mortality rates of countries like south korea or germany and the high mortality rate of countries like italy can be fully explained by the time course of the epidemics and the number of tests without the fig2 also reports data for china germany and australia in the case of china i could only find the number of tests performed in the guangdong province and estimated that the number of tests performed in the whole country was 3 times larger if this estimate is approximately correct the data suggests that the mortality rate of china is smaller than for other countries which could be attributed to two factors 1 the chinese population is significantly younger for instance only 12 of the chinese population has more than 65 years compared to 23 for italy 2 china is closer to the extinction of the epidemics where the extrapolation at infinite time becomes quite accurate while at smaller time the extrapolation probably and hopefully overestimates the mortality rate for germany i could only find the number of tests performed in private laboratories and estimated the total number of tests as the double of this number  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity moreover the fit over the whole time range yielded negative extrapolated death rate and at 12 of march it was dt  2 so that the estimate reported in the plot is probably an overestimate finally for australia it was d  3 at march 12 and d  7 at the last available day despite these three data are not reliable they do not deviate too much from the general trend fig3  one can see that this fraction is substantially larger than 50 for most countries and it is larger than 90 for some countries like italy we examine more in detail the effect of the number of tests for the italian data in fig4  using the data made available by its health ministery 7 one can see that the number of tests per confirmed cases decreased with time a as the consequence both of the saturation of resources and of the decision to test only syntomatic subjects march 25th which was probably unfortunate since it left the majority of cases uncovered as the number of tests decreased the apparent instantaneous mortality rate dn increased b again in agreement with the linear relationship dn    nt  the non-5  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the apparent instantaneous mortality rate dn increased when the test intensity t n decreased as dn    nt  we report both the non-regularized fit dashed and rescaled ridge regression solid c fraction of confirmed cases that were weak enough to be treated at home versus t n  d estimated fraction of undetected cases versus t n  regularized linear fit produces the unphysical parameter   00136 whereas rescaled ridge regression yields   00029 fig4b  note that this low instantaneous mortality rate only takes into account those that are already dead at time t and does not consider the extrapolated mortality once again extrapolated to infinite number of tests data from italy are consistent with the much lower apparent mortality rates observed in germany as the intensity of tests decreased the fraction of confirmed cases that were weak enough to be treated at home at first decreased and then increased again fig4c  possibly as the consequence of the almost saturation of the health system that encouraged patients in not too serious conditions to stay at home finally the estimated fraction of undetected cases u increased with decreasing t n fig4d  this is of course not surprising since u is computed from t n  the aim of the figure is only to quantify the expected impact of reducing the intensity of tests which appears to be modest finally making one step back fig5 shows the ratio between the cumulative number of recovered persons and the cumulative number of deaths rtdt this ratio shows complex dynamics that contradicts the simplifying assumption of constant d 1  the data suggest that rd decreases with time when the epidemics spreads exponentially ultimately reaching a plateau and it increases with time in the final stages in which the epidemics spreads slowly which unfortunately is only evident in the data of china south korea and perhaps japan thus the increase of rd might provide an indicator of the halting of the epidemics that is less delayed than the number of deaths alone and less affected by the number of tests than the confirmed cases unfortunately the john hopkins university database recently stopped the update of the number of recovered persons possibly because for many countries this data is not sufficiently reliable the following is hand-waving reasoning that rationalizes why rtdt tends to decrease in the exponential phase until reaching a plateau denoting by nt the number of people that get the infection at time t and assuming that death takes exactly t d days we can estimate the number of people that die at time t as dt  d 0 nt  t d  analogously we can estimate the number of recovered people as where t r is the time that it takes to recover and f is the fraction of non-lethal infections that are detected and monitored we assume that this fraction is 1 for infections that result in death when nt increases exponentially as expt  the cumulative variables dt  dt and rt  rt also increase exponentially so we obtain in the exponential phase here d 0  0012 so the first factor is estimated to be 82f that is probably larger than 1 depending on f  note that this expression does not depend on t however both t d and t r are expected to depend on the age group so that t d decreases for older people and t r increases we hypothesize that in the initial stage the deaths tend to affect younger persons who travel more and have more social contacts while at a later stage they affect more the elders while people that recover tend to be of the same age throughout the epidemics these assumptions imply that t d  t r decreases with time producing the observed exponential decrease of rtdt until the age distribution of people that die and recover becomes stationary at this point rd becomes approximately constant in the exponential phase as observed in fig5 in the curves from italy and spain data to test the above hypotheses should be available on the other hand when the epidemics stops to spread exponentially we expect that rtdt increases since t r tends to be larger than t d  so at the end of the epidemics there is a reservoir of infected people that slowly recover while people that eventually die reach saturation sooner therefore the systematic increase of rtdt with time may be an early warning that the spread of the epidemics is not spreading exponentially anymore as suggested by data from china and south korea the main result of this work is that due to the reduced number of performed tests the vast majority of the coronavirus infections went undetected in most countries these undetected infections had the potential to spread freely in the population giving raise to the rapid exponential phase of the epidemics before the lockout measures this result is consistent with recent reports from china 8 9  and with the high rates of asymptomatic but positive cases observed in vo euganeo italy 10 in the cruise ship diamond princess 11 and among children 12 see also 13  the only countries that were able to keep the fraction of undetected infections low appear to be south korea and germany which explains their better ability to control the 7  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  epidemics in the initial stages unfortunately in germany the infection is now spreading exponentially and the tracing of all infections is not anymore a viable option without lockout measures while the perceived low mortality rate at the initial stage of the infection may act against the adoption of these necessary measures  critical community size for covid-19 -a model based approach to provide a rationale behind the lockdown sarmistha das bandana sen indranil mukhopadhyay   research in context several countries have resorted to restrictive mass quarantine or lockdown as it has been proved to be the most effective strategy to fight against the prevailing sars-cov2 or covid-19 pandemic to prevent stage iii spreading of the virus or human-to-human transmission various countries have imposed variable number of lockdown days that ranges from 2  4 weeks depending on the real-time situation various nations are updating on their lockdown period however it was not possible to determine or predict accurately the ideal number of lockdown days in advance as we are all fighting against a novel virus still based on the nature of pandemics and epidemics in the past and the successful mode of encounter with them the human race has learnt how to fight out the disease in absence of any specific treatment mostly on the basis of the average incubation period of sars-cov2 virus countries have devised the phase of lockdown in the present day the covid-19 pandemic figures from developed countries have surpassed the figures from china from where this infection had originated in such a dire situation it is very difficult to propose quintessential lockdown period specific to any country the whole world is struggling to obtain unbiased data to predict on the pandemic but even then many questions arise in our minds as will the implemented number of lockdown days eradicate the virus or will it come soon again after the lockdown is over or like how soon will the next wave of infection occur if it comes back again answer to these questions lies in the idea of critical community size ccs from soper 1 and bartletts 2 3 works in 1920s and 1950s added value of this study our study provides a rationale behind the determination of the lockdown period in different countries going through the catastrophic effect of the pandemic moreover we provide country-wise expected time to extinction tte of the disease and the number of people who could safely stay together or quarantine themselves together in clusters the most interesting observation from our study is that the lockdown of 2 weeks or more country-specific will eradicate the disease almost completely we term this period as temporary eradication of spread time test for disease which is much less than the tte of the disease but there will be more waves of infection after different period of time in different countries soothing part from our deduction is that the virus will not be able to create any havoc on its return implications of all the available evidence in this scenario of utter dilemma with the available world-wide data we have provided country-wise estimates of the ideal lockdown phases using our proposed mathematical model to the best of our knowledge any guideline for country-wise mathematical prediction of lockdown days is not available till date so as the famous british statistician george e p box pointed out all models are wrong but some are useful we only hope that our deductions will provide some helpful suggestion to the world where we are all struck in the pandemic in the face of covid-19 pandemic many countries have implemented restrictive mass quarantines or lockdown as the primary controlling measure to confine the number of secondary transmission of the disease within countries in absence of any specific medicine to treat the disease patients are given supportive care to help them breathe but given the mode of transmission of the epidemic health care systems of even developed countries are crumbling down within a week or two so along with many other countries densely populated india has resorted to complete lockdown for 3 weeks to prevent stage iii transmission of the disease available data confirms that the pandemic has affected a million people in around 200 countries till date and already claimed more than 005 million lives across the world within approximately two months after world health organisation who declared the outbreak as a pandemic many countries initiated partial to complete lockdown as done in some provinces of china after the outbreak started and by the end of march one-third of the global population is under some form of lockdown many countries implemented variable number of lockdown days but no country has come up with any magic figure for the ideal period of lockdown no clear-cut guideline or rationale behind the number of lockdown days has been announced by any country or who till date to the best our knowledge the period of 2 -4 weeks is determined mostly on the trial and error basis the prediction on the number of trial lockdown days could be possibly and partially based on the fact that an affected individual could be contagious in the first 14 days of contracting the disease and the number of known positive cases at the time of taking decision idea of quarantining a small group of people after an epidemic outbreak to arrest the disease dates back to 1950s when english statistician ms bartlett introduced critical community size bartlett 2 3 proposed the idea that if the susceptible population is below a certain some threshold the infection is as likely as not to die out after a period of time after the epidemic outbreak in small communities unless the disease is reintroduced from outside bartlett termed this threshold as critical community size ccs in the present context ccs could guide government  health policy makers with an objective strategy of lockdown period as opposed to subjective trial and error phases of lockdown after an epidemic outbreak in a community the infection persists long enough to engulf the entire susceptible population local extinction of the disease could be possible if the susceptible population gets depleted in large communities the tendency of eventual damp down of the recurrent epidemics is balanced by random variability but in small communities the infection would die out when the number of susceptible falls below a certain threshold which is the ccs only a limited number of works 4 5 including our work under review are available on ccs may be because it involves complicated calculations even for simplest mathematical model viz si s susceptible i infected model however since the actual extent of an epidemic can be assessed only retrospectively it is essential to calculate the ccs for covid-19 based on a realistic model that depends on the parameters which could be determined for a specific locality we propose an seir s susceptible e exposed i infected r recovered model to explain the disease dynamics of covid-19 we have derived with evidence the rationale behind the importance and extent of the lockdown period and also the number of people who could safely stay together in this lockdown phase in absence of much prior knowledge on the disease we have to rely on the mathematical predictions to combat the virus in this article we provide a cautionary note from the mathematical deductions that this pandemic will last more than an year and may start afresh again our work resonates the leaked news in the american daily the new york times httpswwwnytimescom20200317uspoliticstrump-coronavirus-planhtml that official authority as well as experts anticipates that the pandemic will last 18 months or longer and could include multiple waves of infection but there is always a ray of hope this nature of epidemic is also seen previously after sars or mers outbreak our deduction reveals that there is nothing to panic as the lockdown if properly followed could almost wipe out the disease and the next wave of infection will not really recur as an alarming pandemic although we have to bear the burden of economic sluggishness or downfall the covid-19 epidemic could be controlled and hopefully wont create a public health emergency in the near future we propose an seir model to explain the dynamics of covid-19 infection the entire population is divided into four compartments these compartments are mutually exclusive in the sense that no person can belong to more than one compartment at any time point the four compartments are susceptible individuals s individuals with and without symptoms of the disease but not yet tested positive for covid-19 e infected individuals who are clinically tested positive i and individuals who are known to have recovered from the disease r note that an individual belonging to class e may transmit the disease during the incubation period which is approximately 1-14 days under this situation we consider the model as here  represents the contact rate for covid-19 transmission from infected to susceptible individuals  is the proportion of the exposed who could transmit the disease an individual in e moves to i at the rate   is the recovery rate d is death rate due to the disease and  is the natural birthdeath rate in the population here   n t where n t is the population size at time t the most important quantity in this type of model is the basic reproduction number which is our method of evaluation of ccs depends on the parameters of the model and it involves a series of mathematical derivation and processes see supplementary material first we develop a fully stochastic model corresponding to the deterministic model 1- 4  assuming quasi-stationarity and non-extinction of infection we derive expected tte ie e q  of the disease e q  involves some probability terms that we evaluate using diffusion approximation of the scaled state variables s e i r  q is a function of the ccs we derive quasi-periodt 0 say in terms of angular frequency that is obtained using linearised system at equilibrium points then using the relation e q  log 2 t 0  4 we could finally evaluate the ccs for the system note that this ccs is a function of the parameters involved in the model that vary from country to country even from one region to another thus ccs is not any unique value for all regions or countries note that the calculation of ccs involves a series of complicated processes and mathematics that demand few approximations at some stages so we also did simulations with realistic parameter values for different countries the simulation study matches with the theoretical findings for covid-19 transmission we have calculated the ccs and tte of the disease based on our proposed seir model note that the value of the ccs is approximate as we have made some mathematical approximation while applying diffusion approximation to find the quasi-stationary distribution the value of ccs for a community or a country depends on the model parameters specific to that community we deduce these parameters from the available information on covid-19 till date actual fatality rate due to any epidemic could only be calculated after the epidemic gets over but in the middle of the pandemic it is difficult to assess so we determine the country-specific death rate d based on the number of deaths up to april 01 2020 and the total number of infected individuals till 7 days prior to this date here we assume that covid-19 patients do not die within the first seven 7 days after detection different countries have implemented varying criteria of discharging covid-19 patients from hospitals httpswwwecdceuropaeusitesdefaultfilesdocuments covid-19-discharge-criteriapdf making the actual recovery rate very tricky to calculate amid the pandemic it is yet unknown whether all the discharged patients have fully recovered from the disease or they got sick again shortly after httpswwwcdc govcoronavirus2019-ncovhcpfaqhtml so we have assumed the recovery rate  based on the number of recovered patients up to april 01 2020 and the total number of infected individuals till 14 days prior to this date the country-specific death and recovery rates are obtained from httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus on exposure to covid-19 infected patient when a person gets infected the virus itself makes enough copies of itself in the host that is the person who was exposed to the infected patient within some time which the host begins to shed through coughs or sneezes or other transmission methods assuming that within the time taken by the virus to replicate itself the host will not shed the virus out of its body and hence the host will not be contagious within this period this time is usually little more than one day of the exposure so we have assumed that after day 1 of the exposure to the virus the host becomes contagious ie an exposed person has 93 chance of transmitting the infection as that of an infected person since the incubation period of covid-19 is 14 days we take   1  1 14  093 another very tricky and country dependent parameter is the rate of detection of positive cases from among the exposed pool of people ie percentage of exposed people that are actually tested to be covid-19 positive in absence of manpower and testing kits in such a dire situation we will not be able to know the actual proportion of the exposed who could later on become covid-19 patient we have assumed it to be 30 across the world that is   03 the rate of natural birth or death is taken as   0015 that stabilises the population under normal scenario in absence of actual contact rate  we have assumed  over a feasible range of values we represent the country-wise ccs and expected tte of the disease in figure 1  for example the ccs for belgium represented by the brown line in figure 1a  lies between 34 and 52 while the expected tte of the disease represented by the brown line in figure  1c  varies between 500 and 693 days for different contact rates in the range 031 to 037 therefore for a particular contact rate   037 say the ccs of belgium is 34 means that if the susceptible population of any community in belgium is below 34 the infection will die out unless it is re-introduced from outside after the corresponding expected tte which is 599 days but we observe that the number of infections falls below 05 after around 16 days when the community size of quarantined people drops to the ccs value 34 as shown in figure  2  thus in this case the disease gets nearly eradicated after 16 days but it may come back again like any other epidemic disease before actually becoming extinct however after test it will not likely to create a pandemic as in the current situation we observe that the number of infections drops below 05 after around 15  30 days in most of the countries for example in india we observe that test is 24 days figure 3  so even if the expected tte of the disease is more than an year it will almost cease to exist after a few days if the rates of transmission of the disease could be kept low as in the prevailing lockdown situation the ccs and expected tte for a few other countries like spain germany france and canada are given in figure 1a  1c along with belgium respectively figure 1b  1d represent respectively the ccs and expected tte of countries viz india austria malaysia hong kong and turkey we present country-specific objective lockdown periods based on our model in table 1  figure 2  tte of belgium is 599 days corresponding to ccs of 34 but the disease almost becomes extinct at test that is around 17 days multiple waves of infection are likely to occur before tte but that will be unable to create a pandemic as in the current situation the earlier the lockdown starts the better it is for any community with the delay in the number of days to initiate lockdown time for the disease to slow down will increase in the absence of any specific treatment to covid-19 before any country enters stage iii of the epidemic in absence of vaccination or any specific treatment complete quarantine will be able to contain the disease from spreading further our work suggests that if people are figure 3  for india the test or required lockdown period is 24 days but the estimated tte is around 593 days india is likely to have another wave of infection after around a year but that will be unable to create a pandemic as in the current situation quarantined in small groups presented by country-specific ccs the disease will become extinct after the corresponding expected tte but it becomes almost extinct after around test so lockdown should to be taken very seriously to fight against the pandemic this paper provides evidence of the fact that even after the lockdown phase multiple waves of the disease will re-occur but it will not create pandemic situation in the present situation where contact tracing of the infected has attracted worldwide attention to trace down the exposed individuals we suggest to quarantine them in groups as small as country-specific ccs so that after 15  30 days as specified for each country the disease would become almost extinct unless any infection is re-introduced from outside there could be some mathematical limitations due to some approximations in the calculation of ccs and expected tte of the disease but the approximations are inevitable and do not affect much the actual ccs or tte as reflected from our numerical evaluation another undeniable consequence of the current pandemic is the great negative impact on the economy this is further magnified due to almost paralysed transactions in many sectors due to lockdown moreover there is a fear among the general population that if any infection pops up it might create another round of spread of the disease this fear which is not completely unrealistic may extend the lockdown further however after the scheduled lockdown period if any individual gets infected and a few others get exposed to that person we need to check whether the total number of such individuals is less than the ccs if so this group needs to be quarantined and the rest of the population would be free from immediate danger however if the exposed group is larger than the ccs we recommend to split them in subgroups each of size at most ccs and quarantine them separately however careful and detail surveillance is required to trace all such exposed and infected individuals moreover this localised lockdown or quarantine would help flowing the daily life and might prevent at least to some extent the economy from being further weak ccs has another implication in allocation and arrangement of hospital beds in the quarantinehospital facilities if the ccs is 30 say a block of 30 or less number of beds should arranged so that total movement within this block including patients and healthcare people should not exceed that number otherwise if one big room accommodates a large number of patients secondary infection may start spreading our model is capable of estimating the average number of testing kits and hospitalisations required in advance to some extent depending on the available data however lockdown in its truest sense may not be feasible in a vast and diverse country like india so targeted or focused lockdown of selected high risk population might be a cost effective option compared to a generalised lockdown this would mean saturating screening for cases and identifying the critical number of contacts so the take away message in the middle of the covid-19 pandemic is that till the end of expected tte country-specific of the disease we have to be careful with further onset of covid-19 symptoms in the future we should follow quarantine rules strictly like any other epidemic covid-19 has the tendency to recur but it will not create any alarming pandemic in the future provided we keep a vigilant eye on our hygiene and have vaccination and treatment in the future  what is crisis leadership steve firestone   before delving into the discussion of crisis leadership it is important to define what a crisis is a crisis is generally defined as a situation that develops quickly and requires a response from a person or an organization in order to mitigate the consequences here are some examples of the way researchers and practitioners have defined ita specific unexpected and non-routine event or series of events that create high levels of uncertainty and threat or perceived threat to an organizations high priority goals seeger et al 1998 p 233
 the military defines it asan incident or situation that typically develops rapidly and creates a condition of such diplomatic economic or military importance that the president or secdef considers a commitment of us military forces and resources to achieve national objectives it may occur with little or no warning it is fast-breaking and requires accelerated decision making sometimes a single crisis may spawn another crisis elsewhere joint chiefs of staff 2011 pp ii29
 here are a few other definitions from other scholarsa crisis is change  either sudden or evolving  that results in an urgent problem that must be addressed immediately for a business a crisis is anything with the potential to cause sudden and serious damage to its employees reputation or bottom line harvard business essentials 2004 p xvi

crises catastrophes and calamities are an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life they have been with us since the beginning of time it can be argued that they will be with us until the end of human history itself in short they are an integral part of the human condition they are the human condition mitroff 2004 p 33
a crisis is an unstable time or state of affairs in which a decisive change is impending  either one with the distinct possibility of a highly undesirable outcome or one with the distinct possibility of a highly desirable and extremely positive outcome it is usually a 50-50 proposition but you can improve the odds fink 1986 p 15
 these definitions both from scholars and practitioners share several things in common they all point out that crises happen quickly many times without warning and in order to be considered a crisis they must imperil an organizations objectives or goals while forcing the organization to take steps to mitigate the possible consequences it is important to note that many if not most organizations do not have a defined concept of a crisis nor a list of what constitutes a crisis to their organization this would be helpful for many reasons chief among these reasons in terms of importance is that by having a list of events describing what constitutes a crisis the organization will be much quicker to recognize and respond and will be less likely to overreact when less severe events occur why is having a definition of a crisis important how we define it will predict and dictate how we see the world with a good understanding of the definition of a crisis is we can also be better prepared to lead and respond when needed we have all likely been in situations where an event occurred and only several people or maybe only one person viewed it as a crisis while the minority of the group is responding to the event as a crisis the others cant quite fully understand what the big deal is this is exactly the situation that can be avoided when proper crisis planning is conducted and a generally agreed-upon definition of a crisis exists for the organization a persons worldview impacts how they define a crisis people who have a secular or atheistic worldview will see a crisis as an opportunity for man to conquer nature and for the strongest to survive and succeed those with a more animistic or spirit-ruled worldview will see a crisis as something that cannot be prepared for or even responded to but rather as something that must be submitted to finally those of us with a christian worldview will see a crisis as something that is of god but that he will help us respond to if we follow his way those people who see their time on earth as an end will more than likely see a crisis as a possible end christians should see a crisis as only one part of our time on earth that is leading to our ultimate salvation and entry into gods never-ending kingdom miller 1998 the relationship between a leaders viewpoint and a crisis goes both ways our perception of a crisis based upon our worldview can become reality because our actions will be shaped by this perception boin et al in couto 2010 explained the importance of perception to crisis in the following definitionin sum crises are the combined products of unusual events and shared perceptions that something is seriously wrong however no set of events or developments is likely to be perceived fully uniformly by members of a community perceptions of crisis are likely to vary not only among communitiessocieties experience different types of disturbances and have different types and levels of vulnerability and resiliencebut also within them reflecting the different biases of stakeholders as a result of their different values positions and responsibilities these differential perceptions and indeed accounts of a crisis set the stage for crisis leadership p 230
 this means that if we perceive a crisis a certain way we may change it into what we think it is similarly how we view difficult events in our lives can over time impact our worldview and how much control we believe we have over difficult situations this is why a leader needs to be prepared to guide the organization through a potential crisis as mentioned earlier it is important for leaders to prepare their organizations for a crisis by educating the members on what the group defines as a crisis pearson and clair 1998 below is a suggested general list of events that can be edited to fit the needs and specific circumstances of an organization this should be a starting point for a leader to consider when evaluating the types of crisis that might affect their organization table 21
 as you can see from this list of crises that can impact an organization the scope and severity can vary greatly many of the listed items are events that occur outside of the organization while others like corporate reorganization happen internally in addition to being able to bin crises as either external or internal occurrences we can further group them into several different categories across the spectrum of impact to an organization harvard business essentials 2004 the list below represents how these categories can be separated into like events with a few examples for us to consider accidents and natural eventshurricane sandy hurricane katrina australian wildfires tohoku earthquake and tsunami health disasterscoronavirus ebola and zika virus technological accidentschernobyl fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster and gulf oil spill economic problemsimpacts from the coronavirus of 2020 the great recession and the 1970s oil crisis geopolitical turmoilgulf war hong kong protests and the israelipalestinian conflict unethical actionsenron bernie madoff scandal and wells fargo scandal harvard business essentials 2004
 this list and the table presented before it are only a limited representation of crises that can occur they are intended to provide the leader with an idea of what sort of things may happen so that they can develop a top ten list of possible crises which they can develop their crisis action plan to combat having this list of ten of the worst things that might happen to the organization is important not just so you can prepare for the specific crisis it is also important so that you can get your organization to start preparing in a general sense for any crisis that might occur it is interesting to note the difference between a crisis and a disaster while many treat the two as one and the same and most view the response as the most important thing to consider there is a difference that should be considered by an organization bhaduri 2019 explains this difference best when he writes a disaster happens within the larger environment in which some crucial element of an organization is situated while a crisis typically happens to an organization but does not cause an issue for most of the units external to the organization you can see from this list above that the tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami are listed disasters while the resulting crisis of the fukushima daiichi nuclear accident is listed as a separate crisis this definition appears to pertain mainly to scope but it is important for an organizations leadership to understand the difference so they can communicate effectively and accurately what is really happening it is important to understand that one disaster and even one crisis can lead to additional crises this is true in the case of tsunami leading to a nuclear reactor meltdown and it is also true of a corporate crisis that is mismanaged that leads to an even larger crisis like what we have seen with companies like enron and wells fargo there is more value in the planning for a crisis than in a prescriptive response that can be prepared for a specific crisis since we never know precisely what might occur one of the favorite sayings in the military planning community is plans are nothing but the planning is everything this simple saying acknowledges that the plans made may not be implemented perfectly due to the varying circumstances of the crisis what is important is the planning process where all of the different variables and possible responses can be considered so that an organization is ready when the crisis happens this benefit from the planning process is why a plan should never be put on the shelf for years instead an organization should have an active planning cycle where plans are reviewed and discussed yearly if not more frequently 
natural disasters have occurred since time began and they have always affected humans within close proximity to them with the population of the earth constantly expanding and humans spread out across the earth these disasters tend to affect more people than in the past what we see even more today are crises that are not related to natural causes large-scale factory accidents nuclear plant mishaps corporate crime and mismanagement and oil refinery explosions are a few of the examples of crises we can view as more internal and preventable than natural disasters mitroff 2004 and todays man-made crises can rival the worst impacts we have seen from any natural disasters the exponential improvement in technology combined with the flattening of the world around us has given rise to a world where many now view crisis as a way of life what this means is that crisis leadership is even more important now than it has been in the past we need crisis leaders who are prepared for crisis as a way of life crisis leaders are not needed simply to guide organizations out of crises research shows that more and more of the crisis we see today are caused by human error typically it is not just a simple error by one person that leads to a major crisis instead it is typically a chain of errors or an overall systemic error involving humans that leads to most of the crises we see in organizations simonsson and heide 2018 perrow 1984 when we look at a crisis we should understand the difference between error and risk as was just explained error is something that can be prevented by an aware leader who encourages their organization to report errors and work to improve in the areas identified risk on the other hand is typically not avoidable when reviewing risk we assume that something will happen and we project the likelihood of when it will occur and how badly the organization will be affected we should not make error and risk synonymous because our organizations should be encouraged to identify areas of human error report them and correct them in short we should not place error and risk in the same category when we plan for the crises that will inevitably come simonsson and heide 2018 the bible provides us with plenty of examples of crisis and peoples response to them while the old and new testaments are different in many respects they both contain many examples of crisis and how those affected responded to these difficult times and while i agree with irving and strauss 2019 that the bible is not a handbook on leadership i do believe there is much that can be learned from scripture on how to lead especially during a crisis from almost the beginning of the bible we are presented with stories of people and groups in crisis we see several specific examples of crisis leadership with moses in exodus 667 god tells moses to inform the israelites that he will deliver them out of their servitude to the egyptianstherefore say to the israelites i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the yoke of the egyptians i will free you from being slaves to them and i will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment i will take you as my own people and i will be your god then you will know that i am the lord your god who brought you out from under the yoke of the egyptians niv
 do you think the israelites believed this and were encouraged to respond to this crisis i highly doubt it we read soon after that  moses reported this to the israelites but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor niv it is almost unfathomable to think that the israelites after being told very clearly that they would be saved from their current situation decided not to listen to moses because their situation seemed so difficult and hopeless it may seem unfathomable but is it any more unfathomable than what we see today when people are going through crisis and do not think they will ever get beyond the issue facing them we are not that much different than the israelites but as leaders we must see beyond our current situation and instill confidence in our people that we will be able to overcome the crisis facing us we should use our faith in god to bolster this confidence and allow us to lead through the crisis presented to us as authentic leaders think back to difficult times in the life of your organization or in your personal life was your first instinct to reach out to god for his support the bible teaches us that the most prudent thing for us to do and the thing god implores us to do is reach out to him during our time of need there probably is no better figure to evaluate on leading during a crisis in the bible than moses time after time he faced difficult circumstances that he could only overcome with the help of god did he have doubts most certainly early on in exodus 31114 moses questioned how he could be expected to leadbut moses said to god who am i that i should go to pharaoh and bring the israelites out of egypt and god said i will be with you and this will be the sign to you that it is i who have sent you when you have brought the people out of egypt you will worship god on this mountain moses said to god suppose i go to the israelites and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me what is his name then what shall i tell them god said to moses i am who i am this is what you are to say to the israelites i am has sent me to you niv
 but by the time the israelites had been led out of egypt and were about to be engaged by pharaoh by the sea near pi hahiroth it became obvious that moses understood the importance of believing in god when challenged by a crisis we see this clearly in 141014as pharaoh approached the israelites looked up and there were the egyptians marching after them they were terrified and cried out to the lord they said to moses was it because there were no graves in egypt that you brought us to the desert to die what have you done to us by bringing us out of egypt didnt we say to you in egypt leave us alone let us serve the egyptians it would have been better for us to serve the egyptians than to die in the desert moses answered the people do not be afraid stand firm and you will see the deliverance the lord will bring you today the egyptians you see today you will never see again the lord will fight for you you need only to be still niv
 this education of moses to trust in god during difficult times is what leaders need today no matter the crisis or difficult circumstances that present themselves we must first believe in god and understand that he will be with us during any problem while it is difficult to first see thiseven moses was not convinced at firstit is imperative for leaders in todays world to live this way in order to improve the ability of their organizations to survive crises and to even thrive during such challenging times the story of moses reminds us that life can be difficult at times for us as individuals and as collective groups nowhere in the bible does god tell us that life will be easy we are told that we will have a better life in heaven but this implies that our life here on earth will have many struggles and crises for us to overcome the main thing we should take away from this is that god is with us during a crisis and that he wants us to overcome the challenges presented to us one great example of this is seen in mark 435 where the disciples and jesus were threatened by a storm while at sea upon seeing waves breaking over the boat the disciples woke jesus and asked why he did not care if they drown jesus calmed the storm and then asked why the men still did not have faith in him this example shows us that even the disciples men who were close to jesus and witnessed him conduct countless miracles still had moments when they lost faith with this understanding it is not too difficult to see why leaders today can sometimes forget their faith we read in the bible that god understands we will have difficult times and he wants us to succeed it is written in james 112 that blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because having stood the test that person will receive the crown of life that the lord has promised to those who love him niv god knows we will have challenges but he wants us to face them head-on and lead our organizations to success with him by our side god knows that life is imperfect and we see many examples in the bible that this is so what is perfect is our life beyond earth the first thing we need to understand is that god knows that there will be crises for us individually and in our organizations we need to trust that he will stand strong with us through these crises he wants us to succeed and has a plan for each of our organizations and for each us of personally of course like many things in our walk with god this is easier to say than for us to actually do accordingly we must stay rooted to our faith and be steadfast in our beliefs much like scholars have generally defined leadership and management as different entities crisis leadership and crisis management should be similarly treated as distinct from one another when looking at both concepts researchers generally regard crisis management as concentrating more on the distinct steps taken to respond to an individual crisis while crisis leadership is more concerned with enduring issues that come from leading during a crisis and how leaders can prepare their organizations to better handle these situations over an extended period of time mitroff 2011 klann 2003 explains the difference between crisis management and crisis leadership very welltraditionally books and articles about crisis management place a great deal of emphasis on management actions to be taken in preparation for a crisis this focus on management functions implies that you can prepare for a crisis by writing a plan and then executing it when the crisis occurs certainly an effective leader is competent in such functions as planning organizing staffing budgeting controlling and directing but a narrow emphasis on management strategy and planning ignores the leadership necessary for putting the plan into action that kind of approach sidesteps the human element that plays such a large role during a crisisthe needs emotions and behaviors of people at all levels of the organization p 27 boin et al in couto 2010 describe the subtle difference between crisis management and crisis leadership in the following statement we should not assume that crises are simply bad news for leaders with crisis management focused purely on damage limitation both operationally and politically crises may also provide leaders with unique opportunities to discard old policies and commitments kick-start new ones reform public organizations and reshape the political landscape by forging new coalitions p 230 prewitt and weil 2014 provide us with a good understanding of what it means to lead during a crisis instead of just reacting in an effort to simply manage the situationreactive leadership and crisis management have been synonymous for years this flows from the belief that crisis is unpredictable and unexpected which is simply not true crisis has its genesis in the values beliefs culture or behavior of an organization which become incongruent with the milieu in which the organization operates a leader who is able to read the signals of looming crisis and understands how to harness the exigency brought on by the situation can diminish the potential dangers and take full advantage of the resulting opportunities p 72
 i believe we need to reframe how we look at crisis management compared to crisis leadership for years crisis management has been synonymous with general clean up and recovery operations in the leadership field we need to focus on crisis leadership since this connotes a definitive difference versus the simple management of a crisis and promotes leading with a broader and more holistic view of crises here the point is that the immediate clean up of and reaction to a crisis both fit much better in the definition of crisis management while the leader who uses the crisis to improve the organization can be seen as conducting crisis leadership this is not to say that crisis management is not important because it is definitely vital rather it is to say we need to prepare leaders to do more than manage the effects from such events 
crisis management in short is not sufficient for the world we live in today we need the leaders of our organizations to do more than simply respond and react to crisis events while crisis management is concerned with how to respond in the short term after a crisis a crisis leader will be proactive and will prepare their organization for an event before one occurs furthermore a crisis leader will see how different crises connect and can be used to improve their organization over a long period of time table 22

 pearson and clair 1998 framed organizational crisis as a low-probability high-impact event that threatens the viability of the organization and is characterize by ambiguity of cause effect and means of resolution as well as by a belief that decisions must be made swiftly this definition moves beyond the somewhat simple definitions of a crisis and adds to it the impact felt by the entire organization in terms of the ambiguity and stress and the role of the leader in guiding the process through sound decision-making as long as there have been organizations and leaders there have been crises for them to overcome we see many examples of good and bad crisis leadership in every field imaginable such as the military government industrial and church fields just to name a few similar to the fact that the study of leadership is a relatively new discipline compared to many others the study of crisis leadership is also relatively new research in this specific area of leadership has burgeoned within the past 25 years due to the numerous large-scale crises we have seen during this period combined with the sharp increase in the speed that news travels due to the internet and social media whereas in the past we would have had to wait days or weeks to hear about a crisis and even longer before we could attempt to understand the role of the leader in the specific crisis now we know many of the specifics within moments after a crisis occurs in addition to providing access to more information this has also caused researchers as well as the general public to probe for information on the actions of leaders during these moments in order to better understand how their leadership style impacted the ultimate response the military has one of the longest histories with dealing with crisis response they have also been in the lead with their training for leaders on how to best respond when unexpected events occur the military tends to view crises as part of a much larger plan for battles campaigns and strategy they teach their commanders to understand how the crisis will impact the larger organization of the defense department and ultimately the nation as a whole the business world has also begun to realize the importance of being prepared to respond during a crisis since one misstep here can lead to the end of a company if the response is not well thought out this increase in preparing business units has grown dramatically from the 1980s but so has the level and severity of the crises seen business continuity planning and crisis response plans are much more commonplace in medium and large-scale businesses than it was in the past lewis 2006 what is missing in most instances is a focus on leading throughout the crisis lifecycle what is missing in even more instances are leaders who lead from a christian perspective trusting in god to help them shepherd their organizations through such troubles this book is one effort to reinforce the value of living with christ through whatever happens crisis leadership is important to both the student and the current leader it is important that we understand what a crisis is and what it might look like so that we are better able to detect one and put a plan into action while crisis management and crisis leadership may appear similar the differences are apparent when you see that crisis management is more concerned with the immediate recovery effort while crisis leadership looks at the enduring role of a leader before during and after the crisis the remainder of this book is intended to serve as a guide for leaders to incorporate their faith into their leadership as they stay faithful with the knowledge of what god has done what he can do and what he has promised to do several new ways of looking at crisis leadership from a christian perspective will also be presented and should serve to encourage continued thought and conversation on this important subject 
a crisis is a fast-developing event that puts the organization at risk and forces it to actpersonal and organizational worldviews affect how crises are perceivedcrises are increasingly caused by events other than natural disasterscrisis leadership is more than simply leading an organization through the response to a crisisleaders should lean on their faith to make it through a crisis
  a new prime minister meets old constraints richard rose   as soon as theresa may resigned boris johnson was quick to announce he was standing for the party leadership giving him the key to downing street one source of strength was his ability to win votes as demonstrated by twice being elected mayor of greater london at a time when the conservatives were trailing in the opinion polls his campaigning skills made him appear a potential election winner when pitted against jeremy corbyn and nigel farage in the three years after johnsons shambolic first attempt to become prime minister his opposition to mays negotiations had established him as a committed adherent of brexit johnson campaigned for the leadership with a do or die commitment to take the uk out of the european union echoing farages pledge to repair a broken political system johnson claimed that respecting the will of the referendum majority was fundamental to trust in democracy in doing so he created a bidding war in which his opponents were pressed to be just as hard or harder in their position on brexit his chief opponent foreign secretary jeremy hunt a late convert to brexit declared if we dont do what the people tell us to do were not a democracy sylvester 2019 in the two-stage process for electing the conservative leader there were seven candidates in the initial round johnson came first with the votes of 114 of 313 conservative mps after other candidates were progressively eliminated in the fifth and final round he won the backing of 160 mps an absolute majority in the contest against hunt for the support of conservative party members johnson won 664 of the 139318 votes this made him not only party leader but also prime minister the legacy of theresa mays handling of brexit left the new prime minister facing formidable tasks internal disagreements in the conservative party meant that not only was there no withdrawal agreement acceptable to brussels but also there was not even a domestic foreign policy that is an agreed position among ministers and backbench conservative mps internal party divisions exacerbated the effect of being a minority government the governments standing with public opinion was even worse at the start of january 2019 the yougov poll gave the conservatives 41 support six points more than jeremy corbyns labour party after multiple defeats in the house of commons and the european parliament election when theresa may left office yougov showed the conservatives with only 19 tied for third with labour and behind the liberal democrats and the newly formed brexit party by the time that a new leader could be installed in downing street there would be only a few months before the uk was officially due to leave the european union in keeping with his image as an english eccentric johnson was happy to be associated with cricket but once in downing street he made the name of the game hard ball instead of including mps of diverse views in his cabinet as theresa may had done he sacked 17 ministers and gave top jobs to mps who were committed to brexit when 21 conservative mps including former cabinet ministers broke ranks to support a measure that imposed constraints on his dealings with brussels johnson withdrew the party whip one of those pushed out mays chancellor of the exchequer wrote i no longer recognise this party of radicals hammond 2019 in his first appearance in the house of commons as prime minister johnson uncompromisingly pledged to fulfil his promise to the people to come out of the eu by 31 october with or without a deal whereas theresa may gave parliament its power over brexit negotiations by losing a general election boris johnson was determined to take back control for downing street by calling a general election and winning an absolute majority of mps as long as he could convince brexit supporters to vote conservative and the remain vote was divided the first-past-the-post electoral system would convert a plurality of votes into the absolute majority he sought opinion polls were encouraging by the time parliament met in september after the summer recess polls showed the conservatives with a lead of 10 percentage points or more over labour and the brexit party relegated to fourth place a cross-party majority of mps was fearful that in eagerness to meet his self-imposed deadline for withdrawal by 31 october johnson would accept britain leaving the eu without a deal to prevent this happening parliament approved an act requiring the prime minister to ask the eu for an extension of the date of withdrawal to 31 january 2020 if parliament had not approved a withdrawal deal by johnsons do or die deadline cf walker 2019 johnson called this measure a surrender act because he saw the threat to leave without a deal as putting pressure on brussels to make concessions rather than a powder keg that could blow up and damage the british economy in an attempt to prevent the house of commons from imposing constraints on downing streets dealings with brussels johnson promptly prorogued parliament so that it would not meet for six weeks the reason he gave was that the new government needed time to prepare measures to introduce in the new session of parliament opponents of johnsons leave strategy filed suits in scottish and uk courts to annul his action on 24 september the uk supreme court unanimously ruled that johnsons decision was unlawful a retired supreme court justice explained the courts upholding the supreme legitimacy of parliament against johnsons constitutional vandalism the courts decision did treat the referendum as a source of legitimacy sumption 2019 boris johnson sought to escape the constraint that parliament had imposed on his goal of leaving the eu in october by securing a last-minute compromise deal with brussels he hoped to sell it both to soft-brexit mps by saying it met their priority of avoiding leaving the eu without any deal and to hard-brexit mps by claiming it met their demand to take britain out of the eu the change of british prime ministers left the policy of brussels unchanged jean-claude juncker the president of the european commission declared that there was no scope for renegotiating the deal that brussels had agreed with theresa may and the british parliament had rejected three times he called it the best and only agreement possible michel barnier the eus chief negotiator for brexit dismissed johnsons fresh proposals for withdrawal as a combative and unacceptable demand the irish taoiseach leo varadkar described new proposals for a border between northern ireland and the republic as not in the real world leaked whitehall files showed that if britain left the eu without a deal at the date of johnsons self-imposed deadline there would be substantial and immediate disruptions to trade industry and the health service eu leaders assumed that johnson would live up to his reputation for flexibility by agreeing a deal within the eus red lines and then sell it to parliament
 the withdrawal agreement that johnson reached with the eu on 17 october differed little from the three points in the ill-fated agreement with theresa may the uk still had to pay tens of billions of pounds to meet its pre-existing financial commitments to the union and there was little alteration in provisions for protecting the rights of eu citizens in britain and british citizens living in eu states the agreement removed a backstop ensuring the border for trade between northern ireland and the republic of ireland was kept open on conditions set by the eu johnson had branded the backstop as anti-democratic and presented its removal as a triumph to pacify hard-brexit mps however the border arrangement he agreed tothe introduction of a check on internal trade between great britain and northern irelandhad previously been described by may as something no british prime minister could accept and by johnson as inconsistent with the sovereignty of the uk the series of votes that followed in the house of commons led to an impasse on 19 october in the first saturday sitting of the commons in more than a third of a century the commons approved by 322 votes to 306 a motion by conservative mp oliver letwin to delay approval of his new agreement and force the prime minister to fulfil his obligation under the benn act to request a further delay in withdrawal until 31 january johnson did so by sending brussels the act of parliament requesting delay on a plain sheet of paper without his signature and simultaneously sending a signed letter stating why he thought delay undesirable the following tuesday johnson won an initial vote approving his deal in principle however mps showed their distrust of the prime ministers plan to refuse parliament time to scrutinise it in detail by rejecting his timetable for rushing enactment to meet his end of october deadline johnson sought to overcome mps repeated rejection of his proposals by calling an election in the belief that voters would return a pro-brexit majority in the new parliament however the fixed-term parliaments act of 2011 frustrated johnsons proposal to call an early election before 2022 each time the government proposed an early contest it failed to meet the acts requirement that calling an early election required the positive support of two-thirds of all mps the labour party was unwilling to co-operate in triggering an election arguing that brexit should be settled before a fresh election was held moreover opinion polls indicated that the conservatives had a fair chance of winning an absolute majority over labour to get what he wanted johnson introduced a fresh bill to hold an election on 12 december because no parliament can bind its successor it overrode the earlier fixed-term parliaments act and only required a majority of mps votes to secure adoption this was achieved by division among the opposition parties while labour was fearful of a popular vote the bill was supported by the scottish national party which rightly saw this as an opportunity to gain seats and by the leader of the chief pro-remain party the liberal democrats who wrongly saw an election as an opportunity to gain enough seats to eject johnson from downing street and install a government that would reverse the referendum decision the election bill was fast-tracked through the commons and approved on 30 october the day before johnson was due to die in a metaphorical ditch in his own words because of failing to deliver brexit by then it was also the day on which a yougov opinion poll reported the conservatives enjoying a 15 lead over labour running a general election with the slogan get brexit done replicated the simple emotional appeal that his chief adviser dominic cummings had used to win the brexit referendum it also played to johnsons journalistic ability to frame issues in simple headline terms it was designed not only to appeal to those who had voted to leave the eu three years earlier but also to others who accepted the authority of a referendum and were tired of endless indecision in westminster labours ambivalent policy could only be framed in terms of yes but we want to leave on much better terms or no but if second referendum produces another majority for leaving the eu we will respect it getting brexit done appealed to a significant bloc of voters who saw a hung parliament as worrying depressing or despairing moreover by an 11-percentage-point margin voters saw a labour government led by jeremy corbyn as a worse outcome than leaving the european union ashcroft 2019 the brexit slogan was used to counterattack the big spending policies that labour promised to end what it described as nine years of economic austerity when social policies were raised with johnson he would typically argue that after brexit the uk would no longer be contributing billions of pounds a year to the eu budget and this money could be spent on improving health care education and other popular services as a form of political rhetoric it linked the partys pro-brexit stance with support for popular social policies johnson was correct to emphasise that after paying a 39 billion divorce bill to the eu the uk would no longer have to make a 13 billion annual contribution as well but from a public finance point of view the statement omitted many relevant facts such as the billions of pounds that eu programmes paid to british institutions and farmers framing the election in terms of the people vs parliament was a contradiction in terms of the theory of representative democracy because they depend on each other see chapter 101007978-3-030-44117-31 members of parliament need popular votes to get elected and re-elected likewise the people need mps to decide which party forms a government and to monitor the activities of government on their behalf ironically eurosceptic conservative mps had used their position in parliament to force the brexit referendum on a prime minister who saw no popular demand for such a vote claiming to speak for the people with a capital p against the political elite is a textbook strategy of populist party leaders they charge members of parliament and government ministers with being a self-interested class who do not care for what ordinary people think mudde and kaltwasser 2017 there is substantial empirical evidence that the political elite are seen as unresponsive by the people they represent table 101007978-3-030-44117-31 britons tend to have a low level of trust in institutions of representative government such as parties and parliament and 74 see a majority of politicians as ready to say one thing to get elected and then do the opposite once in office rose and wessels 2019 table 1
 for an eton- and oxford-educated classical scholar to speak for the people against the elite appears paradoxical but from johnsons point of view it is a means of intimidating a parliament that had imposed checks on what he wants his government to do and on judges said to be making decisions that conduct politics by another means the conservative party manifesto 2019 48 promised to set up a constitution democracy  rights commission that will examine these issues in depth and come up with proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates by contrast with the tightly controlled and focused campaign led by boris johnson the opposition was divided into multiple parties they differed about whether to settle for a soft brexit or to demand a second referendum that could reverse the decision of the narrow majority to leave the eu in the first referendum the labour party wanted to avoid the issue of brexit because its labour mps in the london area tended to represent constituencies that had voted to remain in the eu while labour mps in the north of england had voted to leave jeremy corbyn viewed the eu as a capitalist institution imposing austerity on europe a majority of labour mps lacked confidence in corbyns fitness to be prime minister in a parliamentary labour party vote of confidence after the 2016 referendum 197 labour mps voted no confidence in corbyns leadership and only 40 supported him johnsons personal reputation for untruthfulness was offset by corbyns disdain for traditional english values and reliance on support from a marxist and trotskyite coterie associated with undemocratic regimes and left-wing anti-semites conservative campaigners saw the labour leader jeremy corbyn as an electoral asset second only to brexit yougov surveys supported this view in a pre-election poll 59 considered corbyn unsuitable to be a party leader while boris johnson also had a negative rating among the electorate by comparison with the labour leader he was the lesser evil when lord ashcrofts final pre-election poll asked about the worst election result 48 said it would be a labour government under jeremy corbyn as against 38 saying leaving the european union would be worse the logic of the first-past-the-post electoral system recommended that opposition parties make electoral pacts so that there would only be one anti-brexit candidate in each constituency by successfully putting pressure on nigel farage to withdraw his partys candidates from conservative-held seats to get brexit done the conservatives assured themselves of the pro-brexit vote however major political and personal differences between parties and their leaders prevented electoral pacts being agreed that would consolidate the anti-brexit vote in a way that might have prevented johnson gaining a parliamentary majority opponents of brexit had no inhibition about voting tactically and campaigners for a second referendum to reverse brexit placed loyalty to their referendum cause above party loyalties they set up a number of websites offering advice about which anti-brexit party had the best chance of unseating a sitting conservative mps recommendations were based on a mixture of sources such as the constituency voting patterns census data and surveys given differences in data and interpretation tactical voting websites sometimes disagreed about which party had the best chance of winning a seat for the anti-brexit side while the conservative party was consistently ahead of labour in opinion polls during the campaign there was uncertainty about whether johnson would win an absolute majority or end up heading the biggest party in a hung parliament two of the three preceding conservative victories had involved a hung parliament and this had stopped theresa may from delivering brexit on schedule see chapter 101007978-3-030-44117-311 if boris johnson had won a plurality rather than a majority of seats he would have been challenged to form a cross-party alliance to deliver brexit since every other party had rejected his brexit deal nor were other parties inclined to back a minority labour government under jeremy corbyn to resolve the brexit deadlock without a government in place britain was scheduled to leave the eu without a deal on 31 january 2020 the first-past-the-post electoral system disposed of the threat of a hung parliament it turned the conservatives plurality of 436 of the popular vote into 561 of seats in the house of commons table 121 winning 365 seats gave the conservatives a majority of 80 seats over opposition parties which were divided on many issues this was the conservatives biggest parliamentary majority since 1987 since labour won only 202 seats the conservative government now enjoys a 163-seat lead over the official opposition
 voting at the constituency and regional levels tended to follow a division between places where a majority had voted to leave or remain in the eu in the 2016 referendum thus the conservative party did worst in the two strongholds of remain voters in scotland it lost 31 of its previous share of the vote and seven seats and in london it lost 11 of its previous vote and one seat to labour the party did best in the industrial midlands its vote went up 42 and it gained 16 seats in the north east helped by the brexit party taking most of its votes from labour supporters the conservatives won seven seats that had not gone tory for generations or ever including tony blairs old constituency as in the 2016 british referendum these regional differences showed that while london had a more cosmopolitan and prosperous electorate the north of england had more votes and mps see chapter 101007978-3-030-44117-35 collectively the oppositions share of the vote was 12 percentage points greater than that of the conservatives but its vote was split table 121 the labour partys claim to be the only party capable of displacing boris johnson from downing street was offset by being ambivalent about whether it would deliver a softer brexit or a referendum that would keep britain in the eu jeremy corbyns policy was to negotiate a soft brexit but to remain neutral and let voters decide whether to accept it or vote to remain in the eu after all the seven parties unambiguously committed to the euthe scottish nationalists the liberal democrats plaid cymru the greens and three northern ireland partieswon only 22 of the vote and 74 seats while the brexit party had won more than three times the conservative vote in the ep election seven months earlier johnsons get brexit done policy was critical to the conservative partys rapid recovery of the brexit vote see table 101007978-3-030-44117-35 because the december election was about who governs the conservatives were the only choice for people who had voted to leave the eu in 2016 and wanted to get brexit done among that group the conservatives gained 73 of the vote and only 4 went to the brexit party table 122
 the remain vote fragmented among parties offering a variety of alternatives for dealing with the referendum vote for brexit and no party received a majority of the remain vote labours policy of renegotiating a withdrawal with brussels and then calling a second referendum that might reverse brexit gained it less than half the vote of the remain supporters if it had been able to get as big a share of the remain vote as the conservatives did of the leave vote this would have deprived boris johnson of a majority and created a hung parliament boris johnsons strategic gamble has given him a majority of conservative mps committed to getting brexit done on his terms neither david cameron john major nor edward heath had ever managed to command an unquestioning majority of tories in favour of britains participation in the european union johnsons expulsion of 21 mps who voted against no deal removed conservative mps favouring a soft or no brexit none of the rebels who sought re-election as independents or liberal democrats gained a seat in the new house a cautionary warning to re-elected conservative mps the 109 new conservative mps were committed followers johnson had taken the unusual precaution of having every candidate pledge to support a downing street deal with brussels their lack of parliamentary experience makes them particularly dependent on advice from johnsons whips the prime ministers power to make appointments to more than 100 government posts offers an incentive not to question the governments eu policy the formal departure of the uk from the european union is the end of the beginning it also marks the start of negotiations for a political agreement between the uk and the eu that covers what the withdrawal bill leaves out about britains future relationship with the european union paradoxically withdrawal from the eu gives the uk the freedom to negotiate new relations with the rest of the world while simultaneously requiring it reach a mutual agreement with brussels governing its new relationship with the eu as french president emmanuel macron commented on the day britain left the eu you may be leaving the eu but you are not leaving europe eu negotiators have had years of experience of dealing with britain as a member state while the public statements of david cameron theresa may and boris johnson have shown ignorance of how the eu works and ignored informed advice from british officials about how a national government can influence the eus multi-national policy-making process rogers 2019 the disparity in knowledge is most extreme in trade matters since whitehall has had a minimum of trade officials since responsibility for trade was transferred to brussels when the uk joined the eu in 1973 british public opinion agrees with eu negotiators in the evaluation of brexit negotiations whether the prime minister was boris johnson or theresa may in the year leading up to the uks departure from the eu from 70 to 87 of yougov respondents thought the government was handling brexit badly the symbolism of national sovereignty has been an end in itself for brexit campaigners it gives westminster the power to diverge from eu laws and regulations that affect national policies on trade goods and services working conditions aid to industry and immigration the uk regains the freedom to make new trade deals with the united states china and other countries to replace existing trade agreements that the eu has negotiated with these countries on behalf of britain when it was an eu member state however new trade agreements can only be arrived at by the uk compromising some of its conditions in exchange for the benefits the agreement should bring the future terms of uk-eu trade are central to the politics of the political agreement for the conservative government maintaining access to eu markets for manufactured goods produced the north of england where the party gained many mps from labour in 2019 is a major priority maintaining eu access for the financial services of the city of london is important because of its disproportionate contribution to the countrys gross domestic product and revenue five continental countries want to maintain their access to offshore uk fishing rights british exports to the eu account for almost half of the uks total exports whereas eu exports to britain account for a small share of the eus global exports brexit is almost certain to reduce trade negotiations will set the rules that determine how large or small that may be the treasury has estimated the conservative governments goal of restricting an agreement to avoid tariffs and quotas on goods could lower economic growth about 5 in 15 years that is about one-quarter of one percent per annum cf chapter 101007978-3-030-44117-39
 the eu wants future trade negotiations with britain to maintain a level playing field that is british goods and services should meet the same regulatory standards that the uk met when it was an eu member state since eu regulations are currently evolving in such fields such as environmental protection and data handling british businesses should comply with future regulations too to ensure compliance the british government would need to agree to the eu regulations being judicially enforced from a westminster point of view aligning the british economy with eu regulations and accepting european courts would undermine the purpose of brexit taking back control of british laws
 the johnson government wants the eu to accept the mutual equivalence of regulations that would lead to same outcome even if they are not identical in content this would allow gradual divergence between britain and eu economies in ways that westminster believes would increase british competitiveness and that the eu fears would do so by undercutting eu standards it also wants to avoid giving the eu an effective means of enforcing equivalence this would allow the eu to make a unilateral judgement that british regulations were not equivalent to eu standards thereby reducing eu imports from britain in order to prevent the departure of the uk from harming integration the eu does not want to allow a post-brexit britain to cherry-pick that is enjoy the same relationship as it had as a member state while being free of obligations a senior eu policy-maker has described the british position as before they were in the eu with lots of opt-outs now they are out and want a lot of opt-ins quoted in fleming et al 2019 the president of the european commission ursula von der leyen 2019 told the european parliament its the choice of the uk how far they want to align with the eu or diverge boris johnson shortened the time to complete a political agreement that regulates what comes after brexit by making another do-or-die pledge to end the process by 31 december 2020 if this deadline is not extended and no agreement can be reached brexit ends with no deal thereby maximising the effect of breaking links developed in the 47 years in which the uk was a member of the european union in accepting the british deadline eu officials have cautioned that it makes likely a bare-bones political agreement that minimises the extent to which benefits can be secured the coronavirus crisis which has frustrated negotiations gives him reason to seek an extension given johnsons houdini-like skill in dealing with promises he could alter his position to take into account brussels red lines alternatively to meet his self-imposed deadline he could emulate candide and tell parliament that whatever agreement he reaches with brussels will deliver the best of all possible brexits in the best of all possible worlds a third option would be to invoke the spirit of dunkirk and claim that no deal is better than surrender to the demands of a united european union  whose life to save scarce resources allocation in the covid-19 outbreak chiara mannelli   the current coronavirus covid-19 outbreak is spreading rapidly first reported in china in december 2019 the virus has indiscriminately infected people all over the country with many dying from the infection the chinese attempt to limit the spread by locking down the entire city of wuhan was initially perceived by the rest of the world as simply a chinese emergency to read about in the news however such a perception could not have been more wrong never before have connections and movements of people between countries been so frequent the idea that this emergency would remain within the boundaries of a chinese drama was a mere fantasy as of 11 march the virus has spread to more than 100 countries1 resulting in thousands of deaths although rigorous restrictions in wuhan contained the spread on 11 march the who declared the covid-19 outbreak to be a pandemic and that europe had become its new epicentre italy especially the northern region of the country has been severely affected and is currently reporting the largest outbreak in europe as of march 15 the protezione civile has confirmed 24 747 total cases since the beginning of the outbreak with 1809 deaths of which 1218 have been in lombardy2
 despite the containment measures enforced by the italian government since march 8 to minimise the risk of infected people transmitting the virus to healthy ones limiting the spread is a significant challenge as symptoms associated with the new coronavirus are extremely nuanced and thus hard to identify promptly some people are infectious and contagious without showing any symptoms others may show symptoms similar toand thus misleadingly overlapping withseasonal influenza whose peak is concomitant while the most severe cases develop acute respiratory conditions that require intensive care unit icu admission although only a few of those infected require icu the burden on the italian national healthcare system is unprecedented of approximately 5200 existing icu beds in italy 1028 are already dedicated to patients with covid-19 as of 11 march and the need for more icu beds is likely to further increase rapidly as recent research in the lancet claims3 in this scenario demand for critical care in the northern region of italy currently exceeds its supply raising significant ethical concerns in the process advances in the medical field have progressively shifted the limits of the possible by providing our society with extremely sophisticated treatments yet this high level of healthcare is expensive and it comes with the unfortunate side effect of scarcity when resources are scarce in relation to potential demand they have to be allocated by following strict prioritisation criteriathat is someone will be left without there are many kinds of scarce resources some of which are life-saving which means those who do not access them will not survive this is exactly the current italian situation the rampant spread of covid-19 in italy requires in severe cases massive admission of patients with acute respiratory infection to icus icu beds are extremely expensive and thus limited they are scarce resources the more patients require icu assistance the fewer beds are available and some will have no chance of icu admissionthat is with no chance of survival in the northern area of italy where the healthcare system is currently under unprecedented strain intensive care specialists are facing overwhelming decisions about who should be provided with ventilationdecisions that have to be taken in the knowledge that those not admitted to icus will very likely die in allocating resources in these scenarios professionals are considering prioritising those most likely to survive over those with remote chances of survival the news that prioritisation criteria were being applied in italian hospitals in relation to the current outbreak sparked widespread controversy aroused great resentment and triggered a debate at both public and institutional levels about the right of every individual to access healthcare the emergency that italy is currently facing amounts to an unprecedented clinical humanitarian ethical and financial crisis yet ethical concerns related to scarce resources allocation are far from extraordinary which does not make them any less challenging in the current pandemic the recent history of medicine is rife with similar quandaries our society has indeed been confronted with such issues several times in the past including in the very recent past in 1960 belding scribner a physician at the seattle artificial kidney centre assisted by the engineer wayne quentin invented the shunt to make chronic dialysis feasible4 this changed the lives of many patients yet the success of this operation rapidly showed its negative side the treatment was extremely expensive and had limited funding the nine-bed capacity of seattle center was not able to meet the demands of the numerous patients waiting for dialysis in order to allocate this kind of life-saving scarce resource the board of trustees of the king county medical society envisioned two different committees to select candidates the first committee comprising physicians would select patients by focusing on their medical and psychiatric condition on this basis the second committee composed of various people including a lawyer a businessman a homemaker among others would make the final selection based on a case-by-case evaluation of economic psychological and social factors they evaluated age background education past performance and future potential4 in order to decide who shall live and who shall die such prioritisation for scarce resources allocation is not confined to the past although different in many aspects organs are examples of life-saving scarce resources every day patients on waiting lists for transplants experience the unfortunate effects of prioritisation criteria for allocation in italy organs are assigned according to an algorithm that reflects several parameters the state of severity of the pathology for which the transplant is needed compatibility blood type age and waiting time on the list5 against this backdrop of scarce resources younger patients in need might be prioritised over the elderly healthcare professionals have to make a case-by-case evaluation in order to establish whether a patient is more urgently in need of treatment than another one even if the latter patient arrived first waiting patients die because the need for organs does not meet the supply so resources cannot be provided to all those in need and when the demand exceeds the supply imposition of prioritisation criteria inevitably means that some are left without the coronavirus outbreak constitutes a major emergency the implications of scarce resources allocation are devastating to cope with yet it should be kept in mind that their application is not unprecedented the unfamiliarity of the outbreak that europe is currently experiencing should not disorient our historical perspective and the new framework by which prioritisation criteria for scarce resources allocation are currently being enforced should not lead us to perceive them as something new rather prioritisation reflects established practices that have long regulated the distribution of finite resources when demand happens to exceed supply the uniqueness of this outbreak lies in the extraordinarily high number of individuals likely to be impacted by allocation criteria the effects of prioritisation are now being experienced by an entire nation rather than by a finite group of people such as in the case of patients and their families awaiting organ transplants what is extraordinary is that high-income countries are not prepared to experience such an intense rationing of resources when it comes to life-saving assistance yet we all logically understand that when resources are not enough for everybodycruel though this isnot everyone can be saved this is something we already knowwe just try to forget about it when there is a shortage of resources the formal principle of justice which states that equals should be treated equally and that unequals should be treated unequally is frequently invoked6 this principle raises significant concerns however it seems fair that equals deserve equal treatments but each of us has very different characteristics and these cannot be ignored which traits define equality and which traits do not in other words how far does the meaning of equal extend in italy everyone is equally entitled to the right to access healthcare services this means that on informed consent everyone is offered the best available care yet even in normal practice protocols differ according to different conditions and the different clinical and physiological profiles of patients when patients present the same medical condition factors such as age comorbidity gender and severity of the disease have an impact on the specific protocols that physicians follow since equals should be treated equally it is unequal to treat unequals equally therefore although there is a right for everyone to be treated it is not feasible to ignore contingent medical and biological characteristics that inevitably make one patient different from the other and which have a significant impact on the outcome of care if these differences are relevant in standard clinical practice they acquire an even greater impact in an emergency characterised by a scarcity of resources such as that created by covid-19 prioritisation does not mean that one life is more valuable than another as all lives are equally valuable but when resources are not enough to save all those in need prioritisation involves allocating resources such that they are more likely to save the most lives this method allows priority treatment of those who are more likely to benefit from the scarce resourceadmission to an icu in this caseand to recover quickly with a positive outcome which in turn allows the next in line to benefit from the treatment in question a key concept in healthcare pertains to preventing suffering and harm in such an emergency situation as in other circumstances in which there is a scarcity of resources it is unfortunately not possible to avoid harm at all the effort is to reduce it the ethical implications of scarce resources allocation are in the spotlight in the current covid-19 pandemic italy is currently facing severe challenges with demand for icu admission far exceeding the capacity of the healthcare system and as the virus spreads globally many other countries are likely to face the same emergency prioritisation criteria enforced by healthcare professionals in italy have exacerbated tensions and triggered intense debates about the principle that everyone has the right to access healthcare yet the reality is that along with reduced availability of resources physicians may be forced to choose whose life to save by deciding who to admit to an icu the novelty of this emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation which is rife in past and present clinical practice rather it has to do with the extraordinary numbers of peoplecurrently an entire nationwho find themselves personally affected by such implications and who suddenly realise that the principle of equals should be treated equally is rife with controversy but this aspect is not new it is simply something that people have tried to ignore there is an undeniable and urgent need for a more competent distribution of financial resources within the country in order to adequately sustain and support the healthcare system emergencies like that created by covid-19 underline more than ever the pressing need to increase substantially the resources dedicated to the healthcare system so that as far as possible physicians do not have to make the difficult decision of whose lives to save yet a realistic analysis suggests that for all that necessary funds can be earmarked there will continue to be situations in which extremely difficult choices pertaining scarce resources allocation will have to be made for instance organs are resources whose availability cannot be increased by any additional funding within this scenario an ethical approach to healthcare choices assumes high importance the intersection between ethics and medicine is indisputable and the contribution of an ethical perspective is both relevant and essential healthcare professionals forced to make decisions about resources allocation should not rely solely on their medical background their undergraduate and graduate education should be rigorously implemented with a grounding in medical ethics this implementation should be flanked by the solid presence of medical ethics consultants in healthcare structures to support the evaluations and decisions of healthcare professionals the burden of choicethe implications of which concern us allcan no longer be put on healthcare professionals shoulders now more than ever there has to be a rigorous and adequate implementation of medical ethics in healthcare  emerging and reemerging viral diseases james strauss h ellen strauss g   rabies virus is an example of a virus for which bats are an important reservoir although we think of rabies as being primarily associated with canines such as dogs and other mammals such as skunks and raccoons and these animals do serve as important reservoirs for rabies that enter the human population bats are also an important reservoir in fact in the united states over the last few years the majority of human cases of rabies have been bat-associated rabies in some of these cases of bat rabies in humans exposure to bats is documented and the bite of infected bats is known to have transmitted the virus but in other cases there is no known contact with bats leading to the suggestion that inhaling aspirated droplets containing rabies may be the cause of the infection in south america vampire bats which feed on the blood of mammals after biting them with their sharp incisors have been an important vector in the spread of rabies to livestock and humans this has resulted in campaigns to indiscriminately slaughter bats using a variety of methods including poison and the destruction of roosts and caves with explosives although these campaigns have resulted in enormous numbers of bats being killed these campaigns have had no effect on the spread of rabies thus reduction of bat numbers is not effective in the control of rabies but does destroy ecologically important animals the various bat lyssaviruses which can also cause rabies in humans were described in chapter 4 although only a few human cases are known that arose from infection by these viruses they have the potential to spread more widely further bites or scratches from bats need to be treated as potential exposure to rabies and treated accordingly this is expensive and in effect only available in developed countries in september of 1994 a number of cases of severe respiratory illness occurred in racehorses near brisbane australia the first horse to become ill was a pregnant mare that was pastured in a field which was then moved into a stable with 23 other thoroughbreds the disease spread among the horses in this stable and to an adjoining stable and ultimately 17 horses became ill of which 13 died of the four horses that survived two were left with mild neurological sequelae three other horses were infected but did not suffer symptoms two humans that nursed the horses became ill with a severe respiratory disease of whom one died of respiratory and kidney failure spread of the disease required close contact and imposition of quarantine measures contained the outbreak a previously unknown virus was isolated from the sick animals that was found to be a paramyxovirus and it was initially named equine morbillivirus sequencing of the genome showed that it was not closely related to the morbilliviruses however and the virus was assigned to a new genus called megamyxovirus because of the large size of the genome subsequent studies established that the virus was a bat virus and widespread in flying foxes in eastern australia the virus was renamed hendra virus after the brisbane suburb where the outbreak occurred and the genus was renamed henipavirus analysis of sera from healthy humans and horses in the area failed to detect the presence of antibody and analysis of more than 5000 sera from a variety of wild animals trapped in the areas also failed to detect antibody in any animal other than flying foxes flying foxes can be readily infected experimentally with the virus but do not suffer illness upon infection a second outbreak of hendra virus began in august 1994 about 1000km north of brisbane two horses died and the owner of the horses became mildly ill with neurological symptoms from which he appeared to recover however in october of 1995 the owner suffered a relapse and died of encephalitis at this point an investigation showed that hendra virus was to blame for the illness of the horses and the death of the owner in january 1999 a fatal case of hendra infection occurred in a horse near cairns australia and in 2004 a horse died of hendra infection in townsville in the 2004 incident the veterinarian who attended the horse was infected but recovered after a mild illness extensive studies of flying foxes have shown that hendra virus is present in all four species of flying fox that occur in australia almost half of flying foxes have been found to have antibodies to the virus so it is widespread and common it is only rarely transmitted to other animals however at least to date as shown by the extensive serological studies and the limited occurrence of clinical illness caused by the virus in humans and their horses a related virus 83 identical to hendra virus at the amino acid level emerged in 1998 that represents a much more serious threat to human health from september 1998 to april 1999 an outbreak of 258 cases of human encephalitis occurred in malaysia and singapore that had a 40 mortality rate clinical symptoms included fever headache myalgia muscle aches drowsiness and disorientation that sometimes progressed to coma within 48 hours the disease was associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs with or without neurological symptoms and humans infected with the disease were pig farmers or others closely associated with pig farming it was first thought that the outbreak was due to infection by japanese encephalitis je virus see chapter 3 on the importance of pigs as amplifying hosts for this virus and the malaysian government vaccinated 24 million pigs against je virus when this did not slow the epidemic 11 million pigs were culled in an attempt to reduce the incidence of disease in march 1999 with the assistance of the centers for disease control and prevention the virus responsible for the epidemic was identified as a hendra-like virus a virus related to but distinct from hendra virus retrospective studies suggested that the virus had been responsible for disease in pigs in malaysia for several years and it seems clear that the human cases were contracted from pigs there is no evidence for human-to-human transmission in this outbreak the virus responsible has been called nipah virus after the village in malaysia where the disease first appeared and it is classified as a second member of the genus henipavirus which gets its name from hendra and nipah viruses like hendra virus the reservoir of nipah virus is flying foxes and the virus has been isolated from flying foxes in the area it has been suggested that the outbreak occurred in part because the destruction of the natural habitat of the flying foxes caused by deforestation and consequent food shortage led the bats to forage in nearby orchards located very near piggeries there half-eaten fruit or regurgitated fruit that was contaminated with virus-containing saliva from the bats could be eaten by pigs causing them to become infected more recent epidemics of nipah virus encephalitis have occurred in southern asia epidemics in bangladesh occurred in 2001 2003 2004 and 2005 no evidence for the intermediate infection of an animal as occurred in the malaysian epidemic has been seen in these epidemics furthermore in the 2004 epidemic evidence was obtained that person-to-person transmission of the virus had occurred it is likely that the disease was transmitted directly from bats to humans possibly by human consumption of partially eaten fruit that was contaminated with bat saliva containing the virus followed by person-to-person transmission it is known in bangladesh for example that during the fruiting season young boys climb trees to pick fruit if this fruit was partially eaten by bats the fruit could be contaminated with the virus from the bat the fatality rate in these epidemics was as high as 75 in nearby india an epidemic of nipah occurred in 2001 flying foxes are widely distributed throughout this area fig 81 and nipah virus has been isolated from them in both malaysia and bangladash the virus has also been isolated from flying foxes in cambodia although human infection has not been documented to date the very wide distribution of hendra and nipah viruses the possibility of person-to-person transmission and the increasing contacts between humans and their domestic animals with fruit bats carrying the virus suggests that epidemics will continue to occur as indicated for rabies eradication of the bats is neither desirable nor feasible however simple solutions exist to reduce the contacts of humans and their animals with the bats such as not locating fruit orchards near piggeries recent studies have shown that the sars virus a coronavirus had to adapt to human receptors in order to cause severe illness infection by the bat virus or the civet virus appears to cause only mild illness as stated before merchants who were infected did not develop illness and some persons who work with wildlife were found to be seropositive for sars but suffered no illness however several changes are present in the virulent sars virus isolated from humans there is a deletion of 29 nucleotides upstream of the start codon for the n protein and there are four amino acid changes in the spike protein it is believed that the crucial changes are two amino acid changes in the spike protein that allow the virus to bind to the human receptor called ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 1000-fold more avidly than does the civet strain or the bat strain this is perhaps the reason why the virus has not to date reappeared in the human population together with extensive culling of animals in the food markets in china if occasional human cases occur they are likely to be mild unless the virus has the opportunity to mutate in humans to form the virulent strain of the virus however this did happen in 2002 and may happen again in the future there is need to develop vaccines or antiviral treatments for the virus as well as to maintain the chinese food markets in a way that does not encourage the spread of the virus the ace2 protein is highly conserved among mammals and it is perhaps surprising that one of the few amino acid differences in the human form of this protein occurs in the virus-binding site and causes such a change in the ability of sars to utilize ace2 as a receptor in view of the fact that to become virulent the virus must mutate to bind more strongly to the human form of the ace2 protein it is interesting that there is a second receptor for sars virus the protein called cd209l or l-sign why this second receptor cannot compensate for the failure of unmodified sars to infect humans efficiently is unknown it may be significant that another human coronavirus nl63 only recently discovered also uses ace2 as its receptor other coronaviruses use different receptors including aminopeptidase n also called cd13 by the human coronavirus 229e transmissible gastroenteritus virus of swine and feline infectious peritonitis virus and carcinoembryonic antigens by mouse hepatitis virus it is noteworthy that at least one other coronavirus as yet unnamed circulates in bats belonging to the genus miniopterus in miniopterus pusillus more than 60 of the bats were found to be positive for this virus this virus is distinct from the sars virus it belongs to group 1 coronaviruses whereas sars belongs to group 2 coronaviruses this new virus is not known to infect humans or to cause disease sars is a zoonotic disease of humans caused by a coronavirus it is of interest that human coronavirus hcov oc43 also appears to have a zoonotic source it is very similar to a virus of cattle bovine coronavirus bcov from studies of the rate that mutations have been fixed in these viruses it has been estimated that the virus entered the human population around 1890 the filoviruses first came to the attention of science in 1967 when outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever occurred in marburg and frankfurt germany and in belgrade yugoslavia the cause was a virus subsequently named marburg that was present in african green monkeys imported from uganda whose kidneys were being processed for cell culture production for use in preparing poliovirus vaccine twenty-five laboratory workers were infected and six secondary cases resulted of these 31 infected people 7 died the monkeys in the shipment which originated in uganda also died subsequent studies with the virus isolated during the outbreak showed that it caused lethal illness in african green monkeys following experimental infection there were 3 cases of marburg in south africa in 1975 the source of infection was probably zimbabwe with one death 2 cases in kenya in 1980 infection probably in uganda 1 case in kenya in 1987 an outbreak of 149 cases with 123 deaths in zaire now the democratic republic of congo in 19982000 and an outbreak of 374 cases with 329 deaths in northern angola in 2005 the number of cases is surely underreported since many people in remote areas do not seek medical assistance when ill and counting of new graves in such locations indicates that the death toll is higher than officially reported the locations of these outbreaks are shown on the map in fig 83
 the reported fatality rate in the larger outbreaks was 8090 ebola virus was first isolated during a 1976 epidemic of severe hemorrhagic fever in zaire and sudan and named for a river in the region during this epidemic the more than 600 cases resulted in 430 deaths and asymptomatic infection appeared to be rare one case of ebola occurred in 1977 and in 1979 there were 34 cases with 22 deaths in the sudan in this latter epidemic an index case was brought to the hospital and the virus spread to four people there who then spread it to their families after this ebola disease in africa disappeared until 1994 in late 1994 a swiss ethologist working in the ivory coast performed necropsies on chimps she contracted ebola but survived and a new strain of ebola was isolated from her blood then in may 1995 there was an epidemic in kikwit zaire that resulted in at least 315 cases with 75 mortality this was followed by several deaths in western africa that resulted from consumption of a monkey that had died of ebola then there was a prolonged series of smaller outbreaks in gabon from 1995 through 1997 in 2000 ebola appeared in uganda for the first time and caused an epidemic of more than 425 cases there have been further outbreaks in 2002 2003 2004 and 2005 in various countries including gabon the democratic republic of congo and sudan a map showing these various filoviral outbreaks is shown in fig 83 three strains or species of african ebola viruses are now recognized which differ in their virulence zaire ebolavirus is the most virulent with a case fatality rate approaching 90 sudan ebolavirus is less virulent and ivory coast ebolavirus is the least virulent the natural reservoir of ebola virus in africa has recently been shown to be bats three species of fruit bats collected in gabon and the democratic republic of congo close to areas where an epidemic of ebola had devastated local gorilla and chimpanzee populations showed evidence of infection significant numbers of hypsignathus monstrosus 4 of 17 tested epomops franqueti 8 of 117 and myonycteris torquata 4 of 58 were found to have antibodies to ebola virus and viral nucleic acid was detected in liver or spleen of other bats of these three species 4 of 21 5 of 117 and 4 of 41 respectively no viral rna was found in any other animal species tested which included 222 birds and 129 small vertebrates among others the infection of the bats appears to be asymptomatic consistent with the hypothesis that the fruit bat is the reservoir of ebola virus it is probable that bats are also the reservoir of marburg virus it is clear that monkeys can be infected by the virus and spread it to humans but how the monkeys contract it is not known perhaps the monkeys eat fruit that has been partially eaten by the bats there have been serious die-offs of gorillas and chimpanzees in the last decade or so that have severely impacted the populations of these animals in some areas some human epidemics get started when monkeys dying of the disease are butchered for food but in other epidemics monkeys are not implicated and how the epidemic starts is not known again perhaps consumption of partially eaten fruit is to blame the recent large die-offs of apes and chimpanzees in some areas together with the increasing frequency of human infection indicates that the virus is spreading more widely whether this is due to a new strain of virus that is more easily spread to humans and nonhuman primates or to the recent introduction of the virus from a source outside the areas now experiencing epidemics or to human alterations of the environment leading to more contact between humans and nonhuman primates with the bats that carry the virus is not known a fourth strain of ebola virus originating from the philippines or perhaps another region of asia first appeared as the causative agent of an epidemic of hemorrhagic fever in monkeys imported from the philippines this epidemic occurred in reston virginia near washington dc in 1989 the deaths were at first attributed to simian hemorrhagic fever virus shfv but investigation by the us army medical research institute for infectious diseases and the centers for disease control and prevention found that both shfv and ebola virus were present in the monkeys believing that the community was at risk for ebola made even the more alarming because the epidemic was occurring in the neighborhood of the central government of the united states the army team quickly decided to euthanize the monkeys and decontaminate the facility follow-up studies showed that four animal handlers at the facility had been infected by the virus but had suffered no illness thus the strain of ebola present in the reston monkeys called reston ebolavirus seems to be nonpathogenic for humans although it remains pathogenic for monkeys the story of the reston incident was recounted in a book called the hot zone by richard preston since this first epidemic of reston ebolavirus a new outbreak has occurred in reston two outbreaks have occurred in an animal facility in alice texas and an outbreak took place in sienna italy all outbreaks occurred in monkeys imported from the philippines and it seems probable that the virus is native to the philippines no serious illness in humans has occurred in any of these outbreaks nucleotide sequencing has shown that reston ebolavirus is closely related to the african ebolaviruses the reason it is attenuated in humans is still unexplained and high containment is used for studies of reston ebolavirus in the laboratory to date the filoviruses have caused only a limited number of human infections however if a filovirus were to adapt to humans such that human-to-human transmission occurred readily it could become a major problem the probability of such an event is unknown in the summer of 1999 west nile virus a mosquito-borne flavivirus chapter 3 appeared in north america for the first time there were 62 human cases of west nile disease in the new york city area of whom 7 died of encephalitis numerous birds also died including exotics in zoos as well as native birds with the end of the mosquito season the epidemic died out but the virus had become established over the next 6 years the virus rapidly spread across the united states and north into canada as well as south into central america northern south america and the caribbean the march of the virus across the united states is illustrated in figs 84
and 85
 the rapid spread of this virus into a new ecological area requiring adaptation to new mosquito vectors as well as new vertebrate hosts is extraordinary in the process more than 20000 americans became ill from wn virus infection and more than 800 died of neurological complications fig 86
 figures 85 and 86 illustrate an interesting and not well understood phenomenon after the front passes through an area there are many fewer human cases of disease in the following years yet only a minority of humans in any area had been infected and are therefore immune to the virus and the virus continues to be present in some way the transmission cycle has been interrupted perhaps by the die-off of the birds that serve as the primary amplifying hosts wn virus strains from the united states are 997 identical to strains from israel and the us strain certainly originated in the middle east it presumably arrived in new york on a jet aircraft and there are three possible vectors that could have carried the virus it is conceivable that a viremic human introduced the virus although this seems unlikely because humans are poorly able to pass on the virus as described in chapter 3 a second possibility is that the virus arrived in a viremic bird being imported legally or illegally although there is no evidence for such an event it seems highly unlikely that a migratory bird that was off course introduced the virus because west nile first appeared near a major international airport the favored hypothesis is that the virus arrived in an infected mosquito that came along for the ride in a jet aircraft introduction of the virus was almost certainly a singular event west nile virus has had profound and well documented effects on horses and wildlife as it moved across north america many horses died of wn disease and a vaccine has now been introduced in order to protect horses the effect upon bird populations has been particularly dramatic crows jays and raptors hawks and owls are particularly sensitive to the virus almost all crows die after infection for example and in many parts of the country the crow population crashed with the arrival of the virus although there are recent signs that the population is at least partially recovering many raptors prey upon small rodents and are
important in controlling their numbers and a crash in their numbers results in an increase in rodent populations as an example of the sensitivity of some owls to wn virus there was an outbreak of wn disease in north american owls in a rehabilitation facility in ontario in 2002 associated with the die-off of corvids in the area large owls with a northern breeding range were particularly susceptible snowy owls northern hawk owls great gray owls and boreal owls experienced 100 mortality and northern saw-whet owls experienced 92 mortality wn virus is now well established in the americas and will surely continue to cause sporadic cases of human illness if not sporadic epidemics and sporadic die-offs of birds it is possible that the interruption of its transmission cycle described above is due to extensive die-off of susceptible species of birds that serve as its major amplifying vectors if so the resurgence of the crow population and the populations of other amplifying species could lead to renewed outbreaks similar to those that occurred with the first appearance and spread of the virus one encouraging finding relating to the potential of the virus to cause future epidemics of disease is the appearance of an attenuated variant of wn virus in texas in 2003 in a mouse model this variant is attenuated in neurovirulence the emergence of wn virus was associated with the appearance in europe and the middle east of a more virulent strain of virus perhaps enabling it to spread more easily it seems possible that once the virus becomes endemic attenuated strains may become dominant h5n1 virus was first detected in china in 1996 where it caused the death of a number of geese after undergoing reassortment to obtain new genes it surfaced in hong kong in 1997 where it became widespread in live poultry markets eighteen people were infected by the virus and six died the virus was eradicated by culling all domestic chickens in hong kong different reassortants of h5n1 continued to arise and in 2002 an epidemic of influenza killed most birds domestic and wild in hong kong nature parks two people were infected and one died the virus then spread widely over eastern asia the virus killed wild as well as domestic waterfowl and chickens and together with repeated efforts to stop the spread of the virus by culling of birds the death of more than 140 million birds occurred the virus has a high mortality rate in humans about 50 and as of early 2007 more than 150 people have died as a result of h5n1 infection there is no evidence for human-to-human transmission at the current time all human infections appear to have originated from close contact with infected birds the virus has continued to spread westward it has now reached many countries in europe and established a beachhead in africa it is thought that the virus will soon reach north america brought by migratory birds the mechanism of its rapid spread is not completely clear it is thought that transport of domestic birds may be responsible in part for the spread but there is reason to believe that wild waterfowl ducks geese and swans are also spreading the virus these birds undergo seasonal migrations over large distances and episodes of dead and dying migratory birds have been associated with the appearance of the virus in new areas the virus is continuing to evolve unlike most avian influenza viruses it is highly pathogenic in chickens and many strains are also pathogenic in ducks both domestic and wild virulence in wild ducks seems to be moderating as some recent isolates do not kill wild ducks but virulence in chickens continues all isolates contain the multibasic cleavage site in ha that is recognized by furin which is correlated with increased virulence studies of h5n1 virus in mice and ferrets have shown that many virus isolates are highly virulent for these mammals in one study with ferrets isolates from humans caused a fatal infection characterized by broad tissue tropism including infection of the brain in this same study isolates from birds caused nonlethal infection with virus replication restricted to the upper respiratory tract there have been three or four pandemics of influenza every century for as long as can be ascertained from historical studies and there is every reason to believe that pandemics will come again in the twenty-first century if h5n1 virus should acquire the ability to spread readily from person to person and if its high lethality for humans should continue unabated it could cause a devastating pandemic efforts are being made to prepare defenses against this virus including vaccines and antiviral drugs supported by the us government and other governments promising vaccines are being developed and tested in clinical trials and plans are to stockpile such a vaccine for possible use if an epidemic of this virus arises this effort is complicated by the fact that h5n1 influenza like all influenzas continues to evolve and stockpiled vaccine might not be completely effective against the strain that ultimately might emerge as a pandemic strain nevertheless there is hope that at least partial immunity might be effected by such a vaccine that could ameliorate the symptoms of the disease and protect against the extreme virulence of the virus as described in chapter 4 new approaches to flu vaccine development are being tried including development of a universal flu vaccine that would work against any influenza a strain but such an approach will clearly require many more years of research before a licensed vaccine for general use could be produced efforts are also being directed toward producing and stockpiling antiviral compounds directed against influenza unfortunately most h5n1 isolates tested are resistant to amantadine and related compounds antiflu agents that have been in use for years and that are readily available it is thought that this is the result of the wide use of amantadine by chinese farmers to protect their chicken flocks from influenza thereby selecting for amantadine-resistant variants of the viruses this effect may be moderating however as some recent isolates are sensitive to amantadine inhibitors of the influenza neuraminidase such as oseltamivir tamiflu and zanamivir appear to be reasonably effective against h5n1 virus but these drugs must be used early in infection if they are to be effective production of these compounds is limiting at present but production is being accelerated in order to stockpile them for possible use if or when a pandemic erupts an epidemic of h7n7 influenza a erupted in the netherlands in 2003 a total of 89 human infections was recorded of whom 86 were directly involved in handling poultry human-to-human transmission occurred and three family members were also affected the primary disease syndrome was conjunctivitis but there were two cases characterized by mild influenza-like symptoms only and one fatal case characterized by pneumonia followed by respiratory distress syndrome the virus was eradicated by culling of poultry in the country in 1999 two cases of human infection by h9n2 influenza a occurred in hong kong and five cases in guangdong province china then in 2003 another case occurred in hong kong the disease was characterized by mild influenza-like symptoms and recovery was uneventful dengue viruses are mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause widespread epidemics in humans chapter 3 forest cycles of dengue have been documented in africa and southeast asia in which the vertebrate reservoir is monkeys and various species of aedes mosquitoes maintain the virus recent sequencing studies have now shown that the sylvatic monkey viruses evolved in monkeys into four serotypes this evolution from a common ancestor occurred in the africansoutheast asian region at some time in the distant past these different dengue viruses then jumped independently into humans to become human dengue viruses a dendrogram of dengue viruses of monkeys sylvatic strains and humans endemicepidemic strains is shown in fig 87
 notice for example that the monkey dengue-4 virus groups with human dengue-4 but forms a distinct lineage from that of the other dengue viruses similarly monkey dengue-1 and dengue-2 group with the respective human viruses but form distinct lineages sequencing of sylvatic dengue-3 has not yet been done but it will presumably group in the same way from the extent of the divergence in sequences between the monkey viruses and the human viruses it is estimated that the jump to humans occurred on the order of 200 years ago for den-1 600 years ago for den-4 and 1000 years ago for den-2 it is further estimated that the african and malaysian sylvatic viruses diverged about 800 years ago such estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty but are probably valid to within a factor of two since human dengue virus is an exclusively human virus that is epidemic in nature and induces lifelong immunity it could not have existed until human populations were large enough to support the continued existence of such a virus this topic is covered in more detail in chapter 4 when discussing measles virus but sufficiently large human populations arose only within the last thousand years or so in the regions in which dengue viruses first arose and flourished dengue viruses have been continuously active over large areas of asia and the pacific region for many years they have recently dramatically expanded their range in the americas the viruses may have caused large epidemics in the americas including the united states in the 1800s and into the early 1900s however it is impossible to determine with certainty from descriptions of the disease written at the time whether dengue was the causative agent of these epidemics or whether other viruses that cause similar illnesses might have been responsible in any event dengue almost died out in the americas following world war ii because of efforts to control aedes aegypti the urban vector of the virus with the discovery of ddt in the mid 1900s a serious effort was made in the americas to eradicate ae aegypti from large regions in order to control viral diseases spread by these mosquitoes which include not only dengue but also yellow fever and other arboviruses these efforts succeeded in eliminating the mosquito from large areas of central and south america as illustrated in fig 88a
 however in 1970 these efforts were abandoned because of the expense involved and the detrimental effects of ddt on the environment and by 2000 the mosquito had reestablished itself over most of the region fig 88a the reintroduction of multiple dengue strains into the americas from foci in asia after the reestablishment of ae aegypti resulted in the outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever associated with huge epidemics of dengue fever fig 88b the history of the increasing infection rate is illustrated in fig 89
by data from brazil before 1993 epidemics of dengue were sporadic occurring every few years and then dying out after this however epidemics have occurred every year and the total number of cases has increased dramatically notice the difference in scales prior to the 1980s a native american strain of den-2 circulated and there was very little dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf in the americas a strain of den-3 circulated in the 1960s and 1970s but it then disappeared den-1 was introduced into the americas in 1977 and den-4 in 1981 and these viruses then radiated throughout large regions of the caribbean and northern south america the first epidemic of dhf occurred in 1981 but interestingly it was due to the introduction of a new strain of den-2 from asia this den-2 strain grows more vigorously than the native american strain which is not associated with dhf and led to the dhf epidemic then in 1994 the southeast asian strain of den-3 responsible for the dhf epidemic in sri lanka described in chapter 3 reached the americas the result of all these introductions has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of dhf and dengue shock syndrome dss in the americas whereas in the 1970s there were very few cases of dhf in the americas there were more than 10000 cases in the 1980s and more than 60000 cases in the 1990s cases have continued to increase in number in the last 5 years 20012005 inclusive more than 50000 cases have been reported that resulted in about 700 deaths the evolution of den-1 in the americas after its introduction in 1977 is illustrated in fig 810
 sequencing of strains isolated in various years after 1977 show that silent nucleotide substitutions ie synonymous substitutions that do not result in a coding change have been fixed at the rate of 02 per year however essentially no coding changes have occurred thus coding changes are not acceptable and viruses containing such changes do not persist until recently the extent of sivcpz infection of chimpanzees was not known the chimp is an endangered species limited in numbers difficult to study and only a few isolations of siv from chimps had been made in recent studies to examine the extent of siv infection of wild chimps 1300 stool samples from wild chimps were collected in the field and laboriously tested for the presence of anti-siv antibodies and for siv rna by rtpcr the individual responsible for the stools was identified by examining the host dna in the sample using highly polymorphic microsatellite loci several different chimp populations were included in these studies there are four different subspecies of chimpanzee the type subspecies pan troglodytes troglodytes is found in west africa in southern cameroon gabon and congo fig 812
 pan t schweinfurthii is further east primarily in the democratic republic of congo but penetrating northward into the central african republic and eastward into a swath from southern sudan down to tanzania pan t vellerosus is north of the range of troglodytes in northern and western cameroon finally pan t verus is west of the range of vellerosus in a broad zone from senegal to ghana subspeciation has resulted in part because chimps do not swim and large rivers fragment the various populations of these four subspecies only two troglodytes and schweinfurthii are naturally infected by siv rates of infection vary in different populations but average about 20 with some populations exhibiting almost 50 infected individuals thus sivcpz is a naturally occurring widespread virus for which two subspecies of chimps are the reservoir the virus does not appear to cause disease in chimps similar to the case for other sivs that infect african monkeys surprisingly sivcpz is itself a recombinant virus the 5 half of the genome is derived from siv infecting red-capped mangabeys whereas the 3 half is derived from siv infecting greater spot-nosed or mustached or mona monkeys fig 813
 the recombination probably occurred in a chimp that had been infected by the two sivs chimps eat other monkeys and could have become infected in this process in the same way that humans probably became infected with sivcpz upon slaughtering and eating chimps the fact that only two of the four subspecies of chimps are infected with sivcpz argues that this virus arose after subspeciation of the chimps had taken place the spread of this virus in chimps might in fact be a fairly recent occurrence after infection of humans by sivcpz the virus had to adapt to humans and become a human virus in order to be transmitted from person to person and to spread widely it seems probable that humans have become infected with sivcpz repeatedly but in most cases the virus failed to adapt to humans or failed to become epidemic because of the low transmissibility of the virus following a human infection it may have smoldered in a small number of people but then died out when the viruses crossed the species barrier and became firmly established in the human population as hiv-1 is not clear hiv-1 has been isolated from serum collected in 1959 in zaire and antibodies to hiv have been found in serum collected in 1963 in burkina faso so hiv-1 has been in the human population at least that long from sequencing studies of the glycoprotein gene and examination of the rate of divergence one estimate is that the virus might have entered the human population about 70 years ago although estimates of divergence rates are controversial recent changes in human behavior including more extensive travel by truck bus and plane changes in sexual practices and the use of injectable drugs as well as the increase in the human population could have allowed the virus to reach major population centers and spread more extensively than in the past becoming epidemic worldwide the spread of the virus could also have been aided by the appearance of mutants that were more easily transmissible from person to person the large increase in population during the last century has certainly resulted in more opportunities for the introduction and spread of the virus in humans and therefore for the selection of such transmissible mutants hiv-2 represents a distinct lineage that is closely related to siv of sooty mangabey monkeys smm and of macaques mac siv of african green monkeys agm and of mandrills mnd form other lineages that are more closely related to hiv-2 than to hiv-1 it is clear that sivsmm and sivagm are naturally occurring infectious agents that are widespread in africa and have coevolved with their monkey hosts sequence comparisons have shown that different isolates of siv group with their hosts rather than by geography and they are therefore adapted to their hosts they cause no disease in their natural host but sivsmm does cause aids when transferred to asian macaques in captivity hiv-2 is found primarily in western central africa where its distribution is almost coincident with that of mangabey monkeys it seems clear that hiv-2 represents a separate introduction of sivsmm into humans it has been found recently that the multiple introductions of siv into humans that became hiv-1 and -2 do not represent the only human infections by monkey retroviruses studies of bush meat hunters in cameroon showed that at least six retroviruses have crossed from monkeys into humans who were exposed to fresh bush meat these include two previously unknown retroviruses htlv-3 ptlv-3 and htlv-4 ptlv-4 thus infection of humans by simian retroviruses has not been a rare event a book called the river by edward hooper claimed that the hiv epidemic started because an early version of polio vaccine was contaminated by hiv or its progenitor no evidence for such contamination exists and recent analysis of lots of this vaccine that had been stored for 40 years by three different laboratories failed to find any trace of sivhiv in the vaccine further given that monkey viruses have repeatedly entered the human population it is unnecessary to postulate human vaccine activity for the origin of hiv rumors based upon this claim however have led to suspension of vaccination for polio in some african nations resulting in a resurgence of poliomyelitis in africa that has spread to other areas previously free of polio see chapter 3 hantaviruses are associated with rodents and infect humans through aerosols containing virus from rodent excreta the first hantavirus to come to medical attention was hantaan virus which caused more than 3000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in us troops during the korean war since then many hantaviruses have been identified in both the old world and in the americas that cause serious human illness they are examples of emerging viruses because as the number of humans increases and as they invade more habitat occupied by rodents carrying hantaviruses the incidence of infection in humans has risen very interesting in this regard was the isolation in may 1993 of a new hantavirus that causes acute respiratory distress in humans that can lead to rapid death a syndrome now called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps and originally called acute respiratory disease syndrome ards the virus was isolated by the cdc in collaboration with local health authorities following an epidemic in the four corners area of the southwestern united states that resulted in approximately 25 deaths the virus is associated with the deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus it is thought that the epidemic may have resulted from an abundance of pine nuts in the area during a good growing year leading the local people to harvest larger amounts of these than usual and store them in their homes when their normal storage areas became full with abundant food available the rodent population exploded and invaded homes to get to the pine nuts and it is thought that this more intimate contact between humans and rodents may have led to the epidemic the hantavirus responsible for this epidemic is now called sin nombre virus which is spanish for without a name early suggestions that it be called four corners virus or muerto canyon virus after a geographical feature in the area drew objections from local residents who did not want this major tourist area identified with a fatal disease eventually the cdc simply named it sin nombre there is a small creek in the area called the sin nombre river that serves as justification for the choice of name with the discovery of sin nombre virus searches for viruses in other regions of north america resulted in the isolation of many viruses related to sin nombre these viruses are associated with other rodents in the order sigmodontinae and have been given names of local features in order to distinguish them these include new york monongahela bayou and black creek canal viruses all of which have caused hps in the united states see fig 426 related viruses are also found in latin america in fact studies have now shown that hantaviruses are present in virtually all states within the united states and into latin america and that fatalities due to infection by the virus have occurred in most states retrospective studies of stored sera collected from patients who died of ards in the past have identified earlier cases of hps thus these viruses are widespread and have caused many fatal cases of human disease over the years as noted in chapter 4 the epidemiology of arenaviruses is similar to that of the hantaviruses several south american arenaviruses have caused increasing numbers of cases of human hemorrhagic fever because of increased contact between humans and the rodent carriers of the viruses the development of the pampas of argentina in particular led to increased incidence of human arenavirus disease  a simulation of a covid-19 epidemic based on a deterministic seir model jos carcione m juan santos e claudio bagaini jing ba  italy with a strong contagion rate we implement an seir model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic the example may ideally regard the situation in the italian region of lombardy where the epidemic started on february 24 but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters namely the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people the incubation and infectious periods and the fatality rate first we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions in order the epidemic to start there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human then we consider the lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date may 5 2020 and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature the peak occurs at  day 37 march 31 approximately when there is a rapid decrease with a reproduction ratio r 0  3 initially 136 at day 22 and 08 after day 35 indicating different degrees of lockdown the predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties with 27 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic the incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 425 days and the infectious period is 4 days with a fatality rate of 000144day values based on the reported official number of casualties the infection fatality rate ifr is 057  and 237  if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed however these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals if approximately nine times more individuals are exposed there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and ifr  047  if we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods we observe that a higher incubation period 13 versus 425 days gives the same ifr 06  versus 057  but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit of the data but some of the results may not be realistic therefore an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to the knowledge of precise bounds of the parameters besides the specific example the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic hence the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown the most abundant species in nature are viruses which are parasites since they cannot replicate themselves upon replication some viruses cause serious infectious diseases in human andor animals and are medically socially and economically important spinney 2017 adachi 2020  one of these species is coronavirus an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus covid-19 began officially in february 24 2020 in northern italy and the number of the newly reported cases still increase approximately 29000 casualties are reported in italy at the time of writing may 5 the serious danger covid-19 poses is reflected in the high number of cases of transmission to health-care workers more than 20  in italy the experience in china showed that the use of relative extreme isolation measures in conjunction with rapid diagnosis has a strong impact on the dynamics of the epidemic hence the importance to understand and quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the isolation measures eg chowell et al 2003  there is a long history of mathematical models in epidemiology going back to the eighteenth century bernoulli 1760 used a mathematical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the techniques of variolation against smallpox with the aim of influencing public health policy most of the models are compartmental models with the population divided into classes and assumptions about the time rate of transfer from one class to another hethcote 2000 brauer 2017  we consider a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir model to describe the spread of the virus and compute the number of infected and dead individuals the seir model has many versions and the mathematical treatment can be found for instance in hethcote 2000  keeling and rohani 2008 and diekmann et al 2013 among others the goal is to compute the number of infected recovered and dead individuals on the basis of the number of contacts probability of the disease transmission incubation period recovery rate and fatality rate the epidemic disease model predicts a peak of infected and dead individuals per day as a function of time and assumes that births and natural deaths are balanced since we are dealing with a very short period of time the population members solely decrease due to the disease dictated by the fatality rate of the disease the differential equations are solved with a forward-euler scheme when no vaccine is available the isolation of diagnosed infectives and social distancing are the only control measures available we consider an seir epidemic disease model eg hethcote 2000 al-showaikh and twizell 2004 keeling and rohani 2008 diekmann et al 2013  the total initial population n 0  is categorized in four classes namely susceptible st exposed et infected-infectious it and recovered rt where t is the time variable the governing differential equations ar where n  s  e  i  r  n 0 in this case and a dot above a variable denotes time differentiation equations 1 are subject to the initial conditions s0 e0 i0 and  rate of progression from exposed to infectious the reciprocal is the incubation period  recovery rate of infectious individuals the reciprocal is the infectious period having units of 1t with t time the scheme is illustrated in figure 1  the choice     0 and   gives the classical sir model eg d onofrio 2015  while if  and  are not zero the model is termed endemic sir model eg allen 2017  however the sir model has no latent stage no exposed individuals and then it is inappropriate as a model for diseases with an such as that of the covid-19 let us clarify better the meaning of each quantity n is the total number of live humans in the system at time t s is the number of humans susceptible to be exposed and e is the actual number of exposed individuals a class in which the disease is latent they are infected but not infectious people go from s to e depending on the number of contacts with i individuals multiplied by the probability of infection  see figure 1  where in is the average number of contacts with infection per unit time of one susceptible the other processes taking place at time t are exposed e become infectious i with a rate and infectious recover r with a rate  recovered means individual who do not flow back into the s class as lifelong immunity is assumed but it remains to be seen whether the recovered patients from covid-19 will develop antibodies and achieve lifelong protection the reciprocals 1 and  1 are the average disease incubation and infectious periods respectively  is the rate of birth and  is the natural rate of death both per unit time the reciprocal  1  interpreted as the normal life expectancy eg 70 yr refers to average normal deaths eg natural deaths by normal flu accidents etc not related to the infectious disease these quantities describe a model with vital dynamics endemic model which have an inflow of births into the s class at rate  and deaths into the other classes at rates s i and r see figure 1  if   n  the deaths balance the newborns the number of live people at time t is n t  st  et  it  rt that can be lower or higher than n 0 depending on the value of  and  in this case it is lower than n 0  one of the key parameters besides  is  that represents the disease-related fatality rate chowell et al 2003 zhang et al 2013  in a very fast pandemic we may assume that there are no births and normal deaths or they balance and   n  but deaths due to the fatality rate of the disease this rate is an average because the model does not take into account the age a far higher portion of old people die from the disease than young people the patients preexisting conditions and the healthcare quality in summary susceptible persons enter the exposed class with a rate proportional to  and remain there for a mean incubation period 1  ie those already infected with the disease but not able to transmit it are in the exposed class and progress to the infectious class to recover at the rate  and die at the rate  the dead population as a function of time is dt  n 0  n t whereas the curve giving the dead people per unit time i another equivalent approach is an seidr model eg de la sen et al 2017 sameni 2020  where we have to add to equations 1 in keeling and rohani 2008 section 2  where  is the per capita probability of dying from the infection it can easily be shown that equations 2 and 3 are equivalent if births and natural deaths compensate the basic reproduction ratio r 0  is the classical epidemiological measure associated with the reproductive power of the disease for the seir model it is diekmann et al 2013 zhang et al 2013  it gives the average number of secondary cases of infection generated by an infectious individual therefore it is used to estimate the growth of the virus outbreak r 0 provides a threshold for the stability of the diseasefree equilibrium point when r 0  1 the disease dies out when r 0  1 an epidemic occurs the behaviour of seir models as a function of r 0 can be found for instance in al-sheikh 2012 the infection fatality rate ifr is based on all the population that has been infected ie including the undetected individuals and asymptomatic in terms of the recovery and fatality rates we have since the total humans that have been infected is the sum of the recovered and dead individuals where the subscript refers to the end of the epidemic t   it can easily be shown that using the last equation 1 and equation 3 we obtain since the term containing  is much smaller because    and equation 6 holds approximately at all times not only at the end of the epidemic on the other hand the case fatality rate cfr considers the number of deaths related to the diagnosed individuals and it is always cfr  ifr since the number of diagnosed individuals is lower than the denominator of equation 5 the cfr is time dependent and is the usually reported value we solve the differential equations 1 by using a forward euler finite-difference scheme eg carcione 2014  discretizing the time variable as t  ndt where n is a natural number and dt is the time step equations 1 and 2 become after discretization where n is the number of dead people only in the specific day n this algorithm yields positive and bounded solutions eg see brauer 2017 and problem 142iv in diekmann et al 2013  and the system converges to an equilibrium ie s n  r n  let us consider the following base parameters as an example to analyze the results by varying some of them n 0  10 million   0006day   075day   18day  13day   n balance of births and natural deaths and initial conditions table 1  for sars and implies an average disease incubation latent period of 3 days and an infectious period of 8 days the data correspond to no isolation conditions among individuals and an epidemic situation high  r 0  572  1 the time step of the euler scheme to solve the discretized equations 7 is dt  001 day figure 2 shows the number of individuals in the different classes a and the total number of dead people d and the number of dead people per specific day  b as can be seen the peak of dead individuals per day is reached at day 30 the high values in figure 2b do not consider complete home isolation and social distancing measures or suppression the maximum number of infected individuals is almost 4 million according to data from china around 5  of people who tested positive to covid-19 experience severe symptoms and require admission to an intensive-care unit almost 200 thousands individuals in this case then the health system would be completely overwhelmed with very high death rates and inability to provide intensive care a partial mitigation strategy involving social distancing home isolation of suspect cases and social distancing of the elderly would not be enough and a severe lockdown is required in order to decrease r 0 possibly less than 1 ferguson et al 2020  hereafter we vary the parameters and plot the infected i individuals ie excluding those who are incubating the disease e in order the process to start there should be at least one exposed or one infectious individual figure 3 shows the number of infected individuals for r 0  1 a and r 0  1 b where all the other parameters are kept constant unless  that takes the value for  much smaller than  and   1  83 yr in italy we recall here that  is the probability of transmission times the number of contacts per unit time basically reducing  and r 0  the peak decreases in intensity but moves to later times for r 0 higher than 1 figure 3a  although it is wider there is a significant reduction in the number of infected individuals for r 0  1 meaning that strict home isolation is very effective below a given threshold the effect of the initially exposed individuals are shown in figure 4 for two sets of values of r 0  greater a and less b than 1 figure 4a indicates that more exposed people does not mainly affects the intensity of the peak but anticipates the spread of the epidemic so that the location of the peak is highly dependent on e0 on the other hand figure 4b shows that for r 0  1 the peak location does not change but its intensity does it significantly indicating an effective suppression of the epidemic with more exposed more infectious figure 5 indicates that the incubation period 1  has also an impact on the results if r 0  1 5a increasing the period from 3 to 9 days decreases the maximum number of infected individuals by almost half and delays the spread of the epidemic but the peak is wider if r 0  1 the curves behave similarly but there are much less infected cases the initially infectious individuals from one to ten thousand has no apparent effect on the results as can be seen in figure 6  but this is not the case when we deal with the real case history see next subsection the effects of the infectious period are shown in figure 7  where as expected increasing this quantity delays the epidemic when r 0  1 below r 0  1 the number of infected individuals decreases substantially let us assume now that isolation precautions have been imposed and after day 22 r 0 changes from 572 to 01 a change of  according to equation 8 extreme isolation after imperfect isolation anticipates the process figure 9 shows the results if the isolation measures start two days before at day 20 instead of day 22 the number of casualties decreased from 220 k to 155 k next we attempt to model the covid-19 epidemic in lombardy italy where the data is available at httpsgithubcompcm-dpccovid-19 the time of writing is day 72 may 5 and the availability of data allows us to perform a relatively reliable fit of the total number casualties from day 1 to date on day 69 may 2 329 casualties were reported of which 282 are equally distributed in april since this number is a late report of the hospitals corresponding to the whole month of april to predict with high accuracy the behaviour of the epidemic is nearly impossible due to many unknown factors eg the degree of spacial distancing lack of knowledge of the probability of the disease transmission characteristics of the disease and parameters of the epidemic uncertainties are related to the parameter  that varies with time while the others are assumed to lie between certain bounds and also contribute to the error relative predictions of the trend require an analysis of the data particularly to define the variation of  and r 0 with time we do not assume a specific continuous function but a general approach should consider a partition into discrete periods t 0  t 1  t 1   guided by the measures taken by the state and the behaviour of the population in this case t 0  1 day t 1  22 day and t 2  35 day ie l  3 since after t 1 march 16 home isolation social distancing and partial nation lockdown started to be effective as indicated by an inflection point in the curve of casualties per day see below although it is debatable that the italian government followed the same rules as in wuhan china we also observe that at t 2 march 29 the curve starts to bend downwards and reach a peak this partition in three periods is valid to date but the trend can have an unpredictable behavior due to the factors mentioned above a too early removal of the lockdown conditions etc the reported infected people cannot be used for calibration because these data cannot be trusted the hospitalization numbers cannot be considered to be representative of the number of infected people and it is largely unknown at present the number of asymptomatic undiagnosed infections however we are aware that even using the number of casualties is uncertain since there can be an under-ascertainment of deaths but the figures cannot vary as much as the error related to the infected individuals hence the reported number of deceased people could possibly be underestimated due to undeclared cases this number depends on the country quality of the health system and average age of the population but it is certain that this novel virus is more deadly and spreads more quickly than seasonal flu moreover authorities make a distinction between a death occurred with the co-action of the virus and the death caused by the virus indeed only a small percentage of the casualties were in healthy conditions prior the infection and most of the patients were already affected by other illnesses eg diabetes dementia cancer stroke therefore we also consider cases where 100  more people have actually died per day compared to the official figures in order to accomplish the fit we use the simulated annealing algorithm developed by goffe et al 1994  the fortran code can be found in httpseconwpaub uni-muenchendeecon-wpprogpapers94069406001txt the fit is based on the l 2 -norm and yields   1 before t 0   2 after t 0   3 after t 1   e0 and  from the beginning of the epidemic day 1 february 24 to date day 72 may 5 ie seven free parameters we use the total number of deaths for the calibration table 1 shows the constraints initial values and results for different cases where cases 1 and 2 correspond to approximately nine times less exposed individuals at the beginning of the epidemic and cases 2 and 3 assume double casualties cases 4 and 5 consider a wider range of the lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods  1 and  1  the last column do not correspond to variables but indicates the infected individuals at the end of the epidemic ie i  r  d  r and the day of the last infected individual the end of the epidemic in theory the results are very sensitive to variations of the parameter  and consequently those of r 0  mostly due to the impact of the performed intervention strategies figure 10 shows the curves of case 1 compared to the data black dots with ifr  057  and r 0 decreasing from 3 to 08 at the end of the epidemic the final infected individuals are 269 million people see figure 11a and table 1  figure 11b compares the infectious and dead individuals per day and as expected the two curves are synchronous since a proportion  of infectious individuals die the inflection point at day 22 figure 10b indicates that the isolation measures started to be effective strict isolation could not be achieved at day 22 due to several reasons and there is a reasonable delay of a few days before it can be implemented day 35 the total number of casualties is approximately 15600 and the effective duration of the epidemic is about 100 days however see the last column indicating the day when the last individual is infected obtained with the condition i  1 recent data reveal that the effective duration of the wuhan epidemic was almost 60 days wu et al 2020 fig  1b  a shorter period favoured by the very strict isolation measures applied in that city case 2 that considers twice more casualties and whose results are shown in figure 12  has a high fatality rate ifr  237  but 133 million infected people if the exposed individuals are much higher case 3 we obtain ifr  047  and 65 million infected people see figures 13 and 14 and table 1  but in this case the fit is not optimal at the beginning of the epidemic the calculations indicate the uncertainty related to the initially exposed individuals ie those that are incubating the disease in the following we do not show the plots but the results honour the data if we modify the constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds the results are those of cases 4 and 5 in table 1  case 4 has slightly higher incubation and infectious periods compared to case 1 but a higher ifr 225  versus 057  whereas more exposed individuals yield an incubation period of 13 days and lower ifr case 5 case 6 considers that initially there are a few exposed individuals we start with one the algorithm gives a very good fit of the data with ifr  36  comparable periods to case 1 and 044 m infected individuals case 7 that considers i0  1 and starts with one exposed individual has a good fit but ifr is too high possibly wrong indicating that at day 1 there were more exposed and infectious individuals less initially exposed and infectious individuals requires a higher ifr to fit the curve but also a higher r 0 could have the same effect if the ifr is kept within a realistic range finally we constraint the incubation and infectious periods between 10 and 20 days and the results are those of cases 8 and 9 assuming different initially exposed individuals the calculations yield fatality rates comparable to that of sars chowell et al 2003  as case 6 these calculations indicate the uncertainty in the determination of the parameters of the epidemic but the solutions has to be restricted to reasonable values of the properties of the disease and parameters of the epidemic the values in table 1 for china an ifr  0657  but over 60 yr age this rate is 328  if the number of infected people is several times higher than the reported cases the fatality rate could be considerably less than the official one suggesting that this disease is less deadly than sars and mers although much more contagious read et al 2020 report a mean value r 0  4 while wu et al 2020 obtain values between 18 and 2 according to chowell et al 2003  ifr  48  for sars and verity et al 2020 state that the average case fatality rate cfr of sars is higher than that of covid-19 with the latter approximately 138  their ifr is 0657  however this virus seems to be much more contagious the meaning of  1 is the life expectancy of an individual in the infectious class ie if   000144day case 1 the expectancy is 694 days there are more complex versions of the seir model as for instance including a quarantine class and a class of isolated hospitalized members brauer and castillo-chavez 2012  or generalizing the diffusion equations 1 with the use of temporal fractional derivatives the replacement of the first-order temporal derivative by a caputo fractional derivative of non-natural order provides an additional parameter to fit the data eg caputo et al 2011 mainardi 2010 chen et al 2020  furthermore the model can be made two-dimensional by including the spatial diffusion of the virus eg na- et al 2016 and in addition there are stochastic models allen 2017  although the calibration becomes extremely difficult with the incomplete data provided by the authorities and the high number of parameters to be found at the end of the epidemic more precise information about the parameters will be available and the complete data can be used to evaluate the development of  and r 0  with time the outbreak of a pandemic can have catastrophic consequences not only from the point of view of the casualties but also economically therefore it is essential to absolutely avoid it by taking the necessary measures at the right time something that has not been accomplished in italy and the rest of the world according to these calculations the effective measures are social distancing and home isolation since there is no health system designed for ordinary circumstances that can be prepared for a pandemic when the infected individuals grows exponentially as can be seen the pandemic can develop in a few days and the number of casualties can be extremely high if the fatality rate and contagiousness of the disease are high only a few days to take action can make a big difference in the prevention of this disaster the pandemic and its consequences have been predicted in october 2019 by a group of experts httpswwwpolitico comnewsmagazine20200307coronavirus-epidemic-prediction-policy-advice-121172 but states ignored the fact and transnational nature of the threat delaying the necessary measures to avoid the disaster minimizing in many cases the downsides to their own populations and economies moreover in less than three weeks the virus has overloaded the health-care system over northern italy in particular lombardy where the system cannot support this type of emergency and the authorities are not prepared to deal with the epidemic a high number of secondary infections by covid-19 can take place when an infected individual is introduced into a community it is essential to simulate the process of infection and death in advance to apply adequate control measures and mitigate the risk of virus diffusion one of the most used mathematical algorithms to describe the diffusion of an epidemic disease is the seir model that we have applied to compute the number of infected recovered and dead individuals on the basis of the number of contacts probability of the disease transmission incubation and infectious periods and disease fatality rate a first analysis of the results of the model is based on parameters of the sars disease and we assume that the parameters do not change during the whole epidemic reducing the number of contacts the peak decreases in intensity but moves to later times although it is wider moreover more exposed people does not affect the intensity of the peak but anticipates the epidemic the incubation period has also an impact on the results with higher values delaying the epidemic the dependence on the initial number of infected people is weak apparently if r 0 does not change during the epidemic increasing the infectious period has the opposite effect of increasing the incubation period moreover the day when the isolation starts is important since only two days makes a big difference in the number of casualties the lombardy modeling assumes ten million of individuals and has been calibrated on the basis of the total number of casualties the results show that the peak occurs to nine times more exposed individuals these values are obtained by constraining the incubation and infectious periods to values reported in the literature if we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds we obtain slightly higher incubation and infectious periods compared to the first case but a much higher ifr 225  versus 057  while much more exposed individuals yields an incubation period of 13 days and a lower ifr 06  the present data fit and consequent prediction of the epidemic does not take into account the second phase established by the state which started on may 4 after the partial opening of the economy and under a less stringent lockdown the reproduction number could increase and induce a second outbreak of the epidemic therefore a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the parameters of the epidemic and characteristics of the disease and it is clear from these calculations that the usefulness of simple models to predict is limited and that their main role is to help in our understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic models can be used to predict and understand how an infectious disease spreads in the world and how various factors affect the dynamics even if the predictions are inaccurate it has been clear to scientists from many decades to date that quarantine social distancing and the adoption of very strict health and safety standards are essential to stop the spreading of the virus quarantine was even implemented in medieval times to fight the black death before knowing the existence of viruses in this sense this pandemic reveals the failure of policy makers since it is well known from basic modeling results that anticipating those measures can save thousand of lives and even prevent the pandemic the interface of science society and politics is still uneasy even in highly developed countries revealing a disregard for scientific evidence moreover one of the consequences is that some of these countries do not invest sufficiently in rd and must acquire the new technology overseas at a much higher cost author contributions jmc has

covid-19 is far more than just a data science issue-its a massive public health problem that has resulted in many deaths and is throwing a harsh light onto how we structure our society when it comes to important things like the availability and affordability of healthcare workers rights and even freedom of movement but as a data scientist i do think its important to look at the situation through a data science perspective weve all seen curves on twitter-exponential flattened and otherwiseplotted in excel and been reassured by them or scared by them or wondered whether we could trust them thats a data science question and there are many similar ones that i want to address here in the hopes that what i write will inspire others to think about the data and feel more empowered about what to do in this situation data collection when it comes to infectious diseases is difficult at the best of times the rise of big data has provided clinicians and researchers with the systems and ability to store and work with large amounts of data but in public health critical surveillance systems remain primarily based on manually collected and coded data which are slow to collect and difficult to disseminate traditional health surveillance systems are notorious for severe time lags and lack of spatial resolution and our current situation has demonstrated clearly that systems that are robust local and timely are thus critically needed bansal et al journal of infectious diseases 214 s375-s379 data scientists working in public health can learn from their colleagues in other domains where real-time data acquisition and analysis of high-resolution data are common for a disease like coronavirus where the majority of infections are mild and are therefore self-treated relying on hospital and general practitioner records to estimate the spread can be misleading in the early stages of the disease progression reporting tends to focus on morbidity and mortality and its easier to count the people who have actually presented themselves at health facilities for testing or care a key fact for us all to remember is that for the majority of countries were not actually counting how many people have the virus-instead were counting the reports of how many people have the virus and like all metrics those numbers vary according to how theyre measured an increase in the number of tests being carried out will result in an increase in the number of infections detected as of the date of writing march 25 2020  only iceland has done systematic sampling of a broad enough sample of the population including those who have not shown symptoms to allow us to get a handle on how many people are asymptomatic httpswwwgovernmentisnewsarticle20200315largescale-testing-of-general-population-in-iceland-underway this shows not only the general prevalence of the virus in the general population but further testing will give us an understand-ing of how the virus spreads and how well the containment techniques social distancing etc are working leaving aside any conspiracy theories about governmental cover-ups the simple fact is that testing for coronavirus is expensive this means that the numbers collected in a given country will be influenced by not only how widespread the virus actually is but also the financial ability for the local health care facilities to give the test to everyone who presents with concerns that theyre infected this is a classic data sampling problem and something that data scientists can explain in ways that can ease the concerns of the general public about the increasing number of cases while at the same time working with health professionals to better understand the spread and distribution of cases collecting accurate data and understanding the limitations of the data that have already been collected is an essential part of understanding the situation without good data policymakers cant make good decisions data scientists can help with this once we have data the questions change what will happen next how will the virus spread what will happen to the spread if certain non-pharmaceutical interventions are put in place how effective is social distancing in comparison with countrywide quarantine what are the longer-term impacts of for example shutting schools for the next month or longer how can we track the spread of virus through our understanding of social networks and human behavior is the risk of catching the virus as high if you watch the football match in the pub as compared with the stadium data scientists in collaboration with other researchers are uniquely placed to be able to find answers to these questions work has already been

develop the models but also to determine in which ways theyre wrong and which ways theyre useful because the results of these models will inform along with data the decisions that are made to combat the spread of this pandemic i would urge all data scientists wishing to help in these modeling efforts to not just simply grab the data and plug them into their preferred analysis software the numbers

predicting it accurately than we ever have had in the past but even once the pandemic is over there will still be data science work to do perakslis patterns httpsdoiorg10 1016jpatter2020100018 the data collection may stop because there are no new cases but thats the time to make sure that what were collected are stored and managed properly looking back at the situation with the benefit of hindsight can be painful but its the only way we can ensure that lessons learned during this time are fully understood after it all ends is also the time to look at the systems and structures medical scientific social that worked and the ones that didnt with the view of improvement we will also need to take stock of some of the measures that were employed to deal with the situation yes in times of emergency tracking infected persons via their cell phones may well be the sensible thing to do to contain the transmission of the virus but once the immediacy of that situation is over we will need to ask ourselves if there is a way that could have been done that didnt infringe on personal privacy or the other rights we hold so dear what are we as a society prepared to accept in order to ensure our health and safety and what can data science do to raise our societal health while minimizing the effects on our rights remember the people behind the numbers data science deals with numbers statistics curves and distributions we do this because its easier to work with numbers on a population scale and our tools work best when fed large amounts of data this is alright if i have one plea it is that all of us data scientists or not remember that behind those numbers are human lives real people who are worried and afraid for themselves or for their loved ones its easy enough to calculate a mortality curve that shows that it is those who are r60 years old or suffer from pre-existing conditions are the most likely to die its another thing to realize that those figures show that its your aged parents or grandparents or immunocompromised friends and family who are most at risk we live in challenging times but with the right data and the right science we can make a difference   it feels like im the dirtiest person in the world adel almutairi f abdallah adlan a hanan balkhy h oraynab abbas a alexander clark m   the middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers is caused by an emerging zoonotic virus that was identified for the first time in september 2012 1 it quickly became a virus of international public health significance due to the high mortality rate around 35 of infected people and its ability to spread rapidly in hospitals over 80 of reported cases have occurred in the arabian peninsula with the largest reported outbreak occurring in a tertiary hospital in jeddah in 2014 2 and led to major political ramifications on the healthcare system in the kingdom of saudi arabia 3 mers-cov affects the respiratory system and leads to respiratory failure especially in older people immunocompromised individuals and those suffering from cardiopulmonary illnesses 4 mers-cov belongs to the lineage of the c beta-coronaviruses first identified in bats 5 and is transmitted to humans through an intermediate animal such as the dromedary camel 6 7 however most mers-cov infections are spread from human to human through direct or indirect contact with infected people for example through droplets from coughing or sneezing from shaking hands or from touching contaminated surfaces 8 these infections can be transmitted among close family members in the community and in healthcare facilities from patients to healthcare providers since its emergence mers has been diagnosed in patients in 25 other countries including jordan kuwait oman qatar yemen tunisia the united arab emirates uae egypt iran lebanon turkey the united kingdom germany france italy algeria austria greece the netherlands the united states malaysia china the philippines the republic of korea and thailand the highest number of cases was reported in saudi arabia 1470 9 the second highest in the republic of korea 165 cases and the third highest in the uae 74 cases 10 more than 9 hospital based outbreaks have been reported by saudi ministry of health authorities 9 so preparation for a potential mers outbreak at king abdulaziz medical city in riyadh kamc-r the hospital based outbreak committee assisted by the infection prevention and control department prepared a staged response to mers that was based on the number of mers cases clustering together at any given time this was known as the infectious disease epidemic plan idep 3 11 for this particular outbreak the index case was identified on june 21 2015 and as the number of cases were increased the idep was activated with the widespread of mers in the emergency room level three which is the highest level for the plan called for the closure of the hospital and evacuated wards were being reassigned to cohort confirmed exposed and non infectednone exposed patients this eventually led to the successful control of the outbreak which was declared over on october 12 2015 research has identified that such outbreaks do not just have organizational implications outbreaks of severe viruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov can provoke fear emotional ethical and cultural conflicts and tensions for healthcare providers in workplaces and those providing direct patient care to infected patients or those who have survived infection 12 13 in such instances healthcare workers have refused to provide patient care 14 this is the first qualitative study to examine the perspectives of health professionals on an mers outbreak it contributes valuable and new insights into the unique challenges faced by health professionals caring for mers during this 2015 outbreak at the kamc-r we believe our findings will provide specific insight into what is needed to enhance the preparation of institutions to support their hcws in this very special scenario of a disaster participants were selected using a purposivenon-probabilitysampling strategy 16 participants were frontline healthcare providers who were mers confirmed and were admitted to the hospital due to the infection during the 2015 outbreak and who also met the following criteria 1 they consent to participate in the study and 2 they are fluent in english after obtaining ethical approval for this study invitations to participate were sent to health professionals through the hospitals department of infectious disease as they are responsible for the information concerning all mers-cov patients both volunteer and snowball sampling were used with seven participants agreeing to participate data were collected using face-to-face semi-structured interview approach with each participant 17 the duration of each interview was approximately from 45 to 90 min the sample was composed of an almost equal number of male n  3 and female n  4 participants they represent different age groups four are from 28 to 29 years old one is 51 years and the last two are 61 and 66 years four participants are working as staff nurses and the other three are physicians they have also worked at the study hospital for different lengths of time ranging from 2 to 17 years participants are from different countries three from the philippines two from saudi arabia one from the united states of america and one from korea the interview data were analyzed using the inductive approach to qualitative data analysis in particular the thematic analysis technique which is a method of identifying and interpreting patterned meaning across the collected data the analysis approach comprised six phases including coding searching reviewing defining and naming themes and then weaving together the analytic narrative data quotes and discussion in light of the existing literature 18 in this study the data analysis was undertaken separately by the first and second authors of this study to strengthen the analysis process by supplementing and contesting each others statements 19 collectively these steps were intended to maintain the rigor of the study every participant was given the choice to participate after receiving all the relevant information the acceptance was recorded and documented by signing the informed consent participants reported emotions and involvement in care for mers patients were diverse some participants expressed a high level of altruism associated with professionalism by always going the extra mile for their patients and exposing themselves to high levels of risk therefore they believed they caught the virus as a result of prioritizing patient care over their own health which consequently might have led them either consciously or unconsciously to exercise poor self-protection and precautions the motives of feeling obligated to attend to the needs and best interests of those who were infected as well as to maintaining their professionalism were manifested in their reported intentional practice of providing the maximum level of care even in a high risk situation this was primarily how the participants reflected on how they caught the virus in the first place for example a participant explained as followsin the er  we had patients in the hallway and we had patients positive with corona behind curtains and i was examining and seeing every single patient with corona in this hospital by myself and thats the price i paid
 so the one who got positive virus i think was me the survivor i think i was too close to the patient  because i examine the patient more than the junior
 another participant described his feelings about surviving the virus and considered his survival to be a reward from god for the hard work he was doing for patients during the outbreaklet me tell you something sometimes i feel that i survived this disease because god knows that i was doing the right thing
 in contrast such feelings of obligation and what arguably seems to be altruistic action were not always the case for many healthcare providers other participants expressed how they were anxious about their safety and self-protection apparently the seeming panic of colleagues fear inducing stories that were told of infected patients and perceived severity of clinical presentations of the virus contributed to their increased anxiety level which consequently affected their work performance and willingness to work in such a risky environment despite these fears participants perceived they had an ethical or employment related obligation to provide carei was afraid you know when i have patients that has fever i already get paranoid so when i heard about the outbreak already i wanna go home but theres nothing i can do i have a contract and then i forced myself to stay
its pretty scary but ah as a healthcare provider we cannot say  i dont wanna work  because its our job  thats the main reason how this virus got into my body 
 in instances in which health care providers were frightened of catching the virus to the extent some decided to refuse to provide care to their patients participants described their own negative and painful experiences of being seen as carriers and survivors of mers in the community which were perceived to have affected them psychologically emotionally and cognitively apparently peoples desire to avoid the epidemic infection and remain healthy resulted in either in a subtle or unsubtle way behaviours of social rejection and neglect of those who survived the infection participants explained a variety of painful experiences of rejection and avoidance by their colleagues and neighbours even after recoveryi was standing by my window here next to my house there is a park and a lot of people here walk to the bus stop and in the park there is a distance like maybe from here to you i was standing here looking to my window through the curtain and one nurse who i talk to a lot called and i was walking here and i could see her but and i went back i didnt want her to see me and she told yeah im at the hospital and when i have the time i will come to see youi said okay dont worry yeah im sorry its basically very clearly implying that i dont want to be near you
 this stigma was perceived to arise from the public suspicion that the survivors still had the virus in their bodies peoples fear and anxiety resulted in intentionally ignoring and excluding survivors from their social life or signalling them for special questionsa lot of people knew about it if i go near them they will ask are you negative were you the one who had corona and then they will cover their nose yeah
i felt badit feels like im the dirtiest person in the world thats why they have to avoid me i cant approach them because they are terrified you know i felt bad 
 this conduct led to social isolation and appeared to reduce participants self-esteem sense of meaningful existence and belonging which resulted in social pain and distress on the other hand one participant described the opposite experience with a group of his saudi colleagues during his illness he explained the extent of caring and unconditional emotional support they provided when he was admitted into the hospital and they did not exhibit any intimidation behaviours or rejection the following quotes explain his sentimentsi was born christiani think the islamic teaching of just brotherly love and compassion manifested in the way i was treated by a b and c without question you know and that was the first time i cried and not because i was in pain but because of the showing of caring it touched me so muchi didnt cry because i was in pain no but because of the genuinei mean some people who fake it it was genuine it was real
 the diagnoses of participants as mers created intense feelings of fear and anxiety their infection was a traumatic and dreadful experience as they realized that their lives were at risk and they could die at any time being in the hospital and receiving healthcare did not help they reported feeling hopeless and helpless and frightened of the scenarios that could happen to them their despair about their futures was exacerbated by their medical knowledge and the fact that they had witnessed many patients die from this viral infection for example the following participants quote revealed how they perceived the correlation between their infection and deathin the morning they said i was positive of corona so my feeling that time was very terrible and of course when i say corona all our patients died from corona
 the participants medical knowledge compounded their fear by adding additional stress they started to imagine the scary and seemingly inevitable scenarios that could happen to them including suffering the disease that would eventually lead to their death for exampleso even i have this kind of thinking oh my god after few days i will die after few days i will get intubated or something like this like thati was really scared if i will survive or if i will be gone that time
 contrary to many participants experiences one of the survivors did not realize the serious and fatal consequences of mers-cov even though he was admitted to the icu this could be because he was not physically too sick or he was in the denial phase he only realized the seriousness of the condition when he witnessed deceased patients being taken from the icu to the morgue it was a shifting paradigm and life-changing moment participants were traumatized to the point that they dreamt about their ordeals even after recovering they still felt their recovery was not complete and suffered from the intensity of their experiences the description below highlights one of the participants feelings which were echoed by othersim trying to avoid thinking about the incidenti still have dreams especially yesterday i dreamt about being in icu seeing everything inserting all the tubes and needles i saw i think it will be a big part of my life already
 denial and lack of understanding of the seriousness of the disease occurred in the early stages of the epidemic at two levels the personal level in which healthcare providers had different perceptions of the aggressiveness of the infection and at the official level in which the official responses to dealing with the situation and containing the virus could not cope with the nature of the infection it is noteworthy that these findings only reflect the perceptions of those who were traumatized by their experience of surviving the virus in this environment which may or may not reflect the complexity of the situation nevertheless the perceived denial and underestimation might have contributed significantly to the outbreak of mers in the hospital for example at a personal level one participant reflected on his experience which was similar to that of other participants saying that he thought that the mers outbreak was under control and it did not occur to him that he would catch the virus he explainedthe thing that comes to mind is that life was going on as usual you know that we had the outbreak in march so we thought we were over it and mafee mushkelah arabic for no problem and everything in life was going on
 participants continued reflecting on their experiences and described how suspicious patients who eventually turned out to be mers-cov positive were scattered around the emergency department and in the hallway without applying proper infection control practices therefore the official responses to the outbreak at the early stages were not congruent with the seriousness of the situation one explanation of such a questionable infectious disease prevention response is official denial and underestimation of the outbreak such underestimation of the seriousness of the infection caused a delay in acknowledging the outbreak and then announcing it properly to everyone so they could exercise their highest level of vigilance the participants views on this matter were critical they described how they had to work under the high risk of infection without proper warningcreate a policy where you alert the staff as soon as you have one case or two cases in the er you ie the decision makers should have alerted all the staff
 healthcare providers were seen to neglect hand hygiene practice and other infection prevention measures as they believe it will slow down their practice thus from their perspective if healthcare providers were well informed about the chances of getting the infection they would prioritize strict infection control measures even if it would mean slower practice and that fewer patients could be seen in each clinic the concerns about the lack of knowledge and proper education about the outbreak and related infection control measures were echoed by most of the participants from the participants rich and illuminating experiences during the outbreak and of surviving mers four main themes were identified shaping their experiences the first three themes mainly revolve around the extent of care that participants as healthcare professionals provided to patients during the epidemic outbreak their painful experiences of social prejudice and stigmatization and the moments of diagnosing participants as mers-cov positive which provoked an intense feeling of fear anxiety about their fate and then despair about their future the fourth theme refers to the underestimation of the seriousness of the disease as the healthcare providers had different understandings of the aggressiveness of the mers-cov infection which led them to perceive that the organizational responses were not congruent with the nature of the infection regarding the extent of patient care during the outbreak participants experiences were not uniform some participants prioritized patient care over their own health exposing themselves to risks such behaviours can be better explained through the theoretical lens of altruism which is associated in this situation with a sense of professionalism the notion of altruism which was first coined by auguste comte in the 19th century basically refers to an unselfish act that is undertaken voluntarily and intentionally to promote the welfare of others 20 21 there are two types of altruism normative and autonomous the former refers to the usual acts of helpfulness regulated by social norms with low risk and low cost to the performer whereas the latter refers to intentional acts that are undertaken primarily for the benefit of others and often associated with high risk and high cost 20 therefore those participants who always went the extra mile for their patients believed that they caught the virus as a result of their altruism it seems their eagerness to help their patients led them to either consciously or unconsciously practice poor self-protection and precautions while fear of the infection anxiety panicky responses and scary stories also negatively influenced the performance of some healthcare providers during the epidemic participants in this study were traumatized by their experiences as patients with and survivors of mers-cov infection those who survived the infection and were happily looking forward to life reflected on their painful experiences of rejection and neglect by their colleagues and neighbours such findings were not surprising because the fear of the disease and the desire to remain healthy pushed people either consciously or unconsciously to engage in prejudice behaviours against those who were victims of the virus many studies conducted in different settings and with different groups of people such as those with hepatitis c virus infection and those with ebola indicated how patients suffered from social isolation and rejection 22 23 24 25 significantly research indicated that social rejection and neglect even when experienced in lesser forms have painful and distressing negative impacts on individuals 26 27 these effects of social injury may last longer than physical injury and affect individuals psychologically affectively and cognitively 27 the findings also revealed that the social injury isolation and rejection experienced by the survivors threatened their fundamental human needs such as self-esteem confidence self-worth and sense of belonging many researchers have argued that being socially valued liked appreciated and included lead to the enhancement of well-being and self-esteem whereas opposite experiences will evoke negative emotions and consequently may lead in some situations to antisocial reactions such as aggression or withdrawal 28 29 30 they may also lead to impairment of individuals self-monitoring and self-regulatory processes which could result in negative behaviours such as unhealthy eating which might be detrimental for some people 31 the findings revealed the magnitude of survivors traumatic experiences including near-death experiences feelings of alienation and rejection and social stigmatization which affected them psychologically and emotionally these survivors as well as the healthcare providers who were working in the environment where mers-cov broke out are still vulnerable because of their terrifying experiences of constantly anticipating frightening scenarios and the possibility of death therefore they need support and help at the organizational level in order to reduce their fear and anxiety an educational campaign must be launched immediately after diagnosing the first case in the hospital it should focus on the signs and symptoms transmissibility personal hygiene and protection precautionary practices and help-seeking behaviour educating and increasing healthcare providers awareness will help reduce the incidents of rejection and stigmatization of colleagues who are in contact with mers-cov positive patients it is important that hospitals remain vigilant and proactive when it comes to infection control measures and exhibit a high level of transparency about the nature of the infection with employees it is noteworthy that this organization developed the infectious diseases epidemiological plan idep prior to the outbreak it was based on recommendations and guidelines from the world health organization who and center for disease control and prevention cdc and was activated during the outbreak 3 32 unfortunately despite these guidelines and plans the outbreak still occurred due to a failure to adhere to the infection control measures therefore healthcare providers should remain vigilant and take emails educational material and warnings about mers-cov more seriously and hospital management should ensure that the healthcare providers abide by all infection control plansmeasures despite the fact that participants survived the infection they still suffer from its complications therefore it is important that the hospital dedicate special clinics to helping survivors and their families receive support in the form of psychotherapy geared toward addressing the psychological and emotional effects of the infection and its social consequences such a measure will help survivors overcome their challenges and increase their resilience in order to maintain fairly stable lives in this study we struggled to recruit participants due to the sensitivity of the topic although this qualitative study explored the experiences of only a limited number of survivors it produced rich reliable and trustworthy insights further studies will be useful to investigate the publics perceptions of the nature of the mers-cov infection and their views of and reactions to the survivors another longitudinal study is recommended to investigate the development of survivors resilience over time this study was funded by king abdullah international medical

will continue to happen in the future even if we cannot prevent dangerous viruses from emerging we should prepare to dampen their effects on society the current outbreak has had severe economic consequences across the globe and it does not look like any country will be unaffected this not only has consequences for the economy all of society is affected which has led to dramatic changes in how businesses act and consumers behave this special issue is a global effort to address some of the pandemic-related issues affecting society in total there are 12 papers that cover different industry sectors eg tourism retail higher education changes in consumer behavior and businesses ethical issues and aspects related to employees and leadership actively engage with their corporate

policy public education economics and management failure to implement a proper public health policy may not only lead to a huge loss of human lives but also shatter the economy expose the incompetence of public bodies including governments and political leaders and weaken the confidence of the general public we are used to hearing that women are more other-directed and emotionally intelligent but it has been proven that women are just as good if not better in terms of what we think of as male qualities like being decisive and making tough calls during a crisis prevalent issues like under-representation of women in leadership positions mismanagement of public health systems and inaccurate or inconsistent reporting of public health outcomes in the context of the recent pandemic need to be addressed by involving women at all stages of public health management including planning decision-making and emergency response systems this is important not only for a quick economic recovery in the aftermath of the covid-19 crisis but also to prevent and manage such disasters in future  there has been a long history of fear of pandemic outbreaks the discussion has not focused on whether there will be an outbreak but when new outbreaks will happen sthr  esvald 2004  the events leading to influenza pandemics are recurring biological phenomena and cannot realistically be prevented pandemics seem to occur at 10-50-year intervals as a result of the emergence of new virus subtypes from virus re-assortment potter 2001  as the global population increases and we need to live closer to animals it is likely that the transfer of new viruses to the human population will occur even more frequently all our society can do is take preventive measures so that we are able to act quickly once we suspect an outbreak we should also make an effort to learn from the consequences of pandemic outbreaks to prepare our societies for if-and more likely when-this happens again as we are in the middle of a pandemic outbreak it is very difficult to estimate its longterm effects although society has been hit by several pandemics in the past it is difficult to estimate the long-term economic behavioral or societal consequences as these aspects have not been studied to a great extent in the past the limited studies that do exist indicate that the major historical pandemics of the last millennium have typically been associated with subsequent low returns on assets jorda singh  taylor 2020  for a period after a pandemic we tend to become less interested in investing and more interested in saving our capital resulting in reduced economic growth given the current situation in which saving capital means negative returns it is not at all certain that we will be as conservative as we have been in the past behavioral changes related to pandemic outbreaks seem to be connected with personal protection funk gilad watkins  jansen 2009  such as the use of face masks rather than general behavior changes our lives as humans in a modern society seem to be more centered around convenience than around worrying about what might happen in the future on a societal level we seem to be completely unprepared for large-scale of outbreaks our societies are more open than ever we rely on the importing of important products such as food energy and medical equipment rather than sourcing them from close to where they are needed and there are limited efforts to prepare for pandemic outbreaks the guiding principle of our society seems to be efficiency and economic gain rather than safety this may change after the current outbreak it is also important to point out that the principles eg openness and global trade on which society is based have lifted a large number of countries around the globe out of poverty and produced well-developed economies it is not unlikely that our societies will backoff some of them leading to more poverty in the world the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has forced many businesses to close leading to an unprecedented disruption of commerce in most industry sectors retailers and brands face many short-term challenges such as those related to health and safety the supply chain the workforce cash flow consumer demand sales and marketing however successfully navigating these challenges will not guarantee a promising future or any future at all this is because once we get through this pandemic we will emerge in a very different world compared to the one before the outbreak many markets especially in the fields of tourism and hospitality no longer exist all organizational functions are intended to prioritize and optimize spending or postpone tasks that will not bring value in the current environment companies especially start-ups have implemented an indefinite hiring freeze at the same time online communication online entertainment and online shopping are seeing unprecedented growth as research indicates that pandemics are reoccurring events it is very likely that we will see another outbreak in our lifetime it is apparent to anyone that the current pandemic has had enormous-but hopefully short-term-effects on all our lives countries have closed their borders limited the movement of their citizens and even confined citizens in quarantine within their homes for weeks this is a rather unique occurrence as we are used to freedom of movement but in the midst of the pandemic outbreak people have been fined just for being outside although our societies seem to be very accepting of these limitations and condemn people that do not follow the rules but we need to ask ourselves how this will affect the views of our society eg views regarding freedom healthcare government intervention we should also be aware that infrastructure and routines to monitor citizens in order to limit the spread of the virus have been rolled out and so we should ask ourselves how accepting we will be of monitoring in the future we must realize that once these systems are in place it is highly unlikely that they will be rolled back furthermore in some countries the ruling politicians have taken advantage of this situation and increased their control over the state suppressing opposing opinions and thus jeopardizing democratic systems some of the worst examples are turkmenistan which has banned the use of the word corona and hungary which is letting viktor orbn rule by decree indefinitely as previously mentioned people have been confined to their homes there has also been a constant stream of news on this invisible external threat from which we cannot protect ourselves we have been occupied trying to figure out how best to protect ourselves and our loved ones on top of that many feel pressure due to losing their jobs or due to working in close proximity to potentially infected people as society depends on them fulfilling their duty the consequences of the pandemic outbreak have hit various sectors of society in different ways people that are working in sectors connected to healthcare must endure endless tasks and very long working days additionally people are losing their jobs at rates we have not seen since the great depression of the 1930s the sectors that have seen the largest increases in unemployment are those that are hedonic in nature and require the physical presence of the customer eg hospitality tourism and entertainment as demand for these services has ceased to exist the employees in these sectors tend to be younger and female past experience also indicates that once someone is outside the job market it is very difficult to get back in as they will face more competition that may be more competent all countries that can are trying to stimulate their economies to keep as much as possible of their necessary infrastructure intact and to keep citizens productive or ready to become productive once the pandemic has been overcome in order to keep society from deteriorating people not only need jobs or a way to support themselves but also need access to what they view as necessary products and services if this infrastructure does not exist people start to behave in what is considered uncivil behavior eg hording or looting countries around the globe have adopted very different approaches to handle the current stress on the job markets and infrastructure some countries have chosen to support businesses in order to help them keep the workforce intact but others with less financial strength cannot do the same countries also have directly supported their citizens in various ways there is an enormous body of rich information that researchers can collect to determine the best approaches for when when and if a major disaster happens in the future around the globe societies are in lockdown and citizens are asked to respect social distance and stay at home as we are social beings isolation may be harmful for us cacioppo  hawkley 2009  feelings of loneliness have among other things been connected to poorer cognitive performance negativity depression and sensitivity to social threats there are indications that this is happening during the current pandemic as there has been an increase in domestic violence quarrels among neighbors and an increase in the sales of firearms campbell 2020  however we have also seen an increase in other more positive types of behavior caused by social distancing that have not been researched people have started to nest develop new skills and take better care of where they live for instance they may learn how to bake try to get fit do a puzzle or read more there has also been an increase in purchases of cleaning products and more trash is being recycled at the same time we are eating more junk food and cleaning ourselves less people are also stockpiling essentials panic buying and escaping to rural areas this is an indication that what is happening to us and our behaviors is complex and it would be interesting to study this phenomenon further another consequence of the lockdowns is the extreme increase in the usage of internet and social media previous research has indicated that humans who feel lonely tend to use social media more and in some cases even prefer social media over physical interaction nowland necka  cacioppo 2018  social media also may bring out the worst in us through trolling or sharing of fake news this is to some degree not as damaging as the real life is lived in the physical world and the internet is an add on with in most cases limited impact on the physical world by this we are able to compartmentalize and distinguish what matters and what does not matter however the current situation has made social media the main mode of contacting or socializing with others in many cases the internet is at present also the main way to get essential supplies and receive essential services like seeing a doctor the question then is what happens to us when the real life is lived online and becomes a way to escape the physical world as humans we rely to a large degree on our senses we are built to use them in all situations of life thus we rely on them heavily when making decisions however the current isolation is depriving us of our senses as we are not exposed to as many stimuli as normal situation thus we are in a sense being deprived of stimulation we are also being told by authorities not to use our senses we should not touch anything wear a mask or get close to other humans thus what happens once our societies open up how long will this fear of using our senses linger and will we be over-cautious for a while or may we try to compensate as we have to some degree been deprived of using them these are just some aspects of consumer behavior many more are covered by this special issue the covid-19 outbreak is likely to cause bankruptcy for many well-known brands in many industries as consumers stay at home and economies are shut down tucker 2020  in the us famous companies such as sears jcpenney neiman marcus hertz and j crew are under enormous financial pressure the travel industry is deeply affected 80 of hotel rooms are empty asmelash  cooper 2020  airlines cut their workforce by 90 and tourism destinations are likely to see no profits in 2020 furthermore expos conferences sporting events and other large gatherings as well as cultural establishments such as galleries and museums have been abruptly called off consulting in general and personal services like hairdressers gyms and taxis have also come to a standstill due to lockdowns finally important industries like the car truck and electronics industries have abruptly closed although they started to open up two months after their closure there are an endless number of questions we could ask ourselves in connection to this rather abrupt close-down for instance how do we take care of employees in such situations why are companies not better prepared to handle such situations eg putting aside earnings or thinking of alternative sources of income how are the companies and even countries using the current situation to enhance their competitive situation one of the countries that seem to be using the situation is china that is buying european based infrastructure and technology rapoza 2020  while some businesses are struggling some businesses are thriving this is true for a number of internet-based businesses such as those related to online entertainment food delivery online shopping online education and solutions for remote work people have also changed their consumption patterns increasing the demand for takeout snacks and alcohol as well as cleaning products as we spend more time in our homes other industries that are doing well are those related to healthcare and medication as well as herbs and vitamins typically when studying markets it is assumed that they are static a natural conclusion since they tend to change slowly however if there is one thing the covid-19 outbreak has shown us it is that markets are dynamic jaworski kohli  sahay 2000 and can move rapidly furthermore a market is not just a firm it is a network of actors ie firms customers public organizations acting in accordance with a set of norms these systems are sometimes referred to as dynamic ecosystems that exist to generate value vargo  lusch 2011  the covid-19 outbreak poses a unique opportunity to study how markets are created and how they disappear within a very limited time span it would also be interesting to explore whether the disappearance of one solution for a market may be replaced by another eg combustion engines for electric or physical teaching for online teaching based on past experiences we have become more conservative and protective after a pandemic outbreak we save resources in order to be prepared if the unthinkable happens again countries are starting to stockpile things like food equipment and medicine or prepare to produce them locally it is also essential for larger global firms to have reliable supply chains that do not break consequently it is very likely that this pandemic will make these firms rethink their supply chains and probably move supply chains closer to where they are needed in order to avoid stopping production in the future furthermore authorities have implied that other humans from other countries are dangerous as they may carry the virus a closed border implies that the threat is from the outside in addition international flights are not likely to be an option for many in the coming years together these circumstances mean that countries may become more nationalistic and less globalized this may be a dangerous development as long-term protection from the consequences of a pandemic outbreak is likely to require global effort and sharing of resources such cooperation is also key to tackle other global challenges that we may face in the future in this special issue we have invited scholars from different areas of business and management to write brief papers on various aspects of the effects of the covid-19 pandemic in total there are 12 articles in the special issue which are summarized below the first contribution by jagdish sheth is titled impact of covid-19 on consumer behavior will the old habits return or die it explores how the current pandemic has affected several aspects of consumers lives ranging from personal mobility to retail shopping attendance at major life events like marriage ceremonies having children and relocation the author investigates four contexts of construed consumer behavior namely social context technology coworking spaces and natural disasters additionally the author foresees eight immediate effects of the pandemic on consumer behavior and consumption hoarding-the mad scramble observed at the start of the covid-19 outbreak-applies not only to consumers but also to unauthorized middlemen who buy products in excess to sell at increased prices consumers learn to adapt quickly and take an improvised approach to overcome constraints that have been imposed by governments pent-up demand may lead to a significant rebound in sales of durable products like automobiles houses and large appliances and some of the realities of covid-19 will put consumers in a buying mood soon embracement of digital technology either through online services or information-sharing platforms like zoom has kept people connected around the world digital savviness will become a necessity rather than an alternative for schools businesses and healthcare providers with the onset of lockdowns in many countries online shopping including grocery shopping has become more prevalent the desire to do everything in-home has impacted consumers impulse buying habits slowly but surely work-life boundaries will be blurred when both tasks are carried out from home there should be efforts to compartmentalize the two tasks to make this a more efficient way of life reunions with friends and family are now restricted to digital interactions especially for people who work and live away from their families we can expect a dramatic change in consumers behavior because of sophisticated technology in addition consumers may discover new talents as they spend less time on the road and more at home they may experiment with cooking learn new skills and soon become producers with commercial possibilities in the end most consumers habits will return to normal while some habits may die due to adaptation to the new norm forecasting and overcoming pandemics global warming corruption civil rights violations misogyny income inequality and guns written by arch g woodside discusses whether there is an association between public health interventions national and stateprovincial governments interventions and improved control of the covid-19 outbreak in certain countries the paper suggests ultimate broadening of the concept of marketing in order to design and implement interventions in public laws and policy national and local regulations and the everyday lives of individuals it also lays out effective mitigating strategies by examining designs implementations and outcomes of covid-19 interventions by examining deaths as a natural experiment while covid-19 eradication intervention tests are being run for promising vaccines these are considered true experiments and analyzing the data from these interventions may involve examination of the success of each vaccine for different demographic subgroups in treatment and placebo groups in randomized control trials comparing the designs and impact of the current covid-19 mitigation interventions across nations and states within the us provides useful information for improving these interventions even though they are not true experiments the third contribution employee adjustment and well-being in the era of covid-19 hatak they claim that covid-19 is becoming the accelerator for one of the most drastic workplace transformations in recent years how we work socialize shop learn communicate and of course where we work will be changed forever person-environment p-e fit theories highlight that employee-environment value congruence is important because values influence outcomes through motivation however given the current environment in which the fulfillment of needs and desires like greater satisfaction higher engagement and overall well-being is drastically altered there is an increased likelihood of misfits working in organizations in response to this organizations need to use virtual forms of recruitment training and socialization in lieu of face-to-face interactions increasing job autonomy will alleviate the family-related challenges that may arise within remote work environments by providing employees with the right resources to manage conflicting work and family demands human resource leaders within the organization must enhance relationship-oriented human resources systems in order to combat the risk of unforeseen and prolonged isolation among single independent employees and to better prepare them for situations like the current crisis the field of entrepreneurship can offer insights that can be adapted by organizations coping with the pandemic entrepreneurs struggles are largely caused by the lack of work-related social support in comparison to salaried employees nevertheless some entrepreneurs are known to overcome these limitations by leveraging alternative domain-specific sources of social support such as positive feedback from customers which ultimately enhances their well-being recycling such approaches to identify overlooked or untapped sources of social support is likely to be beneficial for employees given the current work environment dynamic the fourth contribution written by hongwei he and lloyd c harris is titled the impact of covid-19 pandemic on corporate social responsibility and marketing philosophy the worldwide demand for hand sanitizers gloves and other hygiene products has risen because of the covid-19 pandemic and in some countries there has been a surge in complaints about profiteering and opportunism as doctors combat the virus prosecutors are pursuing the opportunistic profiteers who prey on the fearful many large corporations have a social purpose and set of values that indicate how much they appreciate their customers employees and stakeholders this is the time for these corporations to make good on that commitment some organizations strive to set great examples for example jack ma the co-founder of alibaba donated coronavirus test kits and other medical supplies to many countries around the world through the jack ma foundation and alibaba foundation large corporations have often written off the costs of product failures restructuring or acquisitions when writing off losses due to the coronavirus pandemic it is understandable to pursue the bond established between the brand and consumer this gesture can turn out to be more meaningful and lasting than when implemented during normal times on the bright side the covid-19 pandemic offers great opportunities for companies to supermarket will reassure them that they are being cared for fourth messages that retailers spread online during emergencies need to include information about products availability on the shelves and at digital outlets control panic buying by restricting the quantity that customers can purchase devise and implement protection plans for consumers and employees contribute to overall public health and use surveillance measures to limit the spread of the virus to these ends retailers need to improve their customer relationship management systems and promote safe interactions with customers eg through online chats with employees to provide real-time customer assistance smes in times of crisis he identifies small-to medium-sized businesses with low or unstable cashflow as particularly vulnerable during crises as they are currently struggling for profitability studies reveal the interconnectedness between finance and strategy particularly entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation in strategies the paper highlights that a combination of entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation can lead to lean and flexible marketing efforts which are particularly valuable in times of crisis in addition entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation can be combined into an entrepreneurial marketing postdisaster business recovery framework that highlights that seeking opportunities organizing resources creating customer value and accepting risk are markedly different in a post-disaster context sandeep krishnamurthy contributed with the future of business education a commentary in the shadow of the covid-19 pandemic the paper highlights that social distancing is prompting educational institutions to rethink how they are connecting with their student bodies spatial interaction is becoming the new norm and the blurring of physical and virtual communication is likely to continue until the pandemic is overcome globally the higher education system will undergo a decade of radical technology-led transformation according to the author the author identified five trends that will revolutionize how we educate after covid-19 1 the algorithm as professor -rather than taking a traditional route and learning from a human professor in classrooms students will learn remotely from an algorithm the aienabled algorithm will provide customized personal learning experiences students will be able to quickly master rudimentary and routinized tasks then the algorithm will prepare them for an in-person experience where a warm body will engage them in socratic dialogue 2 the university as a service -traditionally we have followed a linear formulation of society students go through k-12 education some get an undergraduate degree and some go on to further studies however the current and future environment is too volatile to sustain this educational structure students will need to learn what they need when they need it personalized continuing education will become the norm 3 the university as assessment powerhouse -in a world characterized by ai and automation learning can come from many sources students will learn from each other algorithmic systems and public information however universities will continue to have a powerful place as assessors of learning students will come to universities to gain objective credentials based on powerful assessments of learning 4 learning personalization to support diversity -students of the future will have access to multiple pathways to learn the same content for example a course may be available through algorithmic engagement animationvideoaugmented reality face-to-face instruction or any mixture thereof using assessment data the university of the future will be able to pinpoint the learning needs of each student and provide a personalized experience 5 problem solving through ethical inquiry -as the influence of artificial intelligence and automation grow exponentially in our lives there will be a great need for students to become problem solvers through ethical inquiry clearly the future will not simply be about what the answers are it will be about which problems we wish to solve given what we know students will need to become more comfortable with the need to evaluate ai algorithms based on their efficacy and their ethical foundation contribution number ten consumer reacting coping and adapting behaviors in the covid-19 pandemic is written by colleen p kirk and laura s rifkin in it the authors explore numerous consumer insights during a major pandemic outbreak mainly they examine consumer behaviors across three phases reacting eg hoarding and rejecting coping eg maintaining social connectedness do-it-yourself behaviors and changing views of brands and longer-term adapting eg potentially transformative changes in consumption and individual and social identity the authors also identify a number of negative aspects of the pandemic that will likely impact consumer behavior as they state given the mandatory close quarters people must keep due to stay-at-home requirements domestic abuse may be on the rise in addition throughout history pandemics provide an excuse for increased racial and anti-immigrant biases in how firms in china innovate in covid-19 crisis an exploratory study of marketing innovation strategies written by yonggui wang aoran hong xia li and jia gao the authors explore how firms in china worked to make their marketing strategies a success they do so by identifying the typology of firms marketing innovations based on two dimensions the motivation for innovations and the level of collaboration in innovations the authors outline four innovative strategies to combat crises for businesses the responsive strategy works predominantly for firms that involve physical contact but it can easily be transferred from offline marketing channels to online channels a collective strategy can be implemented by firms that are highly affected by the crisis which need to develop new business by collaborating with other firms during the crisis a proactive strategy is for firms that are less affected by the covid-19 crisis mostly online businesses to develop new businesses to meet the special demands of existing customers during the covid-19 crisis firms that are less affected during the covid-19 crisis can take an alternative approach a partnership strategy firms should usually develop new offerings through collaboration with other firms professors amalesh sharma anirban adhikary and sourav bikash borah contributed with covid-19 impact on supply chain decisions strategic insights for nasdaq 100 firms using twitter data during black swan events like the covid-19 pandemic which may have severe long-term consequences a deep understanding of business risks can help organizations establish the right plan in this article the authors identified supply chain challenges faced by companies using their twitter data to develop insights from the findings the authors constructed unigrams bigrams and trigrams that revealed the supply-chain-related aspects that gain attention on twitter a topic analysis was performed to identify keywords used in discussions about covid-19 the obtained insights show that the greatest challenge for the organizations was accessing realistic customer demands a pandemic may increase or decrease demand for specific products making estimation of realistic final customer demand more difficult and more urgent to address some user accounts suggested that organizations are still lacking in terms of technological readiness and that companies are looking to gain visibility across value chains there are growing discussions about building supply chain resilience by identifying risks many organizations are not only focusing on social sustainability but also turning their attention toward environmental sustainability to deal with the challenges brought on by unprecedented times the leaders of organizations must reimagine and redesign the supply chain rely on technology such as artificial intelligence the internet of things and blockchain in their supply chain designs and focus on sustainable supply chain finally marianna sigala wrote tourism and covid-19 impacts and implications for advancing and resetting industry and research tourism is experiencing a rapid and steep drop in demand during the covid-19 pandemic despite the tourism industrys proven resilience in other unprecedented times the impact of the current pandemic will likely last longer for international tourism than for other affected industries however the tourism industry should not only recover but also reimagine and reform the next normal economic order currently there is a lack of research on how crises can alter the industry how the industry adapts to changes with innovative techniques and how research that can establish the next norms can be conducted to study the needs and gaps in research work the author reviews past and emerging literature to capture its impacts and impart some ideas from different research fields that will allow tourism to grow and evolve  making sense of perceptions of risk of diseases and vaccinations a qualitative study combining models of health beliefs decision-making and risk perception lyndal bond terry nolan   theories of health protective behaviour offer an appealing framework in which to interpret differences in compliant and non-compliant parents with respect to childhood vaccinations 8 while several models have been developed to account for peoples adoption of health protective behaviour such as the theory of reasoned action 9 the triandis model 10 multi-attribute utility mau theory 11 and the subjective expected utility theory 8 the health belief model is possibly the simplest and the most widely used and tested 1213 the four elements of the health belief model are perceived susceptibility likelihood of getting the disease perceived severity perception of how serious an outcome or consequence is from the disease perceived benefits efficacy of preventive action undertaken and perceived barriers time effort money inconvenience pain side effects of preventive action 1213 attempts to assess the association of these elements and childhood immunisation uptake have been inconclusive with some studies reporting expected relationships 14-16 and others contrary to what would be expected 1718 these contradictory findings have led to the conclusion that the health beliefs of mothers are not important contributors to immunisation uptake or completion and are less important than socio-demographic factors that is incomplete immunisation fall behind the immunisation schedule or fail to complete is associated with being poor 17 and being a single parent 1920 low maternal education has usually been found to be a risk factor for not completing immunisation 20 being anti immunisation on the other hand is associated with high education 21 while in some instances theories of health protective behaviours have been shown to differentiate between complete incomplete and non-immunisers none of them provides an explanation of how people perceive risks or how their perceptions might influence behaviour indeed these models assume a rational basis for these decisions a simple weighing up of information regarding severity susceptibility benefits and barriers there is not however a simple relationship between mortality or morbidity figures and the perception of risk 22 people do not perceive interpret or act on risk information in the way expected by risk experts in general 22 nor specifically when considering vaccines and diseases 423 two domains which have addressed lay rather than expert perceptions of risk and what influences decisions encompassing risk are studies of the subjective perception of risk 24-26 and the study of decision-making under uncertainty also referred to as the psychology of choice2728 both approaches focus on risk as a subjective rather than an objective concept and both involve social and psychological aspects that impact on the individual cognitive structure of risk perception research into the subjective perception of risk generally involves asking study participants to rate a heterogeneous set of environmental or health risks including risks from individual activities residential or work conditions hazards from technologies substances or products and natural hazards respondents are asked to rate these activities or hazards in terms of perceived magnitude of risk the acceptability of the risk and other aspects such as likelihood of death catastrophic potential avoidability fear familiarity imposed or personal choice time scale of impact benefits of risk source degree of concern personal exposure etc studies including vaccination otherwise unspecified as a hazard have reported vaccination as low risk 2425 vaccination is generally considered to be a risk that is not dreaded controllable not fatal individual low risk to future generations but is somewhat unknown not observable effect delayed new risk risk unknown to science slovic 25 in a study of risk perception of prescription drugs including vaccines found vaccines were generally considered beneficial by the sample however people associating negative meanings to drugs tended to judge drugs and vaccines as having higher risks and lower benefits than people who associated positive meanings to drugs this research has consistently found that risks are perceived more negatively if exposure to the hazard is involuntary people perceive they have little personal control over outcomes and there is uncertainty about the consequences of the outcomes the hazard is unfamiliar the effects of the hazard are delayed the hazard has catastrophic potential the benefits are not immediately apparent and the hazard is caused by human rather than natural causes 24 these have been summarised by two factors labelled dread uncontrollable feared involuntary exposure inequitable distribution of risk not easily reduced catastrophic risk increasing fatal consequences risk to future generations and the unknown not observable risk unknown to science delayed effect new risk 29 people make judgements about the persuasiveness and trustworthiness of experts involved in communicating risk and find risks less acceptable if they believe that the communication of the risks between experts and the community is poor 30 research into decision-making under uncertainty showed that the rational subjective expected utility models which presumes that a good or rational decision maker will sum the utilities and choose the action with the greatest total utility does not explain how people make decisions 2728 kahneman and tverskys research confirmed findings from the subjective perception of risk and further contributed to an understanding of how information about risks or uncertainties of outcomes influences decisions 2728 using hypothetical scenarios studies have shown that people consistently underestimate risks of familiar and frequent events and overestimate the occurrence of low probability but high consequence risks thus rare events are perceived as more likely to occur than they do and common events are thought to occur less often than they do the classic problems devised by kahneman and tversky involved asking subjects to choose between the certainty of saving 200 out of 600 lives or taking a 1 in 3 chance of saving 600 lives they found that peoples responses to possible negative outcomes are more extreme than their responses to possible positive outcomes people also demonstrate a tendency to believe that their own risks are less than others particularly if they believe that their exposure to risk is in some way under their control 31 the impact of this tendency described as unrealistic optimism andor the illusion of control is to reduce the perceived need to take protective measures 32 of particular importance to the decision to immunise are studies describing the operation of omission bias and choices involving ambiguous situations 33 omission bias describes a preference for taking no action if the action might cause harm even if there is a greater risk of harm by doing nothing ambiguity describes the decision-makers feeling that there is missing information relevant to outcome or choice 33 the effect of ambiguity on choice is to reduce peoples willingness to act or to postpone the action until the missing information can be obtained 33 these studies used hypothetical scenarios making decisions about others and participants were generally tertiary students and sometimes parents as stated above the health belief model by itself has been found wanting in terms of being able to explain parents behaviour with respect to immunising their children conceptual pieces have been written describing how subjective risk perception and risky decision-making theories may be useful in understanding parents behaviour and choices although these have not drawn on primary data 7 using a qualitative design the aim of this study was to explore the salience of the decision-making and risk perception findings to parents choices to immunise their young children examine the utility of the risk perception and decision-making theories to provide a more detailed explanation of the differences between immunisers and non-immunisers perceptions of severity susceptibility to disease and benefits of vaccines and understand how these theories might explain perceptions of risk and reactions to a new strain of flu for themselves and their children a stratified purposeful sampling strategy 34 was used to identify first time and experienced mothers of infants who were completely immunised for age incompletely immunised behind the recommended immunisation schedule partially immunised parents chose or advised not to have a specific immunisation or who had no immunisations initially mothers of children between 14-16 months were approached this age allowed a range of immunisation experiences to be discussed with participants while minimising the time since the first immunisation to obtain sufficient numbers of non-immunisers and partial immunisers this age range was broadened to include 3 to 30 months it was initially proposed that interviewing approximately 8 mothers from each immunisation category would be sufficient to discern patterns of similarity and difference between these categories if preferred by the mother both parents could participate in the interview possible participants were identified by maternal and child health mch nurses in five metropolitan local government areas in melbourne australia nurses were asked to approach mothers fitting the immunisation categories and to include to the best of their knowledge mothers of high and low education  year 11 and high and low income held a health care card parents were identified as fitting these categories from informal information available to the nurses parents from non-english speaking backgrounds whose english was poor were not interviewed the nursing mothers association group for the area also advertised the study ethics approval was granted by the royal childrens hospital ethics in human research committee participation was voluntary with written consent required participants provided informed consent to be interviewed and for the interview to be taped participants were assured that they could stop the interview at any time could choose not to answer any question if they didnt want to and that their responses would be confidential and transcripts anonymised the interviewer did not have a dual relationship with the participants ie she was neither a clinician nor provider of health servicescare recruiting and interviewing continued until saturation occurred 34 ie no new information was obtained from the interviews for complete incomplete and non-immunisers or until no more new parents fitting the categories could be identified as was the case for partial immunisers over the period of data collection 94 families were identified as possible participants forty-eight interviews were arranged and 45 completed one participant withdrew consent prior to the interview she did not believe she had anything to say two participants were not at home at the time scheduled for the interview and neither returned follow-up phone calls of those not interviewed 17 fitted categories for which a sufficient number of interviews had been conducted complete immunisers 11 were not interviewed due to language difficulties 12 could not be contacted by the nurses and 6 refused interviews were undertaken in 1995-96 for six interviews both mother and father participated in the interviews three of these were non-immunising families all interviews were conducted in the participants homes semi-structured one-on-one interviews were used to collect information from parents about their childrens health the experience of illness in the family their understanding and interpretation of risk and how all of these related to their decision to immunise the method of one-on-one interviews rather than focus groups was chosen as the aim was to explore the parents experiences and path to choosing to immunise or not rather than a group discussion of the pros and cons of immunisation to understand the context of parents decisions to immunise the interviews covered four themes 1 how mothers keep their children healthy 2 experience familiarity and concerns regarding both vaccine preventable diseases and other diseases 3 concepts and influences on risk perception and 4 the decisions experience and outcomes regarding immunisation the interview began with questions about health as a non-threatening introduction and to place the consequent discussions about disease and disease prevention in the framework or context of health questions about diseases and the familys experience of them were included to explore the relationship between common illnesses experienced by the family and vaccine preventable diseases what was of interest here was which diseases were familiar which were unfamiliar which were to be avoided if possible and which were just childhood illnesses health authorities issued a warning today about a new strain of flu expected this winter the flu affects the airways making breathing difficult and causing repeated bouts of coughing long term effects of pneumonia and brain inflammation have been reported in some cases this strain appears to affect adults between the ages of 20-50 years several deaths occurred last year from the a-strain of this virus doctors have recommended that all adults should be vaccinated especially those who are overworked stressed and tired health authorities issued a warning today about a new strain of flu expected this winter the flu affects the airways making breathing difficult and causing repeated bouts of coughing long term effects of pneumonia and brain inflammation have been reported in some cases several deaths occurred last year from the a-strain of this virus many of those who died were children under 5 years doctors have recommended all young children should be vaccinated the description of symptoms and complications was taken from a description of the complications for pertussis 35 the doctors recommendations were written so that the parents could consider themselves at risk in the 1st instance parents of young children often feeling overworked and tired and in the 2nd scenario their childchildren fitted the at risk group omission bias was examined in this study by asking parents to respond to the following statement statement 1 some people say they wont vaccinate because they would feel worse if their child died because of the injection than if the child was not immunised and died from the disease participants were asked their opinion and were then read a second statement statement 2 some people say they would vaccinate because they would feel worse if their child got the disease and died or was brain damaged when they could have had an injection to prevent it these statements were used rather than the more complicated scenarios developed by others eg 33 because it was believed they captured the essential element of omission bias in circumstances with which the parent could identify the interview concluded with discussions of the process of deciding to immunise or not and included a discussion of structural and non-structural barriers all interviews were conducted in the participants homes at times convenient to them by the first author interviews lasted between 45 to 90 minutes socio-demographic information including family size and type two or one parent family mothers age parental occupations and education levels was collected at the end of the interview for those children who were immunised immunisation status was determined from the immunisation records held by the parent all interviews were audio-taped and fully transcribed the interview focussed on the sole or youngest child in the family previous experience of disease and immunisations for older children was discussed in terms of its effect on decisions for the youngest child interviews were thematically coded after all interviews had been collected this analysis focussed on determining whether parents descriptions of their experiences and beliefs were congruent or incongruent with theories of health behaviour decision-making and risk perception the coding was undertaken by the first author no formal testing of the reliability of the coding was undertaken although discussions with colleagues about the analysis and the meanings and patterns derived from this were extensively undertaken dread was an important determinant of what the participants in this study perceived as high risk what was dreaded however differed between the immunisers and the non-immunisers immunisers dreaded the outcomes of the diseases especially those with which they were unfamiliar this fear motivated them to take the risk of immunising the life threatening ones really concerned me like ones i didnt know anything aboutpolio really scared me and the thought of whooping cough those are quite scary sort of concepts meningitis was frightening complete immuniser 11 im not sure about whooping cough it just has horrible connotations in my mind but im not quite sure why what can happen yeah its interesting isnt it you know people think its the ones that you dont know about that youre likely to dismiss but it doesnt seem to me that way complete immuniser 13 polio diphtheria tetanus and meningitis were unfamiliar to these mothers but they conjured vivid images of severe outcomes of this group immunisers parents considered their children to be at greatest risk from meningitis even though most considered it unlikely that their children would contract these diseases it was easy to imagine that if contracted the worst was likely to happen lb if m hadnt been immunised how likely do you think she would get these diseases m well i imagine its fairly unlikely that she would get the diseases um but thats a double edged sword isnt it because having said that thats largely because theyve been for immunisation  i imagine it would be very worrying particularly some of the worst ones it would be quite frightening and thats of course the reason that you give them the immunisations complete immuniser 13 the risks associated with vaccination were also perceived as being rare but rather than imagining the worst in this instance they believed that one would be unlucky to have severe reactions thus on balance the risk of not immunising was not worth taking and a common sense approach was necessary they likened vaccination to taking other safety precautions in terms of the theories of risk respondents were perceiving the diseases as less familiar therefore dreaded and unknown and therefore possibly overestimating their risk and perceiving vaccines as more familiar and possibly underestimating their risk in contrast non-immunisers dreaded the unknown or uncertain outcomes of the vaccines with major fears being for invisibleundetectabledistant problems such as the vaccines causing leukaemia sids aids and brain damage for these parents vaccines were not only ineffective but they were actively dangerous to childrens health brain damage affecting limbs ive read there are long term effects which we really dont know about there are new diseases coming up polio is no longer life threatening but there are cancers and aids long term effects on the immune system and this is because we are interfering causing genetic changes non-immuniser 26 they dont work and they do harm putting these things into their bodies-germs and all the other products-mercury aluminium etc cannot be good it suppressesdisrupts the childs immune system it doesnt work and it is harmful its not just the risk of the side effects but the long term effects that we dont know about now basically so many things which we did in the past we now know better and think were barbaric i would rather not do something to my child when we dont know what the long term effects might be there have been studies which have related these to leukaemia and other cancers asthma eczema and all sorts of things i dont want to do that to my child non-immuniser 19 on the other hand severe outcomes of the diseases were believed to be rare or only a problem for children with poor nutrition poor sanitation and compromised immune systems non-immunisers believed it was unlikely that their children would suffer serious complications if they contracted these diseases because they had healthy immune systems if d did get one of these diseases it wouldnt necessarily be catastrophic some people do get very sick or die but what we dont know what they dont tell us is that those children were probably not well to start with fairly sick children are more likely to get serious long term effects their health before the illness is crucial to how their bodies cope with the disease non-immuniser 19 a rejection of the notion that children have to be immunised against these diseases because the disease itself will automatically be worse than the immunisation and a concern that the you know the vaccination itself can have problems non-immuniser 21 for one non-immuniser who was not against using conventional medicine she believed her children were protected from disastrous consequences because they had easy access to modern medical intervention well i just cant see the need if your child catches measles and that develops into anything else were not stuck in the middle of the country without good doctors or hospitals non-immuniser 29 as reported previously both pro- and anti- immunisers were concerned about vaccines overloading even healthy but immature immune systems 16 i do sort of worry that we are vaccinating too much i just worry about what it does to your immune system to all our immune systems complete immuniser 14 hes still very thin but hes past the point of where i sort of see him as very vulnerablelike now im happy to give them to him incomplete immuniser 24 i mean i know she is a strong as a horse and i know she could have every shot under the sun and shed be fine i just dont think its a proper thing to do  in only two-month olds non-immuniser 29 as would be expected from risk perception theory diseases that were familiar to parents were not dreaded measles mumps and rubella were not considered serious or life threatening by most parents irrespective of immunisation status most mothers were familiar with these diseases they had had personal experience of these and remembered them as mild if she happened to get measles well im not that worriedbecause i had it and it was fine complete immuniser  11 the motivation to immunise against these diseases was therefore less than for diseases that were unfamiliar if its a disease like measles mumps chicken pox things like that you can let them get through fine then if you got into meningitis polio well yeah youd have to think again complete immuniser 31 see measles and german measles-i know that they brought the immunisation in because there are complications and there have been kids with complications but see like i remember from my generation a lot of us that was just the normal kids had the measles so i am not so sure about those two whether it is important incomplete immuniser 15 measles mumps and rubella were perceived as diseases thatevery childs got to get and rather than avoid these diseases it was best to get them out of the way as early as possible especially as it was believed that these diseases were more serious in adults there was no urgency in having their children vaccinated for these diseases the idea of control was also used by parents to explain their choice to vaccinate one explanation for immunising given by complete immunisers was that they could not control their childrens exposure to diseases and hence it was safer to vaccinate by doing so they could control to some extent the diseases that their children were at risk of contracting i think the world of her and i thought if i can prevent her getting any of these diseases i will complete immuniser 7 incomplete immunisers believed vaccination would contain or reduce the effects of disease rather than prevent it completely kids still get measles and mumps so thats the silly thing isnt it really its only to prevent it it cant cure do you know what i mean ive heard of kids still getting measles incomplete immuniser 30 but it doesnt prevent the flu you still get the flu but not a strong dosage incomplete immuniser 44 in contrast non-immunisers talked about being able to control their childrens environment and therefore their exposure to disease this non-immunising mother spoke of her reasons for vaccinating the family dogs because i cannot control what they the dogs do and what they eat i can control childs name non-immuniser 19 the explanatory power of ambiguity outrage omission bias and optimistic control was also examined in these interviews perceived lack of information or insufficiency of information should either provoke outrage 30 or hesitation from acting 33 participants provided examples of both lack of information about susceptibility to vaccine side effects caused mothers in some instances to refrain from vaccinating their child or to hesitate about immunisation one mother had hesitated to immunise her second child until she could be reassured that he would not have severe side effects from the vaccine she had reason to believe he would be particularly susceptible to such side effects because he was not robust he had many food allergies and his father had collapsed after immunisation as an infant she expressed an equivalent concern about the childs susceptibility to disease especially as he had a school-aged sibling who could expose him to disease the major reason for her hesitation was that no one had seriously considered her questions or considered her sons case on an individual basis i want someone to look at him as an individual and i dont feel that they are the medical communityi dont want people making the decisions for me i want that information available so that i can make an informed choice non- immuniser 18 being aware that children could react to the mmr vaccine but not being told what that reaction was or what to expect also caused some hesitation with some mothers some mothers hesitated about immunising against hepatitis b which was at the time of the study recommended for at risk groups it was unclear to these mothers what this phrase meant and if it applied to their children i believe he should have the hepatitis one cause if he comes in contact with another child thats got it but they say hes not at risk but what makes him not at risk to get it so ive been umming and aahing whether to get that onecomplete immuniser 10 the reverse of hesitating to act because of insufficient information was shown by others who figuratively shut their eyes to the information about vaccine risk because it was unsettling i think honestly speaking this sounds stupid but i think well i dont want to hear it about side effects because it scares me i know it might be stupid because you think well you know theyre sposed to have it but if you start thinking well what if you know if this happens and that happens well then you wont immunise your children so theres a risk i sposeincomplete immuniser 42 another response to a perception of insufficient information was anger or outrage during the interview some mothers apologised for not being better informed about diseases others were angry at their lack of knowledge about diseases and vaccines this anger was not directed at themselves but at unspecified others anger was more often expressed by non-immunisers who believed that drug companies and doctors knew vaccines were not safe but kept the information from the public whether parents choose not to act when action may cause harm was explored this was done with the use of two statements-describing whether 1 it would be worse to have your child die due to your action immunise or 2 it would be worse due to inaction die from disease see methods section for statements both statements presented uncomfortable possibilities to parents you cant  i mean as far as im concerned you lose a child you lose it and its painful either way i like to think that ive done the best i can to protect him from it um and if you know its because of the injection well to some degree im fatalistic i mean if its meant to be its meant to be theres not much you can do about it but i would rather know that ive taken every precaution i can instead of you know leaving him open and susceptible to these things lb some people say they would vaccinate because they would feel worse if their child died from an illness which they could have prevented possibly i would sit in that category complete immuniser 1 most parents irrespective of the immunisation status of their children identified more with the second statement with only a few parents identifying with the first id have to agree with that i think if youve given birth to a perfect healthy child and then youve introduced foreign substances into their body which has then damaged them in some way ah yeah i dont know i dont think i could live with myself whereas if theyve caught the disease thats kind of cest la vie you know i mean its still awful its still a great tragedy especially if you do lose them but i think thats that if you talk about metaphysics i believe in metaphysics and all the rest of it so id sort of say well theyre meant to be here theyre meant to experience it theyre meant to deal with it or not deal with it depending on what theyre here for so i have to take a philosophical approach itd be devastating non-immuniser 32 opposite to what would be predicted many of the non-immunisers disagreed with the first statement and were adamant that this did not form part of their reason not to immunise father i think you would be foolish to reach that conclusion i mean were not foolish i couldnt possibly say that i would be more comfortable with the you know mother the child dying or at least you know that he died from the disease father yeah a natural thing rather than induced yeah thats where the natural therapy philosophy goes too farthat would never be reason to not immunise mother no for not immunising him yes i cant even relate to it as a distinction non-immunisers 27 the main reasons parents gave for not agreeing with the first statement was the perception that this scenario was unlikely to occur and irrespective of immunisation status most parents believed they had done everything they could to prevent disease thus parents used their perceptions of the risks of the outcome of death from vaccine or the risk of getting the disease to explain their choice no well id feel well i think that thats part of the risk that there is a small risk that your child will have a reaction to the immunisation thats thats minimal compared to the risk of them getting the disease if you dont immunise so id always opt to immunise complete immuniser 5 i think youve got more to me i think shes got more of a chance getting something not being vaccinated than shes a healthy little girl isnt she complete immuniser7 for those who agreed with statement 1 they based this on their belief that there was a greater risk from vaccines so the first statement was the more likely scenario participants responses to the two hypothetical radio news items was concordant with the theories that perception of risk may be influenced by an unrealistic optimism about ones own risks or unrealistic perception of control over ones life the participants generally did not believe that they would be at risk from the flu they believed themselves to be healthy not susceptible to flu and that they were strong enough to fight it off i tend to think that couldnt happen to me cause im young and healthy and couldnt possibly die of fluits a few cases dying and that happens complete immuniser 13 although the scenarios were written specifically so that those being interviewed fitted the at risk group the participants did not identify with this group they believed that the people who suffered serious consequences of flu were different to themselves when they heard similar items on the news they assumed the people who were badly affected were old frail sick had not been eating well had poor immune systems low resistance or were people who did not look after their health it says doctors recommend all should be vaccinated especially those who are overworked stressed and tired well of course they would be the ones whose immune systems would not cope non-immuniser 19 all non-immunisers believed the risk of this hypothetical flu vaccine was higher than the risk of the disease but some immunisers also perceived high risk and little benefit from the vaccine they related incidents of relatives who had bad experiences after receiving a flu injection they believed that there were other ways of reducing the risk of flu such as taking supplements improving lifestyle and avoiding people with the disease those who did believe their family to be at risk of this flu already received annual flu injections with the occurrence of serious illness in these families prompting them to have flu vaccines participants were also asked whether knowing someone who had the illness and had been very ill would affect their decision to immunise against this hypothetical flu again the response was that it would depend on the state of the friends health and their habits whether they were unhealthy or stressed or careless of their health while it would be more concerning to hear of a friend who was ill most did not think it would mean they themselves were more at risk in the second news item the at risk group was children under five all parents stated this item of news would be of greater concern to them their first action however would be to seek more information from their health advisers before immunising the risk of their children becoming ill was more important than the risk to themselves and all believed that their responsibility as parents was to do everything they could to protect their children this responsibility made it stressful to make decisions for children because you cant afford to make the wrong choice and one cant take risks for ones children where one might take risks for oneself im not prepared to risk them i can control my risks non- immuniser 29 youve got to take the risk to prevent them getting sick incomplete immuniser 20 take all the risk factors out of it and make sure they have a good life incomplete immuniser 34 because i am so much more protective of their health than mine i am concerned that they dont have the option of making choices as easily as i do and that is why i would like to make informed choices and i feel like if i make the wrong choice for yourself and that is something that i wear i am responsible for it if i make the wrong choice for them it is more serious non-immuniser 21 there was however a reluctance to immunise many believed there was an over-reliance on immunisations and antibiotics and that they would only immunise if the disease was widespread or local statewide if it were not widespread it was not worth the risk of preventative medicine table 3 summarises the factors found to influence the decision to immunise and corresponding aspects of the explanatory theories used as a theoretical framework for this study in this table we aim to show how the information from risk perception and decision making under uncertainty allow for a greater explanation or point to more nuanced action for example consideration of unfamiliarity with diseases would be part of the health belief models framework of considering perceived severity however the health belief model does not explain or allow us to understand what people perceive as familiar or unfamiliar one might think that if parents are not familiar with a disease they may not think it is serious whereas subjective perception of risk would indicate that the reverse may be operating unfamiliarity increases peoples perception of risk similarly where parents dont think their child is susceptible to the disease a health belief model construct the idea of having optimistic control helps to explain why they might think this in considering the news reports respondents were asked how many would several deaths be to cause them to worry about the risks of the disease it was difficult for the participants to respond to this question meaningfully and the production of these numbers was somewhat arbitrary most were not comfortable giving their response and many could not say for instance one couple said they could give an answer if it was needed to meet the research requirements but it would be meaningless the numbers given varied from only one or two deaths five in the state or between one and ten percent others gave figures of more than fifty percent of those who got the disease would have to die for them to be concerned the question was useful however because it provoked participants to define the type of information they wanted in order to make sense of reports such as those they had just heard for instance they said their response to the number of deaths would depend on how similar to their own circumstances were those who had died did they live in australia victoria or developed countries were those who were dying previously healthy people or those who were sick and thus more susceptible was it a familiar disease flu or rare ebola virus if it was unfamiliar it was frightening if it was familiar flu they wanted to know the details of who it was who had died or suffered complications thus it was not the statistics that were important for deciding on risk but the characteristics of those who had the disease and the familiarity or unfamiliarity of the disease this study has used qualitative methods to determine if aspects of theories of risk and decision-making can help to explain parents decisions about immunising their children traditionally qualitative research has been associated with the generation rather than the testing of hypotheses however this denies a major strength of qualitative research which is to examine theories in the light of data as such it is a method suited to producing understanding and to generating solutions to problems 34 we believe this method therefore is appropriate to provide a greater understanding of complexities of decision making and perceptions of disease and vaccines and a depth of information not available from large scale quantitatively based surveys the benefits of using the qualitative method described in this study is the large quantity of detailed information it provides however using a small non-randomly selected sample can present problems in determining the generalisabilty of the ensuing information the results of this study confirm complement and extend the findings of other studies in this area 453637 the data that this paper draws on were collected in the late 1990s and some may wonder at their currency we believe that this might be a problem if the focus of the paper was about which diseases or vaccines are an issue with scares and controversies these can change over time the point of this paper however has been to examine the utility of synthesizing theories of health protective behaviours risk perception and decision-making while we recognise that different socio-temporal contexts may create different issues eg the impact of the mmr controversy was substantially greater in the uk than australia we argue that the approach we have taken in this paper provides a framework for us to make sense of peoples reactions to and perceptions of old and new diseases and vaccinations at any time we therefore think this work can contribute to and be of particular importance in informing the public health approaches to new flu epidemics it provides data supporting commentary and critique of the current public health approach to the issues of vaccine risk and immunisation uptake being that continued provision of better risk information is not the answer 7 we have found and would argue that the theories of risk perception and aspects of decision-making under uncertainty have been useful for understanding the differences and similarities between pro-immunisers and non-immunisers except for the issue of omission bias parents in this study whether immunisers or not generally did not agree that a negative outcome was preferable or more acceptable from inaction this finding raises some doubts about the methods andor generalisability of findings from studies of this phenomenon which usually involve multiple similar hypothetical situations with limited contextual information presented in mathematical and probabilistic language participants in this study responded to these omission bias statements by generally denying that either contributed to their decision to immunise their child similar findings to this study have been reported by others 3-537 and have important implications for how public health addresses the issues of trust and communicates risk information as others have noted there is more to risk communication than providing more facts about risks 34723 to paraphrase hobson-west from these studies and critiques it is clear that education is not the main policy tool and ignorance is not the main enemy for maintaining immunisation uptake p 279 23 drawing on the aspects of subjective perceptions of risk and decision-making under uncertainty we believe the following needs to be considered in communicating risk information and health messages facts and figures are not interpreted or acted upon rationally dread catastrophic potential and familiarity with the risk influences interpretation and action people act as lay epidemiologists thus providing information about risks as though everyone has the same risk makes the advice unbelievable and can be discounted parents are more willing to take risks about their own health than with their childrens health but this greater caution about their childrens health does not automatically mean they will accept medical intervention from the theory of subjective perception of risk people may well be wary of novel vaccines or therapies manmade versus natural risks hence there may be some hesitation in the uptake of such vaccines people will discount their risks-the people affected are not like me this may have implications for how people will assess their risk of being badly affected by any outbreak of new strains of influenza such as h1n1 clear communication which involves listening to and not dismissing peoples concerns is valued this study has shown that there is a need to understand and take into account how people subjectively perceive risks and how that influences their decision-making in order to understand their choices and behaviours theories of risk perception and decision-making can help to explain differences in perceptions of severity and susceptibility of diseases and vaccines importantly this study has found that health messages about the risks of disease which are communicated as though there is equality of risk in the population may be unproductive as these messages are perceived as unbelievable or irrelevant the findings from this study have implications beyond the issue of childhood vaccinations as we grapple with communicating risks of new epidemics using and developing a more complex theoretical approach to public health issues may increase the likelihood we can understand the barriers to action and develop effective methods of communicating risk and delivering acceptable public health interventions and indeed may usefully contribute to the current debates especially in the uk of how these theories of risk and decision-making can be used to nudge other health behaviours 3839

those of the patients who have covid-19 whom corrs readers care for with that in mind we reached out to colleagues across the globe and because most of them are desperately busy doing battle with this submicroscopic scourge we asked each of them only for a single paragraph about their experiences nothing more than a postcard from the worlds many war zones just a glimpse a thought or a feeling to

director of the minimally invasive spinal surgery department of wuhan central hospital during the covid-19 epidemic i have been an ordinary front-line doctor since the outbreak of the epidemic my orthopaedic colleagues and i have supported both the intensive isolation unit and the light disease ward of the mobile cabin hospital the team is temporary the ward is new and many difficulties have arisen after weeks of fighting it seemed we had finally settled into a routine if a grim one this changed when i received a call from a young nurse in my department she was crying she had just received word that she had an abnormal ct lung screening i didnt know how to comfort her her coworkers were avoiding her yesterdays colleagues abandoned today i tried to calm her down with a joke it didnt help to avoid infecting her parents at home she planned to stay in a hotel and i helped her find a place to stay upon learning the news her parents were tearful overwrought they wanted to come see her but of course they could not making matters worse she later learned that a close family member caught the virus from her and that family member was even more ill than she was stories like this came in one after the next yesterdays colleagues patients today i tried to hold off depression by focusing on my responsibilities as a leader but my heart can no longer withstand the slightest bit of hurt for my fellows around me finally it seems that wuhan may have hit the reset button no matter how difficult it has been we all can come back again jos r caeiro rey md phd msc orthopaedic surgeon university hospital of santiago de compostela galicia spain i work at a university hospital in galicia in the northwest of spain and here the last several months have been distressing indeed as the number of patients with covid-19 increased so rapidly in the early weeks of the epidemic and as so many of them required hospitalization and critical careespecially in madrid and cataloniai wondered whether our public health system would have the capacity and the means to care for them my second wave of concern was for the number of health professionals who became infected in the course of their duties and the thought that perhaps this could have been prevented if we had not had such a shortage of personal protective equipment most recently and most poignantly ive been thinking about the many older frail patients who have died from this illness many of them were institutionalized and so perhaps less visible to society more broadly this is a lonely way to die and these deaths whether visible or invisible but always in loneliness reminded me of this cri-de-coeur from a palliative care specialist in my country nunca olviden ustedes que los cuidados que un pueblo suministra a sus ciudadanos ms pobres ms indefensos ms frgiles ms viejos ms enfermos es un indicativo de su grado de civilizacin 4 never forget that the care that a society provides to its poorest most defenceless most fragile oldest and sickest citizens is an indication of its degree of civilization kenneth s boockvar md geriatrics specialist james j peters va medical center bronx usa when i entered geriatrics i did not expect to have long relationships with my patients and yet i have cared for many for as long as 10-15 years from say age 80 to 95 this week i parted with two of them they both had covid-19 and both were nearing the 10th decade of life they each came to the hospital with delirium and dehydration and later developed fever id known them both for 12 years writing a condolence card to each family will help provide closure for me but many of my patients who have had covid-19 have already recovered and this keeps me optimistic one a frail older veteran called me right after his symptoms resolved to offer to donate plasma to provide immune globulin therapy to someone else with the disease that was a hopeful moment for me that i will return to during this epidemic cao yang md orthopaedic surgeon union hospital wuhan china wuhan was locked down from january 23 to april 8 because of the coronavirus pandemic when this began we did not know how easily quickly and silently this disease would spread my service cared for a surgical patient with lumbar spinal stenosis he had no viral symptoms when he was admitted five days later he had a high fever and was diagnosed with covid-19 but not before five of my colleagues contracted the disease in the course of caring for him i was quarantined at home for 2 weeks because of close contact the number of patients with covid-19 overwhelmed the healthcare system here in wuhan and more than 40000 medical staff from other cities came to here to help us most of my colleagues were also assigned to take care of the patients with coronavirus including the spine surgeons although elective surgery of course is suspended demands on our system have even resulted in delays for urgent surgery in recent days i have done six spinal operations for different conditionscervical spondylotic myelopathy spinal tuberculosis tumor and traumabut all of these patients were paralyzed or incompletely paralyzed because of delayed surgery although the epidemic is almost controlled in wuhan things here have not returned to normal chigusa sawamura md mph orthopaedic surgeon saitama cancer center saitama japan here we often compare the covid-19 crisis with the great east japan earthquake and nuclear accidents in 2011 but theyre not the same no one knows when an earthquake will happen while we know the peak of the covid-19 surge will hit tokyo in few weeks this gives us time for preparation viruses do not destroy roads rail tracks or buildings and i dont expect a sudden disruption of electricity supplies or distribution networks when the earthquake hit we learned that cts do not work without power and needed deliveries of implants and supplies to operate on patients that did not come things that we previously took for granted the coronavirus pandemic will be another challenge for us but we have overcome many disasters we are strong paul pottinger md infectious diseases specialist university of washington infectious diseases  tropical medicine clinic seattle usa im an infectious diseases specialist responsible for the covid-19 infection-control team at my hospital so i am working on this epidemic full time everything else has stopped the hours are long and the days are challenging because of the many logistical issues involved we cope with new crises every day it is exhausting by the time i get home each night i am spentphysically and emotionally but home life recharges me and is a source of constancy our son is still in high school but my daughter is in college now because of the epidemic she has moved back home with us i love seeing our two kids together again being best friends we are a connected supportive family i make time to eat dinner with them each evening then return to email until the inbox is empty then i fall asleep in 2016 i climbed mt everest and the mountain has haunted my dreams each night since then until now i used to fall asleep listening to the avalanches feeling the glacier move beneath me and waking up expecting to be in my tent at high camp no longer i no longer dream of the mountain or of my beautiful family now there is only one dream covid-19 night after night i bathe in a deep unrelenting fear that my colleagues will become infected if i fail to make the right decisions with our protection plans i must keep them safe people ask how it felt climbing mt everestwas it difficult yes but covid-19 is so much harder more grinding utterly exhausting i know this will pass but now at the crest of the wave that passing still looks to be a long way away zhen-sheng ma md orthopaedic surgeon xijing hospial xian china when i received the invitation to write this postcard i was taking part in our traditional qingming festival which in english would be called tomb sweeping festival its a time to pay respects to the dead and it is considered a major spring festival based on the chinese lunar calendar it occurred in early april this year around that same time china held a national day of mourning for the martyrshealthcare workers and otherswho have died in the fight against the novel coronavirus as of april 8th in china we have 83162 confirmed patients with covid-19 and 3342 have died as of now it appears that the epidemic in china has been controlled and after 76 days of quarantine wuhan city the epicenter in china has lifted the lockdown all of china is once again running after a 2-month hiatus though it is impossible to know if this will remain the case during the epidemic all citizens of china were ordered to stay home when possible to go outside only when absolutely necessary and to wear masks when in the community compliance with the mask guideline was so good that even now when we go to work or to buy things in the supermarket if we do not wear a mask we feel naked perhaps more importantly we wont be allowed into places like supermarkets without one it appears that as of the time im writing this early april 2020 the cdc has endorsed this approach 3 but from what my friends in france germany and the us tell me mask usage in the community in those countries is inconsistent i dont understand why as an aside though an important one ive also read and heard firsthand stories about asian people in western countries experiencing discrimination even violence perhaps in part for wearing masks i understand that many asian people adopted this practice early in those locations this is wrong and hearing these stories makes me sad the sars-cov-2 virus knows nothing about culture this is a time to work together and to take sensible steps in each of our communities to care for one another shuichi matsuda md phd orthopaedic surgeon kyoto university kyoto japan as of this writing early april 2020 surgeons here still are performing elective procedures with some restrictions the number of patients confirmed to have covid-19 is increasing though the number remains low compared to those in the us and european countries but we fear that many patients have gone undiagnosed because public access to the pcr test for covid-19 is extremely limited by the policy of the japanese government the government believes that seeing too many patients with covid-19 who have only mild symptoms would overwhelm hospitals and so energy instead is focused on arranging medical staff rooms and medical devices for treating patients with serious symptoms whose numbers will rapidly increase in the near future in daily life we are advised to avoid nonessential outings but the city is not under lockdown or quarantine as of now its fair to say no one knows what the best approach is well only be able to tell the people in the future what we learned japan has a very sad past in 2011 we lost more than 18000 people in one day to a huge earthquake and the tsunami that followed one small village however lost fewer lives because the townspeople obeyed directions written on a local stone monument do not build any homes below this point 1 the waves stopped just below the stone this monument was built at the time of a previous huge tsunami in 1933 hundreds of such tsunami stones some more than six centuries old dot the northeastern coast of japan some places heeded these lessons of the past but many were too confident about advanced technology and higher seawalls and forgot the old warnings in 2020 it appears that we have been overconfident in our belief that advanced medical technology is the only or best answer instead it seems that older approachesmaintaining social distance and handwashingwill be a big part of any solution here someday perhaps we will build a monument saying how we survived the covid-19 pandemic megan e anderson md orthopaedic surgeon beth israel deaconess medical center and boston childrens hospital boston usa what strikes me about life now amidst the pandemic is a dichotomy of existences with reversed experiences on the one hand is my virtual life using online connections where i meet with patients to evaluate their tumors and guide their rehabilitation and with colleagues and staff to stay current on policies and safe practices but instead of being cold and impersonal i find that i can look at my patients their caregivers and my colleagues directly in the eye via the video camera indeed i am looking so much more at their faces that i seem to pick up more of their stresses and concerns than when i would see them in person when i might have been distracted by other things surprisingly at least to me these virtual encounters are welcoming and friendly with happy safe patients at home grateful for continued medical care and happy safe staff who can achieve more distance than we thought possible while still sharing warm exchanges contrast to this my actual life non-covid care continues during the crisis but it has changed halls at the hospital are empty and the few coworkers i see are in masks and rarely even nod hello patients with cancer from all the services are gathered together on one floor as there are no elective patients in the hospital anymore wards have been converted to care for patients with coronavirus people seem stressed and raw and the hospitals seem dark and cold even at home roles are different and more stressful ive changed from working mother someone who could savor every delightful nonwork moment with my family to home-school home-organization dictator my hope is that going forward in life after covid-19 if that does become a reality i can pull the best parts from both of these existences into some sort of new melded reality to become a better doctor surgeon mother wife colleague and friend berardo di matteo md orthopaedic surgeon humanitas clinical and research institute milan italy march was a tough month we were told that elective surgery was suspended although few patients had yet been diagnosed with covid-19 here in lombardy italy bad feelings were in the air on march 11th all of italy was placed under lockdown it was a shock within days my institute was transformed into a covid-19 hospital with more than 250 patients hospitalized and military medical tents placed at the entrance of our emergency department what should an orthopaedic surgeon do in such a situation the answer actually wasnt difficult it is pretty clear that our category is almost useless as we fight this war against an invisible agent i had to rethink my role and try to help to those who were and are really fighting on the front line internists and anestesiologists both on the wards and in the intensive care unit icu i had to recall old knowledge going all the way back to medical school this helped me to rediscover a true sense of collaboration among physicians nurses and medical personnel in a setting where each of us came in with different backgrounds now on the april 4th the situation seems a little bit better our authorities say the we are at the peak of the epidemic there is still a long way to go we all know but we will resist no doubt jun yang md orthopaedic surgeon allinmed internet orthopedics hospital northwest center yinchuan china although i practice in shanghai my hometown is wuhan the coronavirus epicenter i returned home to see family for the holidays and celebrated the most-important festival of the year chinese lunar new year shortly thereafter my mother developed covid-19 her illness became severe balancing my responsibilities as a physician and family member was not easy my mothers condition went from that of a mild flu-like illness to full-blown hypoxia in a span of hours i borrowed a blood oxygen saturation monitor and an oxygen generator to try to alleviate my mothers symptoms this was not enough my mother was admitted to huoshenshan hospital an infectious-disease center built specifically and quickly to fight covid-19 after 3 days of high-flow oxygen therapy her oxygen saturation improved and she was weaned off supplemental oxygen about 2 weeks later our approaches to this illness still seem so crude physicians around the world need to work together to share data and experiences to refine our treatments and to arrive at

little doubt that our medical practices and even the world will not be the same when this crisis passes changes have been forced but the good that may come from this may be achieved in ensuring that we are changed for the better enrique gmez-barrena md phd orthopaedic surgeon hospital universitario la paz universidad autnoma de madrid madrid spain i work in a large tertiary-care hospital in madrid spain despite the available information from italy which appeared to be 1 week ahead in terms of pandemic-related suffering nobody in madrid imagined we would be so seriously hit then everything changed the orthopaedic department abruptly transformed as the hospital had to admit more and more patients with covid-19 on march 17th we had 269 inpatients with covid-19 and 57 in the emergency room by march 28th those numbers were 803 with covid-19 in the hospital 103 of whom were in the icu and 198 in the er half the faculty and residents of the orthopaedic department were serving in the er or on wards to support the internists by providing care or meeting with families we established a rotating team to take care of trauma in the er and the operating rooms and urgentemergent surgery continued as needed though elective surgery has long since stopped still there were hard decisions admitting older patients with hip fractures risked nosocomial covid-19 infections and soon patients with covid-19 dominated the surgical list the good news as of today april 3rd is that the numbers seem to be improving while we now have 140 patients with covid-19 in the icu the hospital has doubled its capacity by blocking the operating rooms to host patients needing ventilators there are only 73 patients with covid-19 awaiting admission from in the er all the same the orthopaedic team felt the pressure as several surgeons and residents in our department tested covid  and now are quarantined so many questions remain when will we be able to return to delivering full care how many patients will deteriorate or die between now and then will there be as-yet undiscovered musculoskeletal complications but one lesson we learned in the recent past is that orthopaedic surgeons as physicians and human beings must adapt together during crises if we are to have any hope of sharing a future choon chiet hong mbbs frcsedorth orthopaedic surgeon national university hospital of singapore it has been an eventful 12 weeks since the first patient with covid-19 was diagnosed in singapore on january 23rd 2020 disease outbreak control measures were introduced quickly by the government and we put in place containment measures early and avoided sustained community transmission however in the past 1 to 2 weeks there has been a second wave of covid-19 among singaporeans returning from overseas resulting in increased local transmission the government responded with this by activating a circuit breaker with stricter measures to reduce risks of a larger outbreak as of today we have 1375 patients who have been diagnosed with covid-19 and six deaths colleagues have been quarantined after being exposed and orthopaedic surgeons have been called to help out in busier departments including the emergency department infectious diseases and icus those left in the department have covered their colleagues duties in managing patients with orthopaedic emergencies trauma infections and tumors surgical procedures are being triaged based on their urgency and more outpatient surgery is being performed to reduce the hospital census because hospital beds are needed for patients with covid-19 doctors nurses cleaners porters contact tracing teams and many others are working hard together to combat the virus but healthcare workers alone cannot stop the virus transmission community members making good choices are the first line of defense against this invisible enemy healthcare workers are the last bastion and people in the community need to play their part if we are to contain the virus meanwhile lets find our goggles and personal protective equipment and get back to work john d kelly iv md orthopaedic surgeon perelman school of medicine university of pennsylvania philadelphia usa for weeks now the covid-19 epidemic has threatened the health of many and on a hypothetical level i recognized that some of my colleagues at my institution would likely be affected but this only really hit home when a close friend and anesthesia attending texted me a few days ago he asked me to pray for a fellow physician who was critically ill with covid-19 he was intubated on a vent requiring high positive end-expiratory pressure settings while he battles for his life my thoughts also turn to the real heroes in this pandemic the critical care providers who risk exposure day in and day out while i comfortably sit home and conduct televisits though i await the call to serve and it may come my exposure to the virus has thus far been limited those who answer the call to duty in trying times are not to be forgotten i agree with arthur ashe true heroism is remarkably sober very undramatic it is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost but the urge to serve others at whatever cost nicol martinelli md orthopaedic surgeon galeazzi orthopedic institute milan italy my hospital is located 40 kilometers from bergamo the epicenter of the italian epidemic other than trauma and cancer most orthopaedic surgery was suspended early before long hospitals in this area were overcrowded with patients symptomatic from covid-19 and many patients on the trauma service who needed fracture surgery likewise were covid  although our specialty had been fragmented by subspecialization before all this surgeons quickly rediscovered strong community bonds subspecialists like myself volunteered for shifts in the first aid department to decrease the pressure on trauma surgeons who bore a tremendous burden of care to those patients with covid-19 who presented with surgical injuries several of my colleagues caught the virus and although we want to help patients we all bear the fear of getting sick as well as of transmitting the disease to our families this is a source of great distress in terms of the care we deliver it is sometimes necessarily below the normal level this is particularly true for diseases requiring a multidisciplinary approach such as with patients who have orthopaedic infections our colleagues in infectious diseases are stretched very thin we depend on the empathy and support from family members and friends these bonds encourage me to stay positive and persist with my job we dont know what will happen but we as surgeons and caregivers must remain focused on our duties  report from the covid-19 virtual summit disaster experts speak out march 31 2020 james phillips p luca ragazzoni w burel greg frederick burkle m mark keim   this manuscript represents the transcript of a webinar-virtual summit1 originally presented on march 31 2020 to an audience of over 1000 many listeners world-wide requested the written transcript this represents an edited version of the presentations the panel was comprised of the following disaster experts from italy and the united states 1 luca ragazzoni md phd - emergency and disaster medicine physician and faculty at the research center for emergency and disaster medicine in novara italy very close to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 epicenter 2 james phillips md facep - emergency and disaster medicine physician section chief and fellowship director of disaster and operational medicine at the george washington university school of medicine and health sciences washington dc usa also a medical analyst on the cable news network cnn atlanta georgia usa 3 greg burel - public health administrator and former director of the us strategic national stockpile office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response aspr washington dc usa now president and principal consultant at hamilton grace llc consulting group 4 frederick skip burkle jr md - retired professor and now senior fellow and scientist at the harvard humanitarian initiative th chan school of public health boston massachusetts usa and global scholar at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars washington dc usa the four panelists were asked three questions regarding the current pandemic as follows1what do you see as a particular issue of concern during the current pandemic2what do you see as a particular strength during the current pandemic3if you could change one thing about the way that the pandemic response is occurring what would you change
 panelists responses were collected transcribed and minimally edited for grammatical flow not content this is a manuscript of that transcription the summit was moderated by dr mark keim ceo disasterdoc llc and adjunct assistant professor emory university rollins school of public health atlanta georgia usa covid-19 is now a pandemic that has reached over 100 countries in a matter of weeks italy despite having an advanced health care system is almost at point break the situation here is very critical patients are being treated in hospital corridors hospital departments have been converted to treat only covid-19 patients many doctors and nurses are working outside of their field of expertise and we are not able to provide the same quality of care as we usually do of course now we know that the intensive care unit icu is one of the most stressed hospital units however what is concerning me is that there is not enough attention on the prehospital setting primary health care family doctors and emergency medical services ems have key roles to alleviate the burden at the hospital before the admission additionally so many doctors and nurses are working outside of their field of expertise that we are not able to provide the same quality of care as we usually do we cannot expect that africa would respond like china us and europe we cannot ask all the countries to buy ventilators where there are no icus and there are a maximum two intensivists in the whole country we need to differentiate the response and allocate the right resources according to the country what we do after we discharge patients from hospitals is really important in italy we need to increase the importance of the role of the prehospital setting how do we continue care unfortunately currently there is little known about how long the patients need assistance and for how long they remain covid-19 positive we need to plan in advance for home care for the patients or at least create a new health facility to admit patients that are not able to stay at home alone and of course what is concerning me apart from the specific issue of the prehospital setting is the global lack of personal protective equipment ppe in italy were having issues trying to find enough ppe for the family physicians for the prehospital setting and the hospital staff everyday there is a critical lack of ppe as well as a misunderstanding of the importance of this issue these are in my opinion my concerns currently there are several things that i see as particular concerns right now ppe is a critical one not only in the united states where its talked about constantly on every major network but around the world we talk about europe and china and the united states ad nauseam but lets not forget africa lets not forget south america these are places where some of this equipment doesnt even exist i saw somewhere today that theres an african country liberia that has only three ventilators so equipment represents a major concern globally but in particular ppe is key in the united states where we are rationing it in every hospital also i must emphasize that we are using ppe in a manner that is not consistent with the standard of care what this means is not that patient treatment is suffering necessarily but that provider protection is suffering i go into work and i put on a mask and i wear it for eight hours i take it off halfway through one time to have an energy drink to keep going it smells bad after you eat or drink something and after hours it becomes hard to breathe through it makes you very fatigued and it sometimes makes you breathless to have a conversation with your patient you cant understand what anybody is saying in your work area which has been problematic during critical interventions we have seen an outpouring from people who are trying to make ppe for us but i dont even know how to begin to advise them as we cannot wear most of it i get emails daily from people trying to manufacture cloth masks for us some are using 3d printers and girl scout troops to make face shields for us its incredible and heartwarming and is one of the small bits of hope that we have right now as health care providers especially when theres so much disappointing and disheartening news i do not understand how we can assemble all the power and wealth of the united states to go to the moon or to develop the manhattan project yet we havent even considered doing the same thing to manufacture ppe and ventilators there are a lot of people working hard on this pandemic but i still think that we havent pulled out all the stops the defense production act is a useful tool but i think if i were in charge i would be a little less worried about the economy in the short term id be more worried about immediately cranking out millions of masks from every textile manufacturer in the united states we need to raise the curve on ppe production while we try to flatten the curve on the spread of this infection and if we end up with surplus thats what makes us great - because then we can share it with other countries while the production process for ppe and ventilators is obviously a concern for us we are additionally concerned about the ethical decisions that we as physicians may be facing as resources run short - when we start talking about rationing italy has certainly started that conversation its anesthesiology society published its concerns and guidelines and that has generated talk here in the united states i think it was new york university nyu new york usa hospital whose rationing policy was leaked to the media raising publicly the potential need for us choosing who gets a ventilator this distressing issue is why we as physicians need to have our professional societies medical organizations and perhaps even the centers for disease control and prevention cdc atlanta georgia usa weigh in and provide us ethical guidelines so my colleagues and i are not making ad hoc decisions in the heat of the battle we may be forced to decide which one of three patients needs the last remaining ventilator a policeman a mother or the priest  how do we decide as it stands now i alone must choose who gets that ventilator we need help so that were not burdened the rest of our lives by having to make those terrible decisions crisis leadership matters once you lie you lose your credibility and its hard to get it back i turn to my television to watch the president and the task force every single day and i am disappointed our incident commander the president is failing in his ability to communicate the issues at hand instead i find myself simply waiting to hear from dr fauci every day so that way i at least hear something i can believe we need better crisis leadership at the very top and so i think that one of the lessons we learn from this is the importance that at the highest levels it cannot be about politics its about crisis leadership we also need to address and include all-cause mortality theres a lot of people who are going to die from covid-19 who are never infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov-2 virus instead they will die as a result of the burden on our health care systems the implications of delayed ambulances and reduced resources could mean dying of a disease or trauma process that when in non-pandemic times they would otherwise have been saved heroin overdoses that didnt get narcan in time severe pediatric allergic reactions that dont get epinephrine trauma in general all those events may happen and were not including those victims right now in the death rate from this pandemic but they should be counted these are my biggest concerns that i wish we could address i echo the concerns about the availability of ppe today i remain concerned about the availability of other material we will need as we move forward in this event for example if there is a vaccine that becomes available or if there are therapeutics that become available were going to need additional needles and syringes - far more than we normally need during the seasonal flu campaign there are limitations on all products but let me go back to the ppe i agree that the fact that we have limited ppe available for our front-line personnel trying to deal with this problem is just unconscionable the reason i see behind this dilemma is that the medical supply chain is very fragile and people dont really understand that its fragile within all links of the supply chain what we know about that supply chain is evident for most products such as chronic disease medications and ppe  from the point of dispensing all the way back to the manufacturer there is never more than about 30 days of projected need for the entire market available its a very cost-effective system i think its great when you do that for auto parts i think its great when you do that for other materials that are not essential to protect and save lives but when we talk about the medical supply chain we begin to recognize that problem number one is there is no safety stock there is no back stock there is no margin for error in that just-in-time delivery of product at any link in the supply chain - all the way from the point-of-care to a distributor or to a manufacturer that has caused a lot of the problems we have today about getting this vital materiel coming out of this on the other side were going to have to really rethink the entire health care supply chain do we need to optimize so much for cost or do we need to consider optimizing the costs so that we dont ever have this kind of a problem in the future but there are other problems with that supply chain we are reliant on so many products that are made offshore that are no longer available for manufacturers or have very limited manufacturer availability in the united states and this is something that many of us have been discussing for years theres been congressional testimony around this problem as well as at the national academy of sciences washington dc usa and many other fora weve got to find a way to get more of this materiel made in the united states maybe not all of it but weve got to find a way to protect ourselves better from that supply chain perspective i think another particular issue of concern goes back to misinformation there is misinformation and confusion about what the government is doing and not doing what the strategic national stockpile can and cant do and a variety of other issues too weve got to get better about controlling information so that people see the right thing up first and credible one there was and remains a distinct difference in how countries ruled by authoritarian regimes initially managed the early evidence of the pandemic versus democratically ruled countries and as one further investigates this it becomes obvious that in great part this is a symptom of how both define public health in democracies public health is defined by priorities to improve protect and provide services public health infrastructure and programs in authoritarian regimes public health services prevention preparedness and response are inextricably seen and practiced through political and economic imperatives always leading to compromises in health and public health security currently the world has the fewest democracies ever recorded and the united states is currently defined as a flawed democracy and is becoming more authoritarian every day with this pandemic i believe it is fair to say that there is a general lack of confidence among health care providers world-wide because for most this is their first experience in population-based care for the most part they never studied them in medical or nursing schools in past decades with lower population densities infectious disease outbreaks epidemics and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by large natural disasters predatory animals and war mine was in 1968 vietnam with an epidemic of bubonic plague that not only stopped the war on both sides it emptied the city and village streets of people for many weeks while it was the worst plague epidemic of the 20th century it was politically kept quiet once rare zoonotic spread that is between animal reservoirs and human animals through outbreaks epidemics and pandemics now make up 71 or more of new diseases globally they have grown because of massive growth in population numbers and density which are accelerated further by rapid unsustainable urbanization biodiversity loss and climate change and for the first time we have an increasing number of vulnerable populations that are suffering from chronic deficiencies in food water and energy we have never seen those numbers before and lastly which i will introduce you to in more depth in discussing the next question the loss of the world health organization who geneva switzerland and the international health regulations treatys independent leadership established under the united nations has been devastating what they were initially organized to do decades ago globally is now absent they have given their previous leadership role over to political powerhouses across the world because they are monetarily dependent on them to me in the long term this is the most telling issue of concern for us as practitioners and for the future of global public health this current webinar is an example of what i see as a particular strength during the current pandemic we are sharing knowledge we are sharing experience and we can teach others and explain to others how to prepare in advance ill give you an example when we had the first cases here in novara we started to prepare and to convert the hospital to assist covid-19 patients we were treating the first patients in icu and expecting the waves and we had a discussion with colleagues everywhere in the world for example from sweden we had a long talk with johan von schreeb - karolinska institutet solna sweden and health officers there and according to our suggestions they prepared in advance few days ago i received a message from johan saying thanks a lot luca and professor della corte to help us in preparing ourselves and to increase the icu capacity and we had other webinars like this one to help others i think to share knowledge is a real strength right now and of course the science we need to remember everyone disaster medicine is a science and we need to follow the sciences that are now available in the literature and in my opinion now there is real added value for everyone and of course i have to echo what james said the willingness of the health care professionals to respond is amazing right now here in italy it is spectacular we had a call for physicians for nurses to help in hospitals we called 300 physicians and nurses and we received 9000 responses the willingness to help is unbelievable i have to start with the front-line providers - the doctors and nurses at the local level are stepping up and showing their courage you know as we say in the disaster medicine world all disasters are local - and while i emphasize the fact that were lacking in leadership at the federal level the good news is locally thats not the case i know that every hospital is different theres nothing even remotely one-size-fits-all about this pandemic there are differences between academic hospitals non-academic hospitals and critical access hospitals but where i work at george washington university hospital we have a robust disaster medicine program that was in place long before i joined a faculty team including anthony mcintyre bruno petinaux dan hanfling and joe barbera - so our hospital is very well-versed in preparing for these crises im able to watch our emergency manager our local leader provide great leadership getting our hospital prepared both behind the scenes and in public im able to interact with our nurses and technicians both in the emergency department and the icu who are all preparing however as is being shown in the media we see courage knowing that many have been told to wear ppe in a way that is not consistent with the standard of care yet they do not hesitate to go in to treat the most ill of patients but it is taking toll on us i received an email a few minutes ago saying that we need coverage for tonight at one of our hospitals because one of my colleagues is now sick with covid-19 symptoms we are just at the tip of what were going to see here in washington dc evident when we see the incredible evidence of whats taking place in new york but i am encouraged witnessing planeloads full of medical workers flying into new york to volunteer to work its absolutely incredible i also appreciate governor cuomo displaying what i think is very good crisis leadership and this will be proved true when we look back through the long list of after-action reports following this pandemic i think one of the things were going to see as a silver lining is the expertise provided through telemedicine i think that the world will never be the same in relation to the telehealth system allowing doctors to provide care remotely and in a more efficient manner  and now without a financial loss which is critical also reducing associated regulations has been key as the former director of the strategic national stockpile i guess somewhat selfishly that the first thing i see that we do have is the strategic national stockpile in the united states while currently theres a lot of criticism that it doesnt have enough of everything the strategic national stockpile is the most-ready of any global stockpile that were aware of its one of the crown jewels in our preparedness system no its not perfect but every other country looks at us and asks us what we do and how to create their own however admittedly the problem that is facing us right now is that the strategic national stockpile has been chronically underfunded for years and we hope we see that improve i think another particular strength that were seeing and its been alluded to before is the way that people all across the united states and in other countries as well are coming together to try to help solve some of these problems there are limitations to what you can do but the fact that people are willing to step up and try is a major strength i think were seeing more people trying to abide by the remain in place and isolate yourself policy to a certain extent than what we might have thought we would weve got people doing some crazy things out there but youre always going to have that a final strength i see right now is the decision that the federal emergency management agency fema washington dc usa can respond to biological events in 2009 when we responded to h1n1 they didnt have that capability so i think fema leading the national response framework and bringing together the whole of government to try to address this problem puts us in a better position than we would have been otherwise we must remember its their first experience there are going to be hiccups and theyre going to be things that we need to go back and look at as many of us know as these after-action hot washes go well beat ourselves to death for several years over it but i think that this is good i think its brought new capability to a table that might not have been there before this whole of government response i think is going to be important to us moving ahead first i guess would be to see the health care providers speaking up first against chinas delays and inexcusable political decisions that violate public health dictums and similar concerns raised by health care providers in other countries remember the virus was known as early as last october not the december date the chinese first claimed the delay was inexcusable second clearly the manner in which health care providers volunteered and had to quickly learn the nuances of population-based care my one published study on triage categories in pandemics was the first and only triage structure that had a category for the non-survivable i believe italy was the first compelled in population-based care to use this category this has been listed as the most difficult of decisions and the first ever except in war that health care providers have had to make lastly i would offer that the pandemic and all its management deficiencies gives global public health some needed recognition it cannot turn back but the changes that must take place globally will be resisted in draconian ways by authoritarian regimes this pandemic will of course challenge globalization which is totally failing because it only focused on economics - never public health - and it should fail but we must ensure that this pandemic will strengthen what we now know as global public health i would say three main aspects stronger containment measures stronger coordination between health sectors and more just-in-time training no health care system can sustain an uncontrolled outbreak and stronger containment measures are now the only realistic option to avoid the total collapse of any health care system all governments must act now implementing traditional public health response tactics isolation quarantine social distancing community containment and aggressive lockdown also all people must know the basics of infection prevention and control measures and all precautionary measures aimed at avoiding the collapse of your health care system and an unnecessary loss of lives also from my perspective in italy we need more and stronger coordination between the different health sectors from the prehospital to the hospital more coordination between family doctors between ems and hospitals to contain the admission of patients in-hospital and to continue the care at home after the discharge and i would like to spend a little bit more time on training since its my field of expertise i would say we need more training more just-in-time training not only on donning and doffing ppe so i echo what skip said we are lacking of education in training in the medical schools in the nurses schools at any level so right now we need to act and to improve what we didnt implement before we need to increase the knowledge about triage about ethical dilemmas in this difficult situation its not just about donning and doffing ppe and also on basic principles of infection prevention and control again its not only because youre wearing a mask that youre protected so we need to teach everyone we need to educate health professionals on how to protect themselves and then also on how to react and to respond to difficult situations for example again how to expand the hospital how to triage patients at the admission and how to triage patients to decide which one needs icu needs intubation and which one not i think these are principles that are extremely important right now i mentioned ppe before and you know on an individual level as a physician on the front lines that is our major need but to think in terms of population health and a crisis management framework we can change the ppe issue and we can change ventilators those are things that we can improve and improve quickly but we talked about crisis leadership - and thats not something we are able to change right now we are getting messaging from the president that is very difficult to hear as a front-line health care provider i dont feel like he has my back and thats unfortunate this is not a political issue the coronavirus is neither a democrat nor republican and neither am i but we look to the president as the incident commander in a time of crisis like this the president has a choice of two ways to lead one can either lead by inspiration and rally the troops into battle or you can confuse them via mixed messaging even accusing us of stealing masks and selling them out the back door like what happened recently it is completely demoralizing we have to rely on our governors and our local experts we know we need containment and that the president has the power to enact national containment but wont our governors are going to finally have to reach a decisional critical mass before the president would ever decide to make a national decree if he will at all as the number of states where we have lockdown procedures grows like maryland and my home of virginia declared yesterday only then will we possibly see a federal change more personally crisis communication is one of the things that inspired me into disaster medicine i was 16 when the oklahoma city bombing occurred 1995 oklahoma usa - it rattled my window i heard the boom my father was one of the first firefighters in the building going straight into the nursery minutes after detonation since that time i knew this is what i was supposed to do as a career i recall that every night we would come home and there on tv was the excellent oklahoma city fire department public information officer pio named jon hanson jon was on every single night at the same time telling us what they knew what they didnt know and how they were going to find out when he was on the air we all felt that things were going to be okay because the people in charge were honest and informed thats what america needs now and because were americans the world looks to us i dont mean to be an american exceptionalist but i think we have missed a critical opportunity to provide global leadership at that highest level so if i could change one thing it would be the quality of our national leadership i would say crisis leadership again and i look at that from a couple of different lenses the first is we learned a long time ago that you must be first and you must be credible and im afraid that weve missed that boat to a certain extent i think back to 2009 and h1n1 we had a late-night phone call when we were beginning to see these cases and we began to understand what it might mean to the united states the cdc director was on camera the next morning first thing talking about what we knew talking credibly about what needed to be our concerns and we didnt see that here and that bothers me another issue we need to think about from a crisis leadership perspective is beyond just whether were going to send these things out or are we going to award some contracts or whatever we need to be taking better control at the federal level of these supply chain problems i was horrified to hear the comment that states should just go out and try to get their own things all at the same time the federal government is trying to do the same weve set up a competitive environment between the states and the federal government there is no room for that kind of competitiveness when we all need to be pulling together to respond to this event nation-wide i have never been a strong proponent of rapidly running out the door and placing orders under the defense production act because that puts the federal government first in line but in this particular case with some of these particular commodities like ppe that it is absolutely harming our response i believe that the government must order under the defense production act  put itself first in line bring in other capabilities to bear that are not normally engaged in this production field and then make those allocations as difficult as that might be across the country versus having every health care facility in every state and every locality and the federal government all competing with each other for these scarce products its creating an issue across this entire supply chain including placing equipment that is not needed as of this writing supplies are going where it is not needed and not going to where it is desperately needed now so back to the crisis leadership whereas i wanted to give you something different i think this is the most important issue we need to see changing and need to see immediate improvement i trust dr tony fauci first we need to change the medical and public health curriculum globally to include zoonotic diseases or those that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals currently this has not been a priority in education and health delivery medical efforts must not be directed at response phase alone but across the entire disaster cycle prevention preparedness response recovery and rehabilitation health must take ownership this applies to all health populations as well as being supported by the societies and the governments they live in the who and its international health regulation treaty organized to manage population-based diseases such as influenza sars h1n1 mers hiv and ebola have failed to meet population-based expectations in part this is due to influence from powerful political donors which the who is totally dependent on for their existence and which has become most painfully evident in the current covid-19 pandemic the who must exist solely as a treaty-based organization sanctioned and totally funded by the united nations and all its members it cannot be dependent on outside financial assistance to do its work the global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the who and expect to do in the future in a highly integrated globalized world both the who and its treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty a return of the whos singular global authority and support a highly coordinated population-based management as sir william osler who was the father of zoonotic diseases recognized his concept of one medicine one health first written in the early 1900s defines what global public health is striving for today public health and public health infrastructure and systems in developing countries must be seen as strategic and security issues that deserve international public health resource monitoring again this must cover the entire disaster cycle from prevention preparedness response recovery and rehabilitation also all six who regional offices must have similar multidisciplinary professional assets in support of zoonotic sciences which of course would be further resourced from who global assets during any epidemic or pandemic the goal is to identify and begin the containment process as early as possible i must say that america is going to do poorly the 50 states are performing as 50 different countries - it is insane the individual states departments of health are all run by political appointees and differ greatly in capability capacity and containment decisions some departments are excellent models of efficiency while others do not even have a department building to call their own lastly collectively we must begin now to think and plan for a new generation in every country of the credentials of health care managers and scientists who are trained across the entire disaster cycle to anticipate and manage population-based crises epidemics and pandemics are not the only entities that have the potential to devastate societies nuclear war climate change and biodiversity loss alone can lead to global devastation however i am aware that my italian colleagues before this pandemic occurred have seriously addressed and requested funding for a phd-level training program for professional health care managers and scientists within the european union this must be supported to fuel the expertise of a future who and international health regulation globally as well as in individual countries there is no excuse the three questions posed to the expert panel moderated and summarized by dr keim in real-time are summarized here in toto particular concerns the members of the panel expressed focused on the scarcity of ppe and the fragility of the supply chain for our health care system as well as the strategic national stockpile two members felt the defense production act was being under-utilized in regard to emergency manufacturing of resources and there is concern this could force physicians to make life or death resource rationing decisions without guidance the italian system is currently stressed in terms of space staff and equipment and more focus should be placed on the outside of the hospital setting including ems primary care and post-discharge care disaster response is certainly made more complicated by the type of government philosophy and attitude in different countries deficiencies in medical education in global health are also being seen the second question prompted answers that uniformly praised the response of the individual health care worker and the general public response across western countries similarly knowledge sharing between countries has been a strength the strategic national stockpile has been used to address shortages and has saved lives however its limitations have been now made apparent fema has been granted the authority to respond to pandemic events which is new and is also seen as a positive global public health is also having its moment in the sun and showing its value the final question generated enthusiastic answers in regard to failures in leadership at the highest levels it was stated or implied that the president and the who have extremely valuable roles during times of crisis such as this and it was universally believed among the american panelists that there has been a failure by both in regard to crisis leadership and communication better pandemic response education and communication within hospitals was also highlighted  toward a symbiotic perspective on public health recognizing the ambivalence of microbes in the anthropocene salla sariola scott gilbert f   it is important to determine how these new views of microbial evolutionlateral gene transfer and mutualistic symbiosismight be integrated into public health initiatives it seems that present initiatives ignore or marginalize these phenomenon and that public health might be served better if they were made more central two pertinent public health paradigms that have received much publicity in recent years are the precision public health pph paradigm and the one health oh paradigm neither of these appear to take seriously our new appreciation of microbial evolution precision public health pph is the application of genomics technology for population health benefits 3435 and it is the attempt to make public health into a genomic science pph began in 1997 when the office of public health genomics of the cdc was formed to transform population health care into a genomic science by identifying evaluating and implementing evidence-based genomics practices to prevent and control the countrys leading chronic infectious environmental and occupational diseases 36 pph claims that it would be able to analyze ones genome and then prescribe the appropriate drugs and dietary regimens however the original promises that genomic science would find common alleles for common diseases were not fulfilled 3738 genome-wide association studies gwas for cardiovascular disease showed that that genes played a negligible role in predicting heart attacks and that human genetic variation accounted for roughly 3 of the variation in blood pressure 39 moreover the prediction that a patient would have a heart attack was better made by the number of pushups a patient could do than by genomic analyses 40 the genes thought to be associated with depression were lost when large trials were done 41 and deficiencies of the gut microbiome may provide a better account of causation 42 worse for any genomic model of public health was when the genome of the founder of the human genome project james watson was analyzed his dna sequences predicted him to be deaf blind growth retarded and mentally deficient 4344 genes work differently in different people phenotypic heterogeneity wherein the same mutant allele causes different phenotypes in different individuals carrying it is a well-known phenomenon in medical genetics 4546 and a gene that is normal in one generation can cause disease in another 474849 nevertheless the pph got a shot in the arm to use an old public health metaphor by the all of us project begun at the usas national institutes of health 50 its website proclaims this to be a big genome big data approach to public health whereby taking into account individual differences in lifestyle environment and biology researchers will uncover paths toward delivering precision medicine pph is getting a shot in the other arm from pharmacogenomics the study of how responses to drugs are influenced by the genetic makeup of the person receiving the drug according to kapoor et al 51 pharmacogenomics is one of the cornerstones of precision medicine and furthermore is a significant innovation in health care that possesses the potential to change the paradigm in the practice of medicine not solely in the way drugs are prescribed but also in the way drugs are discovered and developed indeed precision pharmacogenetics is being touted as a paradigm for third-world health care 52 however this population-centered model of genomic healthcare delivery has been criticized 37 as being a salvage attempt to rescue something of value from the numerous extremely expensive genome projects that had been the scientific rage of the late 20th and early 21st centuries reardon and others 375354 claim pph is most likely dangerous fantasy exacerbating global economic differences taking the public out of public health and shifting responsibility for health onto the individual citizen 5556 pph has also been criticized for not recognizing the contributions of the symbiotic microbial genomes 38 symbiotic relationships with microbes as will be discussed below provide essential metabolic pathways for phenotype production including those for drug metabolism and over ten-fold the number of different genes than the zygote-derived genome whereas precision public health works from one privileged levelthe genomeup to humans and human communities the one health paradigm is consciously interdisciplinary and multi-speciesit attempts to envision people animals and environments as partners in each others health on several levels 5758 as gibbs 59 p 49 notes one health is the collaborative effort of multiple disciplinesworking locally nationally and globallyto attain optimal health for people animals and our environment the one health paradigm according to friese and nuyts provides a theoretical basis for research involving nonhumans in public health and used to re-organize relationships between human medicine and animal veterinary medicine so that these two fields communicate in both knowledge and practice 60 with contributions from such disciplines as ecosystem services and soil microbiology one health approach also recognizes the role of environments and ecologies in how human and animal health is shaped these contributions see ecosystems including symbiotic microbiomes as providing economic infrastructure benefits that can be calculated as part of any managed change to the environment 616263 however overall the implementation of one health is still fixed on protecting humans from zoonotic infections 60 indeed the cdc who ama and avma websites stress zoonoses and the fact that most infectious diseases are spread by animals the environment gets short shrift in these sites and this deficiency has not gone unnoticed numerous investigators have documented that the environment does not receive attention or funding in most one health networks 64656667 thus the three components of the one health model are not equal and the framework is still used to prioritize protection of humans from zoonotic diseases while the importance of this goal is made obvious in this coronavirus-infused decade the anthropogenic deterioration of the environment by humanssuch as mountain-top coal removal anthropogenic deforestation soil microbial deterioration and reef depletion are crucial in and of themselves as well as can have enormous effects on public health and do not appear on the one health agenda only recently have there been calls to put microbes and global climate change under the one health umbrella 6869 some of these initiatives have come under the planetary health 70 which emphasizes how critical such ecological perspectives are for human health the planetary health perspective however concentrates on the important issues of politics and economics of global health care in the anthropocene but it does not address the issues the changes in how we perceive microbes in contrast to the precision public health and one health paradigms a recently proposed theory holds that microbes such as bacteria are primarily beneficial symbionts of the human body and their presence is both expected and necessary for normal human health while pathogenic microbes can cause enormous damage they are a distinct minority and public health needs to recognize the other arm of symbiosismutualism this approach which could revitalize the community-based one health perspective to public health by using the techniques of the molecularly based pph model is based on the hologenome theory 71 this model has recently received support by private funding most notably from the bill and melinda gates foundation 7273 the hologenome theory 7475 recasts the individual animal or plant and other multicellular organisms as a consortium holobiontthe host plus all its symbiotic microbes during the past two decades advances in microbiome research have clearly shown that most animals cannot normally develop function or reproduce without the vast numbers of microorganisms that inhabit their bodies 2876 microbes are essential for normal animal development and physiological functioning for instance bacteria acquired at birth from the female reproductive tract are critical to the construction of the gut capillaries and epithelia in several vertebrates 7778798081 as well as being critical for the normal development of the vertebrate enteric and cerebral nervous systems 828384 pediatric geneticist barton childs 85 postulated that each persons genetic endowment constitutes a biochemical individuality conferred upon us by our genes patterson and turnbaugh 86 have used the same term to designate the properties of the hologenomethe genes we inherit from our parents and our microbes our germ cells and our germs while we inherit some 22000 genes from our parents we inherit about 8 million different genes from our parents bacteria 87 indeed in some instances the gut microbiome appears to be critical in drug metabolism digoxin cyclophosphamide and numerous other drugs are each metabolized differently by different populations of microorganisms 888990 giving each person an assortment of genes and drug-metabolizing phenotypes that can change with each meal 91  even the human immune system so critical in public health is a holobiont property and not merely the agency of the host 9293949596 microbes enter into the body at birth prior to the maturation of the immune system and they induce the formation of lymphoid tissues 979899 moreover these lifelong immune activities are well-regulated only in the continuous presence of microbes which in turn constantly regulate the microbes that can stay with the animal 100101102103104105106 the immune system is a continuously co-constructed property of the holobiont  holobiont public health recognizes that microbes may be pathogenic or beneficial and that deficiencies in bacteria can cause developmental immunological cognitive and physiological ailments for instance kwashiokor long seen as a protein deficiency disease manifests as a wasting and anorexic pathology only when certain bacteria are absent 107 asthma and allergies are also seen to be due to the absence of protective bacteria which normally are present to be induce anti-inflammatory regulators 108109 in these studies hanski and colleagues 110 explicitly link environmental health microbial diversity and human health indeed a new field of dysbiosis is now emerging including not only infection but also other conditions that may be caused by deficient or aberrant microbiomes here the normal symbiotic relationships that maintain physiological or developmental continuity have been abrogated in recent years science has traced these networks from associations to specific causal changes that can be tested while many of these experiments have been performed in mice the same pathways are known to be present in humans these non-contagious diseases include asthma and allergy 111 kwashiorkor 107112 obesity 113114 diabetes 115 ulcerative colitis 116 depression 42117 and parkinsons disease 118119 these microbial deficiency diseases constitute a new and possibly important category of illness this is not to say that dysbiosis is the only cause of these conditions but that it is a public health concern that should be investigated an important conceptual barrier was recently crossed when the gut microbiomes of pregnant mice were demonstrated to be critical for the intrauterine development of the fetus short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate and propionate are products of the gut microbiomes digestion of cellulose as no mammalian genome contains genes for cellulose digestion the breakdown of plant material is almost totally accomplished by enzymes produced by microbes kimura and colleagues 120 demonstrated that propionic acid derived from the breakdown of fiber by maternal gut microbes was critical for the normal development of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells the sympathetic neurons that project to the heart and the gut enteroendocrine cells without the microbe-derived propionic acid the adult offspring developed a metabolic syndrome characterized by glucose intolerance obesity and insulin resistance since diet can control the prevalence of microbes the holobiont model can explain the mechanism whereby eating low-fiber high-calorie diets during pregnancy predisposes offspring to have metabolic syndrome later in life 121 to understand the importance of a symbiotic approach to public health one has to first appreciate the new biological notion of the human body each of us is a functional entity that includes our zygote-derived cells as well as hundreds of species of microbes the body is both an organism and a biome containing several ecosystems 2876101 once the amnion breaks and the fetus passes through the birth canal the newborn becomes colonized by their mothers bacteria 87 furthermore mothers milk contains a special set of nutrients to promote the survival and growth of those bacteria that are important for symbiosis 122123124 these symbiotic bacteria will produce short-chain fatty acids and sphingolipids necessary for intestinal peristalsis and homeostasis peptidoglycans necessary for normal neuron function lipopolysaccharides necessary for the actions of the immune system the tripeptides necessary for cardiac physiology and the digestive enzymes necessary to metabolize plants 28 remarkably a third of the small metabolites in the blood are produced or induced by bacteria 125 nearly all of our peripheral serotonin is induced by gut microbes where it regulates the maturation of the enteric nervous system and regulates peristalsis 83126 even more remarkable is that such critical symbioses are not only present within humans rather the development of most organisms appears to be predicated on interactions between hosts and their symbionts as mentioned in the above section 1 without microbial symbionts mice do not form their gut capillaries their gut-associated lymphoid tissues their t- and b- cell repertoires or the proper synaptic connections in their guts and brains moreover no vertebrate contains genes that make the enzymes necessary for digesting plant material such as cellulose hemicellulose and pectins 127 these genes are provided by symbiotic microbes in our guts in mammalian evolution the entire family of ruminants is made evolutionarily possible by the ability of gut bacteria acquired at birth to build the rumen of the stomach and then to ferment grass and grains 128129130131 thus symbiosis is a paradigm-changing idea in physiology we are no longer seen as being individuals we are holobionts and our anatomy development immunity and physiology are intimately linked with that of our microbial components the importance of the holobiont perspective for public health is that absences of particular microbes may cause dysbioses throughout a population martin blaser and colleagues 6132 have warned that we may need particular microbes for particular functions and that our obsession with exterminating microbes may be inadvertently killing those bacteria that we need to survive their data indicate that microbes that used to be prevalent those for instance in barnyards and horse stalls are becoming rarer if these microbes are necessary for normal organ immune or cognitive development we will be impaired rhesus macaques that are bottle-fed rather than breast-fed acquire a different population of gut microbes and this population is not as adequate to develop a functioning immune system that can repel opportunistic infections 133 in zebrafish a relatively rare species of bacteria is essential for permitting the expansion of insulin-producing pancreatic cells thereby protecting these fish against diabetes 134  this absence of specific bacteria or their genes may be crucially important for explaining the increases in allergies and asthma since world war i and especially after world war ii throughout human history we had constant exposure to barnyard microbes it was only in the 20th century that they were displaced the barnyard was not just an attribute of farms the nineteenth century city according to raulff 135 p 36 consisted of rows and rows of urban stables mid 19th c boston had some 367 stables each having around eight horses in contemporary america only 6 of amish children whose homes are often adjacent to their barns have allergy and asthma about 20 of the genetically similar hutterites whose farms are not located close to their homes have allergies roughly the same as the american population in general 136 similarly finnish studies have shown that proximity to the barn is a factor in combatting allergies a recent study shows that children living in urban homes with barnyard bacteria have much less asthma and allergies than those children living in urban homes with urban bacteria 109 indeed two of the bacterial types found in the rural homes and missing in urban homes were brevibacterium and ruminococaceae bacteria found in horses and cattle although the severity of microbiome diversity loss might be most discernable in urban populations 137 the importance of soil microbiomes for the maintenance of healthy human intestinal microbiomes has recently been emphasized in studies 138 showing that even in rural areas farming techniques have severely reduced soil microbiome biodiversity bacterial displacement due to urban living and the absence of animals is only one of the ways that anthropogenic microbial displacement can affect public health caesarian sections disrupt one of the pathways of maternal kinship babies receive a protective set of symbiotic microbes from mothers when they pass through the birth canal in caesarean sections this transmission is abrogated babies delivered by c-section were found to be deprived of those microbes that otherwise colonize the infant gut instead there were the hospital dwelling microbes that included a substantial number of opportunistic pathogens moreover a substantial set of these microbes contained genes associated with antimicrobial resistance 139 not only were the species of microbes different but so were their functions the caesarean-delivered infants had less ability to mount immune responses to common antigens 140 this may have strong public health implications concerning elective c-sections the microbes of our gut are critical for basic neurogenerative processes such as the formation of the blood-brain barrier myelination neurogenesis and microglia maturation 141 if this is indeed true then could microbes also be critical for mental health what if in addition to protection against allergies and asthma bacteria were protecting us against mental health conditions such as schizophrenia bipolar disease and autism several studies now indicate that gut microbes appear to be critical for normal brain development and behaviors in mice 82142143144145146147148 first mice born from germ-free mothers and who are themselves without microbes have a syndrome that includes obsessive self-grooming and asocial behavior 149 this behavior is possibly due to the failure of oxytocin-releasing signals from the vagus nerve and it can be reversed by providing the germ-free mice with lactobacillus reuteri or with microbes from normal mice or from normal humans 141150 germ-free mice given microbes from autistic humans do not show improvement of their symptoms although human cognitive and affective behaviors cannot be extrapolated for those of mice a pilot uncontrolled fecal transplant study in humans showed that after two years the acquisition of normal bowel microbes by autism patients significantly improved their symptoms from 83 severe autism to 17 severe autism 146 similar studies in mice and humans have shown that the gut microbiome may be critical in protecting humans from depression 42151152153 there is therefore reason to test the hypothesis that removal or depletion of normal environmental microbes may be responsible for the increasing percentage of the population diagnosed with cognitive dysfunction while studies of the effects of microbes on mental health lag behind those studies of microbial involvement in physical health the relationship of symbiotic microbes to cognitive and affective health and disorder is an area that cannot be ignored public health must acknowledge that we are not monogenomic individuals we are consortia of dozens of species per person integrated together in a complex and dynamically changing network that forms who we are at any given moment this network is altered by the food we eat by the food our mother ate the toxins and medications we are exposed to and by our daily interactions with other holobionts our health depends upon other species making the one health perspective more than metaphor the symbiotic networks of the human holobiont are enmeshed in larger symbiotic networks that sustain the planet public health would be severely affected if any of the many life support systems on which we dependincluding pollinators soils and bacteriafail indeed symbiosis is the signature of life on earth the nitrogen in our soil and atmosphere is made available for protein synthesis by symbioses between rhizobacteria and legumes the interactions of plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi are critical for plant growth while endophytic fungi are often necessary to protect the plants against dessication 154155156 the coral reef ecosystem is dependent on the symbiosis of algae and the ectoderm of corals while the marine seagrass ecosystems are sustained by symbioses involving clams and their bacteria reef-building corals survive through the photosynthesis of their algal symbiont which enters into the ectoderm of its host and transports over 90 of its photosynthetically derived carbon compounds to the host cells 157 however these symbioses the very symbioses that define the planet are at risk these are the analogues of the microbial displacement and extinction that affect human health although public health is mainly concerned about human public health one readily finds that we cannot separate ourselves from our ecosystems socially politically economically or biologically coral reefs for instance are thought to support 500 million people across 50 nations and contribute nearly a trillion dollars to the worlds economy 158 the great barrier reef alone brings 7 billion dollars annually to australian commerce healthy coral reefs absorb over 95 of a waves energy thus protecting the shoreline preventing nearly a hundred million dollars worth of flood damage each year however the coral that form the critical structure of these reefs must be seen as a holobiont that exists only in a fragile symbiosis between the coral animal and single-celled zooxanthellae algae the coral animal provides a sunlit safe and nutrient-containing environment for the algae and the algae living within the animal cells provide the coral with the sugars it produces by photosynthesis the coral holobiont can survive only when its symbionts are present to provide the food resources 157159 under stress conditions such as high temperatures the symbionts are expelled from the corals leaving the corals bleached and undernourished these corals usually die as a result of global warming massive bleaching events and coral die-offs have occurred 160161 we are writing this essay not only in the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 but in the great barrier reef bleaching event of 2020 162 over half the corals in the great barrier reef have perished and some entire reefs have collapsed  the mechanisms for the expulsion of the algal symbiont from its coral host are under investigation and it appears to be a mutual breakdown of the symbiotic relationship 163 one hypothesis is that heat disrupts the photosynthetic apparatus of the algae causing them to produce dangerous hydrogen peroxide radicals the coral cells defend themselves by expelling the algae or destroying them another hypothesis is that warmer temperatures permit algae to get the organic nitrogen that allows them to metabolize their sugars without needing the coral thereby forcing the coral to rely on their own meager carbon reserves 164165 in addition to anthropogenic heating humans are also affecting symbiosis through domestication mycorrhizal symbiosis is critical to plant nutrition and therefore a necessity for sustainable agriculture however artificial fertilization of soil diminishes the mycorrhizal fungi and root symbiosis martin-robles and colleagues 166 have linked the loss of symbiotic colonization with plant domestication indeed failure to colonize is common making domesticated strains addicted to artificial fertilization 167168 moreover the lack of myccorhizal fungus may make the domesticated plants more susceptible to pathogenic fungi 169 we are integrated into these webs where our nutrition oxygen and environmental temperature depend on global symbioses and microbes are at the base of each of them the anthropocene has put these relationships in peril as deborah bird rose 170 wrote relationships unravel mutualities falter dependence becomes a peril rather than a blessing and whole worlds of knowledge and practice diminish we are looking at worlds of loss that are much greater than the species extinction numbers suggest  the vectors of disease are following the sun and following airplane and sea lanes wastewater tourism and trade are circulating microorganisms around the world in a scale never before seen 171 moreover global warming is predicted to introduce new microbes from melting permafrost as well as bringing many insect-borne diseases dengue fever malaria lyme disease etc into new regions 69 here the vector spreads a pre-existing symbiont these will undoubtedly cause major public health concerns however another mechanism of disease can be predicted when organisms reach new lands they are capable of finding new symbiotic partners there is a new anthropogenic mingling going on as an example consider the red turpentine beetle dendroctonus valens a minor pest species that routinely infects pine trees that have been damaged by weather or fire like other bark beetles it is covered by fungi these fungi digest tree bark allowing the beetle to have a home and mate the fungus associated with d valens is usually leptographium procerum however this beetle was introduced from the pacific northwest of america to shanxi province of china in the 1980s in china it met other fungi which are much more potent at digesting wood than the american fungi 172173 these newly acquired fungi can degrade a major host defensive chemical 174 as a result over ten million pine trees have been killed by this fungus in china american officials are worried about a boomerang effect 175 the version of the beetle with its chinese fungi may have been re-imported into the usa however the public health services of the various states that might be affected claim they do not have the revenue to test whether this is so organisms are holobionts and public health must recognize the webs of symbioses uniting different species of organisms into a collective individual and uniting these different individual teams into complex ecosystems symbiosis takes two major formsmutualism cooperative and parasitism pathogenic the emergence of antibiotic drug resistance is the anthropocene effect on parasitic symbiosis just as anthropogenic changes in the environment have changed the populations of microbes involved in mutualistic interactions with humans so other anthropogenic changes have increased the prevalence and virulence of parasitic microbes until the early 20 century the leading cause of death world over was infectious disease crucial to turning this around were sanitation of water and the discovery of antibiotics since their discovery in the 1920s antibiotics have become the key tool against infections caused by microbes used across different forms of medicine by this definition microbes are understood as pathogenic and parasitic dangerous dirty and damaging the host that they reside in bodies are seen to be at war against harmful outside invaders and entire disciplines have been hinged on this notionimmunology clinical medicine and public health just to mention a few antibiotics have been the miracle weapon that have been used to tackle the looming threats of bacteria and have been said to have developed contemporary medicine to be the success story that it is today 24 antibiotics have magnificent power to alleviate symptoms and ensure sterile conditions they play central roles in basic surgeries cancer cesarean birth and in treating basic infections they are prescribed against infections by doctors nurses pharmacists dentists and traditional healers depending on the contexts all across the world there are very few communities left that have not incorporated the use of antibiotics into their basic methods of healing and research on those communities is tapping to their untouched microbiomes microbiome as an oasis 176177178179 literature about antibiotic prescription describes how requests for antibiotics reside on all sides of the patienthealth care practitioner dyad patients say that health care practitioners hand out antibiotics liberally and health care practitioners argue that patients demand them 180181182 in addition antibiotics are bought over the counter from pharmacies and informal markets 183 antibiotic use is a matter of concern as excessive or unregulated use of antibiotics is connected to the development of drug resistance and while there are few new antibiotics in the pipeline there is a need to ensure the utility of existing ones 184185 antibiotic use patterns offer insights into how central antibiotics are to public health as well as the specific practices and contexts that rely on the use of antibiotics understanding these dynamics also illuminates the effects of pathogenic thinking as well as the myriad ways in which reliance on antibiotics would need to change in order to make space for a holobiont practice of public health global statistics about antibiotic use show differences between countries that often follow the guidelines of health system efficiency and general national income since the 2000s antibiotic use in low- and middle-income countries has considerably increased while in high-income countries particularly with those that rely on public rather than private health care antibiotic use has been reduced india pakistan and china are among those countries where use has increased most 186 while data is unavailable in most african countries 187188 that said despite the reduction in the high-income countries antibiotic use in many european countries and the us is still considerably higher per capita than across many african nations 186188 the increase of antibiotic use in low-income countries underscores the utility of antibiotics within lagging health care systems andor in places where people cannot afford health care especially in countries where health care access is precarious due to lack of access poverty or poorly operating health systems antibiotics have come to play a central role in how short-term health goals are achieved for example work by denyer willis and chandler 189 shows how antibiotics function as a quick fix for well-being this fix operates on multiple domains to ensure productivity of humans animals and crops hygiene in settings of minimized resources marked by lack of infrastructures and good health in landscapes scarred by political and economic violence in short antibiotic use has come to stand for development and well-being while use of antibiotics has played a crucial role in helping to increase life expectancy implementing invasive surgical procedures and stand in for health care systems where they are otherwise unavailable the use of antibiotics has accelerated embodied and ecological havoc a narrow characterization of microbes solely as parasitic and pathogenic enemies rather than as needed and helpful partners contributes to excessive use of antibiotics for humans and animals where microbes refuse to remain contained in bodies but shift their form by evolving resistance to antibiotics the heroic narrative of antibiotics is beginning to crumble as microbes push back  mass scale attempts to eradicate bacteria with antibiotics in humans and animals has led to increase of antimicrobial resistance amr making it a quintessential anthropocene problem indeed the mass scale of antibiotic production beginning in the 1940s quickly became infrastructural to the production of many other things at scale more health more meat more fruit more surgery less death more fertility in everything from in vitro embryos cultured in antibiotics to fish farming the scale of production is also the scale of resistance 24 the higher-than-expected levels of amr put western medicine in its current formwhere antibiotics play central rolesat risk with antimicrobial resistance global health literature continues to frame microbes as a threat now an incurable threat the most comprehensive report about amr and its future impacts the so-called oneill report commissioned by the uk government and the wellcome trust indicated that 7 million people will die due to complications associated with amr 190 this report has evoked a flurry of research efforts systemic interventions stewardship programmes and funding to tackle amr health risks for humans have been extensively documented with resistance spreading owing to both excessive use of antibiotics for human consumption and the use of antibiotics as part of animal feeding and in husbandry a key route by which amr spreads is via environmental bacteria that serve as vectors for the resistant geneslateral gene transferwhich is seen to become a problem when otherwise benign environmental bacteria contribute to the spread of resistance in pathogens 24191192 robinson et al state that this otherwise natural quality of environmental bacteria is exacerbated for example by the influx of antibiotic residues from human and animal faeces and run-offs from hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturing 193194 a global comparison of socio-economic determinants correlated with amr prevalence offers insights into the crucial roles that developmental and social inequalities play in anthropocene ecology factors predicting high amr rates are not antibiotic consumption but rather differential access to sanitation education and public investment in health care services as well as the level of corruption in society 195 the focus therefore cannot be simply on clinical bodies but must broaden to encompass environments including animals and infrastructures on the one hand and social practices and power on the other we posit that the notion of plantationocene captures this complexity that transcends the humanmore-than-human bodily boundary while taking power structures into consideration as defined above the plantationocene constitutes the coercive labor structures and extractive and hierarchical management of planetary resources to feed an ever-growing population 1718 the plantationocene acts here both an analytical and a descriptive term analytically plantationocene points to transnational circulations of goods domination and dominion of people over other people and people over nature hegemonic colonial legacies systematisation of farming haraway et al 196 point to the historical origins of the term and how relocations of the substances of living and dying around the earth as a necessary prerequisite to their extraction the logic of the plantation system makes it more efficient to destroy the local labor and import labor from elsewhere the plantation system is built on the relocation and control of any generative unit whether plant animal microbe or person 196  indeed plantations were the result of one of the most catastrophic public health events in world historythe columbia exchange a major part of this exchange resulted in the elimination of a majority perhaps 90 of indigenous american people by the microbesrubeola variola influenza rubulavirus rickettsia salmonella and bordetellabrought across the atlantic ocean by the european settlers the great migration of people and crops took place to bring workers to areas whose native populations had perished especially in the caribbean where the death rate of indigenous people was probably close to 99 197198199 intensive labour was needed to produce crops in north and south america and the workers at plantations were slaves shipped from west and central africanow sites that have the least infrastructure to surveil and control amr but have the most troubling evidence of amr prevalence 187200 these were also sites of resource extraction as well as subjected to structural adjustments in the 80s by the world trade organisation to privatize health care and social welfare resulting in poor health care and sanitation infrastructures and overall poverty that now are known to be key factors for the development of amr  the industrial agriculture of the plantationocene may also contribute to the spread of drug resistant microbes the recent increase in resistant fungicides such as candida auris that has caused tremendous concern among health practitioners and ecologists alike is a resistant yeast that has contaminated entire hospitals 201202 its spread has environmental vectorsresistance has developed in connection to the use of fungicides in monocropping 203 environmental and agricultural practices are thus directly connected to public health concerns amr with plantationocene underscores that public health needs to re-think its relationships with bacteria and antibioticsit cannot bracket out environmental extraction socio-economic injustices and the on-going need for health systems strengthening as factors that create the conditions for why excessive antibiotics are used that lead to antimicrobial resistance amr by this definition is not an exemplary threat by microbes as is framed in global public health but should be seen as a result of the modernist eradication approach towards microbes that requires rethinking health is a negotiation between microbes and hosts holobiont public health would do well to recognize both the parasitic and the mutualistic branches of symbiosis 204 it would also recognize the two major changes in our scientific knowledge of microbial evolution that have occurred in this century 1 organisms are holobionts composed of several species wherein microbes help maintain healthy physiology and resilience and 2 bacteria can pass genes through horizontal genetic transmission thereby facilitating the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance through numerous bacterial species symbionts must be seen as partners and respected as agents with their own agendas three recent examples of holobiont management for public health should be mentioned in this regard the first concerns the public health against mosquito-transmitted diseases such as dengue zika and chikungunya by using wolbachia bacterium to infect aedes egypti mosquitos wolbachia infects numerous insects but not these species of mosquitos however wolbachia can become a symbiont in these insects preventing the acquisition or replication of viruses inside their cells scientists have been able to get wolbachia to grow inside aedes cells and wolbachia-infected mosquitoes have been released into the wild where this has happened there has been significant drops up to 76 in reported cases of the vector-transmitted diseases 204205206 the second holobiont-informed type of public health involves seeking alternatives to antibiotics and partnering with microbes capable of keeping pathogens in check if symbionts help protect hosts from pathogenic bacterial infections then symbiotic microbes would be a good place to start looking for new antibiotics this is especially true of antibiotics for gram-negative bacteria the antibiotics currently in use were developed in the 1960s and several bacterial species have successfully been evolving resistance to them certain nematode worms are susceptible to the same types of gram-negative bacteria as humans so imai and colleagues 207 sought out the antibiotics made by the symbiotic strains of bacteria found in the nematode guts by screening chemicals made by these symbionts they have isolated darobactin a modified and crosslinked 7-amino acid peptide this antibiotic acts by disrupting the cell envelope of the gram-positive pathogens and is largely non-effective in destroying human gut commensals the experiments further show that this new antibiotic is effective at protecting infected mice given potentially lethal infections of gram-negative bacteria the third approach recognizes the importance of microbes to the life cycles of parasites and seeks to kill the parasite by killing its symbionts this approach has worked in eliminating schistosoma mansoni a filariasis worm that has become resistant to the drugs traditionally used to kill these parasites a newer treatment strategy has been to use antibiotics such as doxycyline against its symbiotic bacteria 208209 once the antibiotic destroys the symbiont the worms cells undergo apoptosis and the worms die 210 a similar strategy is being considered to eradicate the plague locusts that are now devastating east africa here a locust-specific fungus might be sprayed on the juvenile locusts as they develop their wings this fungus would grow inside the maturing insect and consume it from within 211 we need to be in symbiosis with bacteria on a social as well as on a corporal level like the body we need to be able to distinguish mutualistic from pathogenic microbes and treat them differently humanity has been given notice a paper by the alliance of world scientists 212 puts humanity on notice that the impact of climate change will depend heavily on the responses of microorganisms which are essential for achieving an environmentally sustainable future public health must take note that we humans are never independent of nature and therefore must be expanded to preserve environmental health as well as human and animal health resilience to perturbations is increased by plasticity and the inputs of symbiotic microbes each human is a biome of many ecosystems asthma allergies and amrs must not be considered the revenge of nature rather they are expected consequences of lower resilience to perturbations public health must see the life on this planet as biology now sees itas a rich mixture of cooperative and antagonistic interactions

preexisting trauma and stress are triggered during disasters so there will also be a corresponding rise in harmful alcohol and substance abuse macauley 2020 families faced with the stressors associated with covid19 may see violence occurring for the first time these factors all culminate in indigenous women and children affected by violence no longer being able to enact the strategies they could take to keep themselves and their children safe it will also be very difficult to seek help outside of their homes the covid19 crisis has seen unprecedented disruption to cultural practices and the normal relational and collective practices of indigenous peoples this is detrimental as it has been empirically proven that the cultural determinants of health have an overwhelmingly positive

transparency among indigenous groups related to previous pandemics and other health outcomes is lacking further perpetuating the lack of indigenous voice and increasing the health disparity gap babyar 2019 failure to recognise the differences in morbidity and mortality among indigenous peoples contributes to inequities there is not only a lack of information sharing but the delay in funding to support nations and the growing jurisdictional disputes over who will provide these services has once again been intensified in the response to covid pandemic planning if ever there was a time to acknowledge the need to collect accurate ethnicity data and disseminate adequate resources to address health disparities among indigenous people globally now is that time the needs of indigenous peoples must be made visible and not subsumed instead in generalised universal response strategies in this editorial we have drawn attention to the existing health and social justice inequities stemming from colonisation we have discussed the devastating effects pandemics have on our health and capacity to practice culture which is our medicine we have asked the reader to consider the desperate situation our peoples face but recognise the indigenousled solutions that are being enacted we demand our governments recognise that the harm and hurt and drastically increased morbidity and mortality in our communities during this pandemic are their legacies of failing to address historical and ongoing inequities the cultural determinants of health must be recognised as the remedy and be built into health policy practice and research going forward data need to meticulously document the damage naming us by our countries our communities our clans and our tribes so that the next time disease sweeps our planet we know our weaknesses we know our strengths and if more informed and empowered we will prevail against the next neo colonial wave  learning from history do not flatten the

from time immemorial infectious diseases have ravaged mankind only 100 years ago tb was still one of the top three leading causes of death in the usa 1 fortunately science advanced dramatically during the 20th century changing the ways in which our society treats infectious diseases current preventative vaccines and drugs are catered to treat long-lasting andor chronic infections or infectious diseases that recur annually or on a regular basis such as hiv tb hepatitis c influenza and so on however the major viral disease outbreaks that have plagued society over the past two decades do not follow this pattern in fact they have shown that the scientific community is not adequately prepared to offer or rapidly develop effective treatments when an outbreak happens 2 as a consequence all countries have to adopt nontherapeutics measures to slow the progression of the epidemic and flatten the curve to limit the burden of the disease on the healthcare system and allow better support to severely ill patients 3 a recent study in the new england journal of medicine
4 estimated that the yearly cost of a pandemic could amount to us60 billion dollars being spent worldwide on treatment control and prevention efforts as seen in the current outbreak of the sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this cost might be even higher because of restrictions on international trade and travel closing of businesses prohibition of large gatherings of people and other social-distancing strategies 5 although these measures do help curb the spread of the disease they have potentially devastating consequences it was initially predicted that a large volume of cases over a short period of time would result in the usa having barely enough masks to last even 2 weeks into the pandemic 6 there might also be other social and political ramifications from a quick glance at the google trends data 7 one can see that on super tuesday in the usa in 2020 the popularity of google searches for coronavirus was nearly three times that for super tuesday also because of prohibitions on gatherings of more than 2550 people in many cities and states people might have stayed away from the polls out of fear of contracting the virus and might continue to do so in the future possibly influencing the outcome of the 2020 us election 8 9 the democratization of access to the internet has also facilitated the access of the general public to information through mediums such as major media outlets and even formal and informal data analytics 10 11 for instance johns hopkins university hosts a popular regularly updated map of the reported cases of covid-19 around the world 12 using data from the chinese centers for disease control and who situation reports the new mantra flatten the curve is also representative of the newfound exposure of the public to data science and analysis in response to the covid-19 pandemic 13 likewise the rapid growth of global communications systems has allowed media government and scientists alike to quickly access and share a large amount of data this real-time sharing of information has been unprecedented although it permits governments to respond rapidly to epidemics through the dissemination of prevention and control methods it can also facilitate public panic by stoking existing fears about an epidemic 14 15 this rapid exchange of information applies to scientific data and publications as well with increased access to the internet the response of the scientific community has been enriched we have observed an increasing number of articles being published for successive outbreaks in both peer-reviewed journals and various arxiv see glossary preprint servers over the past 20 years over the past few months both peer-reviewed journals 16 17 and arxiv preprint 18 19 servers have been overpopulated with reports on known drugs or clinical candidates with possible anti-sars-cov-2 activity identified by computational approaches however despite many experimental and clinical studies no effective drugs or treatments have emerged to treat the previous six epidemics of bird flu sars swine flu mers ebola and zika as well as thus far covid-19 this observation begs the question of whether the rapidity and bulk of immediate responses to epidemics are sufficient to enable the development of effective treatments in this study we investigated historical data for seven major disease outbreaks of the past two decades bird flu h5n1 sars swine flu h1n1 mers ebola fever zika fever and covid-19 we assessed the response of the scientific community to these outbreaks over time in addition to how effective that response was in producing vaccines and small-molecule antiviral drugs to this end we analyzed the number of publications clinical trials funding levels and google trends data from the start of these epidemics until the present day we observed that there has been little success in combatting outbreaks effectively while they were occurring let alone after they have passed by contrast we also observed that these trends were different for hivaids which has received continuous and uninterrupted attention from researchers around the world and for which multiple targeted therapies have indeed emerged we expect this analysis to provide insights as to how to better mobilize both federal agencies and scientists to find treatments for covid-19 as well as other future outbreaks we evaluated the number of publications in both peer-reviewed journals and arxiv preprint servers and the number of clinical trials performed over the course of the epidemic to estimate the engagement and success of the scientific community in response to the seven major outbreaks of the past two decades bird flu sars swine flu mers ebola zika and covid-19 these metrics indicate the velocity with which the scientific community mobilizes to seek solutions to remedy an outbreak as well as how this velocity correlates with other metrics such as the number of confirmed cases and the number of people who have died from the disease in addition we evaluated the number of unique molecules andor treatments being tested in clinical trials because many were replicates of each other first we looked at the response of the scientific community on weekly timescale figure 1 figure 2
 we examined the number of clinical trials fig 1 and publications fig 2 over the first 24 weeks of each outbreak with week 0 corresponding to the time point when the federal authorities or the who first started reporting the data on the epidemic for covid-19 december 31 2019 is considered the start date on this standardized timescale the number of clinical trials launched for covid-19 greatly outnumbered that of any of the previous epidemics the growth rate of publications on covid-19 was also the highest one can also see that for more recent epidemics such as ebola and zika more clinical trials were launched during the first 24 weeks of the epidemic than had been the case for previous epidemics such as bird flu and mers fig 1 the only exception to this general observation was swine flu which is an anomaly because h1n1 flu strains had been researched extensively before the start of the outbreak in 2009 as a result of the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and other past h1n1 epidemics 20 21 this is in stark contrast to ebola virus and zika virus which had caused smaller-scale outbreaks previously yet had little to no information available on how to treat them 22 23 equally valuable is to compare the rate of response of the scientific community to the rate of epidemic growth as a case study we chose to compare data on sars to that of sars-cov-2 covid-19 interestingly the number of total publications for sars over time roughly followed the same trend as the number of cases with an offset by a short time period of less than a month fig 3
 likewise rapid spikes in the number of cases correspond to slightly offset spikes in the number of publications on sars by around the same period 16 days in comparison to sars covid-19 does not show clear spikes in the number of publications or clinical trials corresponding to peaks and dips in the number of new cases or deaths fig 4
 instead the trends in the number of publications and clinical trials appear to follow the trends in the number of cases andor deaths indeed there is a correlation r  098 between the rate at which the virus spreads throughout the population and intensity of research on covid-19 as measured by the number of publications although looking for causality in these relationships is non-sensical the number of new peer-reviewed publications appears to follow roughly the same logarithmic curve as the number of new cases recorded for covid-19 whereas the rate of new publications in nonpeer-reviewed arxiv preprints appears to exceed even that of new covid-19 cases fig 4 the number of covid-19 preprints in arxiv servers surpassed the number of covid-19 papers in peer-reviewed journals in early march highlighting the rise of online journals and preprint servers as well as reflecting the shrinking period of time between the original observations and respective publications this is also in direct contrast to sars more papers were published at a faster rate during this pandemic than in the sars epidemic beginning in 2003 for example eight peer-reviewed papers on covid-19 had been published by the time there were 555 cases of the disease january 22 2020 whereas sars only had one paper published by the time there were 1804 total cases april 3 2003 however it is necessary to contextualize these observations in terms of the scientific output not just by the rate of response in this regard we observed that the large number of studies conducted on sars notwithstanding no us food and drug administration fda-approved drug or vaccine to treat the disease has been developed in the 17-year period since the outbreak began in 2003 it is of particular interest to look at the evolution of both the number of publications and the amount of research funding from the beginning of each outbreak to-date fig 5
 this analysis shows perhaps not unexpectedly that following the spike of the research interest in the initial phases of each epidemic progressively fewer research papers were published for previous outbreaks after they ended this trend probably reflects the lack of special funding for such research and consequently the lack of successful therapeutic development against the respective diseases indeed fluctuations in research funding for each epidemic appear to follow the same spike-like trend as research publications fig 5 this lack of research interest andor funding outside of periods when these outbreaks are occurring is probably partially responsible for the current situation no approved anticoronaviral medications exist and as such the world is frantically looking to repurpose existing drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which is premature and according to at least some reports could be potentially harmful to patients 24 25 in addition to quantifying the response of the scientific community to these epidemics we also collected google trends data on the principal search terms representing each of these diseases google trends data do not represent the number of google searches during a given time period but rather anonymized aggregated and normalized information about the relative proportion of searches on google for a given search term region and time period 7 this normalization protects against places with larger populations being weighted more heavily a value of 100 corresponds to the maximum search interest in a topic for the given time and location whereas a value of 50 corresponds to the search term being half as popular as it was at its peak google trends as a whole serves as a fairly representative data source for the public perception of different news topics indicating how interested people appear to be in a given topic over a specific period of time with rapid peaks in search interest indicating a sudden increase in interest in a topic first we gathered and standardized google trends data for each of the epidemics based on their start dates and relative time periods no google trends data are available before january 2004 thus some timepoints for bird flu and sars were not available when observing the first 30 months of the outbreaks the response of the public to the epidemic appeared to peak during the first 8 months fig 6
 for diseases that had been previously studied such as swine flu and ebola hemorrhagic fever there was already some search interest before the start date of the epidemic and thus the relative search interest in these diseases was higher during the earlier months of the epidemic these outbreaks were shorter lived than some of the other diseases such as mers infection continues today although cases peaked in early 2014 26 the relative search interest in which peaked an anomalous 20 months into the outbreak covid-19 is interesting in that although representing a novel virus the number of relative searches peaked relatively close to those for all the previously studied illnesses mentioned earlier and is following an increasing exponential trend fig 6 the number of cases of covid-19 worldwide is increasing in a nearly exponential fashion with more people infected worldwide than in any of these previous epidemics besides h1n1 swine flu additionally for all diseases previously mentioned their respective search interests peaked during the years when the epidemic was most severe fig 6 so we should expect that the search interest for covid-19 will steadily decrease when the pandemic begins to die down however as noted earlier although we should expect such evolution of the general public interest research into understanding this disease and developing powerful therapeutics should continue unabated before the outbreak of sars-cov-2 previous studies had forecasted the re-emergence of a sars-like betacoronavirus
27 the potential for sustained transmission of sars-cov-2 or for the emergence of another novel betacoronavirus is alarming but has not been sufficient previously to garner any substantial drug discovery or vaccine efforts these transmission dynamics and this potential for wide-scale future pandemics makes covid-19 distinct from the six previous epidemics examined earlier thus the response to the hiv pandemic which began in 1981 is also a worthwhile comparison to the current covid-19 response the change in the number of cases clinical trials and publications for hiv is shown in fig 7
 with marked time points delineating when novel anti-hiv drugs were approved by the fda it is generally agreed that hiv can now be managed thanks to the powerful pharmacotherapies developed since the pandemic began during the early 1980s this success is predicated on the significant and constant increase in federal funding for hiv over the course of the epidemic rising from just a few hundred thousand dollars in financial year fy 1982 to more than us348 billion in fy 2019 28 this support has allowed the research community to continue to study the disease accounting for an average of 6000 papers published per year over the past 5 years as annotated in pubmed box 1

trials and approved for use in patients in 1987 6 years after the pandemic began 29 azt was originally synthesized for use as an anticancer agent 29 and was then repurposed against hiv given the toxicity of azt and the rapid evolution of drug resistance 30 new compounds targeting various aspects of viral replication were eventually designed encompassing different classes of antiretroviral drug such as non-nucleosidenucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors protease inhibitors integrase inhibitors and fusion inhibitors 30 currently combinations of these different classes of antiretroviral drug are used in what is known as antiretroviral therapy art to prevent the development of drug resistance to date 22 distinct medications and 22 combination therapies have been approved by the fda most during the early 2000s 30 the first nonrepurposed drugs approved by the fda were lamivudine a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and saquinavir a protease inhibitor both approved in 1995 nearly 15 years after the start of the pandemic 31 later during the pandemic new drugs were developed in a streamlined process where lead compounds active against hiv in vitro were structurally modified to improve their efficacy and lower their cytotoxicity 32 high-throughput screening hts campaigns have also proven useful in identifying existing compounds with promise against hiv 33 34 35 hiv serves as a prime example of how scientists in academia government and industry can combine efforts to combat a common threat even though it took 5 years to name the virus that caused the disease and 6 years to approve the first medication cumulative scientific efforts ultimately paid off in the form of a diversity of treatment regimens available and a major improvement in life expectancy in most parts of the world 36 although sars-cov-2 might continue to circulate in humans for some time it differs from hiv in that it has an airborne transmission route and a lower mutation rate because of polymerase proofreading abilities 27 37 the latter is especially important to consider when developing therapies vaccines and antiviral medications a lower mutation rate means that there is a higher probability of new treatments working for lengthier periods of time it is also important to consider whether an infection is chronic or if recovered individuals can become sick again examples being hiv and influenza respectively epidemics last longer or can recur if the pathogen at hand meets these criteria thus allowing more time for drug discovery to have a tangible output such as art for hiv and annual vaccines for influenza infection with sars-cov-2 is not known to be chronic and neither is it known definitively whether secondary infection can occur 38 but this or a similar virus is predicted to eventually re-emerge meaning that drugs developed and tested now will be useful for future epidemics 23 the sustained transmission of hiv within the human population coupled with its extraordinary evolutionary rate has provided a lasting incentive for pharmaceutical companies to continue identifying new antiviral medications to treat hiv 30 similarly the expectation of another covid-19 pandemic motivates rapid drug discovery efforts now for sars-cov-2 there are multiple efforts to identify existing drugs that could be repurposed to combat sars-cov-2 39 additionally modern computational techniques such as quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar modeling molecular docking and machine-learning approaches are being used now in covid-19 drug discovery efforts 17 40 41 it should be expected that achieving success in developing covid-19 therapies and preparing for future epidemics will require a substantial lasting and well-funded research effort the sheer amount of resources at our disposal and the velocity of response of the scientific community so far compared with the successful response to hiv suggests that the development of drugs to treat covid-19 in the coming years is attainable in recent years there has been a noticeable uptick in the response of the scientific community to outbreaks we have observed that the ebola 20142016 and zika 20152016 outbreaks had more publications and clinical trials performed in a shorter time period than for previous outbreaks figure 1 figure 2 however the response of the scientific community to the covid-19 outbreak represents the most rapid response yet with an unprecedented number of clinical trials and publications both in peer-reviewed journals and preprint servers however clinical and research efforts in response to past epidemics have failed to yield therapies during or after epidemic period traditionally it has taken years for effective drugs and vaccines to be developed and approved much past the point at which they could be clinically useful andor could be tested in clinical trials the speed of the response of the scientific community to major outbreaks has increased over the past two decades matching the increasing accessibility of information via the internet but the outcome of this response has not changed despite the presence of various intergovernmental agencies such as the who and the united nations individual nations have traditionally responded to large-scale epidemics in a disjointed fashion and they desperately lack a pre-established adequate continuous and centralized effort even within their own countries let alone internationally 23 42 in the usa in particular initial measures to predict or surveil disease outbreaks have been alarmingly either defunded or downsized over this same period in which the output of publications and clinical trials has increased 43 44 as seen in the data presented in this study the viruses that had already been studied before their respective epidemics garnered more publications and clinical trials in a shorter period of time than those that were understudied previously zika virus and ebola virus had both been discovered long before they caused significant morbidity and mortality around the world yet they were not studied extensively and thus the correlated response of the scientific community was inefficient 23 had the scientific community had a consistent stream of funding to conduct research on coronaviruses that have hit humankind twice before the current pandemic there might have been the prospect of pharmacotherapy on the near horizon 23 when preparing for possible future epidemics it is better to be safe than sorry for example the us government has a stockpile of tecovirimat a drug used to treat smallpox in the event of an act of bioterrorism 45 this drug was developed solely to prevent a future outbreak given that smallpox was eradicated decades ago because of global vaccination efforts similar prescient efforts are underway to prevent the next pandemic such as the rapidly emerging antiviral drug discovery initiative readdi this initiative is aiming to create and stockpile a novel broad-spectrum antiviral drug in preparation for the next pandemic 46 the history of hiv and aids shows clearly that steady interest and robust investment in the study of the disease have yielded the desired fruits although the speed of response to covid-19 by both the research community and the public is unprecedented the world needs to pay more attention to infectious diseases before they have the opportunity to cause lasting economic social and physical damage to people around the globe 47 we hope that the data and their analyses presented in this article will stimulate both the funding agencies governmental private etc and the scientific community to maintain their interest in searching for an efficient treatment for covid-19 given the comparison with previous large-scale epidemics given the unprecedented increase in clinical trials and publications the growing public interest in the disease and the looming threat of a future outbreak it is unlikely that these trends will die down in the coming months and years vaccine development for covid-19 is occurring at an unprecedented pace on average vaccine development takes 10 years but there is a hope to have a vaccine available for emergency use by early 2021 48 however global research efforts need to become more focused if we are to combat this pandemic effectively we believe that the ongoing research and clinical trials should be a product of international and intergovernmental collaboration driven by knowledge discovery and artificial intelligence approaches as applied to data from both past and present epidemics finally substantial funding on the part of federal and state agencies along with private foundations is necessary to support massive research efforts to find a cure or a vaccine more quickly than in the past and to stay prepared for future outbreaks of viral diseases it is not enough to say that there are more resources available at our disposal now than ever it is a matter of using these resources effectively the historical response to hiv sets a precedent for success in the fight against emerging infectious diseases we shall use this historical precedent and past failings as a guide for the current battle against covid-19 and all future battles against other imminent outbreaks  go eat a bat

outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic has changed our lives in unprecedented ways in the face of the projected catastrophic consequences many countries have enacted social distancing measures in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus under these conditions the web has become an indispensable medium for information acquisition communication and entertainment at the same time unfortunately the web is being exploited for the dissemination of potentially harmful and disturbing content such as the spread of conspiracy theories and hateful speech towards specific ethnic groups in particular towards chinese people since covid-19 is believed to have originated from china in this paper we make a first attempt to study the emergence of sinophobic behavior on the web during the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic we collect two large-scale datasets from twitter and 4chans politically incorrect board pol over a time period of approximately five months and analyze them to investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with regard to the dissemination of sinophobic content we find that covid-19 indeed drives the rise of sinophobia on the web and that the dissemination of sinophobic content is a cross-platform phenomenon it exists on fringe web communities like pol and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like twitter also using word embeddings over time we characterize the evolution and emergence of new sinophobic slurs on both twitter and pol finally we find interesting differences in the context in which words related to chinese people are used on the web before and after the covid-19 outbreak on twitter we observe a shift towards blaming china for the situation while on pol we find a shift towards using more and new sinophobic slurs  the coronavirus disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the largest pandemic event of the information age sars-cov-2 is thought to have originated in china with the presumed ground zero centered around a wet market in the city of wuhan in the hubei province 50  in a few months sars-cov-2 has spread allegedly from a bat or pangolin to essentially every country in the world resulting in over 1m cases of covid-19 and 50k deaths as of april 2 2020 45  humanity has taken unprecedented steps to mitigating the spread of sars-cov-2 enacting social distancing measures that go against our very nature while the repercussions of social distancing measures are yet to be fully understood one thing is certain the web has not only proven essential to the approximately normal continuation of daily life but also as a tool by which to ease the pain of isolation unfortunately just like the spread of covid-19 was accelerated in part by international travel enabled by modern technology the connected nature of the web has enabled the spread of misinformation 44  conspiracy theories 28  and racist rhetoric 30  considering societys recent struggles with online racism often leading to violence and the politically charged environment coinciding with sars-cov-2s emergence there is every reason to believe that a wave of sinophobia is not just coming but already upon us in this paper we present an analysis of how online sinophobia has emerged and evolved as the covid-19 crisis has unfolded to do this we collect and analyze two large-scale datasets obtained from twitter and 4chans politically incorrect board pol using temporal analysis word embeddings and graph analysis we shed light on the prevalence of sinophobic behavior on these communities how this prevalence changes over time as the covid-19 pandemic unfolds and more importantly we investigate whether there are substantial differences in discussions related to chinese people by comparing the behavior pre-and post-covid-19 crisis main findings among others we make the following findings 1 we find a rise in discussions related to china and chinese people on twitter and 4chans pol after the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic at the same time we observe a rise in the use of specific sinophobic slurs primarily on pol and to a lesser extent on twitter also by comparing our findings to real-world events we find that the increase in these discussions and sinophobic slurs coincides with real-world events related to the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic 2 using word embeddings we looked into the context of words used in discussions referencing chinese people finding that various racial slurs are used in these contexts on both twitter and pol this indicates that sinophobic behavior is a cross-platform phenomenon existing in both fringe web communities like pol and mainstream ones like twitter 3 using word embeddings over time we discover new emerging slurs and terms related to sinophobic behavior as well as the covid-19 pandemic for instance on pol we observe the emergence of the term kungflu after january 2020 while on twitter we observe the emergence of the term asshoe which aims to make fun of the accent of chinese people speaking english 4 by comparing our dataset pre-and post-covid-19 outbreak we observe shifts in the content posted by users on twitter and pol on twitter we observe a shift towards blaming china and chinese people about the outbreak while on pol we observe a shift towards using more and new sinophobic slurs disclaimer note that content posted on the web communities we study is likely to be considered as highly offensive or racist throughout the rest of this paper we do not censor any language thus we warn the readers that content presented is likely to be offensive and upsetting due to its incredible impact to everybodys life in early 2020 the covid-19 pandemic has already attracted the attention of researchers in particular a number of papers studied how users on social media discussed this emergency chen et al 10 release a dataset of 50m tweets related to the pandemic cinelli et al 12  singh et al 41  and kouzy et al 31 studied misinformation narratives about covid-19 on twitter lopez et al 32 analyzed a multi-language twitter dataset to understand how people in different countries reacted to policies related to covid-19 a number of papers studied racist activity on social networks keum and miller 29 argued that racism on the internet is pervasive and that users are likely to encounter it zimmerman et al 56 focused on the influence that the anonymity brought by the internet has on the likelihood for people to take part in online aggression relia et al 39 found that racist online activity correlates with hate crimes in other words users located in areas with higher occurrence of hate crimes are more likely to engage in racism on social media yang and counts 53 studied how users who experienced racism on reddit self-narrate their experience they characterize the different types of racism experienced by users with different demographics and show that commiseration is the most valued form of social support zannettou et al 55 present a quantitative approach to understand racism targeting jewish people online as part of their analysis they present a method to quantify the evolution of racist language based on word embeddings similar to the technique presented in this paper hasanuzzaman et al 22 investigated how demographic traits of twitter users can act as a predictor of racist activity by modeling demographic traits as vec-tor embeddings they found that male and younger users under 35 are more likely to engage in racism on twitter other work performed quantitative studies to characterize hateful users on social media analyzing their language and their sentiment 9 40  in particular it focused on discrimination and hate directed against women for example as part of the pizzagate conspiracy 8 11  remarks to the best of our knowledge ours is the first datadriven study on the evolution of racist rhetoric against chinese people and people of asian descent in light of the covid-19 pandemic to study the extent and evolution of sinophobic behavior on the web we collect and analyze two large-scale datasets from twitter and 4chans politically incorrect board pol twitter twitter is a popular mainstream microblog used by millions of users for disseminating information to obtain data from twitter we leverage the streaming api 1  which provides a 1 random sample of all tweets made available on the platform we collect tweets posted between november 1 2019 and march 22 2020 and then we filter only the ones posted in english ultimately collecting 222212841 tweets 4chans pol 4chan is an imageboard that allows the anonymous posting of information the imageboard is divided into several sub-communities called boards each board has its own topic of interest and moderation policy in this work we focus on the politically incorrect board pol simply because it is the main board for the discussion of world events to collect data we use the data collection approach from hine et al 23  to collect all posts made on pol between november 1 2019 and march 22 2020 overall we collect 16808191 posts remarks we elect to focus on these two specific web communities as we believe that they are representative examples of both mainstream and fringe web communities that is twitter is a popular mainstream community that is used by hundreds of millions of users around the globe while 4chans pol is a notorious fringe web community that is known for the dissemination of hateful or weaponized information 23  we start our analysis by studying the temporal dynamics of words related to china and chinese on 4chans pol and twitter also we investigate the prevalence of several racial slurs targeted towards chinese and asian people figure 1 shows the number of occurrences of china and chinese and the proportion of posts containing these two words on 4chans pol on a daily base we also annotate with vertical lines real-world events related to the covid-19 pandemic see table 1 for more details we first observe a sudden increase for both words around january 23 2020 the day the chinese government officially locked down the city of wuhan marking the first large-scale effort in china to combat covid-19 2 after the wuhan lockdown the popularity of china and chinese declines until the latter part of february right around the time that covid-19 cases started to appear en masse in europe on february 24 2020 annotation 4 in the figure 11 municipalities in lombardy italy were put on lock-down in an attempt to slow the explosion of community spread cases and we start to see the use of china and chinese slightly rise again this rate increases dramatically around march 9 2020 annotation 5 which is when the italian government extended the lock-down to the entirety of italy the second peak comes around march 16 2020 when donald trump referred covid-19 as chinese virus in a tweet interestingly after this event we observe a peak in activity where around 10 of all posts made on pol are related to china see figure 1  on twitter see figure 2  we see the same high level trend discussion about china and chinese has a large up tick when wuhan is locked down and then declines until covid-19 hits europe there is one important difference however the amount of relative discussion on twitter during the first peak is much lower than the level of discussion once europe comes into play this may be due to the fact that discussion on twitter is more geographically distributed or that 4chans pol is more easily inflamed by conspiracies and racism-related posts social distance may work as one factor in illustrating the gap between two peaks referring to the perception of others 48 6 1 14  this perception can be elevated by a familiarity of cultural nationality ethics education occupation etc geographically intimacy as well as close cultural background leads to higher attention on covid-19 outbreak in europe than the lock-down in wuhan besides china and chinese we also analyze the temporal dynamics of sinophobic racial slurs on 4chans pol and twitter we pick a set of 8 sinophobic slurs including chink bugland chankoro chinazi gook insectoid bugmen and chingchong 3 some of them are well-known racial slurs towards chinese and asian people 51  such as chink chingchong and gook others eg bugland are based on preliminary results where we used word embeddings to discover other racial slurs see section 5 for more details the results are depicted in figure 3 and 4 for pol and twitter respectively for pol we observe a general trend that is similar with the trend observed before for the mentions of china and chinese see figure 1  that is we observe two main peaks of activity around january 23 and march 16 2020 for most of the slurs in particular it is worrisome that the use of most slurs keeps increasing after the event where donald trump referred to covid-19 as chinese virus by looking at some posts on pol posted after march 16 2020 we find several worrisome examples of hateful rhetoric that call for violence eg i really hope the world gets together to exterminate every last chink on this planet and seconded every chink needs to exterminated the yellow jew needs to be erased from this world when looking at the popularity of these terms we find that chink is the most popular sinophobic slur on pol with an order of magnitude more posts compared to other slurs like gook and chingchong on twitter see figure 4  we observe a rise of sinophobic slurs during december 2019 especially for chink by manually examining the peak we find that this happens because of a tweet that went viral including the slur chink 4 apart from this outlier we observe an increase in the use of sinophobic slurs after january 23 again the increase in the use of these slurs is lower than the one observed on pol cf figure 3 and 4 by the end of our dataset we observe a substantial increase in the use of the slur chingchong looking at some examples of tweets including this specific term we find several hateful comments eg all because ching chong had to chow a fucking frog raw for lunch coronavirussafety and fuck youd just do to me you little shit ill break your fucking neck fucking ching chong corona viru finally to better visualize the rise of sinophobic slurs we show the number of posts including any of the eight identified slurs posted after january 1 2020 in figure 5  overall we observe a rise in sinophobic slurs mainly on pol and to a lesser extent on twitter despite this fact we observe a substantial increase on twitter on march 16 2020 in a nutshell these findings indicate that sinophobic behavior is on the rise and that it is a cross-platform phenomenon a common theme among racist ideology is that of an invading virus history is rife with examples of diseases being attributed to specific races and nationalities and there is no reason to believe that covid-19 would buck this trend the first identified covid-19 cases did originate in china however the world today is much more diverse and connected than it was in the 15th century when italians dubbed syphilis the french disease figure 1 and 2 make it quite clear that 4chan and twitter are heavily discussing china in relation to covid-19 and that this discussion accelerated rapidly once the western world became affected the upswing is potentially related to the scapegoating phenomenon 47 the first cases originated in china and the chinese government was the first to take active and serious measures to combat its spread prompting a reasonable degree of discussion when these measures were ineffective in preventing the spread to the western world however chinas existing association with covid-19 in particular chinas failure to prevent its spread make it a just scapegoat 2 in the face of a looming pandemic that said we do see meaningful differences in the use of slurs on pol and twitter pols use of slurs tracks with the use of china and chinese to a worrying degree but this is much less pronounced on twitter this is not entirely unsurprising considering that pol is well known to be a locus of racist ideology however it is worthwhile discussing some of the theory around why it tracks so well the clearly racist reaction fits the notion of defensive denial which is a common strategy for coping with stress 3 17 24 27 42  essentially the early stages of covid-19 were exclusively a chinese problem superior western society had nothing to worry about even though experts were warning of a pandemic breakout even before wuhan was locked down this conforms with the scapegoating theory of clinical psychology in which members of a group project unwanted self aspects onto another person or group then attack the scapegoat believing that this is not me 13 18 38  political scientists have argued that scapegoating is a major driver for racism in a number of settings 15 37  to analyze the content more specifically the context of the use of specific words we train multiple word2vec models 33 for each web community in a nutshell these models map words into a high-dimensional vector space so that words that are used in a similar way are close to each other to do this we leverage the skip-gram model which is a shallow neural network aiming to predict the context of a specific word in this work we train three groups of word2vec models for each of twitter and pol 1 one word2vec model w a  trained on all posts made during the period between october 28 2019 and march 22 2020 we denote the period by t  this model allows us to study the use of words for the entire duration of our study 2 one distinct word2vec model for each week between october 28 2019 and march 22 2020 denoted by w ti  i  t i is the ith week in t  these models allow us to study changes in the use of words over time 3 one word2vec model trained on historical data for all posts shared between july 1 2016 and november 1 2019 w c  this model acts as a baseline and allows us to investigate the emergence of new terms during the period of our study first we look into the overall use of words on 4chans pol using the word2vec model trained on the period between october 28 2019 and march 22 2020 w a  in this model words used in similar context will present similar vectors the left side of table 2 reports the top 20 most similar words for the terms china chinese and virus we make several observations first we note that there are many derogatory terms for asian people chinese people in particular in the top 20 most similar terms some examples include chink derogatory term referring to asian people chinkland referring to the land of chinks ie china and chiniggers an offensive word created by combining china and nigger for instance a pol user posted we should have never let these chiniggers into the country or enforced a mandatory quarantine for anyone coming from contaminated areas but its too late now another pol user posted you chinks deserve it theres no shithole of a country that could be as disgusting as chinkland this indicates that pol users use a wide variety of derogatory terms to possibly disseminate hateful ideology towards chinese and asian people second by looking at the most similar words of the term virus we find several terms related to the covid-19 pandemic 50  this is evident since the four most similar words to the term virus are related to covid-19 specifically coronovirus covid coronavirus and corona this indicates that the overall use of words in pol is highly affected by the covid-19 pandemic and this event is likely to cause changes in the use of language by users the corresponding results for twitter is shown on the right side of table 2  on twitter we observe multiple politicalrelated terms that are similar to china and chinese such as government and ccp chinese communist party furthermore we again observe some potentially offensive terms like chinazi which indicates that the use of sinophobic content is not limited to fringe web communities like 4chan and it also exists in mainstream web communities like twitter also many terms that are similar to virus are also related to covid-19 such as corona and coronavirus this indicates twitters users word usage are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic as well to better visualize the use of language related to chinese people we create graphs that visualize the use of words that are similar to the term chinese following the methodology by zannettou et al 55  in a nutshell we create a graph where nodes are words and an edge between the words exists if their cosine similarity obtained from the trained word2vec model is above a pre-defined threshold 5 we limit the graph into nodes that are two hops away from a specific word of interest in this case chinese then we perform various tasks for visualizing the graph first the graph is layed out in the graph space with an algorithm that takes into account the weights of the edges 26  that is words that have large cosine similarities are layed out closer in the graph space second the size of each node is relative to the number of occurrences of the word in our dataset third we run the the louvain community detection method 5 on the graph and represent nodes that belong to the same community with the same color the resulting graphs are depicted in figure 6 and 7 for pol and twitter respectively by inspecting the obtained communities of words in figure 6  we observe several interesting themes around the use of words related to chinese first we observe a community that is highly related to the covid-19 pandemic blue community on bottom right interestingly within this community we also observe terms like biowepon sic and bioattack likely indicating that pol users are sharing probably false information about the pandemic for instance claiming that the whole pandemic is a bioattack from the chinese on the western world for example a pol user posted anyone that doesnt realize this is a chinese bioweapon by now is either a brainlet or a chicom noodle nigger second we observe two tightlyknit communities red and yellow communities on left-side of the graph that appear to predominantly include derogatory terms towards asian and in particular chinese people some of the words in these communities are ricenigger chinksect chankoro chinks yellowniggers and pindick by looking at some examples of posts from pol users we observe the use of these terms for disseminating hate eg chang you useless ricenigger fuck off just call the bitch and ask her youll see this is fucking ccp bs its a fucking ex-perimental chink biowep and i fucking hate chinks stop spreading viruses everywhere you pindick cunts interestingly the most distant word in these communities is the word batsoup which is closer to the community related to covid-19 44  the rest of the communities in this graph are seemingly related to china in general purple community and to other countries in asia green community overall this graph highlights that pol users use a wide variety of derogatory terms to characterize chinese people when looking at the graph obtained for twitter see figure 7  we observe an interesting community of terms blue which includes words related to the covid-19 pandemic we observe a large number of words that are seemingly anti-china like the terms makechinapay blamechina and chinaisasshoe at the same time there are a lot of terms referring to the virus itself like chinawuhanvirus chinaflu and coronacontrol as well as a few terms that aim to support chinese people through this crisis like staystrongchina for example a twitter user posted how do you say chi-com asshoe chinesepropaganda chinaliedpeopledied chi-navirus wuhancoronavirus the other communities on the graph include various terms related to happenings in china and other asian countriesregions by taking a deeper look at profanities that appeared among the terms we can roughly divide them into two groups one is insults addressing asian people such as racist variations of china and chinese eg chinkland chingchong and chinksect or culturally oriented racist terms including attacking dietary habits eg ricenigger skin tone eg yellownigger or sexual stereotypes eg pindick the frequent appearance of swear words among the terms can indicate an abreaction to the rising fear and stress in front of the disease 21 16  at the same time the racist and targeted focus of these slurs can be explained with the mechanism of defensive aggression either focusing on cultural taboos such as sexuality 16 25  or perpetuating societal oppression 25  discussions on web communities like 4chans pol and twitter are highly dynamic and respond to real-world events as they unfold thus we expect users on these web communities to discuss various topics related to the covid-19 pandemic moreover events like the covid-19 pandemic unfold over time and this is reflected by the dynamics of discussion on web communities in previous sections we explored both the usage of some key terms related to sinophobia as well as a static understanding of content however these previous analyses do not help us understand how sinophobic language is evolving over time more specifically there is a lack of understanding on how the context in which words are used changes and also how new words are created the former is important because it provides significant insights into the scope and breadth of the problem the latter is important because the language of online extremism has been shown to include memes and slang that have completely contradictory meanings to normal usage or do not even exist outside of the communities that use them we first study the sinophobic language evolution on 4chans pol and in section 62 we will focus on twitter  to study the evolution of discussions and use of language we make use of the weekly word2vec models w ti  i  t  to illustrate how these models are helpful we initially compare the results from the model trained on the first week of our dataset w t0  with the model trained on the last week of our dataset w t1  table 3 reports the top 20 similar words to china chinese and virus for the first and last weekly word2vec models similar to how table 2 shows results for a model trained on the entirety of our dataset interestingly we observe major differences between the most similar words obtained from the first and last models comparing left sides of the table with the right side as well as between the whole model and these two weekly models cf table 2 and table 3  we make several key observations first when looking at the most similar words to the term china from the first week model left side of table 3  we observe words referring to other counties mostly in asia eg japan singapore etc but also that the derogatory term chinks is among the top 20 this result indicates that 4chans pol users typically use racial slurs targeted to chinese people and this was also happening even before the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic similar findings can be observed by looking at the most similar words to the term chinese we observe the existence of racial slurs like chink however most of the other words relate to people originating from other asian countries such as koreans when looking at the most similar words to the term virus before the covid-19 pandemic we observe general terms related to diseases or other outbreaks eg ebola second by comparing the most similar words from the first and last models we observe several interesting differences by looking at the most similar words to the term china we observe that derogatory terms like chink have a higher cosine similarity compared to the first model likely indicating a rise in the use of this term in discussions related to china furthermore we observe terms like chernobyl which may indicate that pol users are comparing this outbreak with the chernobyl disaster for example a pol user posted i can see china collapsing after all this just as the chernobyl incident was the beginning of the end for the ussr we also see the term childkiller which upon manual investigation is due to a particularly active user repeatedly posting that china created covid-19 as a bioweapon specifically we find multiple occurrences of the following sentence in multiple pol posts china cre-ated the china bioweapon murder death child-killer virus in china interestingly we also find some terms that seem to be sarcastic towards the way that chinese people talk english for instance the term numba refers to table 3  top 20 most similar words to the words china chinese and virus for the first and last trained word2vec models from 4chans pol the word number and asshoe refers to the term asshole some examples from pol posts are dont trust china china is asshoe and taiwan numba 1 china numba none third by looking into the most similar words to the term chinese we observe the term bioterrorism likely indicating that 4chans pol users are calling chinese people as bioterrorists that is likely related to conspiracy theories that covid-19 was bioengineered for example a pol user posted this is bioterrorism nuke china now by looking at the most similar words to the term virus we find that the most similar one is the term bioengineered indicating that the conspiracy theory went viral on pol during that specific week and was discussed extensively for instance a pol user posted the bat soup is just a cover-up one of leibers chinks stole the bioengineered virus  tried to patent it in china violating export-controlled laws  committing espionage my guess is he didnt handle the virus correctly got himself sick then infected others in the wuhan wet market finally by looking at the other similar words to the term virus we clearly observe those that are related to the covid-19 pandemic with terms like wuflu created by combining wuhan and flu covid and corona for instance a pol user posted die to wuflu already boomers these differences are also more evident by looking at the graph visualizations in figure 8  to create these graphs we use the same methodology as figure 6  for the first and last weekly trained word2vec models visualizing the two-hop neighborhood of the term chinese looking at the graph obtained from the first model see figure 8 a we observe mostly innocuous terms related to chinese people and other asian people by looking at the graph obtained from the last model see figure 8 b however we observe an entirely different more hateful behavior specifically the two main tightly-knit communities red and blue communities are filled with slurs used against chinese people like ricenigger fuckface zipperhead bugpeople subhumans etc example of posts from pol include i hope you fucking die in hell you psychopathic zipperhead you and your whole disgusting race and we should unironically nuke china kill some bugpeople and eradicate covid-19 at the same time overall these findings indicating that we are experiencing an explosion in the use of chinese derogatory terms in fringe web communities like 4chans pol in particular after the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic these findings are particularly worrisome since it is likely that as the pandemic evolves it is likely to have further rise in the dissemination of racist and hateful ideology towards chinese people that might also have real-world consequences such as physical violence against chinese people discovering new terms next we aim to study how new terms related to chinese emerge on 4chans pol and how their popularity changes over the course of our dataset to achieve this we make use of the terms extracted from the vocabularies of the trained word2vec models on 4chans pol specifically we initially extract the vocabulary from the model trained on historical data w c  and treat it as our base vocabulary then for each weekly trained model w ti  i  t  we extract the vocabulary and compare the terms with our base vocabulary for each term that is new we add it to our base vocabulary treat it as a new term since we want to find new terms that are related to chinese we filter out all new terms that have a cosine similarity below 05 in the weekly trained model for which we discovered the new term overall using the above methodology we manage to discover a total of 50 new terms then we visualize the popularity of the 20 most popular new terms of the course of our dataset in figure 9  we observe the emergence of several interesting words during the the end of january 2020 first we observe the emergence of terms like batsoup likely indicating that pol users are discussing the fact that the covid-19 outbreak allegedly started by chinese people consuming bats second by the same time we observe the emergence of biolab and biowarfare the use of these words indicate that pol users discuss various conspiracy theories on how the covid-19 virus was created on a lab or how it can be used as a bioweapon interestingly these terms are persistent from their emergence till the end of our datasets indicating that these theories are generally appealing to 4chans userbase other interesting new terms include the terms kungflu which an offensive term towards chinese people related to the covid-19 virus and heinsberg which is the center of the outbreak in germany and indicates that pol users was discussing about it especially during the end of february 2020 and beginning of march 2020 the echo chamber effect 54 performs significantly on 4chan that the narratives towards covid-19 are consistently blaming china and being racist or spreading conspiracy theory which alarms for the risk of information manipulation table 4  top 20 most similar words to the words china chinese and virus for the first and last trained word2vec models on twitter figure 9  visualization of the emergence of new words related to chinese over time on 4chans pol 7 49  previous studies on social networks have shown that a small number of zealots can distort collective decisions especially on ambiguous events 52 43  now we focus on the sinophobic language evolution on twitter we follow the same methodology used in section 61 the corresponding results are depicted in table 4 and figure 10  from table 4  we can observe that during the first week covered by our twitter dataset many similar terms to china and chinese are related to politics such as tradewar this is again quite different from the result on pol see table 3  meanwhile for virus the most similar terms are also related to diseases however when checking results on our last week twitter data we observe that many sinophobic terms appear to be semantically similar to china and chinese such as chinazi as in 4chans pol see table 3  newly created sinophobic terms including chinavirus and kungflu appear to be close in context as well for example a twitter user posted i agree too specific its obviously called the kungflu its kicking all of our asses regardless of denomination moreover many terms with similar contexts to china and chinese in our last week twitter dataset are still about politics in contrast to the first week twitter data these politicalrelated terms are related to covid-19 eg ccpvirus and some of these terms even convey the meaning of revenge and punishment towards china such as boycottchina for instance a twitter user posted chinesevirus is chinesevirus one name boycottchina chinaliespeopledie by looking into the graphs obtained from the first and last weekly trained word2vec models see figure 10  we again observe substantial differences between the first and last models the graph from the first model includes mainly words related to china and other asian regions as well as words used for discussing matters related to china eg tradewar on the other hand for the graph obtained from the last model we observe several terms related to covid-19 like chinavirus chinesevirus chineseflu and chinaisasshoe this indicates a shift towards the use of racist terms related to chinese people after the covid-19 outbreak on twitter we also observe some terms that appear related to the behavior of donald trump for instance the term racistinchief is likely related to the fact that donald trump calls the covid-19 virus as chinese virus and this was discussed on twitter for instance a twitter user posted trumps a real asshole just in case yall forget trump-pandemic trumpvirus racistinchief discovering new terms to discover new terms from twitter we follow the same methodology with pol as documented in section 61 overall we discover a total of 713 new terms between october 28 2019 and march 22 2020 figure 11 visualizes a sample of 40 of the new terms according to their popularity and cosine similarity with the term chinese we observe a lot of new terms relating to the hong kong protests emerging during november 2019 such as freehongk and hongkongpoliceb also after the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic we observe the emergence of a wide variety of terms around the end of january 2020 some notable examples include terms like chinavirus chinesevirus wuhanpneumo-nia wuhancorono etc these findings highlight that during important real-world events such as the covid-19 pandemic language evolves and new terms emerge on web communities like twitter at the same time it is particularly worrisome that we observe the appearance of new terms that can be regarded as sinophobic like chinesevirus which can possibly lead to hate attacks in the real-world and almost certainly harm international relations as the last part of our analysis we set out to assess how the semantic distance between words change over the course of our datasets to do this we leverage the weekly trained word2vec models w ti  i  t  for each word2vec model we extract the cosine similarity between two terms and then we plot their similarities over time this allow us to understand whether two terms are mapped closer to the multi-dimensional vector space over time hence visualizing if two terms are used more in similar context over time we show some examples in figure 12  the terms are selected based on our previous analysis we observe several interesting changes in the similarities between terms over time specifically for the terms chinese and virus see figure 12 a we observe a substantial increase in cosine similarity between these two terms over time especially after the week ending on january 19 2020 the cosine similarity on both twitter and pol was below 05 in the early models while after january 19 2020 it is mostly over 05 with the last model having a similarity over 06 this indicates that the terms chinese and virus are used in more similar ways over time on both twitter and pol another example are the terms chinese and chink see figure 12 b we observe that for both twitter and pol the similarity between these terms increases over the course of our datasets interestingly the increase in cosine similarity between these terms is larger for twitter likely indicating that twitter users are more affected by the covid-19 with regards to sharing sinophobic content while on pol the difference is smaller which indicates that pol users were affected less by covid-19 when it comes to sharing sinophobic content finally we illustrate also the cosine similarity differences between the terms chinese and batpangolin in fig-ure 12c and 12d respectively for bat we observe that the cosine similarity was low during our first models and it substantially increased after the week ending on january 26 2020 this indicates that both twitter and pol users have started discussing the fact that the virus allegedly originates from bats around that specific time frame and they continued doing so until the end of our datasets for pangolin we observe some differences across the two web communities on pol the users were not discussing pangolins at all before january 26 2020 and after that they started discussing them with a high cosine similarity to the term chinese over 04 on the other hand on twitter we observe that users were discussing pangolins even before the covid-19 outbreak to combat the covid-19 pandemic many governments have implemented unprecedented measures like social distancing and even government enforced large-scale quarantines this has resulted in the web becoming an even more essential source of information communication and socialization unfortunately the web is also exploited for disseminating disturbing and harmful information including conspiracy theories and hate speech targeting chinese people part of this can be attributed to scapegoating a basic psychosocial mechanism to deal with stress building upon the well known in-group favoritismout-group hostility phenomenon racist ideology has a long history of scapegoating a common scapegoating theme has been to equate the targeted people with a disease either figuratively or literally when threatened by events outside our control it is only natural to seek for external blame in the case of covid-19 the entire world is threatened and there is a natural external actor to blame in this paper we make a first attempt to understand sinophobic language on the social web related to covid-19 to this end we collect two large-scale datasets from 4chans pol and twitter over a period of five months our results show that covid-19 has indeed come with a rise of sinophobic content mainly on fringe web communities like pol and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like twitter relying on word embeddings we also observe the semantic evolution of sinophobic slurs moreover our study also shows that many new sinophobic slurs are created as the crisis progresses our study has several implications for both society and the research community focusing on understanding and mitigating emerging social phenomena on the web first we showed that the dissemination of hateful content and in particular sinophobic content is a cross-platform phenomenon that incubates both on fringe web communities as well as mainstream ones this prompts the need to have a multi-platform point-of-view when studying such emerging social phenomena on the web second we showed that sinophobic behavior evolves substantially especially after life changing events like the covid-19 pandemic this highlights the need to develop new techniques and tools to understand these changes in behavior and work towards designing and deploying counter-measures with the goal to prevent or mitigate real-world violence stemming from these behaviors while the covid-19 crisis does provide a unique opportunity to understand the evolution of hateful language our study should be also be taken as a call for action the web has enabled much of society to keep going or at least to maintain social connections with other humans but it has also allowed and potentially encouraged the proliferation of hateful language at a time where we can afford it the least  modeling covid-19 forecasting and analyzing the dynamics of the outbreak in hubei and turkey ibrahim aslan halil mahir demir michael wise morgan suzanne lenhart  as the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 rages throughout the world accurate modeling of the dynamics thereof is essential however since the availability and quality of data varies dramatically from region to region accurate modeling directly from a global perspective is difficult if not altogether impossible nevertheless via local data collected by certain regions it is possible to develop accurate local prediction tools which may be coupled to develop global models in this study we analyze the dynamics of local outbreaks of covid-19 via a coupled system of ordinary differential equations odes utilizing the large amount of data available from the ebbing outbreak in hubei china as a testbed we estimate the basic reproductive number r0 of covid-19 and predict the total cases total deaths and other features of the hubei outbreak with a high level of accuracy through numerical experiments we observe the effects of quarantine social distancing and covid-19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak using knowledge gleaned from the hubei outbreak we apply our model to analyze the dynamics of outbreak in turkey we provide forecasts for the peak of the outbreak and the total number of casesdeaths in turkey for varying levels of social distancing quarantine and covid-19 testing  in late 2019 the city of wuhan in the province of hubei china experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  the disease caused by the novel coronavirus sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this outbreak quickly spread to all states of china and across the globe being declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on 11 march 2020 the authorities imposed a strict lock-down on the city of wuhan and other cities of the hubei province on 23 january 2020 world health organization 2020b  in the face of over sixty-seven thousand cases and over three thousand deaths the authorities continued strict enforcement of these measures chinese physicians 2020 coronavirus covid-19 global cases by johns hopkins csse 2020 finally on 23 march 2020 hubei reached a significant milestone as the provinces health commission reported no new cases for seven consecutive days world health organization 2020b the new york times 2020  shortly thereafter after over two months of severe restrictions on the movements of the hubei population the 2020 hubei lockdowns were relaxed as the hubei outbreak began to wane inspiring hope that the global pandemic might be able to be controlled previous studies of covid-19 provided the evidence of human-to-human transmission and revealed its similarity and differences from sars chan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 xu et al 2020  however data-driven simulation-based studies are needed to understand the dynamics of the ongoing outbreak indeed it is of the utmost importance to use these tools to investigate the effectiveness of public health strategies such as the number of covid-19 tests carried out to detect the infected the level of quarantinesocial

global modeling of the dynamics of this pandemic exceedingly difficult as a result in this study we develop a model for dynamics of the pandemic from a local perspective the many hotspots of covid-19 combined with the many travel restrictions in place throughout the world further suggest that local models might provide more practical insights into the dynamics than their global counterparts indeed it stands to reason that accurate models for local regions can be coupled to develop reasonable models for larger regions as of 23 march 2020 around one-quarter of the global covid-19 cases and consequent deaths occurred in hubei the large proportion of data available from hubei combined with the regions recent achievements toward managing their local outbreak suggest that the data from this region presents an excellent picture of the lifetime of an outbreak of covid-19 indeed as countries worldwide close their borders cities and regions and impose their own shelterin-place quarantine or lockdown orders in the face of the pandemic the large amount of data available from hubei provides an excellent testbed for modeling the dynamics of a local outbreak of covid-19 in this study we start by developing a seiqr type deterministic model which uses a system of ordinary differential equations to analyze the dynamics of the outbreak in particular highlighting the effect of testing and the effects of quarantine and social distancing in hubei we present estimates of the basic reproductive number r 0 of covid-19 in hubei and perform a sensitivity analysis to deduce which parameters play significant roles in the transmission and control of the outbreak in hubei in addition we also provide 15-day forecasts of the fatality rate of the outbreak the number of cases and the number of deaths depending on the data chinese physicians 2020 coronavirus covid-19 global cases by johns hopkins csse 2020 world health organization 2020b and outputs of our seiqr model finally building on knowledge obtained from the hubei outbreak we apply our model to the outbreak in turkey we forecast the peak of the outbreak and the total number of casesdeaths in turkey utilizing the extant covid-19 data from turkey ministry of health turkey 2020 a deterministic compartmental model has been developed by using ordinary differential equations odes to understand the dynamics of covid-19 in hubei

note that all individuals who upon testing test positive are immediately isolated the transition flows among compartments are given in figure 1  the rate of reported cases i q denotes the number of individuals who transition from the infected class i to the reported class i q per day it is also directly related to the daily number of covid-19 tests carried out during the outbreak figure 1  flow

the number of reported cases i q  when the number of reported cases increases in a state or country then the quarantine is imposed or naturally taken as an option thus when the number of reported

individuals in s and s q compartments transition to compartment e exposed with a force of infection given by and disease transmission rate  note that since the individuals in s q transition to e

average number of secondary cases arising from an average primary infected case in an entirely susceptible population the dfe is locally stable if r 0  1 van den driessche  watmough 2002 diekmann et

with r 0 for the system 1 note that we might control the disease with increasing quarantine rate of infected individual i q  thus if then the dfe is locally stable and the disease dies out when sufficiently close to dfe biologically if the infected individuals can be detected in a sufficiently short time another word the number of test to detect the number of cases increase then the disease can be controlled in this part we estimate the parameters in the system 1 so we fit our model with the daily reported cumulative number of cases and deaths which are provided by world health organization 2020b and chinese physicians 2020 we use the ordinary least squares ols method and minimize the sum of the squares of differences between the daily reported data and those predicted by our model the goodness of the fit is measured by computing the associated relative error of the fit using the formula where c i and l are exact and estimated cumulativeinfected cases and d i andd l are exact and estimated cumulative deaths to estimate the number of covid-19 deaths we sum the number of deaths coming from the infected class i and the reported infected class i q  note that the

cases and on february 12 2020 13332 clinically rather than laboratory cases reported even though they were diagnosed in the preceding days and weeks due to the very small number of cases reported after march 23 2020 we chose to fit the model using only data from before this date table 1  in this section we discuss 15-day forecasting of the outbreak the effect of quarantine and the effect of testing in hubei we also conduct a sensitivity analysis to see which parameters play important role in the dynamics of the outbreak when we look at the change in the quarantine class nearly the entire province of hubei was quarantined by february 15 2020 see figure 3  february 15 corresponds the day 25 in the figure the percentage of the population transitioning from the susceptible class to the quarantine class attains its maximum level between january 27 2020 and february 10 2020 and by february 15 almost all of the population were in quarantine this result makes sense since the state government imposed a quarantine in the state on january 23 2020 initially recommending quarantine and finally forcing the people into quarantine to guarantee social distancing this action seems to have worked to great effect reducing the contact rate by about 989 see table 1 for the parameter r the reduction rate due to the quarantine  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available

thus any change in the quarantine rate makes very significant change in total number of cases and deaths furthermore see the sensitivity analysis section below the quarantine rate is a significant

infected cases i q  as it can be seen the number of individuals in each of these classes tends to zero which implies that the outbreak is almost over and so new cases may not be recorded in hubei as it can be seen from the change in infected class the outbreak reaches its peak about february 9 2020 the infected class i also shows how many people were out with no symptoms or mild symptoms during

the same as in table 1 and the initial condition same as before figure 6 shows the results of these experiments how the number of cumulative cases changes for different values of s q  i q  r and  it

infected people thus increasing the number of tests will increase the rate of case reporting i q  this will reduce the number of cases see figure 6  and consequently the number of deaths due to the outbreak when we increase the rate of reported infected cases i q by about 10 the number of cases and number of deaths are estimated to be 36040 and 1639 respectively decreasing the rate about 10 the number of cases and number of deaths are estimated to be 14084 and 6724 respectively in the part we fit the model 1 with available covid-19 data from turkey ministry of health turkey 2020 we fit the model 1 with turkish data from march 10 2020 to april 10 2020 and get about 59 relative error in the fit by using the equation 3 we estimate the four parameters i q  s q   and r which are not only the most significant parameters in the dynamics of outbreak but also are specific to each country since they are related to the number of covid-19 tests administered i q  the number of individuals in quarantine s q  the contact rate of individuals  and the efficiency of quarantine r in each country therefore by using the initial conditions s0  83 000 000 s q 0  0 i q 0  1 and r0  0 we estimate these four parameters together with the initial number of exposed and infected individuals we do not estimate the rest of the parameters employing the parameters in table 1  therefore our results in this section will depend on observed dynamics of the outbreak in hubei as well as the available turkish data ministry of health turkey 2020 note that the quarantine rate and the rate of reported cases which we stress is related to number of covid-19 tests can be increased and the increase still may have significant effect toward the reduction of the number of cases see figure 6  sensitivity analysis but increasing the reduction rate r does not make very significant changes by way of the number of cases in turkey since it is very close to its maximum level see figure 6  sensitivity analysis part thus we will vary only the quarantine rate s q and the rate of reported cases i q in forecasting the peak of the outbreak and the number of casesdeaths in turkey  cc-by-nd 40

preprint  https doiorg101101 doiorg10 2020 the rate of reported cases is about 18 this rate is larger than what we observed in hubei this implies that in terms of numbers of covid-19 tests conducted per day turkey is now doing a better job than hubei china at a comparable time in hubeis outbreak the efficiency of quarantine also seems to be very good in turkey given the approximately 85 reduction in the contact rate of covid-19 obtained by our parameter estimation on the other hand the quarantine rate is about 0088 which is small when compared with the quarantine rate in hubei the rate was 0096 in hubei in hubei the population transitioned to quarantine class very quickly almost in two weeks but in turkey the movement to quarantine has been very slow in comparison see figure 8  suggesting why the contact rate is higher in turkey when we compare to the contact rate in hubei see table 1 and 3 for these rates it is still possible to increase the quarantine rate the rate per day of transition to quarantine class and the number of covid-19 tests given each day in turkey to make a reduction in the number of cases and deaths see figures 9 and  10  in figures 9 and 10  the red curves are obtained using base parameters from table 1 and 3 and the other curves obtained by varying the quarantine rate s q and the rate of reported cases i q  when we use the base parameter values which are obtained from our fitting turkey then will have about 203700 cases and 8269 deaths if turkey can increase the number of individuals in quarantine and the number of daily covid-19 tests then depending on the magnitude of the increases the number of cases and deaths can decrease significantly see figures 9 and 10  when we look at trajectories of cumulative cases and deaths in figures 9 and 10  in the worst-case scenario the black curves of the study turkey will have about 281500 cases and 11430 deaths these projections decrease to 148100 cases and 6005 deaths if turkey can increase the

suggests that quarantine greatly reduced the number of cases and deaths seen in hubeis covid-19 outbreak in addition while quarantine does not appear in the representation of r 0  it still indirectly reduces r 0  we also saw that the dynamics of the outbreak is very sensitive to the quarantine rate s q and contact rate  as indicated by our sensitivity analysis the basic reproductive number is estimated as 549 and the study shows that any change in  or i q directly affects the basic reproductive number the quarantine decidedly reduces the number of cases and deaths increasing or decreasing the speed of movement from the susceptible class to the quarantine class by about 10 would double or half the number of cases and deaths due to the outbreak this speed of movement is controlled by the rate s q  of course the efficiency of the quarantine is also very important in our model the efficiency of the quarantine measured by the reduction rate r the reduction rate shows how much reduction is effected in the contact of covid-19 thanks to the quarantine based on our sensitivity analysis this parameter is very important see figure 6  our model shows that the quarantine in hubei was almost perfect since it caused about 989 percent reduction in the contact rate of covid-19 another important parameter that plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the outbreak is the rate of reported infected cases i q which is directly related to the number of tests given to detect infected individuals similar to the quarantine rate s q  the rate of reported infected cases i q could double half when we have 10 reduction or increase in the rate as of 30 march 2020 there were no reported cases in hubei in the past week and the total number of cases and total number of deaths were 67801 and 3187 respectively based on our 15-days forecasting the number of cases in hubei was projected to be about 67994 and the number of deaths was projected to be about 3254 thus we estimate the fatality rate of the outbreak to be about 48 in hubei our model gives about 6 relative error and we are confident that using the model will be helpful for forecasting local outbreaks of the pandemic in other regions from existing covid-19 data from turkey and the dynamics of our model understood from the hubei analysis the outbreak in turkey is expected to reach its peak between april 20 and april 26 depending on the number of individuals amount of people in quarantine and the number of covid-19 tests carried out each day in turkey the daily number of tests given in turkey is large when we compare to the rates of reported cases in hubei as we showed in the sensitivity analysis increasing the number of covid-19 tests and the number of individuals in quarantine will significantly reduce the number of cases and deaths based on our forecasting the number of cases will be about 203700 with the range 148100 and 281500 and the number of deaths will be about 8269 with the range 6005 and 11430 depending on quarantine rate s q and the rate of reported cases i q in turkey thus in any cases that are given in figure 9 and 10 the fatality rate of covid-19 will be about 41 in turkey  cc-by-nd 40

preprint  httpsdoiorg10 1101 2020   infection arbitrage sander heinsalu  increasing the infection risk early in an epidemic is individually and socially optimal under some parameter values the reason is that the early patients recover or die before the peak of the epidemic which flattens the peak this improves welfare if the peak exceeds the capacity of the healthcare system and the social loss rises rapidly enough in the number infected the individual incentive to get infected early comes from the greater likelihood of receiving treatment than at the peak when the disease has overwhelmed healthcare capacity calibration to the covid-19 pandemic data suggests that catching the infection at the start was individually optimal and for some loss functions would have reduced the aggregate loss in a severe enough epidemic that is likely to overwhelm the capacity of the healthcare system getting infected early is individually rational in particular under most parameter values consistent with the data on the covid-19 pandemic the reason is that getting treated early when the healthcare system still has free capacity is better than facing rationing of medical services during the peak of the epidemic if the fraction infected at the peak is large enough then the higher likelihood of treatment when   catching the disease early outweighs the greater total probability of being infected when trying to catch it early as opposed to reducing risk throughout the epidemic the preference for early exacerbation holds for any health condition likely to need treatment at some point during the epidemic not just for the disease causing the epidemic getting infected early imposes the obvious negative transmission externality on others-the initial disease carriers spread the infection however the welfare effect of early infection is ambiguous because of a positive peak load externality the initially infected people recover or die before the peak of the epidemic thus reduce the load on the healthcare system when its capacity is needed the most the balance of the transmission and peak load externalities determines whether infecting part of the population initially improves welfare if many people try to get infected early then the peak of the epidemic arrives earlier and may be higher or lower than without attempted early infection the more people who try to acquire the disease early the lower the incentive to acquire it initially because the less spare healthcare capacity remains early on symmetrically this arbitrage argument shows that the more people who try to delay the infection before the peak the lower the incentive to protect oneself during that time the strategic substitutability of risk choices leads to a mixed equilibrium in which some fraction of the population arbitrages the infection timing by getting infected early the rest best respond by doing nothing until the fraction infected is large enough at which point everyone tries to reduce their risk until the peak of the epidemic passes the arbitrage of infection timing flattens the peak of the epidemic and spreads it over a longer time the welfare effect of this depends on the loss function if the loss rises fast in the fraction infected then welfare depends mostly on the height of the peak in this case reducing the maximal prevalence of the disease reduces aggregate losses if the loss increases slowly in the fraction infected then the wider and lower peak under early infection is worse than the higher and later peak under the standard policy of reducing risk the literature on theoretical epidemiology is vast starting from kermack and mckendrick 1927  the study of the incentives to protect oneself goes back at least to peltzman 1975  although in a safety context an early review of economic epidemiology is the book of philipson and posner 1993  toda 2020 finds that delaying infection control efforts until a significant fraction of the population is infected is socially optimal the present work takes the natural next step and shows that the opposite intervention to the usual risk reduction is individually and socially optimal in the early stage of a severe epidemic the individual and social optimality of protection from disease are also studied in auld 1996 auld   2006  chen and toxvaerd 2014  fenichel 2013  galeotti and rogers 2013  goyal and vigier 2015  heinsalu 2020  kremer 1996  kremer and morcom 1998  rowthorn and toxvaerd 2017  talams and vohra 2019  toxvaerd 2019  to the authors knowledge the literature has not considered deliberate early infection as a feasible let alone optimal individual choice or policy instrument mathematically the environment with a changing hazard rate of an event infection over time resembles khan and stinchcombe 2015  the current paper studies a game in addition to an individual decision each agent solves a control problem chooses risk every period instead of a stopping problem when to vaccinate the next section examines individual incentives to reduce or increase risk and calibrates the results to the covid-19 data from the empirical literature section 2 studies infection arbitrage by interacting decision makers welfare comparisons using the compartmental susceptible-infected-recovered model are in section 21 section  extends the individual and equilibrium results to continuous time a discussion of policy implications is in section 4 a continuum of individuals each face a risk of infection r 1  0 1 in period t  1 and if this risk does not realize then a greater risk r 2  r 1  1 in period 2 the loss t  0 conditional on infection also increases over time 2  1  the loss t summarizes the expected discounted value of all negative consequences of the risk rising risk and loss over time reflect an epidemic spreading in the population which both increases the infection probability and leaves fewer medical resources per patient thus worsens the expected consequences of infection the improvement in treatment or the availability of supplies is assumed slower than the spread of the epidemic and is incorporated in t wlog before being infected the individual can take an action a t   t  1 t  with 0  a t  1  t  1 rt  to decrease or increase the infection risk to a t r t that period action a t  1 is costless and leaves the risk unchanged t costs  0 r 1 1  and decreases the risk and t costs  0 and increases the risk example actions reducing infection risk are social distancing measures using protective equipment following hygiene practices example actions increasing the risk are doing more work in healthcare contaminated waste disposal or in crowded locations or deliberately obtaining the disease agent and infecting oneself in the second period at the peak of the epidemic the individual does not increase the risk because  2 r 2 2   r 2 2  decreasing the risk is optimal if  2 r 2 2   r 2 2  which reduces to if  1 2 r 2 2  then the individual leaves the risk unchanged only the continuation value   2 for an uninfected person at the start of period 2 matters for subsequent results the continuation payoff of an infected individual is zero because the loss from infection has already been incorporated into the first period payoff suppose  1 2 r 2 2  interpreted as a large risk and loss from catching the disease at the height of the epidemic high prevention effectiveness 1  2  or a small cost of preventive measures then   2   2 r 2 2  otherwise the individual optimally does nothing and obtains   2  r 2 2  in the first period the individual compares doing nothing payoff r 1 1 1r 1   2  reducing the risk payoff  1 r 1 1   1  1 r 1   2  and increasing the risk  1 r 1 1  c  1  1 r 1   2  raising ones risk is optimal if 1  1 r 1 1  1  1 r 1   2  and  1  1 r 1 1  1  1 r 1   2  these are equivalent to r 1  1   2   a 1 1 becaus c   and 1  1  1  1 recall that   2  0 if the cost of increasing ones risk is small the risk is large and can be significantly increased and the second-period losses from infection and mitigation   2  are large enough then the individual prefers to increase risk initially because this reduces the risk later when it is more costly the logic is similar to vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine which causes disease with a small positive probability eg most poliomyelitis cases were caused by the vaccine over several years until the vaccine was phased out and the wild-type disease made a comeback macklin et al 2020  1 vaccination is still optimal because it reduces the 1 another analogy is counter-firing against forest fires httpswwwnwcggovtermglossary counter-fire and controlled burns to prevent large fires infection risk over several years and this risk when unvaccinated is substantially larger than the likelihood of catching the disease from the vaccine in terms of the primitive parameters if the individual plans to reduce risk in period 2 then in period 1 increasing the risk is optimal if r 1  1  2 r 2 2   a 1  1   if the individual anticipates doing nothing in period 2 then increasing the risk in period 1 is optimal when the optimality of increasing ones risk depends on the parameter values the next subsection uses empirical estimates of the epidemic characteristics of the novel coronavirus to calibrate 2 and 3 for the median estimates increasing ones risk early in the epidemic is individually rational the utility and informational assumptions underlying the individual choices are discussed after the calibration section 31 calibrates the individual best response in a continuous time epidemiological model and shows that infecting oneself early remains the optimal strategy interpret period 2 as the peak of the epidemic with the least resources available per patient period 1 may be any time before the peak when the healthcare system still has spare capacity for the epidemic disease carriers the infection rate in the population at the peak of the epidemic is estimated to be 40-70 shlain 2020  similarly to the rate meltzer et al 2015 estimate for an influenza pandemic assume no deaths among the 70 of cases who are non-severe and non-critical assume 467 of cases are critical as in the data of livingston and bucher 2020  among critical cases 49 survived in the data of wu and mcgoogan 2020  385 in yang et al 2020 and 21 in zhou et al 2020  assume all critical cases die without a ventilator this is a lower bound on the case-fatality rate when the healthcare system is overwhelmed because severe cases become critical under a shortage of medical professionals and supplies an upper bound on the case-fatality rate is that all severe and critical cases die an estimated 160 000 ventilators are available in the us as of 1 april 2020 johns hopkins university center for health security 2020 which would cover 245 of the critical cases who form 2 of the us population of 329 million 2 if 5 of infected are critical and 40 of the population is infected at the peak of the epidemic getting infected at the peak of the epidemic then results in an expected death probability between 004671  00245  051  0046 and 031  00245  021  0298 which is the product of the probability of needing a ventilator and the probability of either not obtaining one or dying even with ventilation the large upper bound 0298 assumes severe cases become critical without medical intervention that is unavailable during the peak of the epidemic and die after becoming critical catching the disease early when medical capacity is unconstrained results in an expected death probability 004671  051  0023 onder et al 2020  if expected utility is linear in the death probability then the loss ratio 2  1 between being infected at the peak of the epidemic and initially is in the range  0046 0023  0298 0023  ie from 2 to 13 trying to catch the disease deliberately likely has close to 100 success rate so in 3 1 r 1  1 the fraction infected is close to zero early in an epidemic which makes 3 approximately  1  r 2 2  and 2 to  1  2 r 2 2   compared to the loss of dying with probability over 138 verity et al 2020  the cost of increasing or decreasing ones risk is likely small in which case 3 is approximately r 2 2  1 and 2 is 2 r 2 2  1  shlain 2020 meltzer et al 2015 predict a peak infection rate of 40-70 even with control measures so 2 r 2  04 trying to catch the disease early in an epidemic is individually rational if 04 2  1  1 ie 2  25 1  which is at the lower end of the range 2 13 of loss ratios if expected utility decreases faster than linearly in the death probability then 2  1 increases and deliberate infection early becomes relatively more attractive one cause of the faster decrease in expected utility is risk aversion because all death probabilities are below 50 so the larger probability is riskier creates a bernoulli random variable with greater variance prospect theory predicts upward distortion of small probabilities in which case an increase in the likelihood of death translates into a slower than linear reduction in the payoff then infecting oneself becomes relatively less attractive information is imprecise early in an epidemic so individuals have an option value of waiting which reduces their motive to increase their risk in a less severe epidemic where the peak infection rate in the us is below 1 13 of the population the china scenario increasing ones risk is not optimal a lower fraction of critical and severe cases has a similar effect as reducing the peak infection rate if the cost of infecting oneself is large perhaps due to effective isolation of disease carriers early in an epidemic then the cost may outweigh the benefit of increasing ones risk conversely if the cost of reducing ones risk is large then individuals optimally do nothing in period 2 so their probability of catching the disease at the peak of the epidemic is r 2  higher than 2 r 2 for any population infection rate this increases the motive to increase risk in period 1 a necessary condition for increasing ones risk to be optimal is that the loss increases over time otherwise a non-discounting agent is indifferent to the timing of risk and a discounting agent strictly prefers to delay the infection after the peak of the epidemic the risk and loss fall over time for general decision problems with a decreasing hazard rate the results of khan and stinchcombe 2015 imply that it is always optimal to reduce ones risk and delay the disease if many people decide to get infected early when medical help is still available then of course the peak of infection arrives early this gives individuals the incentive to delay their disease past the peak which in turn delays the peak conditional on catching the illness rational decision makers want it when others are healthy the next section discusses how arbitrage tends to equalize the net loss the cost of changing the risk plus the product of the risk and the loss across periods to model the interaction of risk choices let r t and l t in 2 and 3 increase in the fraction t of individuals choosing t and decrease in the fraction t taking t  the fall in period 2 risk and loss when more others choose to decrease risk as 1 shows weakens the incentive for a given individual to reduce risk in period 2 and to increase it in period 1 similarly the increase in period 1 risk and loss when others choose to raise their risk decreases an individuals incentive to increase risk in period 1 according to 2 and 3 the risk and loss in the second period may also decrease in the fraction infected in period 1 but any effect across periods is assumed weaker than the corresponding effect within any period formally the risk and loss are functions of the action history  the interpretation is that infection confers partial immunity and a period is longer than the course of illness this further strengthens the anticoordination motive to catch the disease when others are healthy definition 1 a subgame perfect equilibrium consists of choices      t   t  t12  risks r   r  t  t12 and losses     t  t12 each period satisfying the following a  2  0 e r  t  r tf  t   and  t  tf  t   subgame perfect equilibria are just called equilibria henceforth assume for simplicity that the period 2 risk and loss cannot be reduced enough to make doing nothing optimal even if all agents increase risk in period 1 and decrease it is 1  1 1  0 2  0 2  1 then all equilibria feature  2  1 and thus the continuation payoff may be written as   2  1    2 r 2f  1  1  0 1 2f  1  1  0 1  the following proposition characterizes the equilibrium set 2 mixing between decreasing the risk and doing nothing is an equilibrium if r 1f 0 1 1f 0 1    2 0 1  1 1  r 1f 0 0 1f 0 0    2 0 0 r 1f 1 0 1f 1 0    2 1 0  a 1 1  r 1f 0 0 1f 0 0    2 0 0 decreasing the risk is an equilibrium if r 1f 0 1 1f 0 1    2 0 1  1 1  increasing the risk is an equilibrium if r 1f 1 0 1f 1 0    2 1 0  a 1 1  equilibrium is generically unique the proof is merely checking the conditions in definition 1 and is thus omitted it is reasonable to assume that if everyone tries to get infected in the first period then the risk and loss are so large that individuals prefer not to increase their risksufficient for this is 1f 1 0    2 1 0  similarly if all others choose to reduce risk then an individual prefers either doing nothing or increasing own risk sufficient for which is 1f 0 1    2 0 1 the reason is that imperfect protective measures by the rest of society do not eliminate the disease but reduce transmission enough that paying the cost of risk reduction is individually suboptimal under these assumptions the candidate equilibria 4 and 5 in proposition 1 are not equilibria then the conditions guaranteeing mixed equilibria reduce to 1 1  r 1f 0 0 1f 0 0  2 0 0 for decreasing the risk part 2 and a 1 1  r 1f 0 0 1f 0 0    2 0 0 for increasing the risk 3 focus on the parameter values at which the negative continuation payoff   2 0 0 from doing nothing in period 1 is larger in absolute value than the loss 1f 0 0 in period 1 the interpretation is that the expected consequences of catching the disease at the peak of the epidemic are worse than when catching it now with certainty for example medical supplies run out many healthcare professionals fall ill and the rest are overloaded with patients reducing the probability that a given person receives adequate treatment if treatment is effective enough and the probability that the epidemic exhausts medical capabilities large enough then getting infected early is optimal when 1f 0 0    2 0 0 no equilibrium involves decreasing the risk in the first period for a small enough cost the unique equilibrium is that a fraction of the population increases their risk and the rest do nothing this is formalized in the following corollary corollary 2 if r 1f 1 0 1f 1 0    2 1 0  a 1 1  r 1f 0 0 1f 0 0    2 0 0 then in the unique equilibrium 1  0 and  1 solves r 1f   1  0 1f   1  0  2   1  0   a 1 1  the arbitrage of infection timing decreases the difference between the losses in different periods relative to doing nothing or reducing risk initially   2  1  1  1f  1  1     2   1  0  1f   1  0  0 for any 1   1 and any 1  corollary 2 additionally implies   2   1  0  1f   1  0  r 1f   1 0 1 r 1f   1 0  which goes to zero in with the implication that if the costs of arbitrage are small then so is the difference between the initial loss and the expected future loss arbitrage thus flattens out the peak of the epidemic in terms of both infection risk and the loss conditional on infection for a single agent this improves payoff by revealed preference however strategic interaction may yield a positive or negative welfare effect the following proposition provides sufficient conditions for increases and decreases in welfare from flattening the peak of the epidemic by early infection compared to doing nothing proposition 3 there exists  r 2  0 st if r 2f 0 0 0 1 2f 0 0 0 1  r 2f 1 0 0 1 2f 1 0 0 1   r 2  then welfare in the equilibrium in which individuals in period 1 mix to increase their risk is less than when all individuals do nothing there exists  r 1  0 st if r 1f 1 0 1f 1 0  r 1f 0 0 1f 0 0   r 1 and  2 1 0   2 0 0 then welfare in the equilibrium in which individuals in period 1 mix to increase their risk is greater than when all individuals do nothing proof  2 1 0   2 r 2f 1 0 0 1 2f 1 0 0 1  so if r 2f 0 0 0 1 2f 0 0 0 1  r 2f 1 0 0 1 2f 1 0 0 1   r 2  then  2 1 0   2 0 0  2  r 2  the indifference of the mixed equilibrium implies that the average payoff in it is r 1f   1  0 1f   1  0  1  r 1f   1  0  2   1  0 the average payoff if everyone does nothing in the first period is r 1f 0 0 1f 0 0  1  r 1f 0 0  2 0 0 the difference between the average equilibrium payoff and the average payoff when everyone does nothing is which is continuous the risk and loss increase in period 1 so if  2 1 0 2 0 0  0 the continuation payoff becomes constant in  1  then 4 converges to where the equality comes from corollary 2 unsurprisingly increasing the risk and loss initially without much compensating decrease later worsens welfare on the other hand the equilibrium increasing risk initially is better than doing nothing when the risk and loss do not rise much at the start of the epidemic but fall during the peak the welfare-maximizing strategy depends on the generally nonlinear r tf and tf  for any  in which tt  0 risk is not simultaneously increased and decreased there may exist risk and loss functions making this  socially optimal for generic risk and loss functions no equilibrium is efficient ie the welfare-maximizing strategy is not an equilibrium the reason is the externalities of transmission and peak load imposed by individual decisions to derive clearer welfare comparisons and policy implications more structure needs to be imposed on the risk and loss functions the next section derives the risk from the standard sir model the loss is derived from dividing the medical capacity by the number infected the risk function is derived from the standard continuous time sir compartmental model of kermack and mckendrick 1927  reformulated in terms of fractions of the population instead of absolute numbers of people fraction s t is susceptible i t infected and r t  1  s t  i t recovered resistant or dead at time t these fractions change over time as dst dt  s t i t  dit dt  s t i t  i t and drt dt  i t  harko et al 2014 solve for the paths of change of the susceptible infected and resistant fractions given initial conditions s 0  i 0  r 0   0 for technical convenience the sir model assumes the recovery times of infected people are exponentially distributed this is unrealistic because the duration of infection usually has an upper bound 3 if the recovery times are exponentially distributed then increasing risk is never optimal because the peak of the epidemic from a higher initial infected fraction is always higher and occurs earlier toda 2020  however with bounded recovery times infecting part of the population early reduces the height of the peak of the epidemic when the initially infected recover significantly before the peak which now occurs earlier there is no closed form solution to the sir model with bounded recovery times figure 1 shows a numerical example 4 in which deliberate early infection yields higher welfare the parameters of the epidemic can be interpreted as incorporating the effect of standard infection control measures in which case the comparison is between deliberate infection initially followed by the control policy that would be optimal if early infection was not feasible and this optimal control without early infection for simplicity and easier visualization the duration of infection is assumed exactly 10 days so on day 11 all the initially infected people recover a bounded distribution of infection times would smooth out the downward jump in the fraction infected without changing the qualitative insight in figure 1  with early deliberate infection the epidemic peaks on days 10 and 14 on which 37 of the population is infected without early infection the single peak on day 50 has 40 of the population infected of course if the fraction infected early is large enough then both peaks of the epidemic are higher than without early infection the optimal policy needs to be precisely tailored to the parameters of the disease which is difficult especially for newly emerging infections about which information is limited the sir model assumes random mixing so the early infected infect others if they could be quarantined until they recover then this increases the welfare gain from deliberate early infection relative to standard policies because early infection is also individually optimal volunteers may be found who are sufficiently altruistic to agree to quarantine in exchange for getting access to the disease agent early if welfare the negative of the aggregate loss only depended on the height of the peak then the policy comparison in figure 1 would be clear however the loss also depends on how long the infected fraction stays above the capacity of the healthcare system and how high above to account for these effects the loss function is next defined explicitly welfare is the negative of the integral of the loss function over the horizon of the epidemic the per-person loss function is assumed constant normalized to 1 if the infected fraction i of the population is less than the capacity k of the medical system if i  k then the loss is 1  1  k i  with   0 the increase in per-person loss if the capacity were zero the interpretation is that  is the extra loss from not getting treatment conditional on infection and 1  k i is the probability of not getting treatment due to rationing of the capacity dt over the horizon t max of the epidemic as long as t max is substantially later than the peak of the epidemic its value here taken to be 90 days does not materially influence the results because after the peak the fraction infected declines at an exponential rate as in section 11 assume for the us 160 000 ventilators population 329 million ventilation needed by between 5 and 30 of the infected the latter when serious cases become critical due to lack of care in this case k is between 160 000 005329 000 000  00097 and 160 000 03329 000 000  00016 the death probability without treatment is between 00467 and 03 but with treatment is 0023 the ratio of the death probabilities is assumed to be the loss ratio 2  1  2 13 which defines   2  1 1  1 12 table 1 shows the aggregate losses in the cases in which the fraction needing ventilation is 5 or 30 and the ratio of expected individual loss between early and peak infection is 1 or 12 the loss is less welfare is greater with early infection in all cases under other parameter values the standard policy may yield greater welfare despite the higher peak of infection the intuition is that flattening the peak with early infection also spreads it wider so the infection rate may be above the capacity of the healthcare system for a longer time depending on the capacity if the capacity is low and the loss rises slowly enough in the amount by which the infected exceed the capacity then the wider and flatter peak with early infection may be worse time is continuous indexed by t and the horizon infinite the discount rate is   0 an individual faces a time-varying risk a poisson rate r t and suffers a loss of size risk a t  t  1 or decrease it a t   0 1 with respective costs c1  0 c t   and c  assume t is continuous in t the individuals value at time t under an optimal strategy is denoted v t  the value is bounded above by 0 because the cost and the loss both cause negative payoffs the value is bounded below by  max  t t   because doing nothing forever is feasible the individuals dynamic programming problem is the optimal action is for increasing ones risk to be optimal a necessary condition is v t   t  thus t  max  t   the interpretation is that the peak of the epidemic has not been reached yet the value is the value is continuous for any bounded a x  r x  x   xt  assume r t  t are continuous in t single-peaked as is typical for an epidemic with a peak at t max  0 assume lim t r t t  0 eventually improved vaccines and treatments make the risk and loss arbitrarily small the following proposition characterises the individually optimal action paths proposition 4 there exists t 1  0 st a t  1 t  t 1  if v t  t1rt  t  then there exist t 0  t   t max  t 1 st the optimal strategy is a t  t for t  t t 0  a t  1 for t  t 0  t   a t  for t  t   t 1  and a t  1 for t  t 1  there exists k depending on proof the bound v t   max  t t implies lim t v t   0 therefore there exists t 1 st for any t  t 1   t  1r t v t   t   and 1 r t  t  v t   so the optimal action is a t  1 continuity of t  r t  t  v t in t implies that the set of times at which a given action is optimal is an interval and the intervals for t and are not adjacent denote by t 1  0 the earliest time after which doing nothing forever is optimal the value at t 1 is if t 1  0 then t 1 solves 1 r t 1 v t 1  t 1   if t 1  0 then there exists t 0  t max  t 1 after which increasing ones risk is never optimal because v t   max  t  and t  tmax t  t max  so because t  is the earliest time after which the individual first reduces risk and then switches to doing nothing the minimality of t  and the continuity of r t  t  v t imply there exists  0 st 1r t v t  t   and  t 1r t v t  t   for all t  t    t   denote the minimal such t   by t 0  if positive then it solves  if t 0  0 then by the continuity of r t  t  v t  there exists   0 st optimal sufficient is that max xt r x x is above a cutoff which increases in  and c t1rt  t  intuitively if the risk and loss eventually vanish then doing nothing becomes optimal from some time onward if the peak of the epidemic is severe enough then reducing risk is optimal in a time interval around the peak and increasing ones risk is optimal early on when the risk and loss are low compared to the peak between any intervals of raising and reducing risk there is an interval of doing nothing because the incentives are continuous in time next the continuous time individual optimization problem is calibrated to the epidemiologic parameters of the 2019 coronavirus increasing ones risk early on in the epidemic turns out to be optimal both when other individuals do nothing and when all individuals respond optimally so the risk and loss are derived from the decisions in equilibrium the mathematica code for the simulations in this section is available on the authors website httpssanderheinsalucom first an individual decision is calibrated assuming that the rest of society does not respond to the incentives to raise or reduce risk after that the background risk is derived in equilibrium from individual choices the unit of time is one day the discount factor is assumed zero because the time horizon of the pandemic is less than one year the risk function r t for t  10 4 is the rate i t at which susceptible people get infected in the sir model of kermack and mckendrick 1927  5 the parameters are i 0  10 6    04 and   01 initially one in a million people is infected and the average duration of the illness is 10 days at the peak 40 of the population is infected after t  10 4  the risk and loss are assumed zero the interpretation is vaccine and treatment development over the 10 4 days 27 years the per-person loss function t for t  10 4 is 1  1 i  k 1  k i  so the loss rises if the infected fraction i of the population exceeds the capacity k of the medical system as in section 11 assume for the us 160 000 ventilators population 329 million ventilation needed by between 5 and 30 of the infected the latter when serious cases become critical due to lack of care in this case k is between 160 000 005329 000 000  00097 and 160 000 03329 000 000  00016 the death probability without treatment is between 00467 and 03 but with treatment is 0023 the ratio of the death probabilities is assumed to be the loss ratio 2  1  2 13 which defines   2  1 1  1 12 the cost of reducing or increasing risk is assumed   001 the unit in which costs and losses are measured is the death probability conditional on infection when the medical system functions normally the factor by which risk can be decreased or 5 fraction s t is susceptible i t infected and r t  1  s t  i t recovered resistant or dead at time t the fractions evolve as dst dt  s t i t  dit dt  s t i t  i t and drt dt  i t  thus a susceptible gets infected at rate  dst stdt  stit st  increased is assumed to be 2 so that  05 and  2 at   1 and k  00097 an individual optimally does nothing after t 1  84 reduces risk between t   44 and t 1  does nothing between t 0  31 and t  and increases risk when t  0 t 0  if   12 and k  00097 then t 1  94 t   38 and t 0  26 if   1 and k  00016 then t 1  85 t   44 and t 0  25 if   12 and k  00016 then t 1  103 t   36 and t 0  25 in all cases increasing ones risk initially is optimal reducing the cost or increasing the effectiveness t of raising the risk widens the time interval during which raising ones risk is the best response on the other hand reducing or shortens this interval an equilibrium of the dynamic model consists of s t  i t  r t  r t  v t and a  t such that given a  t  the aggregate variables evolve according to dst dt  a  t s t i

6 equilibrium can be found numerically in it the individuals optimal policy remains qualitatively similar to the one calibrated above for example if   1 and k  00097 then each individual optimally does nothing after t 1  64 reduces risk between t   20 and t 1  does nothing between t 0  18 and t  and increases risk when t  0 t 0  the increased risk taken by all individuals early in the epidemic compresses the epidemic in time the cutoff times t 0  t   t 1 and the peak time t max occur earlier tan when all individuals do nothing the ex ante value if everyone does nothing is 1882 but the equilibrium value 198 welfare is lower in equilibrium than under doing nothing because the transmission externality outweighs the peak load externality imperfect measures to reduce infection even if costless may be suboptimal by contrast deliberately infecting a fraction of the population early even at extra cost increases welfare under some parameter values that match the covid-19 data the policy of infecting part of the population early is difficult to implement even relatively safe vaccines are refused a live unattenuated vaccine the wild-type disease agent likely generates even more opposition although it is probably more immunogenic than safer vaccines another practical problem is evaluating the optimality of any infection control pol-icy including early infection at the start of an epidemic information is limited so the parameters of the disease that determine the optimal control method are imprecisely estimated given the risk of worsening the epidemic by infecting too large a fraction of the population early the principle of first do no harm argues against the early infection strategy an argument against the early infection policy is that the epidemic may not be severe if its peak still leaves spare capacity in the healthcare system then there is no benefit to flattening and spreading the peak the benefit relies on at least partial immunity generated by early infection so is negative for diseases that lie dormant in the organism herpes hiv tuberculosis cancer and flare up later for diseases with a long duration hiv discounting over the course of the epidemic is a significant factor in preferences and welfare discounting reduces the benefit of early infection which moves the peak of the epidemic earlier risk aversion increases the benefit of the early infection policy for at least two reasons a certain early infection with the same expected loss is preferable to an uncertain later one the probability of death is closer to 1 2 at the peak of the epidemic than early on thus generates a lottery with higher variance which a risk averse decision maker dislikes prospect theory preferences on the other hand are risk loving for lotteries with negative outcomes thus reduce the benefit of early infection the benefit calculation for the sir model in this paper assumes random mixing if instead the initially deliberately infected volunteers are quarantined until they recover then the welfare gain relative to standard policies is greater  analysis of austrian covid-19 deaths by age and sex martin posch peter bauer alexander posch franz knig   to the best of our knowledge the most recent published evaluation of austrian covid-19 death data by age and sex is based on the 112 registered covid-19 deaths that were available in the epidemiological reporting system of the federal ministry of social affairs health care and consumer protection in the following abbreviated as ministry of health by 1500 on 31 march 2020 of the total 128 deaths by that time 1 in addition the current marginal age distribution and marginal gender distribution but not the gender distribution per age group of deaths is continuously published on the dashboard of the ministry of health 2 for this analysis we used both the data set from march 31 as well as data from the dashboard including 439 deaths reported by 1100 on 21 april 2020 in both data sets the majority of the deceased are men 61 men by 31 march and 58 by 21 april most of the deceased are over 60 and 55 years of age respectively fig 1a and b when comparing the graphs the different age categories and total number of deaths should be taken into account however the absolute figures must be related to the size of the population in each age group then they can be interpreted as current covid-19 mortality per 10000 people in each age group in austria fig 1c and d accounting for all cases reported to the epidemiological reporting system by 31 march and 21 april respectively this illustration shows a clear age trend and the gender difference is even more pronounced since women are in the majority in the upper age groups of the population it should be noted that the graphs do not show the infection fatality rate defined as the proportion of fatalities among infected persons but the proportion of registered covid-19 deaths in relation to the general population the age dependency of mortality rates is not unusual also the normal mortality risk depends strongly on age the mortality tables show for each age and sex the number of people who die in the next year of life fig 2a red and blue lines per 10000 people in that age and sex group the risk of mortality is high at birth but then drops below 001 by age 7 after that it increases again especially among the more risk-taking young men the risk of men remains higher than that of women until old age and only approaches that of women at the end of the curve if we compare this normal mortality risk with the covid-19 mortality until 31 march or 21 april respectively fig 2a and b we see a similar increase although the number of covid-19 deaths registered by the respective survey date scaled to the population size is orders of magnitude lower than the annual mortality rates the proportion of austrians who die from covid-19 by a given date depends on how many people are infected and the risk of death among those infected the so-called infection fatality rate  however estimating infection fatality rates is complex 4 5 a simple but not very reliable estimator is the proportion of observed deaths among those who tested positive however the positively tested are only a part of all infected persons and it is difficult to quantify the dark figure of undetected infections that are mild or even without symptoms it is difficult to determine the number of undetected cases of infected persons as it depends heavily on the number of tests and the testing strategy only representative antibody tests will provide reliable estimates therefore instead of infection fatality rates case fatality rates the number of deaths per registered cases are often considered instead but these are also difficult to estimate during an outbreak of an epidemic because many of those who test positive are still ill when the data is collected and may die within the next few days the case fatality rates however depend sensitively on the number of undetected cases which explains part of the differences between the numbers reported in different countries an indication for the infection fatality rate is provided by the cases on the diamond princess the cruise ship on which all passengers were tested and a mortality rate of 15 11 out of 712 tested positive was observed however the risk of death is strongly age dependent scientists at imperial college london 3 used a model-based approach to estimate the age-dependent risk for infected persons to die from covid-19 sir david spiegelhalter professor of risk communication at the university of cambridge observed that these estimated infection fatality rates were roughly similar to the normal annual mortality risk in the united kingdom 6 7 comparing the infection fatality rate estimates reported in 3 with the normal annual mortality rates for austria we see parallels as well  the estimated risk of death with covid-19 is for the majority of age groups roughly as high as the normal risk of dying within 12 years fig 3 black dots however the risk is not spread over the entire period but concentrated on a much shorter interval we also observe that the number of those who have died in austria with covid-19 per population size in the respective age and sex group have a similar exponential age dependency as the estimated infection fatality rates fig 2a b and 3 on closer inspection one sees that the increase of the former is somewhat steeper this could still be consistent with the infection fatality rate estimates if infection rates are higher in the upper age groups in fact if the number of people who tested positive are put in relation to the population size the current data of the ministry of health show that the group of people over 85 years of age is overrepresented a misinterpretation would be to conclude from these considerations that the risk of death is not increased on the contrary it follows from the structure and magnitude of infection fatality rate that it is substantial especially for higher age groups although it is unclear how many people would have died in the course of the year even without covid-19 disease it can be assumed that the risk of dying from covid-19 is to a substantial extent an additional risk it is not yet known however how many years of life on average one loses through a sars-cov2 infection since many seriously ill patients with already shortened life expectancy are affected the additional effect on the general life expectancy could be less than it would be derived from mortality alone although in the long run the loss of years of life may be a more relevant figure than mortality itself in the short run especially to assess the social impact mortality is of greater importance such risk comparisons put the danger of covid-19 disease into perspective but it is doubtful whether this pandemic can be perceived as less drastic these mortality estimates do not take into account the possible overloading of the healthcare system and the associated indirect effects on mortality of other diseases such as heart attacks strokes or cancer which can no longer be treated appropriately according to estimates by imperial college london 3 5 of infected 40- to 50-year-old people need hospital treatment a figure that rises to over 25 for those over 80 of those treated in hospital about 6 of 40- to 50-year-old people need intensive care and over 70 of those over 80 in order to comprehensively evaluate the effects of the disease it is also necessary to consider in which state of health for example older patients who did not die leave the hospital after intensive care treatment the long-term consequences of the disease are also not yet known therefore comprehensive measures to control the spread of the epidemic are essential to prevent the collapse of the health system it is difficult to include the social and economic consequences of the measures which can also have medical consequences even if deaths are easier to collect than the number of people infected these figures are not without controversy firstly it is often difficult to determine whether a patient dies from covid-19 ie the virus is the cause of death or dies with the virus ie is infected but the cause of death is different two figures are currently reported by the ministry of health those of the deceased who tested positive regardless of the actual cause of death and those who died from covid-19 on the other hand there may also be an unrecorded number since covid-19 deaths may not always be recognized as such more reliable than the number of deaths due to covid-19 is the total number of deaths reports from several countries with stronger outbreaks of the epidemic indicate that the death figures in recent weeks are significantly higher than the long-term averages but also in austria increased death rates especially among the elderly have been reported recently 8 the extent to which the deaths affect people who would have died this year even without covid-19 may become apparent in the annual statistics  does culture matter social distancing under the covid-19 pandemic toan luu duc huynh   with the covid-19 pandemic threatening millions of lives changing our behaviours to prevent the spread of the disease is crucial and timely action mainly practising social distancing compared to the seasonal flu this deadly virus exhibits nearly twice as contagious because the double in the median reproductive index r0 seasonal flu was 128 while this r0 for coronavirus is 22 biggerstaff et al 2014 li et al 2020 it implies that the average person with flu virus will cause the infection to one other person whereas having coronavirus he could infect about two different people in addition the covid-19 also has a longer incubation therefore people could affect to the other without their intentions to be more detail the seasonal flu takes two days to have apparent symptoms however the extant medical evidence shows that the incubation period for covid-19 is up to two weeks li et al 2020 therefore this challenges the health policies to contain this virus the outbreak of coronavirus is causing the worst health crisis because the heavy pressure on the healthcare system exists which was potentially predicted that tens of millions people might die ferguson et al 2020 therefore the recent study of anderson et al 2020 emphasized that the only thing that human can do to stop the covid-19 outbreak is to change their behaviours once again individual behavior will be crucial to control the spread of covid-19 anderson et al 2020 accordingly many suggestions are raised such as washing hands more frequently and for longer avoiding public gatherings cancelling travel plans and keeping a distance from others although the efficiency of these actions is not well examined from academic and scientific evidence until now these recommendations tend to be applicable for many countries to execute at present even this is the global pandemic each country has its response for example vietnam japan taiwan and the other asian countries chose to lock down the national economy as well as applied the strict quarantine at the beginning of the outbreak stage in contrast the united states is likely to overlook this pandemic severity
1 one of the potential concerns might arise from cultural differences across these countries because people might have different perception and viewpoint regarding the covid-19 outbreaks this paper is the first study to examine the global scope data from google covid-19 community mobility reports which allows seeing the changes in the percentage of people gathering in different areas such as retail and recreation grocery and pharmacy parks transit stations workplaces in comparison with the median value of baseline day 16 february 2020 in addition using the cultural dimension from hofstede 2001 study is our main predictive factor to examine the differences in human behaviours across the world our main contribution is to indicate the role of cultural factor in driving the global social distancing activities under the covid-19 pandemic we find that only one factor matters most this is the uncertainty avoidance index uai the higher avoidance in uncertainty the lower gathering in public our results are robust by different regression models as well as the control of wealth status however we do not find any supporting evidence that cultural factors would predict the proportion of people who are staying in the home to practice social distancing our results will suggest several health implications to the authorities by framing people about uncertainty avoidance feature to encourage people mitigating social gathering the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 will acknowledge the related literature about how social distancing works and the role of cultural factors in human behaviours under pandemic section 3 describes our data collection data processing and descriptive statistics before giving our conclusions and discussion in section 5 section 4 summarizes our main findings and results to begin with mahtani et al 2020 provided a rapid summary of the evidence for social distancing during global pandemics this systematic study also emphasizes that the timing and duration of such measures are quite essential to contain the disease outbreaks also the strategy in staggering and implementing cumulative interventions might prove most effective in the previous pandemic such as influenza pandemics therefore what people did in the previous outbreaks might be helpful in the covid-19 tough time fong et al 2020 rashid et al 2015 indicated the effectiveness of six measures to reduce community influenza transmission through a policy review of social distancing practices such as isolating ill people tracing contacts quarantine of exposed persons school dismissals or closures changes in the workplace and avoiding crowds and restricting movement at present many countries are following to shut down the educational system performing the national lockdown and forcing their citizens to stay at home the empirical studies have indicated the efficiency of social distancing in particular remuzzi and remuzzi 2020 alerted that the european countries should avoid close contact at the individual level and social meetings in each country this is the only effective way to contain the spread of this virus in the same vein there might be 176 million people who would be saved their lives if the united states practicing social distancing greenstone and nigam 2020 however greenstone and nigam 2020 also concerned the cost-benefit analysis of social distancing when applying in the enforced ways however in reality each country has its own way to implement social distancing for instance the russian is using the financial penalty for those who do not follow the instructions the philippines and india are the typical examples to arrest those who violate the social distancing practices instead of using strict regulation some countries are using the media tools to disseminate their policies to nudge people to perform social distancing interestingly lunn et al 2020 used the experiments to investigate how to motivate social distancing in ireland this study found that the thought of infecting vulnerable people or large numbers of people could encourage social distancing by using a sample of 500 respondents this is one of the critical findings to indicate that human behaviour can change if we understand the participants judgements about this deadly virus meanwhile lerner et al 2015 asserted that the rational information process not emotional responses despite the evidence mainly drives human behaviours however the understandings of this virus as well as risk perception about the current pandemic are quite ambiguous and not the same to every country thus the actions by the government are quite different over the foremost period it implies that this might be cultural differences in their decision-making across countries which we would like to examine this study when it comes to the theoretical framework for culture and social distancing we would like to acknowledge the cultural psychology which identifies the likelihood of human behaviors on the societal values under the covid-19 pandemic it is undeniable that humans behaviors are mainly based on what they perceive others in the community are doing or approvedisapprove of cialdini et al 2004 therefore the roles of culture as well as social norms heterogeneously drive human behaviors for instance while the asian countries have applied the strict and punishable rules on social distancing as the tight cultures the european countries are likely to be loose culture in recommending people to stay at home gelfand et al 2011 the previous studies such as harrington and gelfand 2014 gelfand et al 2011 indicate that the tight culture is associated with natural disasters invasions population density and pathogen outbreaks therefore these countries will form the group to coordinate as well as collaborate to keep people together during a crisis in contrast the loose culture will prioritize the privacy as well as freedom of each individualism from this perspective this has a partial connection with the cultural dimension in hofstede 2001 that people coming from individualism countries are not likely to commit the social distancing as the governmental suggestions to sum up people have to tradeoffs between their freedom and constraints from the different viewpoints across societies when doing social distancing gelfand 2019 one cultural aspect influencing the human behavior is political polarization some countries might think that the popularization of information seems to cause lower political trust hetherington and weiler 2009 therefore people in these societies might believe in the misleading information which induces the wrong decision-making in the pandemic period van bavel and pereira 2018 thus the political opinion will gradually transmit to the human behavior through one of cultural dimensions particularly as masculinity versus femininity and in power distancing index of the hofstede measurements lastly the human decision-making during a pandemic involves uncertainty because people tend to avoid the uncertainties if they perceived higher risk huynh 2020 in addition those who are risk-adverse might commit to social distancing furthermore the extant literature shows that human behaviors might be affected by the others by comparing to themselves for example atanasov et al 2013 garcia-retamero and galesic 2012 hence looking at the uncertainty dimension might offer us how people react in terms of the uncertain situations regarding the covid-19 outbreaks recently the study of caria et al 2020 indicated that there is heterogeneous behaviors among 51 countries in terms of social distancing according to this study peru is the country which exhibits the highest number of people choosing i stayed at home for the past week interestingly our dataset from google also confirms that peru ranked the second in the countries who have the highest percentage increase in residential the caria 2020 study is one of the international surveys to investigate the human behaviors as well as their belief in terms of following the social distancing under the covid-19 outbreaks in the light of how people behave the social distancing broniec et al 2020 explain that social distancing can keep flattening the infected curve which helps to remain the number of infection cases within the range of the healthcare capacity thus using the cultural factors to examine their roles on encouraging the social distancing is crucial at that time therefore we acknowledged the theoretical background that how cultures and social norms might matter to social distancing however this is the first empirical study which investigates this relationship in-deep we used the data provided by google to observe the level of social distancing taking place in various locations such as retail and recreation grocery and pharmacy parks transit stations workplaces and residential these data are the anonymous locations to trackback several weeks over the changes across 131 countries and individual counties across the world this data represents the aggregation numbers instead of individual-level therefore it does not show the absolute values of how many people are staying in specific areas however these data exhibit the percentage changes implying the potential surges in attendance compared to the median value of baseline time specifically february 16 2020 our data were retrieved on march 29 2020 hence these numbers explain how the trends vary over 13 days in different countries for instance if the number of retail and recreation means -52 it means that vietnam has seen a 52 drop in retail and recreation moreover the positive value implies the opposite direction for example the residential in italy is 24 referring to a 24 increase in residential population over the period from february 16 to 29 march 2020 the following data that we use in our estimates are cultural dimensions from the extended version of hofstede 2001 in 2015 therefore we have three main dimensions to capture the social distancing of people across the world in particular we use four main cultural dimensions that are relevant to social distancing
power distancing index pdi
 this index demonstrates the measurement of how acceptable that society has the hierarchy of power and wealth among the general population of a nation cultural or business the higher value stands for a strong hierarchy
individualism versus collectivism idv this index captures the degree to which the community reinforces individual or collective achievement people in the individualism society are expected to be different as individual as compared to loyal affiliation to a life-long in-group for example extended family friend etc the opposite side is collectivism
uncertainty avoidance index uai
 this element represents that society is afraid of uncertain unknown and unstructured situations hence this proxy can capture cultural perception in an ambiguous context in decision-making
 
table 1
presents a summary of descriptive statistics among our variables overall people around the world tend to reduce their gathering in the transit stations for example the airport and the retail area over the last 13 days to our great surprise the workplace is the place where people are less likely to reduce their working gathering although many governments are calling for working from home parks and grocery places have similar patterns in mitigating human interactions noticeably there is one country which experiences an increase in gathering people in parks and grocery it is the south of korea when this authority is performing the mass testing in the public community in addition the south korea is the typical example that flattened its coronavirus curve and people tend to come back their normal lives with keeping the distance at least two meters interesting the lowest value in staying a residential place is taiwan at present taiwan is likely to control the current situation see table 2
 as the beginning we have 131 countries and regions observations in the google social distancing indices which is illustrated in figure 1
 after matching with hofstede indices we have the total 58 observations for further estimations in addition to compare the differences across the continents we also match each country with each region such as the asian europe latin america as well as oceania and australia to examine the differences across the continents to consider whether we should put as a control variable or not 
figure 2
represents the correlation matrix among our main variables first it is very intuitive to observe that the numbers of social distancing proxies highly correlated meanwhile the lower gathering percent in workplace the higher percent in residential areas it implies that the work from home might be effective because people can increase their likelihood to stay at home second when looking at the cultural dimensions uncertainty avoidance index exhibits the negative correlation with the majority of social distancing index except residential it means that people coming from the countries with risk-adverse tend to reduce their frequency to go the public negative values and stay more at home 017 noticeably citizens from high individualism country are likely to come to the parks more frequency 017 instead of having a decrease in this percentage numbers because the five factor such as in retail grocery parks stations workplaces stand for the decrease in percentage compared to the median value of baseline this number also represents the human behaviors in the outdoor activities thus we perform the explanatory factor analysis to construct one proxy from these data which is representative to the outdoor social distancing 
table 1 demonstrates the number of factor that satisfies the eigen value accordingly there should have one factor generated with the explanatory of variance is 8219 table 3
summarizes the proportion that each variable contributing to the social distancing variable by checking correlation with residential - the increasing percentage of people who stay at home the correlated value is -07587 p  001 if people are not likely to gather in the public implying the decrease in the percentage of social distancing the proportion in residential areas would rise accordingly before performing the regression to examine the relationship between the cultural dimensions and the efficiency of social distancing we executed the one-way analysis of variance and covariance anova to see whether the difference in social distancing across the continents our results suggest that significant at the 10 level differences among the four continents with f-statistics 228 df  3 in addition the anova test for residential effect has f-statistics 214 df  3 is insignificant thus it implies that the geographical effect does not apply in the social distancing we decided to not add this factor as our control variable however the use of gdp per capita as control variable is applied in many cultural economics studies including getzner 2002 dieckmann 1996 hence in our regression we performed two estimates including with-and-without the natural logarithm of gdp per capita to assure the robust of our conclusions 
table 4
summarizes our main findings how the cultural factors can influence the efficiency of social distancing captured by the changing proportion of people in the outdoor activities over the period from february 16 to 29 march 2020 the robust coefficients appear in the proxy of uncertainty avoidance index across four regression models the negative coefficients are consistent to our expectations it means that people coming from higher uncertainty avoidance index would decrease their likelihood in joining in the outdoor activities in this period our finding also confirms the theoretical framework that risk-adverse citizens would do social distancing by not going to grocery pharmacy workplace or parks kappes et al 2018 emphasized that human behaviors will change when they perceive the possibility to transmit risk to others for instance when co-workers think that their decision to go to work might risk infecting the elderly colleagues suffering a serious illness they might stay at home concomitantly andreoni and bernheim 2009 offer another perspective that the british and american are unlikely to stay at home to work if they think that the risk of illness transmission is uncertain these theoretical frameworks also explain why people coming from the higher uncertainty avoidance index tend to avoid the activities in the public in our study the sole explanatory of uncertainty avoidance index on social distancing is 114 while the combination with the other determinants improve the explanation up to 1991 
table 5
chronologically presents the different regressions how the cultural dimensions could predict the proportion of people staying at residential area to our great surprise three cultural factors could not predict the changes in residential areas over last 13 days it means that cultural factors could not explain why people choose to stay at home however the uncertainty avoidance index plays a predictive role on explain why citizens coming from high risk-adverse countries avoid gathering our results are robust when controlling the wealth status 
figure 3
demonstrates the relationship between the uncertainty avoidance index and changes in proportion of social distancing at the public overall the european countries have the higher uncertainty avoidance in addition over last 13 days the government well applied the lockdown to compulsorily request people to stay at home as social distancing interestingly the northern european such as finland sweden and norway are unlikely to commit social distancing since these countries have lower uncertainty avoidance indices currently the best advice from public health authorities are sending the prominent messages that in order to contain the coronavirus pandemic people must take their actions to change their behavior one of the important behaviors is social distancing this is the first country-level research to examine the role of cultural factors on driving the efficiency of social distancing by using two dataset such as the google trackback and the extended hofstede 2001 in reality the human behaviors about social distancing are heterogeneous across the countries currently the world needs to obtain the systematic actions from many countries and regions to ask people to perform the social distancing as the forced legitimation however people are allowed to go to grocery pharmacy transit stations or parks and so forth as their necessity needs this also has the potential risks to infect and to be infected thus this study found that the country with higher uncertainty avoidance index from the hofstede 2001 dimension has less proportion in gathering at these abovementioned public areas however we do not find any evidence to explain the changes in the proportion of people staying at residential places our study also confirms the finding from borg 2014 gaygsz et al 2017 that the cultural determinants play an important role in controlling infection behavior our suggestions are to embed core cultural values relevant to potential threats when going to the public to nudge people to avoid the social gathering under the covid-19 pandemics this is understandable to let people understand that they might have potential incubation period to infect to the others in addition this should be taken into account when interacting with the strangers in the public might increase the risky likelihood to get the coronavirus our study provides an evidence that public health strategies and interventions should be immediately taken actions to reduce the social gathering by uncertainty avoidance factor our study has been analyzed much more rapidly from preliminary evaluation than would be standard for research of this type therefore the further research about the cultural factors and the efficiency of social distancing need to be examined to draw more conclusions to the health authorities to the pandemics this study was funded by university of economics ho chi minh city vietnam the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  this newly recognized coronavirus makes one wonder why we were so unprepared charles calisher h   in late 2019 the chinese government notified the world health organization that it had detected a hitherto unrecognized coronavirus now named sars-cov-2 in people with respiratory distress some had died and the disease was reported to be spreading httpswwwwhointcsrdon05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-chinaen of course the disease was not spreading it was the virus that causes the disease that was spreading  and frighteningly fast and far it was obvious then that this might become a global problem and it has become just that a pandemic the government of china and in particular the chinese investigators studying this problem deserve recognition and praise for the courageous work they did in the early days of this extraordinary event although sars-cov-2 is related to sars-cov the causative agent of sars it differs sufficiently in many ways enough to give it a different name and to consider it a very different virus its rapid spread essentially world-wide now threatens to cause thousands if not millions of fatalities globally at the time of this writing we cannot see over the horizon to its end perhaps some plant extract existing or newly formulated anti-viral drug or other developed substance will be found to be effective in treating the disease caused by sars-cov-2 more likely it will take an effective and safe vaccine to end this horror that will not be simple and straightforward early observations of patients suffering from infection with this virus suggested that young people were not sickened by it old people were killed by it and those in between became sick but recovered relatively quickly from infection with it it was not long before this supposed relatively simple clinical picture was seen to be incorrect now the epidemiologic observations regarding a larger number of patients indicate that the death rate in males is greater than the death rate in females that older people with co-morbidities are more likely to die than are otherwise healthy people also young people can be infected with sars-cov-2 albeit with a lower case-fatality rate but also shed virus and older patients can become ill and shed virus for how long and by what routes critically people in all age groups may become infected with the virus but some of them may shed virus yet do not become ill it is important to recognize that all people not infected with sars-cov-2 themselves comprise a susceptible population a harbinger of the next round of illnesses caused by this virus this is a frightening potential situation and one suggesting that total elimination of sars-cov-2 is unlikely thus what will occur when the personal controls we humans have self-applied are considered no longer necessary will the populace simply be relieved and wander out of their houses to resume life as before it is likely that life as we knew it will not be as it was before this disease was recognized there will be no miracle that occurs to make all surfaces safe on day one in summary sars-cov-2 has led to a disastrous situation and one with which the medical community of each nation must manage in some way perhaps through world health organization protocols perhaps by a novel approach because humans infected with sars-cov-2 may shed virus before they become ill or even if they never become ill they may serve as reservoirs of the virus this is a principal reason for patients and non-patients alike not to contact anyone other than a house-mate spouse children and anyone else sharing living quarters for two weeks or longer this is called social distancing but it is actually physical distancing because computers telephones the mail system and many other tools allow us to socialize at a distance rumors in the popular press have not helped the public understand the situation and statements by politicians as always bend the truth either intentionally or because they do not understand what the truth is the spike proteins of coronaviruses mediate viral entry into cells by binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes 5 however preliminary evidence suggests that in some instances igg-virus complexes may make possible the entry of viruses to cells and infection of those cells by what has been called antibody-dependent enhancement in so doing increasing severity of infection 67 this phenomenon has been shown to occur in infections with feline coronavirus sars-cov mers coronavirus influenzaviruses zika virus human immunodeficiency virus and dengue viruses and probably occurs with other viral infections or after certain vaccinations more relevant to the current pandemic it may be that older patients produce high affinity igg antibody and younger patients do not thus older patients might very well not respond as desired to a vaccine treatment with monoclonal antibody or immune serum transfer as older patients are the ones at higher risk of deadly outcome vaccination might not be suitable in this instance i hope i am wrong about this so was the sars experience just the disease of the week or month or year it was discovered in 2003 and disappeared after 2004 after it had spread from asia to north america south america and europe as is typical funding to support research on this disease declined precipitously that is also typically unfortunate as it is only research that can maintain and defend preparedness huge amounts of money have been spent to gather information we hoped would lead to the prediction of outbreaks obviously we have accomplished little in this regard a lesson in itself but have we learned nothing perhaps each country wealthy or poor should consider putting some proportion of its income into a fund put aside as a contingency in the event of an inevitable emergency that such a fund might have to come from additional taxes is no reason to ignore this possibility pay it now or pay it later  or pay the consequences governments that do not protect their citizens from diseases are simply criminal enterprises as humans continue to plunder the natural world by using such extractive sources such as coal oil and other forms of non-renewable energy we scavenge in unexplored areas containing wildlife that likely are infected with presently unrecognized viruses that are potential pathogens for humans andor livestock andor other wildlife recent cross-species transmission events particularly those jumping from wildlife infected with genetically malleable rna viruses have been shown to be the primary source of recently recognized human pathogens 8 how many more potential human pathogens are there still and thankfully unrecognized what do we do with the possibly predictive information we gather when a previously unknown virus is recognized do we continue to repeat over and over again our discoveries and our errors are we as a species committing suicide note at the time this opinionated column was written at least 1 000 000 people have been infected with sars-cov-2 and nearly 50 000 have died china italy spain and the usa have suffered most the end is not in sight and the devastation this virus has caused will undoubtedly lead not only to human physical misery and great sadness but to economic turmoil   katrien deroey l b miriam taverniers  this paper presents a comprehensive overview of lexicogrammatical devices which highlight important or relevant points in lectures despite the established usefulness of discourse organizational cues for lecture comprehension and note-taking very little is known about the marking of relevance in this genre the current overview of lexicogrammatical relevance markers combines a qualitative and quantitative investigation of 160 lectures from the british academic spoken english base corpus these markers could mostly be classified according to their main element into adjective noun verb and adverb patterns verb patterns were the most common followed by noun patterns the verb pattern v clause eg remember slavery had already been legally abolished and the noun pattern mn v-link eg the point is are the predominant types of relevance markers the discrepancy between the prevalent markers and what may be thought of as prototypical or included in eap textbooks as relevance markers also demonstrates the need for corpus linguistic research implications for eap course design teaching english for lecturing purposes and educational research are discussed  a growing number of non-native speakers need to deliver and to understand lectures in english due to the internationalization of tertiary education the establishment of english as the lingua academica jenkins 2011 phillipson 2008 p 250 and the continuing importance of the lecture these international lecturers teaching assistants and students may benefit from english courses tailored to meet their particular communicative needs in lectures this corpus-based study adds to our knowledge of lecture discourse by reporting on ways in which important points are highlighted in this way we aim to inform the design of such courses by providing an overview of authentic relevance markers that can be used to help students identify important points and that may assist lecturers or teaching assistants in marking these effectively since the knowledge gained from lectures forms a critical part of assessment and thus academic success it is important to ensure they are sufficiently understood to allow adequate note-taking assimilation and recall an essential aspect of successful lecture comprehension and delivery is the ability to distinguish between important and less important information flowerdew 1994 kiewra 2002 lynch 1994 mulligan  kirkpatrick 2000 tyler 1992  yet both native and non-native speakers are reported to have significant difficulties in discerning the main lecture points in fact some note-taking studies have found that native speakers generally only record up to 40 of the main points see titsworth  kiewra 2004 for an overview non-native speakers comprehension and note-taking can additionally be compromised by inadequate understanding of english by the lecturers speech rate nesi 2001 and pronunciation williams 1992  and by differences in discourse expectations background knowledge and educational culture duszak 1997 flowerdew  miller 1996 nesi 2001  however even those with apparently adequate language skills may fail to identify the overall lecture structure and main points allison  tauroza 1995 clerehan 1995 olsen  huckin 1990  discourse organizational cues have widely been advocated as a significant means of improving lecture comprehension note-taking and recall eg allison  tauroza 1995 bjrkman 2011 decarrico  nattinger 1988 jung 2003 kiewra 2002 lynch 1994 titsworth  kiewra 2004 tyler 1992 williams 1992  nevertheless surprisingly little is known about the verbal cues used to highlight important or relevant information the main study so far is by crawford camiciottoli 2004 camiciottoli   2007  who identified 12 lexicogrammatical patterns functioning as audience-oriented relevance markers in a small corpus of business studies lectures these contain relevance adjectives eg important metalinguistic nouns eg point determiners deictics eg this it eg it is crucial that what eg what is important is and there eg theres an issue here about this investigation uses the british academic spoken english base corpus 1 to present the most comprehensive account to date of how lectures highlight important information using overt lexicogrammatical devices the findings provide valuable input for eap listening courses lecturer training programmes and experimental studies on lecture comprehension and note-taking relevance markers a term adopted from hunston 1994 p 198  are here defined as lexicogrammatical devices that overtly mark the relative importance or relevance of points which are presented verbally or visually they are metadiscursive devices which can be considered an interactive feature of lecture discourse as they accommodate the audiences need for guidance in distinguishing between more and less important discourse crawford camiciottoli 2004 camiciottoli   2007 hence calls these audience-oriented relevance markers other terms include emphasis markers jung 2003  emphatics bondi 2008  emphasizers siepmann 2005  importance cues kiewra 2002  saliency markers heino tervonen  tommola 2002  selection cues titsworth  kiewra 2004  focus formulas tuggy 1996  and focusers simpson 2004  they have also been included in such categories as text-structuring metadiscourse thompson 2003  macromarkers chaudron  richards 1986  pragmatic force modifiers lin 2010  metapragmatic signals flowerdew 1994  identificationfocus bundles and attitudinal stance bundles biber 2006a  evaluators decarrico  nattinger 1988  and evaluation phase young 1994  relevance markers organize discourse by establishing a hierarchy of importance of lecture points deroey  taverniers 2011 and present the lecturers attitudinal evaluation of these along a parameter of importance or relevance thompson  hunston 2000 p 24  this combined function is central to our definition of relevance markers on the one hand we have focused on the evaluation of discourse entities thetela 1997  cited in hunston 2000 182 ie evaluation on the interactive plane of discourse sinclair 2004  thus an important point is considered an instance of discourse evaluation while an important philosopher is disregarded because important here evaluates a world entity thetela 1997  cited in hunston 2000  and so exemplifies evaluation on the autonomous plane of discourse sinclair 2004  in other words we are interested in instances of evaluation where the lecturer acts as text constructor rather than informer hunston 2000 p 183  on the other hand discourse organizational cues without evaluation of importance eg the next point is were also not taken into account the relevance markers were drawn from the 160 lectures of the british academic spoken english base corpus these are mostly delivered by native speakers of english and are distributed across four broad disciplinary groups arts and humanities ah social studies ss physical sciences ps and life and medical sciences ls a subcorpus of 40 lectures ten per disciplinary group was created for the initial manual search of relevance markers study level interactivity and audience size were systematically varied in a pilot study of four lectures from the subcorpus we independently identified lexicogrammatical devices which appeared to highlight points subsequent comparison and discussion refined our inclusion criteria in four main ways first pure discourse organizational cues without evaluation were excluded 1 although they may help identify the main points swales 2001  they lack an explicit marking of relevance 1 so one of the questions that arises what do i really mean by better adapted lslct001 a a note that the first person singular pronoun in examples is rendered as it occurs in the lecture transcripts that is in lower case a second complicating factor in the analysis was distinguishing between the evaluation of discourse entities and world entities while this distinction is arguably artificial it is inherent to quantitative research on metadiscourse for this study we excluded instances where disambiguation using the transcript only was impossible 2 in 2 for example it is unclear whether the thing is used discussively meaning a point or non-discussively meaning a feature cf swales 2001  2 they certainly havent got any hair nude mice have no hair but thats not the important thing the important things about nude mice is that they dont have a thymus lslct006 in a similar way we excluded instances where the evaluated world entity is the discourse topic as in 3 3 now then so we have metal-hydrogen metal-hydrogen is a very important reaction and its really based on the fact that the organometallic compounds lets say of lithium are very sensitive pslct003 third relevance marking of student or third party discourse eg an important point that nozick makes is was excluded as strictly speaking this does not highlight the lecturers discourse admittedly however much lecture discourse is a representation of other peoples discourse and the exclusion here pertains only to instances which are attributed fourth it was impossible to exclude reliably the highlighting of information presented visually eg in slides and handouts on the board the inclusion of instances of such metasemiotic evaluation baldry  thibault 2006 p 99  is moreover important in creating a representative picture of relevance marking in this genre as visuals are an integral part of lecture delivery using a definition of relevance markers refined by the above considerations a close reading by the first author of the other 36 lectures in the subcorpus yielded further lexemes which could mark relevance these were then retrieved from all 160 lectures using the concordancing tool sketch engine in this as in all other searches co-text beyond the concordance was examined as necessary to determine whether a lexeme functioned as part of a relevance marker ungrammatical and disfluent instances were retained if analysable further candidates for relevance marking in the immediate co-text and in a frequency list of words with p50 occurrences in the base lectures were also searched additionally a few relevance adjectives were adopted from swales and burke 2003 and crawford camiciottoli 2004 and the adjective-and noun-based lexicogrammatical patterns of relevance markers listed in crawford camiciottoli 2007 p 98 were searched empty ie without specifying particular adjectives or nouns using corpus query language to identify further lexis finally we searched words which were derived from or synonymous with lexemes found through the above procedures cf giannoni 2010  this multipronged approach yielded adjectives metalinguistic nouns verbs and adverbs which could function as or in relevance markers and which generally appeared in recurring lexicogrammatical patterns see section 4 interestingly most lexemes were retrieved manually from the subcorpus and all approaches were complementary for instance the word frequency list yielded adverbs which were not found in the subcorpus but did not contain the multi-word items discovered when examining the subcorpus eg bear in mind bottom line to further temper some of the subjectivity that is inevitable in analysing evaluation a sample of 120 instances of these patterns was independently rated for their status as relevance markers by the second author after discussion full agreement was reached on their in-or exclusion as relevance markers two limiting factors in the analysis should be noted as we have used transcripts only visual non-verbal and prosodic clues were not taken into account furthermore as is typical for research on ready-made corpora there was no triangulation so that we do not know what information the lecturer intended to highlight or what was perceived as important our account is thus based on judgments of plausibility rather than certainty mann  thompson 1988  cited in siepmann 2005  the methodology and definition used here yielded 782 instances of relevance markers or approximately seven instances per 10000 words 3 however this average conceals considerable variation as about half the lectures contain fewer than four instances and about a sixth contain ten or more although it would be interesting to explore this and other idiolectic and disciplinary variation this is beyond the scope of this article an inspection of the concordances uncovered similarities in the elements and structure of relevance markers that could be represented as patterns hunston  francis 2000  depending on their main element or focus hunston  francis 1998 p 49  relevance markers were classified with a particular adjective noun verb or adverb pattern to keep the overview transparent and practitioner-friendly we have adopted a fairly generalizing approach to this classification postmodification eg about that and ellipsis of the link verb or determiner are not specified in the pattern so that 4 is classified as mn v-link a metalinguistic noun with the link verb is 4 and the point about that it holds for all sets a pslct025 instances with embedding have also been simplified so that 5 and 6 are respectively viewed as variants of 2 pers pron v n second person pronoun verb nominal complementation and there v-link adj mn there link verb adjective metalinguistic noun 5 its the only number you need to remember lslct033 6 theres something very important to note about this pslct010 the category assessment-related expressions cf section 45 contains the few instances which did not fit these patterns as can be seen in table 1  verb patterns are overwhelmingly the most frequent relevance markers followed by noun patterns this predominance is largely due to the prevalence of v clause verb with clausal complementation 7 and mn v-link 8 7 remember slavery had already been legally abolished ahlct008 8 the point is that people cant do that sslct028 the main words in adjective noun verb and adverb patterns are respectively important point remember and importantly see appendix for a full list of focus elements relevance markers further vary in their textual and interactive orientation see table 2  interestingly and reassuringly most highlight following points such prospective marking is likely to benefit online processing and note-taking and also reflects the semi- planned nature of lectures typically the highlighted statement is included in the clause containing the relevance marker 9 alternatively it is encapsulated by a deictic and subsequently stated in full 10 9 note that in spenser the weather is always there ahlct010 10 the point is this in in many member states in the european communities as they then were accounting regulation is entirely by law sslct007 retrospective relevance markers are considerably less common and are chiefly restricted to patterns containing a deictic with anaphoric reference 11 he was very largely influenced by his religious upbringing and thats important to know ahlct024 in a few cases a restatement of the highlighted discourse follows retrospective relevance marking an especially strong highlighting effect is created when an immediately preceding point is restated 12 such action as it deems necessary now this is an essential point such action as it deems necessary sslct019 in this regard it is also noteworthy that relevance markers often co-occur with discourse markers mainly and but now and so cf 12 to some extent this reflects the position of many relevance markers at transition points but some discourse markers may also have an attention-focusing effect cf brinton 1996  interactively relevance markers are orientated towards the listeners the speaker the listeners and speaker jointly or the content about half are listener-orientated including pronouns referring to the listener andor verbs denoting listener actions 13 speaker-orientated markers refer to the speaker andor contain verbs denoting speaker actions 14 some patterns combine both listener-and speaker-orientation 15 content-orientated relevance markers contain no such references or verbs 16 13 so you have to remember this part is permeable to water lslct029 14 i ought to stress that im talking about vectors here pslct031 15 so were interested in the gradient here pslct030 16 thats an important point sslct003 these differences in textual and interactive orientation also affect the clarity and possibly effectiveness of relevance marking for instance prospective listener-orientated marking 13 often seems the clearest clarity may also vary with explicitness for example instances with relevance adjectives 16 mark relevance explicitly while those which are multifunctional eg the thing is or contain polysemous lexemes eg note are arguably harder to recognize as signaling relevance and seem more muted signals swales  burke 2003 p 17   in adjective patterns the main element is an adjective adj conveying relevance adjectives expressing another type of evaluation in addition to relevance such as crucial cf swales  burke 2003 and interesting cf crawford camiciottoli 2004 peacock 2011 were included where the co-text suggests a primary relevance reading for example in 17 that said to notice and the that-clause suggest it is interesting to notice functions as a relevance marker 17 so we cannot get along without either of them have to have both in order to cope best with pathogens that said its interesting to notice that you only get adaptive immunity in in vertebrates lslct036 to represent the surface patterning of similar concordances hunston and francis 2000 notation system is used the pattern focus is in upper case other elements are in lower case and lexemes are in italics for simplicitys sake the overview does not specify the type of clausal or nominal complementation the adjectives are used predicatively see table 3  a verb v-link links the adjective to a deictic deic metalinguistic noun mn anticipatory it or what in extraposition constructions the adjective precedes a clause in wh-clefts it precedes nominal n or clausal complementation although adjectives are considered prototypical realisations of evaluation eg swales  burke 2003  adjective patterns are in fact comparatively infrequent relevance markers ca 7 important which has been associated with academic prose biber johansson leech conrad  finegan 1999 p 517 swales  burke 2003  predominates as the focus the rare cases of adjectival premodification eg absolutely very are mainly restricted to this adjective the predominant pattern it v-link adj clause represents cases of extraposition surprisingly in crawford camiciottolis study 2004 2007 of relevance markers in 12 business studies lectures and 10 multi-disciplinary lectures from micase 4 this pattern is infrequent instead the most frequent pattern there is deic v-link adj which in base was far less common as a relevance marker than extraposition it is however difficult to draw conclusions from a comparison with crawford camiciottolis study as her corpus is much smaller and more homogeneous in disciplinary terms and as the information on search methods and inclusion criteria provided does not allow us to establish methodological causes that may account for different findings this infrequent pattern is one of the few retrospectively orientated ones an anaphoric deictic usually this or that creates cohesion by encapsulating a preceding statement and making it available for evaluation gray 2010  about half the instances contain adjectives with to-infinitive clauses conveying the mental action to be performed by the listener 18 thats important to know ahlct024 in the rare pattern mn v-link adj a metalinguistic noun encapsulates a preceding point which is evaluated as relevant 19 this thing here is important pslct011 in common with deic v-link adj this encapsulation creates cohesion but would also seem to require more processing effort as the listener has to infer the referent this prevalent pattern has previously been reported to typically contain evaluative adjectives eg hunston  sinclair 2000 peacock 2011 and to emphasize noteworthy points hewings  hewings 2001  it appears particularly listenerfriendly in that it extraposes a relatively long subject signals important points prospectively and explicitly and renders sslct028 speaker-oriented i just want to point out here that its not just your arterioles lslct005 listener and speakeroriented we should note that the process only takes place after a lengthy period of instruction ahlct032 content-oriented this is absolutely crucial lslct038 the highlighted discourse completely the chief adjectives are important and worth anticipatory it mainly projects non-finite clauses with verbs denoting the speakers communicative actions 20 or the listeners mental actions 21 20 its important to say that its actually quite rare sslct016 21 its worth remembering that italy has a huge history ahlct015 although basic wh-clefts are common in the base corpus and serve an important highlighting function deroey 2012  instances with relevance adjectives in the wh-clause are rare 22 what is important to grasp is that our immune system can actually respond to almost anything lslct036 as shown in table 4  in noun patterns the focus is a metalinguistic noun mn which is sometimes premodified by a relevance adjective these patterns mostly signal relevance prospectively the attested metalinguistic nouns are idea point question and thing see also crawford camiciottoli 2004  2007 swales 2001 and the conversationally flavoured bit 23 bottom line message and moral 23 the important bit is that if its an algebraic integer then the absolute value of this quotient is nought pslct037 such nouns encapsulating discourse have also been called signalling nouns flowerdew 2003  discourse labels francis 1994  anaphoric nouns francis 1986  cited in schmid 2000  general nouns halliday  hasan 1976 and shell nouns hunston  francis 2000 schmid 2000  point 124 instances is the most frequent followed by thing 63 instances the prevalence of point may reflect the point-driven organization of lectures see olsen  huckin 1991  however it partly also reflects the comparative ease with which metadiscursive uses of point can be distinguished from those with other meanings eg purpose 24 24 the point is for you to develop your own scholarship ahlct015 important is again the predominant adjective 37 instances followed by key 26 instances in addition to the adjectives which also occur in adjective patterns other adjectives and modifiers were found some of which are reminiscent of conversational speech basic big critical essential gotake home key main vital and whole 25-26 25 and big message here allow the markets to function sslct001 26 thats a sort of take home message lslct003 premodification of the adjective is rare but postmodification by a prepositional phrase 27 or relative clause is common clausal postmodification can contain language which suggests a relevance reading or reinforces the highlighting effect 28 to keep the study manageable however these have not been separately investigated or counted 27 but the bottom line of this is from what impression is this pretended this supposed idea derived ahlct037 28 so the moral to remember all the time is that just occasional amino acids at key points in a protein can determine the three-dimensional structure lslct033 most instances contain the determiner the a another and determiner ellipsis 29 are rare as are postdeterminers eg first 29 so first important point is that searle is going to be attacking cognitivism ahlct035 a noteworthy element in the right co-text of some noun-based relevance markers is here which can add saliency to a point that is presented verbally 30 or visually 31 bamford 2004  30 okay so that thats i think the the the main point here about how these films are placed within the film industry ahlct016 31 this diagram is taken from that text where you see if you just take a brief look in the the the main idea here is that we really have a variety of different basic production models sslct030 these equally frequent patterns highlight prior discourse which is encapsulated by a deictic this retrospective relevance marking is often followed by a restatement of the highlighted point creating a sandwiching effect and making points particularly salient 32 mussolini isnt starting something completely new its a key thing here is its not completely new ahlct004 in deic v-link mn the noun is typically followed by a relative clause which helps identify instances of relevance marking in much the same way as do relevance adjectives in deic v-link adj mn 33 thats a a sort of thing that i would emphasize vis  vis the exam sslct012 this is not only the predominant noun pattern but also the second most common type of relevance marker overall interestingly its prevalence stems from repeated use by many lecturers sometimes making it seem more like an interjected discourse marker mn v-link seems fairly casual compared to patterns with an adjective crawford camiciottoli 2004 p 94 and makes the lecturer appear to essentially be a conversationalist with an academic hat on mike mccarthy personal communication 2009  the pattern encompasses both unmodified idiomatic instances biber 2006a sinclair jones daley  krishnamurthy 2004  ca 61 34 and ones postmodified by a prepositional phrase ca 7 35 or relative clause ca 32 36 in the latter case notable collocations are point and make cf also swales 2001 or note and thing with the mental verbs remember or bear in mind 37 34 the thing is that the one of them is not good pslct034 35 the point about it is they contain direct bonds pslct003 36 now the point im making is this ahlct034 37 the thing you have to remember is theres no such thing as the heritability lslct001 for listeners the unmodified instances may be particularly hard to recognize as relevance markers although prosodic and non-verbal clues possibly facilitate their recognition this pattern is probably one that intuitively comes to mind when imagining how lecturers highlight important points indeed it seems particularly listener-friendly in that it prospectively and explicitly signals relevance nevertheless our data only partly confirm such intuitions although it is much more frequent than the retrospectively orientated deic v-link mn and deic v-link adj mn it is by no means as popular as the often less explicit mn v-link similar to deic v-link mn and deic v-link adj mn the noun is usually postmodified by a prepositional phrase 38 or relative clause 39 38 the main point about this is that weve got this whole zoo of of different gauges pslct028 39 now the essential questions that i want to address in talking about this model are the following pslct012 instances of patterns with existential there are infrequent and rarely contain a relevance adjective most contain postdeterminers indicating enumeration thus blurring the boundary between pure discourse organization and relevance marking however clausal postmodification suggests a relevance reading 40 there are two main ideas that you need to keep in mind ahlct024 in verb patterns which are mainly prospectively orientated mental and communication verbs occur with first and second person subject pronouns or without subjects imperatives and to-infinitive clauses verb patterns see table 5  seem the most interactive relevance markers as they explicitly address the listeners andor include them in the unfolding discourse mental verbs predominate and denote memory processes bearkeep in mind forget go away with remember direct attention bringdrawfocuspay attention be interested in note notice take away take note of or refer to knowledge acquisition know learn register understand  their predominance is largely due to the extremely frequent remember 229 instances the communication verbs can be situated along a cline of emphatic force ranging from the clearly emphatic emphasize ise stress reinforce place emphasis and impress on over point out and the least emphatic make athe point and note although the less emphatic verbs are similar in meaning to non-emphatic say the counted instances have a co-text suggesting a relevance reading see also hunston 2002 41 41 i must interrupt myself at that point because i do see you writing away fiercely i want to make a point you get a lot of those approaches again throughout this course really try to listen today dont take so many notes ahlct030 overall clausal is much more frequent than nominal complementation and is chiefly realized by a that-clause 42 finite verb phrases are generally in the simple present and often contain deontic modals eg have to need should 42 in imperative and to-infinitive clauses similar effects are achieved by please do 43 and just 42 we have to bear in mind here in celte that we are working in a multicultural group sslct040 43 please please do learn this lslct005 it is worth noting the occurrence of just 46 instances with verb patterns it precedes all instances of to-inf nclause which announce the lecturers communicative intent 44 and sometimes appears with speaker-orientated 1s pers pron v nclause 45 and the cognitive directive v nclause 46 44 just to emphasize that this is a genuine organometallic compound pslct003 45 i just want to reinforce three things that weve already talked about lslct039 46 just bear in mind thes theyre not absolute values lslct027 this polysemous restrictive adverb cf grant 2011 lin 2010 lindemann  mauranen 2001 here seems to primarily mitigate directive force while also adding emphasis biber et al 1999 charles 2009  other devices used to express cognitive directives more democratically include the much rarer please let  meus modals might can could and would like instead of want 1s pers pron v nclause is exceptional in that it explicitly attributes the evaluation to the speaker combining the first person singular pronoun i with communication verbs mostly point out emphasizeise and stress these verbs sometimes take want or would like more rarely modals expressing advisability 47 or the intention to highlight be going to will occur 47 but i should stress that i dont lecture out of grant sslct032 ahlct027 1p pers pron v nclause were interested in the gradient here pslct030 29 69 we need to remember were talking about proper names ahlct033 2 pers pron v nclause you might want to remember it for the exam pslct029 41 98 you should also note that significance depends on the sample size lsct015 1s pers pron v clause  2 pers pron v nclause i want you to focus your attention on this column here lslct008 10 24 i ask you to bear in mind that these people are fairly intelligent lslct022 to-inf nclause now just to reinforce again this idea of what h-nought is pslct036 6 14 just to emphasize that this is a genuine organometallic compound pslct003 v nclause just remember this lslct028 265 631 notice this is again a matter of express consent sslct017 the simple past and present perfect are often used to refer back to previous discourse which is then highlighted 48 the few relevance markers with present progressive verbs occur as the conclusion of a topic or before a justification for the importance of the point 49 48 again ive pointed out ah that viruses may effect both humans and animals lslct035 49 now i am stressing all this because many of my colleagues construction economists disagree with this proposition sslct006 although these instances resemble pure discourse organization they were counted because listeners would probably perceive them as relevance markers this infrequent pattern combines the first person plural pronoun we with mostly mental verbs eg note remember creating a sense of joint cognitive endeavour and apparently involving the listeners in the lecture most instances of be interested in occur here and establish joint visual attention 50 deontic modals 51 are common 50 so were interested in the gradient here at two-seven-three pslct030 51 we need to remember were talking about proper names ahlct033 here the listeners are directly addressed and directed to perform a mental action mostly represented by remember which probably makes this pattern one of the clearest relevance markers the inclusion of deontic modals makes the directive force obvious 52 in fact instances without these normally appear more like pure discourse organization 53 and were thus not counted 52 you have to remember at the time you couldnt just say protestantism ahlct010 53 you remember we have three types of problems pslct018 this rare explicit pattern consists of a main clause 1s pers pron v clause expressing the lecturers desire for the audience to perform the mental activity expressed in the subclause 2 pers pron v nclause nominal and clausal complementation occur fairly equally 54 ill just ask you to remember this sslct007 the other rare pattern to-inf nclause is an adverbial clause indicating the lecturers purpose and can be considered a casual equivalent of 1s pers pron v nclause both communication 55 and mental 56 verbs occur and all instances are preceded by just see above 55 ive written in the zero formally just to stress that thats a wall that doesnt move pslct022 56 just to draw your attention to one small piece of this poem ahlct011 this imperative pattern containing a mental verb and mostly clausal complementation is the most frequent of all relevance markers this is probably due to various factors most of which are shared by the second most common relevance marker mn v-link first it is reminiscent of conversational speech and is a particularly economical way of marking relevance second some lecturers use it very frequently third instances with the predominant remember are multifunctional cf tao 2001  meaning for instance i want you to remember relevance marker or do you remember checking recollection while discourse participants can use prosodic clues and their knowledge of what was taught previously to help distinguish functions we could only use co-textual clues for instance in 57 the discourse immediately preceding remember facilitates its recognition as a relevance marker 57 if you forget everything else i say just remember that kidney failure causes high blood pressure lslct033 further in utterance-initial position 58 remember is usually followed by complementation rendering a relevance reading more probable than when it occurs alone utterance-finally as a tag 59 tao 2001 p 128 or as a parenthetical insertion tao 2001 p 127 60  instances such as 59-60 were thus not counted admittedly however bringing previous information to bear on a new point may make the reactivated content more prominent in the listeners mind 58 and remember that most developing countries are small sslct008 59 there is a class switch remember lslct006 60 the papilli remember are part of a drainage system of the kidney lslct032 remember keepbear in mind and do not forget direct students to take into account previous discourse or knowledge when considering a new point or specifies what students should take away from the lecture 61 now what did art historians do with that and bear in mind marx was quite quiet about the work of art ahlct030 62 dont forget theyre cells and have some water within them themselves lslct026 note and notice are also common most instances seem to draw attention to visual points 63 here is the source and the destination operands but note that they are specified by quoting the the address of the registers pslct007 64 notice that these results are different from the results with the rats pressing levers sslct027 adverb patterns see table 6  consist of an adverb phrase conveying a judgement of importancewhen functioning as relevance markers the adverbs -notably essentially importantly and significantly -appear clause-initially and mark relevance prospectively they tend to be preceded by but 65 or and 66 which mark the relationship with the preceding discourse see also bondi 2008  furthermore the prevalent importantly is normally premodified by an adverb denoting a comparison in terms of importance with the previous discourse 66 65 well come back to this topic a little later but essentially what im saying is that you could have a word instruction which is sort of adding two data registers together pslct007 66 so it distinguishes between corona viruses and rhinoviruses and more importantly it adapts to the challenge of infecti an infection lslct036 although like adjectives adverbs appear obvious candidates for expressing attitudinal evaluation bondi 2008  their rareness as relevance markers is perhaps not surprising on the one hand stance adverbs in university classroom teaching have been found to mainly express epistemic eg probably rather than attitudinal stance biber 2006b  on the other hand attitudinal stance adverbs vary in their scope and hence status as relevance markers as relevance markers they evaluate the proposition that follows in contrast the instances in 67 68 and 69 were not counted as importantly evaluates the importance of an action 67 significantly premodifies an adjective and relates to statistical significance 68 and essentially may be interpreted as expressing the lecturers intention not to go into detail 69 given that the audio or video files were not consulted we have taken a conservative approach and retained only instances where a relevance reading appears likely 67 we need these kind of externally acquired disciplines to protect us not just from the subject and from others but most importantly from ourselves ahlct012 68 the incidence of disease x in warwickshire is significantly lower than in the rest of the u-klslct015 69 the systemic herbicides interfere with the natural hormones in the plants and essentially they make them grow too fast so the plants cant take in enough nutrients from the or water from the soil lslct004  a few instances eight clearly signaling important points did not fit any pattern these all point out the likelihood of being assessed on particular content and contain exam or examine 70 okay the first one is the consultation procedure and this one encapsulates the the the exam question which you often get sslct025 71 it is something that you can be examined on lslct014 although the lexemes exam examination test and question were searched in the whole corpus extremely few references to assessment were found this is remarkable considering that this is one of the best ways to make students pay attention and that such pointers are very useful in guiding study however we lack information about the position of lectures within lecture series which is important because assessment talk may be concentrated in first and last lectures this paper presents a comprehensive overview of the lexicogrammatical devices marking the importance or relevance of lecture points due to the large corpus and multi-pronged methodology it offers a greater variety of relevance markers than has hitherto been the case crawford camiciottoli 2004  2007 swales  burke 2003  the findings could be incorporated into eap courses for non-native speaker lecturers and students and are also valuable input for subject lecturer training especially in multilingual settings and educational research while eap courses aimed at improving students lecture comprehension and note-taking are already fairly common eap courses for lecturers seem at present rather rare however continuing internationalization combined with a growing recognition of the need to support lecturers in using english for the specific purpose of lecturing will likely lead to an increase in such courses in belgium for instance ghent university provides an english for lecturers course designed by the first author as regards eap course design teaching students and lecturers to respectively recognize and mark important points seems crucial yet published eap materials typically either do not list many lexicogrammatical relevance markers and use examples that are not corpus-based or they focus on prototypical but less common markers such as the important point is however this study shows there is a wide range of relevance markers the most frequent of which mn-link v clause may not be those that intuitively come to mind it would thus be useful to help students recognize a variety of authentic relevance markers in doing so we may want to pay special attention to popular but multifunctional devices such as mn-link and v clause with regard to materials design it is further worth noting that fuller contexts of the markers can be freely searched in the base open corpus through sketch engine the authentic relevance markers provided here can further be used in experimental research on listening comprehension and note-taking educationalists will also be interested in the general picture of relevance marking which emerges more specifically certain findings may be surprising such as the rareness of references to assessment and the variation in clarity as well as textual and interactive orientation of relevance markers may inform courses on effective lecture delivery nevertheless we recognize this study is limited in a number of ways first it surveys only overt lexicogrammatical devices although there are many other ways to highlight points such as intonation stress pausing speech rate volume visual and non-verbal cues discourse markers repetition questions and grammatical constructions such as clefting second to keep the study manageable we have focused on metadiscursive and metasemiotic relevance marking although the evaluation of entities outside the discourse eg an important philosopher possibly also focuses attention on the lecturers talk about such entities third information on points lecturers intended to highlight or listeners perceived as important would be illuminating but could not be obtained this seems an inevitable limitation of using large ready-made corpora for smallscale studies this could partly be resolved by getting other students to read or watch the lecture to identify highlighted points or by analysing which points occur in the conclusions this investigation opens up various avenues for further research into relevance marking for instance it would be interesting to establish how prosodic non-verbal and visual cues combine with lexicogrammatical relevance marking another useful area of investigation is the variation in relevance marking across speakers eg idiolectic variation or variation across british american or l2 speakers of english disciplines lecture cultures eg micase and academic speaking genres eg conference presentations finally we are currently researching how less important points are marked since these indications also help students distinguish between more and less important information verbs    covid-19 and the fears of italian senior citizens diego de leo marco trabucchi   in italy the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 developed with extreme virulence presenting by march an official number of infected and deceased individuals higher than that of china where the pandemic first appeared as of 26 april the united states of america has the largest number of infected people followed by spain whose infected count now exceeds the number of infected people in italy by a few thousand it is worth mentioning that these figures are based only on people who tested positive to the swab and do not reflect the real impact of the infection on the general population which remains unknown furthermore testing modalities and cultural factors could explain at least some of the observed differences between countries however italy is the second countryafter the usin terms of mortality with 26977 deaths 1 the vast majority of these deaths come from individuals aged 70 years more than 84 with approximately 9500 deceased individuals aged 83 years 2  for more than fifty days coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the sars-cov-2 has forced 60 million italians into their homes schools are closed only 30 of all commercial and industrial activities are functioning the pandemic is severely testing the entire italian system in particular its welfare structures the northern regions were the hardest hit with lombardy emilia-romagna piedmont and veneto leading the ranking to cope with the emergency intensive care units were built in record time and entire hospitals were converted into covid-19 care however the pandemic found the country largely unprepared failing to provide on time the necessary protection even to its health workers with serious shortcomings regarding the supply of eyeglasses masks gloves and gowns many health professionals lacked the necessary disaster preparedness so far this has resulted in the loss of 151 doctors and 39 nurses 2 difficulties in assisting critical situations combined with the scarcity of places suitable for the reception of patients in serious conditions and lack of a sufficient number of ventilators have given rise to very painful ethical choices for health professionals on how to prioritize patients for care with the available equipment 3  the authors of this report are the vice-president ddl and the president mt respectively of the italian psychogeriatric association during the pandemic they maintained close contact with many colleagues mostly geriatricians neurologists and general practitioners in total 52 physicians operating in different contexts in italyhospitals nursing homes and their patients homes this article is not written in the form of an original research article but it is intended to be a commentary of what is happening in italy the contents of this report condense the narratives that describe the experiences of those front-line medical doctors with their senior patients during the tragic spread of sars-cov-2 the original narratives of 48 of those physicians were included in a special issue of the journal of the italian psychogeriatric association 4 older adults with chronic poly-pathologies were and still are the subjects who have suffered the most from the reaction difficulties of the italian health system before the pandemic even those living in senior housing communities designed to reduce social isolation reported significant levels of loneliness 5 undoubtedly these are now exacerbated by the rules imposed in quarantine and social isolation in a journal of american medical association viewpoint steinman et al 6 eloquently described the general condition of older adults isolated at home as a consequence of the pandemic here we intend to add some considerations on the peculiar conditions suffered by italian elders in italy in cities of lombardy such as bergamo and brescia the deaths occurred at an impressive rate giving rise to the sad televisions images of long lines of military trucks carrying coffins to incinerators often very far from the place of origin of the deceased there was no way to celebrate funeral rites nor burial in the cemeteries of the place of residence one of the most heartbreaking aspects of the loss of life associated with this pandemic was the inability to accompany loved ones in their last moments of life the isolation imposed by the pandemic means that thousands of subsequently deceased subjects were last seen when an ambulance took them to be hospitalized nursing homes neglected for too long by government administrations have paid a very high price due to the lack of protective measures and the social distancing that covid-19 has imposed in the province of bergamo lombardy in just twenty daysfrom 7 march to 26 marchover 600 deaths occurred in nursing homes with a total accommodation capacity of 6400 beds 7 to date it has been calculated that almost a quarter of all residents in nursing homes in northern italy have died due to covid-19 and that the average age of italians who lost their life with the virus was 79 years 2 older people have been specifically advised to stay home given their particular vulnerability to covid-19 but also to reduce the burden on health services and limit the spread of the disease the negative effects of isolation could be particularly insidious for older adults and people with pre-existing mental illness 8 regular checks by doctors and regular intake of drug therapies can become problematic alcohol intake and smoking can increase frequently eating properly and maintaining personal hygiene can become quite difficult these aspects can increase the sense of demoralization and despair in people forced to live alone and easily suffering from loneliness and social isolation well-known risk factors for suicide in late life 9 indeed self-killing cases have been repeatedly reported in the national press 10 and can be expected as one of the most feared outcomes of the pandemic 11 nursing homes have become like castles under siege where old guests can no longer leave and new guests can no longer enter given the spread of the infection within these institutions 6 healthcare professionals who work there report some peculiar elements of the behavior of the guests of those institutions residents face fear of the disease and anguish for its threatening consequences with mixed attitudes these attitudes range from continuous prayer a rosary to pray has become a frequent request from residents to a nihilistic form of fatalism there is nothing i can do i can only hope death will come without too much suffering episodes of psychomotor agitation that require drug sedation are also quite frequent residents are often seen crying constantly they have lost their roommate or people they have made friends with in the nursing home health workers wearing protections frighten them because this reminds them that the virus is highly contagious therefore getting infected and having the symptoms of the disease would just be a matter of hours when health conditions actually deteriorate many residents express the wish of avoiding hospitalization this is because they do not believe in a favorable treatment outcome and because they think they would only encounter unnecessary pain in complete detachment from the surrounding world they believe that there are no effective therapies and that none of the protocols operating in hospitals would have a positive outcome given that residents usually watch television for most of the time they are now aware that the vast majority of deaths are concentrated among elderly people especially those who suffer from chronic conditions as they know they are if they were to get covid-19 they do not want to be intubated but hope to be treated by someone they already know possibly the same doctors of the nursing home and overall to have the possibility to stay in touch with family members and loved ones 12 by this they mean physical contact in fact many reject the tablet offered for video communications by health workers  for people living in their homes the situation is not very different from that in rest institutions italian elders have become accustomed to days sadly marked by the 600 pm television bulletin of the civil protection which communicates the number of infected people andabove allnumber of people who died in the eyes of older adults of italy those bulletins never miss the opportunity to point out that the greatest number of deaths occurs in the most-advanced age groups with a lethality index number of subjects positive to swab testsnumber of deceased subjects that reaches 30 among those who are 8089 years old the group that comprises most residents of italian nursing homes once again according to data from istituto superiore di sanit 607 of deceased subjects suffered from at least three pre-existing pathologies eg cardiovascular disorders diabetes kidney problems etc they died on average ten days after the clinical onset of symptoms especially fever dyspnea cough etc and five days after hospitalization which in turn occurred five days after the onset of symptoms 2 senior citizens living with family members often refuse to wear mask and gloves at home although they are told that the virus could spread easily among cohabiting people especially in small apartments it would be the will of god they often say similarly to the case of nursing home residents they say if i get sick do not take me to the hospital treatments are useless there and in any case im too old so it would be ok for me to pass away i just want to die in my bed  these days many elders are dictating their last will while the say to their children not to worry too much for them they often ask for the presence of a doctor certifying that they are compos mentis in this way their will would have legal validity another concern is the fear of being buried in mass graves these elders are aware that nobody can hold a funeral in present times considering this they hope to be cremated with their ashes arranged in an identifiable cinerary urn most elderly people live alone many have limited or no internet knowledge and are poorly connected with other family or community members 13 quite frequently some elderly people die in complete isolation their corpses can be discovered many days after death 14  as said older adults did not grow up in an internet-connected environment using a laptop or a tablet can be a challenge to call their children and grandchildrenif ever in their livesmost of them still use an old telephone not a smartphone often television is the only company they have as well as their most efficient time killer can i survive it is the big question coming from them the more time passes the more likely they are to survive they think however the long wait is unnerving especially in industrious regions of northern italy the unusual silence that looms in cities contributes to making the atmosphere particularly surreal many elders wonder why this pandemic arose what caused it some elderly people think that covid-19 is the consequence of divine punishment for a society that has lost any moral value despite being completely isolated from the rest of the world other elders do not feel safe inside their homes they believe that the virus is in the air it could enter through the windows or from any possible crack or gap in the walls of the house hence contagion would be inevitable and only a matter of time in these cases anxiety levels are at the top and ringing the general practitioner gp becomes an urgent need if the gp does not answer the next calls are to the police or the emergency services or to one of the numerous helplines activated in recent times to meet peoples psychological needs  in italy covid-19 has violently struck a country that was insufficiently prepared to face it the pandemic has overcharged a healthcare system particularly its acute care wards and confined millions of citizens at home or in nursing homes especially in northern italy healthcare professionals were overworked and operated on the edge of their forces and energies and fatigue poor disaster preparedness and precarious availability of protective equipment also contributed to the level of stress of doctors and nurses it seems quite obvious to emphasize that adequate responses to dealing with disasters would require both specific training and appropriate equipment these appear as mandatory recommendations for future challenges like never before peoples mental health must be supported in every possible way forced isolation loneliness and fear of contracting the disease are tough challenges for all people especially for frail elderly people 8 in the current situation promoting self-help and positive coping and reducing isolation also through technology appear imperative active outreach seems a necessity especially for older adults 15 this would help to counteract the feelings of abandonment and disempowerment that covid-19 is imposing on all members of the community with older adults being the most exposed ones  the public health response to the covid-19 pandemic for people with disabilities coleen boyle a michael fox h susan havercamp m jennifer zubler   people with disabilities pwds represent a large and diverse group with about 1 in 4 adult americans reporting some type of disability1 while disability is not inherently linked to increased risk of getting covid-19 infection or in experiencing more severe disease factors or circumstances associated with disabilities may increase these risks specifically pwds are more likely to have an underlying health problem2

3 and are more likely to live in congregate care settings than those without disabilities4 both of these factors have been shown to increased risk for covid-19 infections5

6 additionally because of the nature of some disabilities individuals may have difficulty practicing routine preventive measures for example people who rely on assistance with personal care will be unable to maintain physical distancing while others may have difficulty communicating symptoms of illness resulting in delays in diagnosis and additional virus spread there is little doubt now that the covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented in our lifetime we will continue to learn how to contain and control the spread of the virus in the months and even years to come with this rapidly changing landscape assuring pwds are not disproportionately impacted is a global public health priority7 in this commentary we identify three areas of pressing scientific need and offer possible strategies for each a what are the types of data that would help clarify risks for pwds and assure the right types of health protection efforts prevention treatment and mitigation are in place b what can be done to improve the health protection measures for pwds through the duration of the outbreak and c how can we address the evolving issues of equity in access to and quality of medical care for pwds these three areas of need for pwds are not new or unique to the covid-19 pandemic they have been identified from prior emergencies and are integrated into the framework we discuss below for covid-197

8
 with every emergency addressing the needs of high-risk populations requires scientific data to highlight who is at greatest risk so we can target intervention strategies and subsequently to monitor the effectiveness of interventions the critical nature of data on who becomes infected with the sars-cov-2 virus and who is more likely to die has been highlighted by the cdc showing that older adults racial and ethnic minority groups and those with underlying chronic health conditions are more likely to be severely impacted9

10 unfortunately there is little information that allow public health experts to break out the impact on pwds instead we mostly rely upon circumstantial information such as reports of covid-19 outbreaks among pwds living in residential care facilities11 or inferences we can make about the risk of severe health outcomes in pwds given their higher rates of chronic health conditions9 it is uncertain whether children with disabilities are at higher risk of serious complications from covid-19 infection httpsemergencycdcgovhan2020han00432asp we do know that children with underlying neurologic conditions are more likely to die from seasonal influenza also a respiratory-based illness12 a focus on children with disabilities as a vulnerable group must be a priority in future data collection efforts incorporating disability identifiers into new or revised surveillance or other data collection systems for monitoring the covid-19 outbreak is essential disability is a critical demographic identifier similar to age raceethnicity and gender with a standardized set of survey questions13 using this standard set provides information about disability type eg mobility vision hearing cognition self-care or independent living helping us pinpoint groups of pwds who are at higher risk leading to more effective mitigation measures cdc recently updated the covid-19 case report form to include a disability identifier httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovphpreporting-puihtml the challenge will be to convey the importance of reporting these vulnerability factors to the health care and public health workers on the front lines who are completing these forms although most people with disabilities will be identified using the standard disability screening tool this approach is likely to overlook people with intellectual disabilities intellectual disability represents a small proportion of people with disabilities yet one at high risk for severe health outcomes from covid-19 infections a recent analysis of national mortality data for deaths attributed to pneumonia prior to the covid-19 outbreak indicated a 2 to 6 times higher death rate due to pneumonia in people with intellectual and developmental disabilities compared to without these disabilities14 these findings suggest that this population might be particularly vulnerable to dying from covid-19 infections given that the virus can cause lung complications including pneumonia in addition to new surveillance or data collection systems national state and local mortality data may be used to examine people with different types of disability even while acknowledging challenges in accuracy of death certificate capturing and coding information on specific type of disability15 linking service system data with mortality data that is now available in more real-time16 at the state and local level may provide a more accurate picture of the consequence of the pandemic on segments of the disability population and help target prevention efforts beyond mortality information using existing secondary data sources such as state medicaid data or health system specific electronic health records may allow for selective snapshots that can have important healthcare and policy implications17

 the spread of the virus and the public health response to contain it has evolved quickly over recent months the response strategy moving forward will involve a combination of routine virus testing with a focus on high risk settings and populations isolating and caring for those with newly identified infection and tracing and following up on anyone who has come into close contact with newly diagnosed caseswith the goal of stopping virus spread19 incorporating the needs of pwds as they relate to these basic public health functions is important to making this strategy a success and protecting this high risk group with each of these strategies access barriers for pwds will need to be addressed such as how someone who is blind will access a drive through testing center especially when ride services are not recommended a key component to continuing to protect pwds is to have accurate and accessible health information on the virus and ways to continue to protect oneself there are many audiences for this type of information in addition to the pwds they include health care providers service providers who assist pwds and family members and other caregivers because the information on the virus and the public health response is changing rapidly it is important that we update the materials often and continue to look for creative ways to get the information out to individuals and communities communication materials need to be accessible eg braille sign language and easily understood by all audiences advocacy organizations with a direct line to pwds should be engaged throughout the process of developing disseminating and evaluating the impact of the communication materials we already know from recent epidemiologic investigations of virus spread and containment strategies with other high-risk populations or settings specifically residents of nursing homes and homeless shelters that improved infection control guidelines have relevance to pwds who live in congregate care settings6

20 the recommendations resulting from these investigations mirror the broader response strategy referenced above of testing isolating and tracing but also include some specifics such as limiting familyvisitor access screening staff before entry for temperature and symptom checks reinforcing adherence to standard infection control strategies and ensuring that facilities have adequate supplies of masks gloves and other personal protective equipment an emerging issue that will undoubtedly impact our public health protection response for pwds for the longer term is addressing the social and emotional needs of those living under isolated conditions following hurricane katrina it was found that pwds already had meaningful support networks in place that allowed them to be more resilient through the disaster compared to many without disabilities21 enhancing that resiliency through targeted strategies may be beneficial given that the need to self-isolate may go on for some time these strategies may include easing of restrictions on visits by family members in residential or group home settings by offering routine virus and symptom testing working with advocacy groups to create virtual and setting-specific ways to engage with those socially isolated virtual gatherings social chat rooms online exercise and movie or game nights and working with local businesses to provide easier ways to address essential needs and services specialized grocery delivery services including extending curbside pickups ride share services that target pwds and exclusive hours of service for health care or hygiene services  dental hair appointments7
 some pwds worry that they may not get the best healthcare because of their disability this fear was intensified early on in the global covid-19 outbreak discussions of the need to ration lifesaving medical equipment pwds are disadvantaged because of the pervasive negative biases and inaccurate assumptions about their quality of life when quality of life quality-adjusted life years or disability-adjusted life years are considered in medical rationing decisions pwds are unfairly disadvantaged not because they have lower quality of life but because they are wrongly assumed to have lower quality of life22 in fact several states adopted crisis standards of care guidelines that categorically excluded people with intellectual disability from accessing scarce medical resources23
 while the shortage of critical care and medical equipment is lessening a recent new yorker article featured several adults who are deaf and blind who expressed concerns about the inherent biases they may face in receiving equitable treatment24 to communicate with doctors or other health care providers a person who is deaf and blind needs an interpreter because of infection control requirements the lack of this essential help in the icu or other hospital settings leaves a person with communication needs especially vulnerable the no visitor policies adopted by hospitals to protect patients hospital personnel and visitors is particularly problematic for patients with disabilities who rely on assistance with activities of daily living exceptions to the no visitor policy are needed to ensure that known and acknowledged support persons such as designated family member direct support professionals or other designated caregivers are permitted to be with the patient starting with admission and through to the caretreatment process such an exception would likely be considered a reasonable accommodation under the americans with disabilities act and would improve communication between the hospital staff and pwds and allow for informed and shared decision making25 hospitals may consider adopting protocols for providing infection control briefings and providing appropriate ppes to support persons as we move further along in the pandemics trajectory we can anticipate the need for prioritizing new treatments on the horizon are potential antivirals or other pharmaceuticals for the early treatment of infections and ultimately a vaccine for prevention initial supplies may be limited particularly for a vaccine pwds should be included among those prioritized for receiving these potential life-saving treatments given the risk for contracting the disease they experience lastly many pwds have complex medical issues that required ongoing care26 as we move into the next phases of virus containment we need to think through how to safely address routine health care issues and assure that pwds receive needed care pwds represent a diverse group with varying needs in responding to covid-19 pandemic data on who is at greatest risk of infection will help us better anticipate and meet the needs of pwds at high risk from what we know about other respiratory infections people with intellectual disabilities and children with neurologic disabilities may be at higher risk of severe outcomes from covid-19 disease and we can act now to ensure they have information and supports to mitigate this potential risk we can also anticipate that many pwds will shelter-in-place for long periods of time to reduce their risk of infection we can plan services and supports to meet the need for meaningful social interactions to maintain mental health and well-being while self-isolating because of the rapid nature of the public health response it is critical to periodically reassess and readjust our approach to best address the needs of pwds in the months and years to come and to incorporate these new practices into future emergency preparedness responses coleen boyle no

conflicts of interest or outside funding  popular geopolitics steve pickering   for a long time popular geopolitics was not taken too seriously it was certainly seen as a relative of other forms of geopolitics but perhaps a sort of distant cousin who just gathered the low-hanging fruit to an extent this idea remains there is research in the sphere of popular geopolitics which is a little less serious than we might expect of other academic research and many respectable geographers avoid popular geopolitics because to study it would require studying popular culture but on 7 january 2015 when the brothers sad and chrif kouachi stormed the offices of the french satirical weekly charlie hebdo murdering 12 people it became clear that the study of popular geopolitics would have to be taken more seriously how did we arrive at a situation where two men decided to commit mass murder for a cartoon there is so much that we do not know about the relationship between elites media and the general public when it comes to factors like the formation of foreign policy multiculturalism identity interstate relations soft power and the relationship between religion and the state popular geopolitics can give us a forum at which to start drawing together theories and research from many different areas to try to better understand these areas at the time of writing the charlie hebdo
case has not made it into the popular geopolitics academic press as journal review cycles are long but an earlier case has the drawings of the prophet mohammed in the danish newspaper jyllands-posten
in 2005 which led to attacks on danish
and indeed norwegian and austrian embassies and christian churches around the world ridanp 2009 sees this stemming directly from popular geopolitics in the case of the danish cartoon crisis it is crucial to stress that this time the impetus for the political conflict came from the world of popular geopolitics which has conventionally been perceived as a more or less passive reflector of geopolitical processes ridanp 2009 732 we can no longer afford to simply view popular geopolitics as a passive reflector of geopolitical processes as our daily interactions with media increase that relationship between popular geopolitics and other forms of geopolitics will become every more complex but this presents an opportunity as more data become available we have more opportunities to research and better understand the phenomenon of popular geopolitics as dittmer 2005 626 argues if we want to understand national identity and global order we need to understand popular geopolitics discussions of popular geopolitics generally start with the work of  tuathail but we can wind the clock back a little further takeuchi 1980 15 discusses how geopolitics has always been of popular appeal because it gives novel explanations of political reality which conventional means have not been able to explain however this comes at a price geographys scientific basis is lost for the sake of demagogy takeuchi 1980 is very seldom referred to in the literature which is unfortunate as this analysis remains nuanced and useful but we are indebted to  tuathail for his work in advancing the field of popular geopolitics drawing on michael herrs herr 1977 account of the vietnam war referred to as americas first rock-n-roll war  tuathail argues that the influence of vietnam remains with us  tuathail 1996 171  chuck norris oliver stone rambo wannabes are shooting up wild zones across the globe while a remasculinisation imperativeovercoming the lack and impotence that is the vietnam syndromeunderwrote the picture-perfect slaughter of the gulf war at the time of  tuathails article it was bosnia again referring back to herr 1977  tuathail states bosnia bosnia bosnia is now everywhere it is an ongoing series in our newspapers a sound-bite on our television sets that occasionally splashes us with spectacular violence captured on videotape for our viewing pleasure we can be there now by going to a u2 concert clicking on a computer screen  tuathail 1996 171 here then we can see the start of the formal analysis of popular geopolitics while some of the events are now dated it set the stage from moving away from just analysis elite texts 
prior to this analysing elite texts had been the norm and while there was a recognition that popular culture had been feeding on geopolitical events popular culture itself was seen as a bit of a waste of time dittmer 2010 1 there was recognition that popular culture could provide easy access to the events of the geopolitical world in a simplified form but for many geographers this was a little too easy ridanp 2009 730 accordingly there was a reluctance among geographers to look at popular materials in a formal way but after  tuathail 1996 geographers realised that they would have to start looking at popular culture in their analysis geographers and other academics in the classical fields of study have to their chagrin been forced to accept popular cultures increasing importance in shaping reality particularly via motion pictures television programmes comics serialised fiction blogs and user-generated content on the web saunders 2012 83 one of the earliest attempts to move away from the elite focus was the analysis of the readers digest in sharp 1993 in a sense so much has changed in the world since the publication of this piece yet sharp 1993 remains a model of how to do a structured empirical analysis of popular geopolitics and serves as a reminder to us that we need to apply such methods now that social media have arrived sharp 1993 was very conscious of the fact that critical geopolitics had been depending on elite texts the belief had been that these were the fonts of wisdom and that popular media would naturally follow their lead accordingly we only needed to read the texts at the source rather than the second-hand stuff sharp 1993 disagreed an over-concentration on the understandings of elites tends to collapse the sociology of knowledge production into the internal dynamics of the geopolitical text geopolitics does not simply trickle down from elite texts to popular ones it is thus not sufficient only to interpret elite texts sharp 1993 493 this allowed her to develop the notion of geopolitics and you popular participation in the creation of a geopolitical enemy sharp 1993 495 
 for the actual analysis sharp 1993 looked at all articles in the period 19801990 the second cold war referring to the soviet union of the 89 articles in that period only one was sympathetic to the soviet union and that was a piece on the december 1988 armenian earthquake in the other 88 articles she found there is a constant set of themes running through all soviet storieswhether ethnographic sociological religious and so onwhich provide a consistent characterisation allowing the credible creation of a soviet geopolitics by the digest thus every representation of the ussr is a political action it fits into the discursive structuring of the usa and ussr as polar opposites a structure centered upon irresolvable difference sharp 1993 501
 debrix 2007 looks at the ways in which television news in the usa feeds back to elites the usa has an especially aggressive type of tabloid geopolitics in which viewers are constantly told of the dangers facing the usa see the discussion of the oreilly factor in dittmer and dodds 2008 439 because of the volume of talk shows and news programmes presented in sensationalist ways debrix 2007 argues that the intellectuals of statecraft in the usa start to present geopolitics in the same way as eye-catching fear-inducing spectacular shocking scandalising and overtly simplistic debrix 2007 as such international relations ir scholars start presenting their work in terms of danger national security terror and war again this presents opportunities for new research is this the case in other countries have ir scholars always framed their narratives in these ways for instance during the cold war or has something changed have social media changed the dynamic debrix 2007 923 refers to
tabloid geopolitics as something which entertains shocks sensationalises and simplifies it does this by giving common sense explanations and fancy maps to create a sense of fear and inevitable danger in an earlier piece debrix argued that tabloid geopolitics works from the assumption that americans do not want to hear about their everyday life americans do not want to read or hear that they are underpaid overworked bullied at work in the home when serving their country in foreign lands they want glamorous stories scandals exceptional events news they can build dreams on or develop a sense of anger from in short they want to be entertained debrix 2003 152 glynn 2000 argues that this creates an environment in which people are constantly seeking new bits of exciting news before the first bit has even finished a mix of exhaustion and desire for the next media event long before the present one has even reached its culmination glynn 2000 1819 glynn was writing with reference to the oj simpson case and the death of princess diana his argument applies even more in the age of social media one of the most powerful parts of the tabloid geopolitical discourse is the map some of the tricks of the cartographic trade harley 1989 7 were discussed in chap 101007978-1-137-52217-72 but tabloid realism takes these to the next level tabloid realist maps are no longer the binary simplistic red versus blue cartographical representations of the cold war era they are now fluid multi-dimensional almost holographic projections of this geopolitical discourse this does not mean though that these different-looking maps are necessarily less artificial delimiting and reality producing than the older maps debrix 2003 162 consider the map presented in fig 41 when cartoonist edward linley sambourne drew his cartoon of the rhodes colossus striding from cape town to cairo in punch magazine in 1892 it was intended as a piece of satire yet in daily news broadcasts today there is no satire people standing on maps and surveying the world beneath their feet are the new normal thankfully news anchors have experts fig 42 to explain these maps and their geopolitical reality to us which is the subject of the next section if the link between experts and policy is an area we do not quite understand the link between celebrities and policy is an even more understudied area as benwell et al 2012 points out celebrities can issue official and policy-prescriptive statements endorsed by others such as the academic economist jeffrey sachs benwell et al 2012 1 there is a long history of celebrity involvement in geopolitics for instance benwell et al 2012 look at jane fonda and muhammad alis criticism of the us involvement in vietnam in the 1960s more recently they look at george clooney being arrested outside the sudanese embassy in the usa in 2012 as he protested against the sudanese governments actions in darfur additionally they look at bono and bob geldofs campaign over the famine in ethiopia richard geres campaign on tibetan independence oprah winfrey on education in south africa madonna on health care in malawi and the involvement in the

charlie hebdo murders at the start of the chapter shows the impact of cartoons on geopolitics can hardly be overstated ridanp 2009 explores how the publication of cartoons of the muhammed in the danish newspaper

cartoonists have long faced violence from state and non-state actors dodds 2007 158 looks at how cartoonists have faced violence intimidation and death because their work ridicules the powerful and contributes to stereotypes3 as far back as 1831 french cartoonist honor daumier was given a six-month prison sentence for drawing king louis philippe as a monster tun 2002 48 more recently uruguayan cartoonist francisco laurenzo pons was arrested and tortured in 1978 lebanese cartoonist naji salim-al-ali was shot dead in london in the 1980s iranian cartoonist manouchehr karimzadeh was put in prison by the islamic revolutionary court and yugoslavian cartoonist predrag koraksic corax was taken to court for offending politicians in 1993 tun 2002 49 
nevertheless there has been a belief that cartoonists are somehow inferior to other journalists and as a result they become outsiders in the journalistic community this outsider status however allows them to use satire in a way in which their journalistic colleagues cannot ridanp 2009 732 
the study of cartoons is useful as it shows us clearly the importance of not just focusing on elites see dodds 2010 ridanp 2009 looks at reactions to the cartoons in
jyllands-posten the reactions were worldwide drastically intensive and occurred at several administrative levels there were political meetings all over the world public protests boycotts of danish products public criticism in the media official statements and apologies issued by various international organisations and national governments serious threats closures of embassies and armed conflicts ridanp 2009 736 clearly non-elites can have profound influences on popular geopolitics we need to pay attention to them parallels between the james bond films and contemporary geopolitics have been drawn dodds 2006 links osama bin laden with the blofeld character and al qaeda with the criminal organisation spectre similarly saunders 2012 sees zombie films as being reflective of geopolitics the films 28 days later and 28 weeks later are contextualised in terms of britain as a declining island nation with links made between foot and mouth disease severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and avian flu yet ultimately such accounts are unsatisfying yes we can see geopolitics on the silver screen but in these analyses that is where it stops as researchers of geography and conflict we want to see cinema feeding back we want to find evidence of it influencing policy more interesting is when hollywood feeds back when cinematic representation starts influencing reality the saving private lynch case is particularly informative private jessica lynch was rescued from an iraqi hospital in nasiriyah where she was being held prisoner according to an iraqi doctor at the hospital anmar uday it was like a hollywood film they cried go go go with guns and blanks and the sound of explosions they made a show  an action movie like sylvester stallone or jackie chan with jumping and shouting breaking down the doors kampfner 2003 the pentagon claimed she had suffered bullet and stab wounds torture and interrogation according to the bbcs correspondent programme however she did not receive any bullet or stab wounds and indeed had received the best medical treatment available including blood donated by hospital staff and the rescue was from a hospital long deserted by the iraqi army the film of saving private jessica it was suggested included us forces firing blanks to liven up the action crampton and power 2005 257 
dittmer 2005 628 argues that comics are important to geopolitics as they appeal to a young audience exactly when they are starting to form their socio-spatial frameworks dittmer looks to that most patriotic of us cartoons captain america dittmer 2005 629 looks back the very first issue in which the comic takes part in constructing a geopolitical reality in which there is a war-mongering europe and a peace-loving america dittmer argues that captain america presents us foreign policy as being defensive not offensive to make this case he focuses on captain americas weapon a shield which is unusual for american comic characters most have a rather more dramatic offensive weapon dittmer 2005 630 argues that this is important means through which to create the idea that american foreign policy interests are purely defensive again though it is hard to see how this research could be used to look at how comics feed back to the policy community or how seriously people take them also non-american cases need to be considered such as manga in japan consider for instance the hadashi no gen series by hiroshima survivor keiji nakazawa 
conspiracies also need to be considered as part of popular geopolitics for jones 2012 45 conspiracies are not just beliefs held on the fringes of society they are common-place they cross the spheres of politics science and popular culture and should be seen as important to mainstream public debate in the case of conspiracy we can see instances of feedback to overseas elites jones 2012 cites the case in 2010 of the then iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad addressing the un general assembly in which he claimed that the majority of americans believed that parts of the us government organised the 911 attacks to stimulate the us economy jones 2012 45 goes on to conclude that there is an imperative for geographers to critically interrogate the discourses of conspiracy which circulate across and between actors networks scales and territories and which have the capacity to shape how people understand the world around them and thus how they choose to act within it it is especially important that this research includes countries other than the usa diseases do not respect borders and diseases have been subject to the earliest forms of geo-spatial analysis see snow 1855 in october 2014 the ebola virus started to trend on twitter revealing the fears of many people about the disease it is hard to determine exactly how many tweets were sent on the subject of ebola however in preparing this case study a census day was set 16 october 2014 during which at some points over 40 tweets with the word ebola in them were being sent every second we can determine the geographic coordinates of approximately two per cent of these and of them the overwhelming majority came from the usa as is shown in fig 436

 clearly the trends found in these tweets intersect well with the themes which have emerged in this chapter on popular geopolitics also as twitter gives us the ability to geocode tweets we can start to do serious analyses with them both cross-nationally and sub-nationally as these new popular data are available we should start using them but perhaps most interestingly as twitter is used by people from a diverse cross section of society it starts to break down the elitenon-elite distinction discussed at the start of this chapter political geographers have been reluctant to engage with popular media it is time to start engaging studies of popular geopolitics have proceeded in a rather fitful way one of the reasons for this is that the people involved keep changing researchers have engaged with popular geopolitics for a while and then moved on to other things few people have stayed with the field for a number of years dittmer 2010 xviii in order to move the field forward we need to start filling the gaps in the literature one gap is that of audience research dittmer and dodds 2008 445 point out that there has been an acknowledgement that popular geopolitical studies have still to demonstrate in detail how and in what manner certain films magazines and the internet are indeed consumed but we need to know more about how they are consumed we need to know how they feed back into the formation of foreign policy and perhaps most interestingly how public opinion in one country affects foreign policy in another while many researchers talk about the relationship between elite and pluralist models of foreign policy few actually do any empirical research on it there is a good reason for this it is difficult woon 2014 cites two reasons for this difficulty first audience interpretations are multitudinal and hard to pin down comparing peoples popular geopolitical imaginations thus becomes an exercise in futility rendering it highly difficult to make generalised conclusions about the entire audience second audiences are often deluged with mediated messages from a variety of popular sources and it is in the aggregate that they have an impact it thus becomes a fruitless task to identify one cultural artifact as having an effect on people in all but the most unusual circumstances woon 2014 660 but thankfully researchers are finding creative ways to overcome these obstacles and move popular geopolitics in new policy-relevant ways as has been discussed earlier tagos research illustrates this trend with research which has been presented to the japanese ministry of foreign affairs tago 2010 ikeda and tago 2014 tago and ikeda 2015 pilster et al 2015 kohama et al 2016 similarly woon 2014 is another notable exception woon carries out semi-structured interviews in the philippines looks at representations of life in mindanao and studies how the philippines daily inquirer the newspaper with the highest readership and circulation in the philippines covers conflict there in so doing not only is this work actually doing empirical research in popular geopolitics but it is also moving beyond the us bias although geographers have been pivotal in elucidating how wars against terrorism waged in different parts of the world have to be constructed as just in order to gain moral legitimacy there seems to be an overwhelming focus on critiquing the uss justifications of its war on terror policies in foreign sovereign territories this paper however departs from these above works insofar as it casts attention on the philippines governments internal war against its own dissident citizenry woon 2014 659 finally dittmer and dodds 2008 highlight another area in which popular geopolitics needs to move new media associated with the internet deserve greater scrutiny and need to be tied to the popular geopolitical corpus in the light of the growing importance of activities such as blurbs blogging and threads using online platforms and other sites such as the internet movie database imdb around the world dittmer and dodds 2008 445 since dittmer and dodds 2008 the number of people using social media on a daily basis has increased enormously and this includes people from many parts of society as researchers of popular geopolitics trying to understand how decisions are made about human conflict we absolutely need to research these new media as they are breaking apart the old distinctions between elites and non-elites which popular geopolitics was built on  news from the front excess mortality and life expectancy in two major epicentres of the covid-19 pandemic in italy simone ghislandi raya muttarak markus sauerberg benedetta scotti  existing studies commonly rely on national official reports to estimate the impact of covid-19 on population health and human life however relying on national reports is problematic because classification and estimation of covid-19 mortality are not consistent across countries likewise delay coronavirus test results and shortage of testing kits can result in undercounting of coronavirus deaths to overcome these problems this study exploits all cause daily death registrations data provide by the italian statistical office istat from 1 st january to 4 th april 2020 this allows us to 1 calculate excess mortality in 2020 compared to the years 2015 to 2019 and 2 estimate life expectancy on a seasonal and annual basis we focus our analysis on bergamo and brescia the two hardest hit provinces in lombardy northern italy given the clustering nature of the epidemic focusing on the areas with high concentration of severe illness and deaths allows us to capture the true impact of covid-19 on mortality and life expectancy which are likely to be underestimated in the national level data we find that on the period 1 jan to 4 april 2020 seasonal life expectancy in bergamo reduced by around 81 and 65 years compared to 2019 for men and women respectively 45 and 34 years in brescia the drop in period life expectancy for 2020 may total up to 3 years in the case of men and 2 years in the case of women such a sharp decrease in life expectancy has not been experienced in modern history since the second world war this study shows that in the absence of public health interventions to reduce the spread of the virus covid-19 has set life expectancy in bergamo and brescia back to the italian life expectancy of 15 years ago  according to the world health organization who records on 31 december 2019 a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in wuhan china was first reported to the who country office in china on the 20 th of january 2020 the media around the world report the news of the human-tohuman transmission of this new coronavirus while on the 30 th of january the who declares the outbreak a public health emergency of international while italy iran and south korea had already experienced a significant outbreak of the new coronavirus it was only on 11 march 2020 that the covid-19 was declared a pandemic by who there are now confirmed cases of covid-19 in every continent except antarctica what is particularly worrying about the new coronavirus is its high degree of transmissibility and infectivity along with its great potential to develop into severe illness and death wang et al 2020  indeed to minimise the impact of covid-19 pandemic on public health over 100 countries worldwide had impose strict restrictions on movement of people and social gatherings hale et al 2020 following the drastic measures taken in china in an attempt to flattening the curve italy the first country outside china to experience a large-scale health impact of covid-19 imposed a partial nationwide lockdown since 9 march 2020 whilst the italian government was praised by who for an implementation of such a measure never employed in modern democratic nations since wwii given the evidence that the virus spread under-detected in the northern part of the country already since late january 2020 strict measures might have been imposed too late as a consequence the outbreak has put unprecedented strain on the italian healthcare system resulting in an exceptionally high number of coronavirus deaths currently the second highest in the world after the us as the covid-19 outbreak spread aggressively in other countries like spain france the uk the us country disparities in covid-19 deaths became distinct in particular italy is shown to have the highest case fatality rate while germany austria and norway are among the countries the lowest rate global health 5050 2020 accordingly the media has constantly trying to dig out the underlying reasons behind the country differentials in covid-19 deaths comparing covid-19 deaths across countries however is challenging for several reasons ranging from disparities in testing coverage the criterial for defining a covid-19 death to practice in post-mortem examination garca-basteiro et al 2020  one way to overcome the inconsistency in the differences in measurement of incidence and fatality is to consider excess mortality data on weekly or daily excess deaths for instance would allow scientists to compare the observed deaths in 2020 with the mortality patterns typically observed in previous years leon et al 2020  exploiting daily death registrations data published by the italian statistical office istat this paper provides the first evidence-based assessment of the impact of covid-19 on mortality and life expectancy in the first hardest hit epicentres outside china three main features characterise the present analysis first covid-19 deaths are estimated using excess mortality measures rather than relying on the official report of the number of deaths attributed to covid-19 this way the mortality estimation does not suffer from biases related to sampling in testing and reporting policies second the analysis focusses specifically on bergamo and brescia the two hardest hit provinces in lombardy northern italy the two provinces were sometimes compared to wuhan given their position as epicentres of the outbreak which experienced a rapid escalation in the number of infections resulting in an insufficiency of healthcare resources and intensive care units porcheddu et al 2020  the highly clustered nature of local transmission results in high concentration of severe illnesses and deaths in one area jia et al nd  therefore the direct impact of covid-19 on mortality and average life expectancy is likely to be felt at a sub-national level rather than in a whole country finally at the moment of writing the epidemics in bergamo and brescia appear now to have been contained given that the epidemic curve has presented a downward trend in the first wave of infections the results presented here are thus based mainly on hard number observed in these regions rather than on some forms of simulations with underlying assumptions focusing on the areas where the outbreak appears to have slowed down allows us to capture a fuller picture of the impact of the virus on mortality and life expectancy hence by using complete and reliable data on the number of deaths for the first largest-scale outbreak outside china this paper provides the first unbiased account of the mortality impact of covid-19 and its consequence on life expectancy in the analysis we compare mortality rates in 2015-2019 and 2020 across age and gender categories and provide estimations of how life expectancy changes following the covid-19 pandemic the motivation driving our analysis is discussed in the next session where the main methodological choices regarding the measures and the geographical areas are discussed in depth in the background section we provide a short description of the policy measures implemented for tackling the epidemic next the set of results are divided in two parts first rough excess mortality rates are presented these values are the used to construct potential life expectancy based on different assumptions for the rest of the year 2020 in the final discussion part we underline the most important lessons to be drawn from the evidence and conclude this paper aims to provide the first evidence-based assessment of the human life consequences of the covid-19 pandemic based on unbiased weekly death registrations data in particular the choice of using overall daily mortality rather than official covid-19 figures is motivated by two major concerns first during the last couple of months it has become clear that there exists no uniform way of classifying covid-19 death there is a variation across countries in counting mortality from and mortality with covid-19 italy for instance include any persons who tested positive for the virus when they died in the official covid-19 death toll statistics regardless of the pre-existing diseases that may have caused death onder et al 2020  likewise whilst countries like belgium and france after 2 nd april 2020 include coronavirus deaths outside hospitals in its official daily report countries like the uk italy or spain do not some countries such as belgium the uk and the us record covid-19 deaths also from suspected cases and do not require a positive laboratory diagnosis like in germany and the netherlands roser et al 2020  in addition when the epidemic worsens the counting of fatalities becomes more difficult people dying at home or in long-term care facilities might indeed not be tested at all simply because resource allocation prioritises emergency operations even within the same country it is difficult to compare the number of cases and deaths in different regions given disparities in regional policies and testing strategies and capacities  therefore weekly death registrations data from all causes are more comparable across countries and regions leon et al 2020  this is important given the need to share generalisable information in order to track the progress of the epidemics to guide the implementation of prevention and control measures as well as to plan when to relax social distancing measures a second advantage of using overall mortality measure is that it allows us to capture the negative spillovers associated with the drop in supply of hospital-based services due to covid-19 the reduced access to hospitals emergency rooms often closed during the outbreak acute hospital beds and clinical activities could contribute to peaks in mortality for other medical conditions that are not directly related to the epidemic obviously these deaths should be considered as death as an indirect consequence of covid-19 in other words a study that consider excess all-cause all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which

httpsdoiorg10 1101 mortality during the period of the epidemic like ours provides a complete assessment of the impact of covid-19 on population health and human life most of the existing literature has relied on mortality measures especially case-fatality rates cfr cdc covid-19 response team 2020 giangreco 2020 khafaie and rahim 2020 onder et al 2020  which are not informative for international and historical comparisons since case-fatality rates are calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases the absence of accurate estimation of the infection rates in a reference population makes the denominator in the cfr relies heavily on testing strategies and capacities  although much of the attention from the media and who has been devoted to increasing the number of coronavirus testing to as many people as possible who 2020 little has been said about a sampling strategy the only possible way to obtain reliable information about infection rates is through selecting and testing a representative sample of the population galeotti and surico 2020  an approach only very few countries have actually implemented only recently in april 2020 iceland and austria were the first countries to carry out a random-population screening test this is understandable since testing has been used as a measure of containment through isolating infected patients together with tracing however testing only suspected cases implies a selection bias in a sampling approach which fails to provide unbiased estimates of infection rates in a population no matter how many tests a country runs the figures on infection rates based on unrepresentative sample testing thus are likely to be misestimation of the true prevalence another important feature of the present study is its specific geographical focus on bergamo and brescia the two hardest hit relatively small provinces in lombardy northern italy due to the clustering nature of the virus outbreak an analysis at the national level would underestimate the scale of the impact of covid-19 on mortality and life expectancy with a total population of approximately 23 million in the two provinces a large-scale excess mortality can indeed affect life expectancy of a population in these small areas in addition the containment measures through lockdown were introduced too late given that the virus had already been circulated undetected in the region as early as in january 2020 leco di bergamo 2020 reuters 2020 this allows the epidemic to develop in its purest form showing the potential impact of the virus in absence of any intervention measures to reduce its spread hence when indicators like life expectancy are calculated the reference population should naturally be the one experiencing the consequences of the epidemic on the contrary if the national data are considered and the outbreaks have been contained the negative impact of the epidemic on potential years of life loss might end up being heavily underestimated finally our study extends beyond current studies on the health impact of covid-19 which typically focus on mortality by focusing on life expectancy related measures whilst studying covid-19 mortality rates are certainly important they need to be collapsed in an index which is universal enough to provide a reliable measure of human life lost in this regard life expectancy is a consistent objective measure of human development since it represents overall wellbeing of populations in a simple and non-bias form ghislandi et al 2019 sen 1998  furthermore reliable measures of life expectancy are available for some countries since the nineteenth century this makes it possible to use life expectancy for historical comparisons of the human costs associated to major events in the early morning of the 20 th february 2020 the first severe local case of covid-19 was diagnosed in europe in a small hospital in codogno a municipality south east of milan all

would be difficult if not impossible indeed later studies have shown that covid-19 was present in the lombardy region since the first half of january 2020 cereda et al 2020  leco di bergamo 2020 reuters 2020 the area around codogno was immediately declared a red zone and a complete lockdown was enforced in 11 municipalities while universities and schools in lombardy were immediately closed the region was about to enter what is probably the most serious public health and economic crisis after-wwii period however in the ten days following the presence of patient one the nature of the epidemic was downplayed by most media and authorities including some health experts testing strategies changed in due course with only patients showing a combination of symptoms being tested lockdowns were gradually and slowly introduced only when it became clear that important outbreaks were on the way on 8 march 2020 the whole lombardy was declared orange zones just one day before the rest of italy non-essential activities were however stopped only on 23 rd march 2020 the nature and the adequacy of the response to the covid-19 epidemic has been discussed elsewhere and is still ongoing winfield 2020  in this context this brief excursus is useful in order to understand the timing and the geographic distribution of the events specifically the timing is crucial here bergamo has been the first and hardest hit province in lombardy by 14 march 2020 all beds in intensive care units icus of the main hospital of the city were already filled as it will become clear later the wave of hospitalizations and deaths started around the very first days of march indeed it has already been noticed that bergamo is a case where the flattening of the epidemic curve policies were introduced too late and hence not being very effective a similar situation with a few days delay can be said for brescia we rely on a compendium of administrative data provided by the italian national institute of statistics istat we use daily death counts for all causes at the municipality level disaggregated by sex and age class 0 1-4 5-9 10-14  95-99 100 they cover the period between 1 st january and 30 th april for the years 2015-2019 while for 2020 the observation period extends up to 4 th april importantly istat does not collect and release data on daily death counts for all municipalities 1  as of today these data are available only for municipalities which meet the following three criteria i have been included in the recently established national register of resident population anpr ii have recorded at least 10 deaths between 1 st january and 4 th april and iii have recorded an increase of at least 20 in the number of deaths registered between 1 st march and 4 th april 2020 compared to the 2015-2019 average over the same period in both our areas of interest ie the provinces of bergamo and brescia about 72 of municipalities are included in the anpr totaling to 175 and 149 respectively out of these istat has released daily death data relative to 2020 for 122 municipalities in the province of bergamo and 101 municipalities in the province of brescia in addition to this dataset we rely on four further sources of information first we make use of annual death counts at the municipality level disaggregated by sex and by age class 0 1-4 5-9 10-14  95-99 100 these data extend up to 2017 second we obtain data on resident population at the municipality level disaggregated by sex and single-year age classes 01100 on january 1 of years 2015-2019 we reclassify age classes so as to match the 1 these data have been collected and released by istat ad hoc to better document the evolution of local mortality upon the covid19 epidemics outbreak as such istat has been focusing so far on a subgroup of municipalities where excess mortality in 2020 is most likely attributable to the epidemics all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not

httpsdoiorg10 1101 ones used by istat for daily and annual death counts 0 1-4 5-9 10-14  95-99 100 and aggregate data accordingly third we use data on monthly live births disaggregated by sex at the municipality level these data are available up to december 2019 finally we collect data on monthly death counts disaggregated by sex at the municipality level these data are available up to december 2019 we estimate the resident population by age and sex in the provinces of bergamo and brescia on 1 st january 2020 by the following steps first we aggregate resident population data by year age class and sex at the province level then we estimate the female and male resident population in each age class at the provincial level on 1 st january 2020 by means of linear extrapolation based on years 2015 to 2019 likewise we use available data on monthly live births between january 2015 and december 2019 to estimate monthly births over 2020 in the provinces of bergamo and brescia we measure excess mortality at any time t of 2020 as the difference between the observed and the expected number of deaths in 2020 in t we defined the expected number of deaths in t as the average number of deaths observed in t over the period 2015-2019 we calculate seasonal life expectancy between 1 st january and 4 th april for the years 2015-2020 separated for men and women for this purpose we calculate seasonal age-specific mortality rates for each year the numerators ie the death counts are recorded daily thus aggregation over the period 1 st january and 4 th april at the provincial level is straightforward the corresponding exposures ie the denominators were estimated as follows starting from the estimated resident population on 1 st january in 2020 we counted age-specific person-days up to 4 th april theoretically these counts are a function of four demographic events namely births ageing migration and dying the daily inflow of births is estimated by using monthly birth data and assuming that these births are uniformly distributed over each month the effect of ageing ie individuals might transition in-and out of a given age interval is modeled by giving each individual the probability of 1365 for turning one year older during the observation period the outflows due to deaths are straightforward as age-specific death counts are known on a daily basis we neglect migration because the population under study is quarantined in sum the exposed population at day t in age group x is given by the population alive at day t-1 in age group x plus those who age into age group x at day t minus those who either die in age group x or age out of the age group x in day t we express the obtained daily exposure values in terms of person-years by multiplying them by 1365 1366 for leap years then we derive age-specific mortality rates for the period 1 st january to 4 th april finally life tables are built following standard procedures outlined by the human mortality database protocol we estimate confidence intervals for life expectancies by bootstrapping using monte carlo simulation methods assuming death counts follow a binomial distribution andreev and shkolnikov 2010 chiang 1984  further the method proposed by arriaga 1984 allows for decomposing changes in life expectancy into agespecific contributions we applied this approach in order to assess which age-groups have primary contributed to the change in seasonal life expectancy between 2019 and 2020 when estimating life expectancy at the end of the year harvesting ie the reduction in mortality rates following peak mortality associated to shock events should be taken into consideration hence we estimate life expectancy for the entire 2020 considering two alternative scenarios which we define as conservative and a business as usual in the conservative scenario full harvesting we assume the mortality rate at the end of the year will be the same as in 2017 in this approach the main effect of covid-19 would be to anticipate mortality to the first quarter of all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license

represents a clearly defined upper bound for life expectancy in 2020 in other scenario harvesting is set to zero and we assume that after the end of the epidemic mortality rates will go back to the average levels recorded in the previous years there are good reasons to assume that mortality will not reduce substantially after the end of the first wave of covid-19 infections for example because of most of the resources and health services have been directed to covid-19 patients people with other medical conditions such as cancer were under-treated likewise although most vulnerable people have been doing self-isolation and locking themselves inside it is highly possible that they would get the virus later after restriction measures are lifted as a matter of fact mortality after the epidemic wave might actually increase especially among the working age population as a consequence of the lockdowns and the likely economic recessions as has been observed for example in greece laliotis et al 2016  however for this paper we are not making assumptions on the indirect impact of covid-19 pandemic on mortality after the epidemic ends therefore if anything years of life lost due to covid-19 for the year 2020 may in fact be underestimated based on the evolution of daily mortality observed until 4 th april we posit that the epidemics in our area of interest ie the provinces of bergamo and brescia should be over by 30 th april to estimate life expectancy for the entire 2020 we need to project the evolution of deaths after 4 th april we use cubic spline extrapolation to project the number of daily deaths in each age class from 4 th april until 30 th april after 30 th april we project mortality until the end of the year based on two scenarios in the conservative scenario we assume that after the end of the covid-19 epidemics deaths in each age class will occur such that the total number of deaths in 2020 equals the total number of deaths registered in 2017 2  if the cumulative number of deaths by the end of the epidemics in any age class exceeds the total number of deaths registered in 2017 we assume zero deaths will occur after the end of the epidemics in that age class in the business as usual scenario we assume that mortality will return to the average levels recorded in 2015-2017 these are the most recent years for which data on annual death counts are available thus it is possible to derive the number of deaths occurring after 30 th april as the difference between the annual death counts and deaths registered up to 30 th april for the years 2015-2017 as we do not know the daily distribution of deaths after 30 th  we make two assumptions for age groups 50 we assume that deaths occur uniformly over the period 1 st may -31 st december 2020 for age groups 50 we assume that deaths between may and december 2020 occur following the 2015-2019 average distribution of monthly deaths we then assume that deaths distribute uniformly within each month between may and december 2020 we then proceed with the estimation of population exposure for each day between 1 st january and 31 st december 2020 under both scenarios following the same procedure detailed above finally we aggregate death counts and population exposure values over the entire year to derive age-specific mortality rates and life expectancies under both scenarios bergamo and brescia represent the highest number of municipalities with an outlier number of deaths their distribution across the provinces is displayed in figure 1  clearly bergamo province shows a higher number of red areas in addition figure a1 in appendix shows the same municipalities within lombardy comparing the same graph with veneto the region that together with lombardy was the epicenter of the very first clusters of covid-19 in the last week 2 2017 is the last year for which data on yearly death counts disaggregated by age and sex at the municipality level is available all rights reserved

the losses are observable in the areas of bergamo and brescia indeed in the whole country no other provinces display such a monumental upward trend in mortality the maps plot the  change in total number of deaths recorded between jan 1-apr 4 2020 with respect to the 2015-2019 average table 1 shows the age and sex distribution of the total excess mortality by province compared to the average number of people that died in the same period in the five years before 2015-2019 the excess number of deaths between 1 january 2020 and 4 april 2020 for bergamo and brescia sums to 6549 64 of mortality of this excess mortality is witnessed in bergamo covid-19 affected slightly more men than women 56 of excess deaths whilst at the national level 65 of covid-19 deaths involve male mortality global health 5050 2020 however this almost gender balance in the number of deaths does not reflect an equality in the relative mortality risk between sexes in general men are up to 35 times more likely to die from covid-19 than women in fact the risk of dying for men is higher than for women across all ages except for the under 50 in bergamo where the risk ratio is slightly below one age clearly represents the most important predictor of absolute excess mortality related to covid-19 for example from table 1 one can deduce that in our sample a man over 70 years is 10 times and 37 times more likely to die than a person under 70 and under 60 years of age respectively the number of people dying for covid-19 peaks in the 80-89 age interval note that the proportional increase in mortality due to covid-19 in this age class did not spike as much as it did for the under 40 or the 40-49 in fact for the 80-89 the expected mortality is already very high in regular times still in the first quarter of 2020 in bergamo the 80-89 mortality increased by 350 for males and 250 for females similar figures are observed for the 90 and for the 70-79 note that for the age group 90 the gender disparity in covid-19 mortality reverses due to a naturally much higher number of women living until over 90 years of age niu et al 2020  this is consistent with the outbreaks spreading in care

higher than expected number of under 40 both males 1300 and females infinite increase died in brescia municipalities figure 2 shows trends in daily mortality within each of the two provinces from raw data it is evident how the epidemic curve inflates with age and how this age effect is particularly remarkable for bergamo it is also clear that our last day of observation is already on a downward pattern of daily mortality indeed on the 4th of april the epidemic wave was already towards the end in both provinces this allows us to rely on hard data for the most part of the infection wave reducing our reliance on modelling in the estimation of the total number of deaths related to this first wave of infection from the graphs shown in figure 2  it is also evident that the rumors of an unexpected peak of flu mortality in 2020 can be rejected by mid-march the seasonal flu which started in december 2019 was at the very final stages of its wave however during the first two months and a half of 2020 mortality across age classes did not show any significant unexpected peak hence the observed trends do not support the hypothesis that the boost in mortality could be caused by the

is striking if one considers that the time between infection and the development of severe and critical conditions could be as long as three weeks it is evident that the lockdowns were imposed too late in order to measure the human life impact of this epidemic on the two provinces we show two set of results 1 changes in the age structure and 2 changes in life expectancy as stated in the methods section when predicting mortality for the rest of the year two scenarios can be defined in the conservative scenario harvesting is complete and the overall mortality rates by age at the end of the year are maintained constant with respect to the previous years unless the number of deaths by 4 april already exceeds the overall expected deaths for 2020 in the business as usual scenario the after covid mortality drops at its regular values observed in the previous years harvesting is thus set to zero to the purpose of estimation the cumulative number of people that died for covid compared to the expected annual death by age is an important information figures a2a and a2b in the appendix report its evolution by age classes in both provinces for men and women respectively it is impressive

of age specific deaths in the same municipalities in 2017 it has been argued that the impact of the covid epidemic should be understood also by looking at the age structure of a population dowd et al 2020  from the evidence provided so far it is clear that age is the main risk factor for covid related mortality figure 3 reports the changes in the age pyramid between 1 january 2020 and a 4 april 2020 b 31 december 2020 in the two scenarios overall the age pyramid is going to be affected significantly at the top levels the number of missing people among the elderlies at the end of 2020 is going to be significant especially in the extreme scenario note also that elderly women seem to be the most affected by the epidemic in terms of covid this reflects the fact that among the 80 63 are females life expectancy has reduced accordingly as shown in figure 4  the drop at the end of the observation period is significant especially for the men in bergamo when seasonal life expectancy is calculated the reduction in 2020 for males reaches 8 years for women the reduction is less marked although seasonal life expectancy at 4 april 2020 is around 5 years lower than in 2019 we refer to the discussion part for the interpretation of these figures when life expectancy is extrapolated to the whole year the loss in life expectancy is of course diluted over a longer period and hence reduced

testing coverage and classification of cause of deaths by focusing on the two hardest hit areas in lombardy and italy bergamo and brescia we are able to capture the full impact of covid-19 on population health and human life the first important piece of evidence refers to the duration of the epidemic wave by 4 april 2020 the daily mortality in both bergamo and brescia was approaching the regular values observed in 2019 hence the time between the first sign of an epidemic wave first three days of march and the possible return to normality is likely to be between 6 and 8 weeks with the peak happening around two weeks from the start it is likely that the lockdown policy might have contributed to the reduction of mortality in the late stage of the epidemic wave however containment policies were not implemented during the initial spread of the infections when the virus circulated undetected in lombardy hence they played no role in reducing mortality in the first part of the epidemic wave regarding the demographic characteristics two empirical regularities emerge clearly first the age gradient in mortality is steep and age represents the most evident risk factor for covid-19 mortality in our sample men aged over 70 are 10 times and 37 times more likely to die than their counterparts aged under 70 and under 60 respectively second gender disparities in the percentages distribution of deaths are not as large 56 deaths involve male subjects as reported for the whole nation of italy 65 however this figure is misleading the risk of dying for a male is between 15 to 35 higher than that for a female depending on the age class and the province considered men are thus more at risk of mortality but since covid-19 affects the elderly the most and women are overrepresented among those aged 70 absolute figures show a high number of deaths also among the females this age gradient of mortality affects the age pyramid as well with elderly women being associated to the sharpest reduction in their number by the end of 2020 in terms of life expectancy we have shown two main set of results first when focusing on the period 1 jan to 4 april 2020 life expectancy in bergamo reduced by around 81 and 65 years compared to 2019 for men and women respectively 45 and 34 years in brescia one way to understand these figures is to imagine that they represent what would happen if the 1 jan to 4 april period were to be stretched for the entire year so that the epidemic would last around four months over twelve fortunately this is not the case because the epidemic wave had a limited all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020  httpsdoiorg10 1101 duration nevertheless these figures give us an idea of the power of the epidemic wave that crushed the provinces return to normality in bergamo and brescia is not going to be straightforward the near future is hard to predict for this reason when calculating life expectancy at the end of the year we focus on very simple assumptions ie focusing only on the impact of the first epidemic wave only harvesting effect is considered as possible consequences of covid-19 epidemic on mortality two scenarios of full harvesting conservative and no harvesting business as usual are introduced by construction the conservative scenario does not show significant changes at the end of the year this is because although the number of deaths by 4 april exceeded the expected yearly number of deaths in some age class it did so only by a small number on the other hand the no harvesting scenario implies a loss in life expectancy of around 45 and 28 years for males and females respectively in bergamo 22 and 24 respectively in brescia although the conservative scenario represents a logical extreme upper bound to any estimation of life expectancy the business as usual is a more realistic one but how can we interpret these results one good feature of the life expectancy indicator is that it provides a historical perspective over the human consequence of relevant shocks ghislandi et al 2019  looking at figure a3 in the appendix it appears evident that such a sharp decrease in life expectancy has not been experienced in modern history since the second world war in terms of the pandemic impact on years of life lost we are observing a large-scale loss in life expectancy second only to the spanish flu in 1918 where according to figure a3  life expectancy for italy dropped by more than 15 years for the usa noymer and garenne 2000 estimate reduction in life expectancy of 118 years the differences between the covid-19 pandemic and the 1918 flu pandemic are very distinct first of all the spanish flue typically killed the young which of course all else equal reduces life expectancy much more second the outbreak of the spanish flu occurred at the same time as the first world war when no public health and preventive measures were implemented finally the medical technology and knowledge was much less advanced with penicillin and other crucial pharmaceutical products not yet being available it thus can be said that the years of life lost in bergamo and brescia although not at the level achieved after the spanish flu are of a substantial scale given a much more advanced medical technology and the absence of war in the present day note that our analysis focuses on a local context given that the covid-19 outbreaks are geographically concentrated looking at a country level life expectancy is misleading and underestimates the actual impact of the pandemic indeed from our results it is fair to conclude that this is a lifetime unprecedented shock for most of the residents in bergamo and brescia the main limitation of the present study is related to the limited coverage of the death registrations data used both geographically and temporally all the information provided here has been retrieved from a number of the most affected municipalities in bergamo and brescia so the estimation represents an attempt to describe and measure the human cost of covid-19 among the populations that were hit the hardest in a country this study does not represent the experiences of italy and lombardy region but also by choice we intend to investigate the impact of covid-19 on human life in the areas where little containment interventions were put in place from the point of view of the timing we have enough information to actually picture the entire evolution of the epidemic wave however when it comes to life expectancy for the year 2020 we need to rely on harvesting assumptions and we exclude the possible negative impact of the present and future lockdown policies and global economic recessions on health and human life in this sense this paper only focuses on the direct impact of the pandemic and if anything may underestimate the years of life lost due to the covid-19 nevertheless the timing of this paper is also its strength indeed the present analysis represents the first attempt to provide an evidence-based assessment of the human life impact of a frontline covid-19 outbreak in doing so we raise a warning for the scientific and public health community around the world the epidemic when undetected and not contained can easily get out of control and cause relevant social and human consequences in defining the lockdown strategies governments should balance the costs of limiting social and economic activities with the human costs of possible epidemic waves vulnerable populations should be protected with a particular attention and constant monitoring of the epidemic progression this should be given a priority in order not to get caught by surprise by devastating epidemic waves like the ones experienced in bergamo and brescia human life in itself is a solid indicator of human development because it represents health and wellbeing of a population which is one key priority of the sustainable development goals so many years of life lost due to covid-19 pandemic is worrying since it sets the affected areas back to their level of human development 20 years ago as shown in the case of bergamo and brescia the cost of human life from a delay in public interventions to reduce the virus transmission is disturbingly high amidst countries preparation to ease the lockdown restrictions and social distancing measures it is important to keep in mind the conceivable risk of viral reintroduction and a potential direct and indirect cost it can pose on human life well-planned government measures to prevent a second wave of infections along with public collaboration in keeping physical distancing and practicing proper hygiene until a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is available are key to achieve a balance between health and economic protection the maps plot the  change in total number of deaths recorded between jan 1-apr 4 2020 with respect to the 2015-2019 average all rights reserved no reuse allowed

over 95 of covid-19 related deaths in the european region currently the epicentre of the pandemic alongside with north america occurred in people older than 60 years elaborating on these figures we want to make a clear statement to reinforce the protection of each nations older adults and to promote intergenerational equity and solidarity this message deserves to be fully understood in light of the potential discrimination against older people in the current public debate regarding the allocation of scarce medical resources during the present pandemic priority setting in healthcare ie the task of determining the priority to be assigned to a service a service development or an individual patient at a given point in time 1 is unavoidable because the demand for healthcare exceeds resource availability particularly in pandemic circumstances however even under conditions of resource scarcity priority setting processes should not compromise the basic human rights to health and wellbeing of any stratum of the population especially that of older people and other vulnerable groups yet there is a real risk that the immense pressure on resources exerted by the covid-19 pandemic may result in the prioritisation of key services across different age groups based on actual or future contribution to society or on other utilitarian criteria in this context older people may be seen as a particularly large and vulnerable group and one which plays a less active role in society especially from an economic point of view therefore in an attempt to optimise resources older people might be considered as having a priori less rights to high-quality healthcare than younger generations who tend to be seen as less vulnerable and more active members of society on the contrary we want to emphasise that resource scarcity and utilitarian calculus should not undermine older peoples rights to receive high-quality healthcare societies have a moral imperative to protect and respect the dignity and autonomy of older people 2 moreover in line with philosophical accounts which regard vulnerability as valuable 3 we also wish to highlight that older people can enrich societies we are not claiming that age parameters should not be considered while facing the allocation of scarce sources our aim is to strongly oppose the idea of setting an a priori age cut-offs to decide who should get access to healthcare as such ideas discriminate against older people we believe that especially during the covid-19 pandemic there is the need to focus on this issue since there are some initial signs of such discrimination thus we wish to show how these discriminatory phenomena can cause severe negative outcomes not only from the moral standpoint of respect for dignity and autonomy of older people but also from the utilitarian perspective of achieving the greatest good for the greatest amount of people in italy  one of the first european countries hit by the pandemic and one among those with a significant proportion of older individuals siaarti2 guidelines on admission to intensive care units icu envisage or at least do not exclude the possibility of a priori age cut-offs the main argument is that elderly patients may need longer intubation time and have less chance of survival than younger patients the argument is also underpinned by the utilitarian calculus of maximisation of benefit for the greatest amount of people 4 
an age limit for the admission to the icu may ultimately need to be set the underlying principle would be to save limited resources which may become extremely scarce for those who have a much greater probability of survival and life expectancy in order to maximize the benefits for the largest number of people in the worst-case scenario of complete saturation of icu resources keeping a first come first served criterion would ultimately result in withholding icu care by limiting icu admission for any subsequently presenting patient recommendation 3 their emphasis
 this discrimination against older people seems to have spread to other countries which are dealing with the covid-19 tsunami in the us  where there are triage frameworks which do not categorically exclude large groups of patients therefore also older people 5 opinion-leader bioethicist a caplan interviewed by a major national newspaper makes similar age cut-off claims which are also underpinned by utilitarian calculus 
although a patients age is not the only consideration it is one it would be dishonest if we didnt say age is a driver age is correlated with resilience because younger patients in general get better faster they may free up a ventilator more quickly for the next patient3
 moreover in the us social distancing measures have been implemented rather late andor sporadically across different states including states with populations older than the national average4 effectively putting older people and other vulnerable groups at risk a common argument for such inconsistent implementation was the decision to assign more importance to the economy than to the health of the population  alongside the false myth that younger people could not develop serious complications from covid-195 these initial signs of age discrimination in time of covid-19 seem to go in parallel with a contemporary dangerous trend there are indeed some scholars supporting the idea both of a priori age-based cut-offs for access to certain kinds of medical intervention and preaching that older people should sacrifice themselves for the good of younger generations before the emergence of covid-19 an american oncologist and bioethicist e emanuel sparked some controversy 6 after writing about his plan to self-impose a cut-off of 75 years for access to any curative treatment and accepting only palliative treatment6 such proposals echoed the previous 65 year cut-off advocated by d callahan 7 and even arguments about the existence of a duty to die 8 the common denominators of these positions include the utilitarian idea that continuing to live after a certain age can impose significant financial burdens to healthcare systems as well as financial and emotional burdens to family andor caregivers younger generations and society as a whole another denominator is the critique of the hype around biomedical innovation and the tendency to overmedicalize death which may foster illusions of immortality finally these positions share the idea that living too long can also be a loss for the old persons in terms of their own quality of life the same arguments used by those who sustain those a priori age-based cut-offs have previously featured in literature for example they are not too dissimilar from the ones used by trollope in his 1882 satirical dystopian novel the fixed period 9 here he depicts a society that has progressed beyond the limits of civilisation and has agreed upon euthanasia a decent and comfortable departure for the elderly when they reach the age of 67 and a half unfortunately the abstract and fictional positions sketched above are currently being actualised for example in texas lieutenant governor dan patrick said he would be willing to die to preserve the us economy from covid-19 public health measures as someone who turns 70 next week he was in the high-risk group but    he was willing to give up his life for his six grandchildren7 in italy father giuseppe berardelli 72 died after choosing to give his respirator to a younger coronavirus patient8 an important argument against potential age-related euthanasia or suicide and against the dangerous and immoral stigmatisation of aging is the fact that older people should have the same rights as others to receive high-quality health care and the rights not to be spurred  especially by key opinion leaders - to consider their own death as something good moreover not all older individuals have the same clinical psychosocial and other contextual features and expectations that is what could be good for emanuel callahan patrick and berardelli may not be good for others a 70-year-old patient may have a better chance of survival and benefit more from intensive or other forms of medical treatment than a 30-year-old one notably there are studies showing how the so called oldest old  ie patients 90 years old or older  with early stage lung cancer can benefit from surgery 10 even in the context of the current pandemic there is revealing news eg in italy a 101-year-old man9 and a 102- year-old woman10 have recovered from covid-19 these examples are also in line with the who active aging policy framework that is the process of optimizing opportunities for health participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age 11 moral imperative of respect for the autonomy and dignity of old people notwithstanding discriminatory positions are problematic also from a utilitarian and economic point of view for example us citizens aged 50 and older represent the 35 of the entire population account for 40 of the national gross domestic product and contribute 43 of us taxes 12 while it is important to honour those who have survived into their later years for their contributions to family and society it is also important to understand the practical and objective contributions that older adults still make to their communities and their families and occasionally even to the world it seems that there is a contradictory attitude towards the older population on the one hand older people are cajoled especially for business reasons the silver economy on the other hand as soon as the younger generation is under pressure older people run the risk of being stigmatised or discriminated 13 it is also important to highlight that such forms of discrimination can pit one generation against the other seriously impoverishing the whole fabric of societies exceptional and austere situations like the current and previous pandemics can elicit the best and the worst of humanity despite the current covid-19 circumstances or possibly even more so it is key to shape the public sphere in ways that allow to recognise both the vulnerabilities and potentialities of all generations one way to do so is to respect the individual person going beyond categories such as age or age groups and to promote intergenerational equity and solidarity by fostering connectedness across different generations caring and protecting older people is not only about respecting their dignity and autonomy it opens up invaluable possibilities for all generations to engage with collective memories and traditions  promoting the exchange of skills knowledge and understanding  responding to covid-19 whats the problem roderick lawrence j   first multi-level governance of this global pandemic is fundamental at the outset we challenge political and public scepticism illustrated by the incapacity of politicians and laypeople to listen and learn from scientific knowledge and professional know-how in the context of uncertainty and vulnerability governance denotes the way that governments public administrations private enterprises and community associations interpret the pandemic and how they decide collectively to respond to it in order to reduce known unknowns about this beta-type coronavirus with species jump the coordinated synthesis of interdisciplinary information and knowledge professional know-how and individual and social perceptions and understandings are necessary then this broad understanding can be applied to define the appropriate allocation of many types of resources eg administrative financial human material medical pharmaceutical and scientific necessary to implement effective responses see fig 1 in contrast to south korea and taiwan many european countries have reacted by following the propagation of this coronavirus rather than being proactive to prevent it despite the warnings made by scientists from 2004 1 the contrasting responses of federalnational stateregional and citylocal authorities between and within countries since january 2020 illustrate how differently this real-world challenge has been interpreted for example comparisons between cities in the lombardy and veneto regions in northern italy highlight successes and shortcomings that can be interpreted as lessons learned 2 several types of resources coexist for coordinated action and systemic responses to this extraordinary situation administrative behavioural financial health care legal and medical resources and have been used at different geo-political levels sometimes in an uncoordinated fashion of winner takes all notably some actions have been endorsed by the world health organization eg confinement quarantine distancing testing washing hands whereas others have not eg wearing masks in public spaces the diverse interpretations and responses of governments and public administrations confirm that evidence-based policy is a theoretical concept that is often not applied in current circumstances like many others including ambient air pollution and passive tobacco smoking notably some local authorities in american and european cities have not introduced systematic testing and proactive tracing or legally binding measures to protect population health the second prerequisite condition is the importance of specialised data information knowledge and professional know-how required to understand and counteract a new virus for which there is still no proven medical or pharmaceutical remedy the known unknowns about this coronavirus can be identified and studied using principles of one health ecological public health and planetary health during transdisciplinary research and practice in community settings to collect facts on the ground beyond the walls of laboratories 3 the non-linear uncertain and unpredictable characteristics of this coronavirus are derived from the evolving interfaces between natural ecosystems and human-made environments that accommodate people and all other living organisms that may be vectors of zoonoses including this coronavirus these novel situations created by rapid urbanisation in cities and mega-urban regions can be analysed by interdisciplinary case studies of the multiple consequences of rapid urbanisation these transdisciplinary case studies should combine biological epidemiological medical and veterinary research together with methods of behavioural and social science research in addition to knowledge and know-how acquired from biological ecological health medical and veterinary sciences this pandemic confirms the crucial function and contribution of access to many types of resources when they are needed in particular sufficient stocks of medical equipment hospital wards with specialised infrastructure replenished supplies of pharmaceutical products adequate numbers of trained and qualified medical doctors nursing staff and auxiliary personnel in hospitals medical centres and nursing homes for elderly persons and coordinated uses of all these resources when the virus is first diagnosed in specific localities we now know from experience in asian countries and italy that the timing of responses to the first diagnosis of this virus in specific cities and mega-urban regions is crucial for the effectiveness of counter-measures the comparison and stark contrast between interventions and resources in asian cities including seoul taipei and singapore compared with london and new york is a timely reminder that anticipation by proactive thinking and preemptive measures by prospective planning vary considerably between countries and cities irrespective of their gdp or political regime the asian cities learned important lessons from the coronavirus sars-cov-1 in 20022003 which impacted more than 28 countries highlighting the fundamental contribution of preemptive measures founded on empirical knowledge also national and city comparisons confirm the vital contribution of strategic public health policies after a global shift towards the privatisation of medical and health care services in the last three decades in many countries ironically many advocates of laissez-faire and neo-liberal economics now expect governments to intervene to support private enterprises that are financially fragile or bankrupt including those that failed to provide much needed medical and pharmaceutical equipment currently imported from foreign countries 4 the third prerequisite condition that influences effective national city and communal responses to counteract the transmission of coronavirus concern individual household and community adherence to behavioural norms and new regulations introduced by national and local governments some interventions by governments and public administrations concern regulating personal behaviour and interpersonal contacts for example norms and rules include different degrees of confinement controlled access to outdoor public spaces markets and shops social distancing wearing masks and washing hands public adherence to these norms and rules cannot be assumed owing to cultural social and psychological reasons including religious customs spiritual beliefs group identity and the notion of individual liberty diverse individual and group perceptions of health risks attributed to coronavirus coexist in societies that have endorsed the supremacy of individualism at the expense of collectivism the authority of divine providence and rights of humans above all other living organisms on earth in this context of heterogeneous lifestyles values and worldviews appropriate data and information should be effectively communicated to target groups in order to create responsible behaviour not only for individual health or social well-being but also for the common good we now know there are crucial compromises and trade-offs between individual liberty and personal responsibility as well as fundamental collective choices about how to respond to economic health and social threats in the context of uncertainty and vulnerability we also know that a patient-centred strategy that targets highly vulnerable individuals and groups should be complemented by a community-centred approach the negative impacts of this pandemic confirm a well-known correlation between socioeconomic inequalities and mortality rates of populations at national regional and city levels 5 while targeting populations should identify and respond to the needs of vulnerable groups this pandemic confirms that an area-based approach in countries and cities is also pertinent eg wuhan in the province of hubei china bergamo and lodi in the province of lombardy italy this dual approach often used in environmental health interventions underlines the importance of working with an in-depth understanding of the contextual conditions in which the coronavirus has been diagnosed normative behavioural codes and rules should not ignore the societal context including inter- and intra-urban differences notably a who recommendation to wash hands repeatedly is unrealistic for all those people an estimated 790 million people 11 of the worlds population who do not have access to a supply of affordable clean and safe water 6 this brief commentary confirms that our livelihood and our health are strongly influenced by the biological ecological financial political and cultural milieu in which we live this milieu our habitat and our livelihoods are founded on fundamental monetary and non-monetary values the extraordinary situation of the current pandemic should be a catalyst for rethinking the hierarchy of priorities and values used implicitly and explicitly to sustain our societies the capacity of public authorities private enterprises scientists practitioners and community associations to respond effectively to major public health threats such as this coronavirus should be founded on in-depth understanding of the medical veterinary and societal variables that influence health and quality of life in specific cities there are significant differences between health impacts in geneva and zurich switzerland or between adelaide and sydney in australia or between boston and new york city in the usa and these differences need deciphering in each city a dual temporal perspective should be used to understand its particularities initially short-term responses should respond to patients and curtailing the transmission of the virus within and between cities and countries this immediate response should be supplemented by mid- and long-term responses founded on strategic actions initiatives that reduce health and economic vulnerability the growing number of accounts of the impacts of coronavirus in countries and cities north and south of the equator presented by the mass media in recent weeks highlights the shortcomings of neo-liberal economics and the fragility of human life in a world that has been transformed by rapid globalisation and urbanisation these ongoing processes around the globe have reduced the resilience of many countries and cities to counteract global threats because they have lost their capacity to act autonomously after becoming subservient to global production processes and trade with foreign countries in international markets eg dependent on imported face masks pharmaceutical products and ventilators from abroad to meet national demand some wealthy countries including switzerland rely heavily on foreign medical and nursing staff to efficiently operate public and private hospitals surprisingly some national governments have reacted by reintroducing controls at national borders which has been ineffective in limiting the propagation of the pandemic to over 210 countries and the transmission of the virus-provoking excess mortality in countries global governance is not possible if some countries do not comply with international agreements 7 these expressions of nationalism and sovereignty ignore that a global pandemic cannot be contained by closing national borders the main focus of discussion in european and other countries about the impacts of this pandemic on national economies has concentrated on lower production and consumption gdp in 2020 the need for public financial support to maintain private enterprises affected by the pandemic and grants for employees in the formal sector who have become unemployed the absence of attention to the impacts of this coronavirus on people working in the informal sector reinforces the lack of concern about health impacts of workers in all sectors including formal health services and personal care and welfare 8 it is unrealistic for workers to respect behavioural codes and rules that ignore that person-to-person contact is the basis on which daily work and income depend media reports indicate that many workers including doctors and nurses in hospitals and nursing homes do not have the personal equipment necessary to protect them finally public anxiety about this situation supported by mass media and social networking should raise major concerns about the quality of life and resilience of all peoples that can be influenced by major ecological threats eg climate change and extreme weather events economic instability since 2008 in many countries technological accidents eg fukushima in 2011 and ongoing civil unrest and warfare in several continents we need to rethink the real interconnected nature of our lives and the livelihoods of others on earth in contrast to the false claims for nationalism and protectionism in some countries notably we recall the plight of many victims of hunger and malnutrition that can be avoided by concerted action we underline here that about 9 million people die of hunger and malnutrition each year and 3 million of these are children who starve to death while about a third of all food produced is disposed as waste likewise the absurdity of the request for social by staying at home given that not less than 150 million people are declared homeless and 16 billion are estimated to live in inadequate housing 9 the fundamental issue is whether the current pandemic will be a catalyst for collective radical rethinking about the future of us and others in a world that should become more ecologically responsible more economically just and more socially equitable for the common good or a shared quest for returning to business as usual  disease now and potential future pandemics walter dodds   diseases have probably existed since soon after the first life evolved all organisms known today have diseases these infections harm bacteria fungi protozoa plants and animals many of our diseases have their own diseases disease is an inescapable feature of human life humans can contract communicable diseases from bacteria fungi helminthes protozoa viruses and prions a little biology my favorite subject is required to understand how they cause disease how novel diseases can arise and why some of them are so difficult to control helminthes are simple animals little microscopic worms these animals often lack digestive systems as they take nutrition directly from their hosts they have complex life cycles and can inhabit several hosts evolution has stripped these animals down to only the basics required for living off others schistosomiasis is the most common helminth disease causing widespread suffering initial infection can cause fever chills and liver and spleen enlargement chronic infections can lead to liver or kidney failure bladder cancer heart failure and other symptoms this disease is difficult to treat and causes major suffering in the world at any one time over 200 million people are infected mostly in africa this disease is a major cause of suffering but we dont know enough to eradicate it we have studied most tropical diseases far less than those influencing populations in wealthier temperate countries worldwide cooperation in study of all major diseases is required to decrease the amount of suffering related to helminth diseases fungal diseases are becoming more dominant as sources of mortality they are particularly problematic for immune-compromised patients but some of the diseases are endemic in environments around the world they cause less mortality than many other diseases protozoa are single-celled microbes that are tremendously diverse and play both positive and negative roles for humans protozoa cause a variety of nasty diseases including african sleeping sickness giardia and cryptosporidium two major causes of diarrhea these diseases are difficult to control because protozoa are more like us than bacteria and chemicals that kill them tend to harm humans of the diseases caused by protozoa malaria is one of the top diseases causing death and suffering in the world mosquitoes carry this disease and it is common in tropical areas worldwide as global warming increases temperatures mosquitoes will move into formerly colder climates spreading malaria to new areas there are over 200 million cases and a half million deaths each year from malaria this is one of the major scourges of humanity and it is a difficult disease to prevent and cure more research is essential to control this disease prions are strange disease agents that arise from proteins that cause other proteins to change shape and become ineffective the mad cow disease is probably the best known of these diseases this prion-caused disease arose when meat producers in europe fed animals neural material brain and spinal tissues from other cattle cannibalism is not natural for cattle but the practice arose because it stimulated growth when animals consumed waste by-products from other slaughtered cattle some of the sick animals had a protein in their brains that was defective and could infect the brains of other cattle when ingested if people unknowingly eat beef contaminated with some of this infected neural tissue they also become infected the defective protein causes human neural proteins to lose their function slowly over time people have died from this and related prion diseases however this number is small relative to other diseases and i will not consider it further some of the worst diseases of humankind are bacterial including the black death  plague tuberculosis cholera salmonella and coliform diseases while antibiotics allow treatments for many of these diseases they still infect and kill millions of people each year bacteria are very simple cells and can completely replicate themselves if provided the basic vitamins and compounds they require the vast majority of bacteria are harmless to humans and even beneficial for instance if we did not have bacteria that decompose dead animals and plants the earth would rapidly fill with these and there would be no resources left for the living a very small number of bacteria relative to the total millions of species on earth can cause significant disease in humans of these some do so incidentally and can live indefinitely in the environment without ever interacting with a human in any way however a few can only live in animals and can lead to debilitating if not fatal diseases intermediate between these two strategies are the bacteria that opportunistically cause disease in humans but can live freely without an animal host viruses like prions are not individual life forms they are more like information parasites that completely rely on their hosts for reproduction viruses take advantage of the fact that we use dna as the blueprint containing the information we use to make all cellular components and rna to translate that information from dna into the structure and machinery of the cells proteins viruses subvert the cells reproductive machinery for their own nefarious purposes the reproduction and dispersal of more viruses all viruses unlike bacteria must take advantage of living cells with dna to reproduce viral diseases include hiv smallpox polio hepatitis influenza ebola and rabies viral diseases also infect and kill millions of people per year our bodies and our species are engaged in ongoing arms races against our diseases just as all other species are in a biological arms race with their diseases in the short-term our immune systems learn to recognize and fight diseases in the long-term humans have evolved defenses against the diseases for each defense humanity has evolved the diseases have evolved ways to get around the defense the red queen hypothesis describes this arms race the red queen from lewis carrols alice in wonderland needs to run as fast as she can just to stay in place this hypothesis suggests that organisms need to evolve as fast as they can to keep up with the organisms with which they interact because they are evolving as well this is a case of feedback as both members of the interaction need to keep evolving to survive in the case of human diseases this arms race leads to a situation where humans are constantly adapting to their diseases and the diseases are constantly evolving to take advantage of their hosts more effectively to make things more complex a disease that can jump from host to host such as the flu that can move from pigs to humans can escape the evolved defenses of one host by moving into another we will consider this more completely when considering diseases arising from other animals sometimes these crossover diseases are too successful in this case the disease can completely kill off its new host leading to extinction of the disease itself it is certainly a worst-case scenario that such a disease would arise in humans humans have an immune system that can protect against most invasive diseases but once an invader evolves a mechanism to skirt the human immune system it can infect people everywhere infections will occur as long as humans do not evolve a way to keep the disease from reproducing or find a way to avoid exposure to the disease evolution to evade human immune defense is why viruses that cause colds move though human populations so readily the group of cold viruses has evolved a way to swap genetic information continuously creating new viruses there are around 100 strains of cold virus and each person gets a cold roughly twice a year thus it would take you 50 years to go through all the cold viruses and in that time new viruses could evolve the process of evolution is not nice because the very basis of natural selection is that some organisms die and others that are better adapted survive when a novel deadly disease arises it may not kill all the people that it infects but could kill most and only the lucky few who survive can reproduce and pass their offspring resistance to the disease likewise if humans become very resistant to a disease either through evolution or by technology eg an effective vaccine it might die out the ideas of humans evolving resistance to diseases and of diseases becoming more effective at infecting people lead to some of the major points in jared diamonds book guns germs and steel 25 he suggests that successful invading cultures are those that have evolved to be resistant to a larger array of diseases and as they evolve this resistance the diseases become more virulent infective in order to spread this evolution can lead to a situation where people are no longer killed by a disease and some of them become disease carriers such a group of people will bring these diseases with them upon colonizing a new area the disease that is not lethal to the colonists could be quite lethal to the colonized people that have no evolutionary experience with it european colonization of the americas is a prime example of this form of migration and conquering other groups of people agriculture and technology made possible the large populations and cities in europe and asia people living in dense urban environments and trade routes connecting those groups of people across vast areas created the perfect breeding grounds for new diseases to develop living in close proximity to domestic animals further stimulated the emergence of new diseases the huge land mass of these two connected continents and a modest connection to africa as well meant that there were many locations for diseases to develop then spread across the continents exposure to repeated waves of diseases allowed europeans to develop immunity to those diseases while still chronically harboring many of them when europeans encountered the indigenous peoples of the americas they gave them their diseases these diseases probably moved across the american continents faster than the europeans invaders did the resulting wave of diseases could have killed even more people than the black death of europe we will never know exactly because there are no written records and no accurate methods to estimate the exact causes of death of the pre-european human population in the americas however archeologists have found evidence for a large crash in american indian populations across both north and south america after first contact with europeans the estimates are 57 mortality these estimates are based on genetic methods that can be used to indicate drastic population reductions from all causes in the past 26 thus the european colonists entered a land with relatively low population density that was poorly defended with a huge amount of exploitable resources the endless cycle of disease massive death development of resistance and resurgence of disease was the hallmark of human history until we developed the technology to control many of our diseases cultural evolution moved ahead of biological evolution and protected us by changing our behaviors and ultimately by allowing us to develop the tools to manipulate the biochemistry of our own cells to fight off diseases inoculation with vaccines while many animals have adaptations that help them avoid disease one of the earliest unique signs of human cultural technological developments to avoid disease and make food more digestible is the act of cooking food additional steps to avoid diseases included cultural changes such as dietary restrictions of religions as well as guidance in matters of personal hygiene in ancient cultures and religions by the mid-1800s john snow used statistical methods to link a cholera outbreak in london to a particular well on broad street the authorities shut down the well probably helping end the outbreak this understanding of the source of disease was the first case of using epidemiology the science of incidence distribution and possible control of diseases to help understand how to control disease 27 at about this time louis pasteur developed the idea that bacteria spread disease once people had microscopes they could see bacteria and assign them as potentially causative agents of disease these observations by pasteur and his contemporaries led to a rapid succession of ways to control diseases including purification of drinking water preservation of food pasteurization and sterilization or sanitization during surgeries it was not until the discovery of antibiotics and vaccinations that humans really started to free themselves of some of the worst diseases in history at least temporarily people started looking for chemical agents to destroy bacteria once science confirmed that they caused diseases alexander fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 and in 1942 howard florey and ernst chain developed the drug penicillin in an easily produced and administered form yet humans still did not win the evolutionary battle between bacterial disease and humankind when fleming gave his nobel acceptance speech in 1945 he noted that bacteria could develop that were resistant to penicillin if exposed to less than lethal concentrations within 2 years of the advent of clinical use of penicillin clinicians had noted antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in human patients antibiotic resistance is a classic case of evolution a very low proportion of bacteria in a population have the ability to survive exposure to the antibiotic there is a low level of mutation leading to very small differences in the dna in each bacterium by chance one or a few have a mutation that allows them to escape death from the antibiotic these bacteria reproduce and soon take over the entire population bacteria are particularly well suited to rapid evolution because their populations are so huge and grow so quickly that the chance that one cell has a mutation that makes it resistant is high even though the chance that each individual cell is resistant is extremely low there are about 100000000000000 a hundred trillion bacteria associated with each human this is about 1000 times as many as there are stars in our galaxy or 100000 times as many as all the people on earth there is an even more interesting and insidious twist to this story bacteria have special little bits of dna called plasmids since bacteria are not sexual organisms they cannot exchange genetic material through sex like we other animals and many plants do instead they trade these little plasmids they can trade this genetic material within or among species thus antibiotic resistance can move among different species of bacteria a recent spread of antibiotic resistance illustrates the problem 28 the antibiotic colistin represents a last-ditch compound used to treat infections that are resistant to multiple antibiotics the gene mcr-1 started showing up in bacterial infections in hospitals around the world and this gene makes bacterial infections resistant to colistin the antibiotic colistin had seen limited use in humans because it has bad side effects however swine farmers use it researchers sequenced isolates of colistin-resistant bacteria from 31 countries and the genetic data suggested the gene arose in a pig farm in china in 2006 it took less than 12 years for disease-causing bacteria containing the gene to move from livestock to humans globally numerous plasmids for antibiotic resistance have spread readily around the world now microbiologists can take a sample from the center of the ocean and isolate bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics only synthesized by humans thousands of miles away thus in the evolutionary battle we cannot easily vanquish disease-causing bacteria controlling the expansion of resistance to new and existing antibiotics requires an understanding of evolution taking a full course of antibiotics to be certain the drug completely clears the infection only using antibiotics when they are necessary and not allowing livestock producers to use antibiotics added to feed solely to increase growth rates of healthy animals are all necessary to decrease the probability that bacteria will become resistant to antibiotics cooperation not to overuse antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance is necessary to control this threat this cooperation needs to be worldwide given the propensity of diseases and antibiotic resistance to spread rapidly around the world this is an evolutionary arms race with bacteria rapidly evolving ways to resist antibiotics and humans developing new weapons against bacteria we need science to win the arms race by coming up with novel antibiotics to stop diseases resistant to the current antibiotics otherwise we end up back where humanity has been for most of its history at the mercy of bacterial infection we live in a world where millions of people die each year from preventable diseases these diseases often only cause temporary illness to people in developed countries for example in developed countries we do not generally consider diarrhea a fatal disease and we successfully treat most severe cases with hydration and chemical therapy in bad cases intravenous fluids can prevent dehydration likewise many cases of pneumonia can be treated particularly bacterial-caused cases that are treatable with antibiotics however pneumonia is the top cause of death diarrhea the second and malaria and problems with childbirth are the next two top killers of children when considered worldwide diarrhea causes 15 of global deaths in children under 5 years of age even though it is treatable with access to basic medical care and many cases are preventable with clean food and water pneumonia causes even more childhood deaths 18 essentially all of these deaths occur in developing countries vaccines against some bacteria that cause pneumonia can help and access to antibiotics for bacterial cases can help cure the disease inoculations against measles and whooping cough pertussis can also help reduce mortality as these diseases can lead to pneumonia malnourished children are more susceptible as well as those are that are exposed to indoor air pollution smoke from cooking fires  only about 15 of the children with bacterial pneumonia even have access to antibiotics solutions are obvious and not tremendously expensive still the solutions to these diseases require global cooperation and a concerted effort there is good news child mortality rates continue to fall and diseases are decreasing worldwide 29 however in undeveloped countries rates are still high and not declining rapidly enough the following interventions could reduce childhood disease in parentheses by over 40 1 breastfeeding diarrhea pneumonia neonatal sepsis 2 insecticide-treated nets malaria 3 additional food for infants 612 months old diarrhea pneumonia measles malaria 4 zinc supplements diarrhea pneumonia 5 sanitary delivery childbirth deaths 6 hib vaccine pneumonia and 7 clean water diarrhea pneumonia oral rehydration therapy antibiotics and antimalarial therapy could reduce deaths by another 31 none of these steps seems that difficult globally including adults and children the world health organization estimates that millions of people are afflicted by treatable diseases these include in millions diarrheal disease 4620 lower respiratory infections 429 malaria 241 measles 27 pertussis 18 dengue 9 tuberculosis 8 and hiv 28 many of these diseases are disproportionately harming people in less developed countries the study of epidemics is essential to understanding how diseases spread from one organism to another diseases can be passed from person to person from animals to people or from the environment to people a firm set of general principles of the conditions under which harmful diseases will emerge some of them already referred to here are now widely agreed upon by epidemiologists these general principles in addition to a number of unique behaviors in humans lead to the conclusion that the probability of global disease is increasing drastically density of hosts is important in proliferation of disease in diseases that move from person to person the greater the frequency of contact between people the more quickly disease can increase we now live in a world where over half the people live in cities the total number of people on earth is still increasing leading to ever-greater population density people move from city to city and around the globe more quickly and more frequently than ever many diseases have an incubation time of days to a week historically long-distance travel across oceans took months if somebody with a deadly disease boarded a boat it could kill all the people on the boat or they would be over the disease and no longer infective before they reached their destination thus conditions are more conducive than ever for the spread of a new deadly disease around the world new diseases are more likely to arise when there is opportunity for them to take hold stressed or unhealthy people are more likely to contract and transmit diseases than healthy individuals we now have a greater absolute number of disease-prone malnourished people on earth than at any time in history people who live in cities particularly the poor are under constant stress from crowded living conditions unhealthy environments and the pressure to survive a greater proportion of people live in cities now than any time in history and the total number of people living in cities is also greater novel diseases arise when humans come in contact with animals that can transmit diseases to humans zoonotic diseases 30 we already have dozens of diseases that come from animals we grow ever more animals to feed people as increasing population and standard of living increases demand for meat we grow these animals under crowded conditions oftentimes we breed the animals for maximum growth and they are genetically similar conditions that can lead to greater disease susceptibility we raise many pigs and birds in huge numbers in close proximity most diseases that arise in birds are not transmissible to people however they are more transmissible to pigs once the bird diseases establish in pigs they are more likely to evolve ways to be infectious to humans bush meat refers to wild animals killed by people for protein as people move into more remote areas they hunt wildlife to satisfy their protein needs there is a particularly high chance of disease transmission from animals to humans when people butcher wild animals and make contact with fresh blood and organs from these animals human populations are growing and moving into more wild areas particularly in the tropics most new human diseases come from wild animals as people stress natural ecosystems the probability for such transmission could increase because we displace other animals from their natural habitats causing them to move longer distances and they are more susceptible to disease because of the stress induced by human pressure there is also a demand for live exotic meat in some asian countries in particular in this case merchants bring caged animals into dense markets in close contact with other animals and many people these are perfect conditions for a novel disease to spread from infected animals to livestock and people more people in the world are now immune compromised than ever offering another reservoir for diseases around 40 million people are hiv positive and may become immune compromised in areas where medical care is available these people are receiving quite a few antibiotics leading to increased antibiotic resistance evolving in bacterial diseases in addition recipients of transplanted organs are generally immune compromised because drugs given to them to avoid rejection of the transplants also halt immunity to disease humans have also developed some novel behaviors that further increase the probability of transmission of diseases particularly those that require blood-to-blood contact intravenous use of illegal drugs leads to sharing of needles and has resulted in transmission of hiv and hepatitis b and c this behavior could also lead to transmission of novel diseases in the future blood transfusions and organ transplants can also lead to movement of diseases people receiving blood products were some of the first victims of the hiv pandemic organ transplants from other species into humans could also lead to transmission of novel diseases the most common species considered for organ transplants into humans are apes and pigs both these groups of animals carry viruses that may be harmless to them but cause extreme disease in humans such transplants are very rare currently but given that the majority of people on organ transplant lists are not able to obtain an organ before they die it is likely such transplants will increase as research progresses on ways to accomplish such transplants successfully the field of epidemiology tells us that it is becoming more probable that new diseases will develop existing diseases could evolve into more deadly and virulent forms all diseases will multiply more quickly and they will continue to become resistant to human efforts to control them these findings have ramifications for both chronic diseases and new diseases one of the worst worldwide pandemics was the spanish flu that started in 1918 it killed about 3 of the world population and infected about 16 of all people the bubonic plague in the 1300s infected about 14 of the earths human population and killed an estimated 13 the swine flu h1n1 started in 2009 and infected about 14 of humanity but killed less than a hundredth of 1 of our population scientists have traced the first widespread series of cases of hivaids to 1981 but the disease probably jumped into humans in the early 1900s since then about 1 of people on earth are living with hiv and about 15 million people per year die because of aids about 2 of the human population deaths each year is from aids-related causes worldwide waves of disease are a regular occurrence throughout human history and becoming more common recently the world has been concerned terrified about ebola symptoms include fever severe headache muscle pain weakness fatigue diarrhea vomiting abdominal stomach pain unexplained hemorrhage bleeding or bruising and death this disease has been simmering in africa for decades outbreaks have occurred in sub-saharan africa regularly since 1976 in 2014 an outbreak started in guinea and jumped to other african countries in weeks and then to countries around the world killing over 10000 people in 2019 almost 2000 people died in the democratic republic of the congo and stopping the disease there has been difficult because of warfare this outbreak has spread to uganda the ease of global movement and increased travel continue to increase the potential for spread of the disease what if this disease evolves to an even more easily transmitted form there is no treatment or vaccine although some promising vaccines are being developed disease epidemics that do not kill a large proportion of the human population are common in the 1700s there were 13 epidemics and in the 1800s 12 with 5 pandemic influenza epidemics in the 1900s the data suggest that roughly every 1020 years there are epidemics with some mortality that infect a quarter to a third of the worlds population you could argue that disease has not wiped out humans yet so it will not in the future unfortunately science has documented cases where diseases cause the extinction of an entire species for example people have inadvertently moved a fungal disease around the world that kills amphibians frogs and salamanders this disease is leading to numerous species extinctions globally i have seen the effects of this disease first hand in panama we studied the consequences of the fungal disease killing all adult frogs leading to loss of all the tadpoles in panamanian mountain streams scientists had already documented that the disease was moving through north america to south america through central america the disease kills frogs in high-elevation areas and moves through lower-elevation areas without killing most animals we knew that the area we were working in was going in the direct path of the disease so we set up a before-after experiment to understand the effects on our first visit to the mountain stream there were frogs everywhere we needed to be careful not to step on them as we walked the trails each square yard of stream bottom had up to a hundred tadpoles twenty frog species used the streams for reproduction and many of these species were entirely restricted to cooler areas with high altitude on this particular volcanic mountain from sunset to sunrise the jungle was a riot of frog choruses there were fantastically colored adult frogs including the stunning black and white panamanian golden frog a species that has special meaning for panamanians we made our measurements on the stream and enjoyed the frogs two years later the disease had swept through as it progressed through the country from costa rica when we drove up to the stream for the after disease infection experiment it was immediately clear that it was different hoping against hope i went down to the stream but there were no tadpoles and no adult frogs on the banks it was very quiet and sad the stream had dense growths of algae because no tadpoles were eating it and the absence of the tadpoles fundamentally changed the way the stream functioned in the end maybe 100 species will go extinct from this disease through this and other examples we know that some diseases have driven animals and plants to extinction 31 in hawaii 16 cases of bird extinctions have come about at least in part because of diseases numerous mammals and birds have gone extinct from diseases alone or in combination with other factors such as habitat loss 32 thus it is not impossible that humans could suffer the same fate the conditions that could lead to such a tragedy are making it more likely that such a disease could infect the human population throughout human history new nasty diseases have arisen many of them have jumped into humans from other species whenever a particularly virulent disease has infected a human and killed most of the people exposed to it the population of people infected was small and disconnected from the rest of humanity epidemiology tells us that the incidents that were formerly isolated now have the potential to sweep across the globe and cause massive death and suffering we are increasing the conditions under which such diseases can arise and transmit to people ever more intimate contact with wildlife dense livestock production losses of biodiversity caused by humans also are predicted to increase the transmission of infectious human diseases 33 it is no wonder that new diseases like avian flu h1n1  ebola and sars are popping up with alarming regularity adding to the worry viral evolution is unpredictable and a new deadly strain of virus could arise from laboratories working on viruses that are presumably safe and contained in this case a newly virulent strain could arise escape and become a pandemic 34 at the same time new diseases challenge the safety of people and the ability to treat such diseases increases we can develop vaccines rapidly antiviral drugs are available that work at least well enough to decrease mortality however only those people in developed countries are able to afford or even have access to methods to protect from sickness and death from these infections as usual the poorer people of the world will suffer the worst of globalization increased population greater chance of new diseases and unequal distribution of basic health care in late 2011 and early 2012 two laboratories one at the university of wisconsin-madison usa and the other at erasmus mc in rotterdam the netherlands found out how to make avian flu h5n1 transmissible in ferrets this research ignited a firestorm of controversy because the deadly virus could also spread among humans much more easily the researchers submitted the work for publication but journals held up the release of the papers because of fears that people with bad intent bioterrorists or countries willing to employ biological warfare could use the information to transform this and other viruses to more deadly forms ultimately the journals published the work as eventually the information would get out this is the way science works once the general concept for an important idea is out somebody else is certain to replicate the experiment thus information on how to create a deadly disease is ever more available accidental release from existing research facilities is also a concern the deadliest diseases known to humanity are stored and researched in containment facilities found around the world smallpox has killed people for at least 3000 years and following vaccination it was completely eradicated from human populations in the 1970s a number of laboratories still keep cultures in 1978 one person died from exposure to the virus in a british laboratory after that scientists transferred all cultures to two laboratories one in russia and one in the united states entire generations have reached adulthood with no exposure to the disease if smallpox was ever released by accident or on purpose a scientist with phd-level training could potentially re-create it from the known genetic sequence it could cause massive mortality in 1979 the sverdlovsk military facility accidentally released anthrax causing 100 human deaths soviet researchers probably isolated this highly virulent strain of anthrax from rodents in the soviet city of kirov the facility had likely accidentally released the bacterium at least once previously anthrax is able to survive as dry spores and soviets were presumably producing it to arm biological weapons while research on diseases is necessary to learn about causes and cures of the diseases that influence humans such research comes with a cost the ability to contain these diseases in research settings is plagued with the problem of potential human error in addition the possibility of terrorist attacks on such facilities is perhaps remote but real in 1984 followers of bhagwan shree rajneesh in oregon released salmonella into 10 restaurant salad bars sickening 751 people in an attempt to keep them from voting in a local election in which the cult had candidates luckily nobody died in this incident but it does illustrate that people can be capable of bioterrorism in june of 1993 members of the aum shinrikyo cult sprayed anthrax from the top of an eight-story building in the heart of tokyo fortunately the disease did not take hold the strain they used was not very deadly and they had problems with a sprayer so the dispersion of the disease was not as effective as they had hoped this group had previously set up multiple laboratories and had experimented with the toxin for botulism cholera and q fever a dangerous bacterial disease carried by livestock they also previously sponsored a trip to the democratic republic of congo that was an attempt to bring back an isolate of ebola this apocalyptic cult eventually released the chemical weapon sarin in the tokyo subway killing 12 people and sickening thousands while both these examples are unusual cases we are entering a world where a few crazy people or one crazy country could do tremendous damage to humanity if they had access to the right materials and knowledge such knowledge is becoming commonplace every year academia cranks out numerous phds around the world with the technical expertise to build a deadly virus with the right equipment chemicals reagents and knowledge of the sequence at the same time technology to work with dna sequences is getting cheaper easier to use and more broadly available with a million dollars and proper training it is now possible to create designer diseases we should consider motives in this discussion as well a terrorist who wanted to kill many people but wanted to discriminate victims would not only need to create a disease but also vaccinate or protect all the people they did not want to die while a few doses of a disease placed appropriately could quickly spread around the world creating many doses of vaccine is a far more daunting and expensive task thus it seems unlikely that any of the major terrorist groups would be able to create a disease and vaccinate large numbers of people before releasing the disease without being detected first such a task is not completely out of the question for a small country such as north korea there are insane people who just might try to take down the entire human race the mass shooting in a movie theater in denver in 2012 was carried out by a neuroscience phd student this individual could have had the technical ability to create a novel disease a scenario where such a person creates and releases a deadly virus is conceivable quite a bit of preparation and disaster training would be necessary to stop transmission of an infectious agent once it was released 35 active surveillance of disease outbreaks is necessary to react to a pandemic in time currently the world health organization keeps track of disease outbreaks but we need new methods to detect pandemics in time to respond an effort called global viral 30 is also helping move the international community toward predicting viral outbreaks by promoting science and education about viral outbreaks responses could include rapid development of vaccines to protect a population antiviral drugs to decrease the probability of mortality and increased capacity to produce these treatments public health officials are developing novel methods using social media and networks of cell phones to create an early warning system of disease outbreaks from remote areas additional improvements are possible in safety of livestock production safer practices in killing and butchering wild animals and education on behaviors that discourage the transmission of diseases there are several things that we can do to thwart bioterrorism the easiest way to obtain a disease would be for a terrorist to attack one of highest-level containment facilities in the world that has cultures of the deadliest diseases known to humankind these laboratories should be resistant to attack and have established procedures to quickly destroy all the diseases in them if they are compromised several historic agreements are present to stop the use of biological and chemical warfare and terrorism the 1925 geneva protocol the 1972 biological weapons convention the 1976 environmental modification convention and the 1993 chemical convention all strove to have all countries agree to not develop or use chemical or biological weapons 36 the obama administration was involved in international efforts to stop the spread of biological weapons to terrorists the united nations is developing other treaties measures might include careful accounting of the reagents that molecular biologists can use to produce diseases and barring companies from providing dna or rna synthesis for particular sequences known to be associated with disease organisms careful international monitoring of biological laboratories capable of handling pathogenic microbes is also necessary as well as protecting the laboratories that hold the deadliest human diseases all of these require modest cost but a substantial degree of international cooperation  for example if even one country allows synthesis of dangerous virus sequences and will sell those to individuals control elsewhere is pointless  a transparent open-source sird model for covid19 death projections in india ananye agarwal utkarsh tyagi  as india emerges from the lockdown with ever higher covid19 case counts and a mounting death toll reliable projections of case numbers and deaths counts are critical in informing policy decisions we examine various existing models and their shortcomings given the amount of uncertainty surrounding the disease we choose a simple sird model with minimal assumptions enabling us to make robust predictions we employ publicly available mobility data from google to estimate social distancing covariates which influence how fast the disease spreads we further present a novel method for estimating the uncertainty in our predictions based on first principles to demonstrate we fit our model to three regions spain italy nyc where the peak has passed and obtain predictions for the indian states of delhi and maharashtra where the peak is desperately awaited  india has just emerged from a long and strict lockdown there are doubts about effective the lockdown has been and where the country is going from here given the steep economic cost of lockdowns it is important to understand their impact on case numbers and death counts further given the lack of information about the novel coronavirus it is extremely hard to model the disease realistically in our work we choose a simple sird compartmental model in order to model death counts due to covid19 at a high level the sird compartmental model in epidemiology partitions the population into four compartments susceptible those people who can potentially be infected from the virus infected recovered and dead it also takes as input the the reproduction rate r 0  which depends on the social distancing behaviour of the people in the country this allows us to vary for the infection by capturing details of the policies being implemented with respect to lockdowns in the country and summarizing it in a single number  we list down popular models being referred to by the indian and international community and their shortomings and then we discuss how we overcome them ihme model after getting cited by the united states government for the covid19 projections the ihme model 1 has received a lot of attention from the public and professional community it relies on data from china and italy for training the model parameters and extend the model to the united states one of the criticisms for the model is that it uses statistical definitions to make predictions it cannot give information on the actual parameters underlying the disease spread due to departure from epidemiological theory it has consistently under-performed compared to the actual statistics and needs to be re-updated after every few weeks the code for this model is only partly open-sourced it is very hard for a third-party to replicate their results overcoming the limitations of the statistical models like ihme projections stanford published a nine compartment model 2  which explicitly tracks nine compartments including exposed asymptomatic pre-symptomatic symptomatic hospitalized and recovered a similar model was developed in the indian context 3 the criticism of this complex epidemiological model is that they have a large number of tunable and learnable parameters which interact in unpredictable ways further given the uncertainty surrounding the disease it is not clear how these values can be fixed reliably since the data provided by the government becomes unreliable as the cases increase the modelling in such cases becomes unreliable pracriti model by m3rg iit delhi the model by m3rg group of iit delhi 4 is an extension of the sier model that creates adaptive interacting and cluster-based seir compartments for district level populations this model suffers from limitations as stated for both previous models they have added a lot of mathematical parameters with do not have physical meaning and thus cannot be checked against real-world data with an additional migration term they assume the migration statistics irrespective of the movement of the migrants and their social distancing measures next the model doesnt perform well as on simple inspection as of the time of writing the r 0 for mumbai is reported as 073 while same value for the state of maharashtra is 133 this is unreasonable because mumbai is known to be contributing the most to the case load of maharashtra further there are no confidence intervals in their plots which makes their predictions meaningless since it is impossible to extrapolate cases with 100 accuracy further they have not open-sourced their code our model is inspired by the ones mentioned above and aims to combine various techniques to avoid the pitfalls outlined above salient features of our model include -modelling on daily deceased data we use daily deceased data for time-series forecasting of the covid19 in this work we only include projections for future deaths although this can be extended to projections for other things like the number of infections and the number of icu beds required the benefits of using deaths rather than infections is that the latter crucially depends on the scale of testing and reporting by the relevant government agencies further cases are reported as and when they are discovered which means that the time when a person was infected does not show up in the data on the other hand deaths due to covid19 occur in hospital icus and the exact time of death is known further since all patients who eventually die end up in the hospitals it is unlikely that deaths are being under-counted barring deliberate under-reporting in this way we bypass the uncertainty of testing further it can be argued that the death toll and number of icu beds required is more important to estimate than the total number of infections since most infected people recover from covid19 without medical assistance simplicity the model implements a four compartment sird based model where we vary reproduction number r 0  with respect to the social distancing measures this means that r 0 effectively summarizes the entire suite of prevention strategies adopted by a region as well as migration and mixing patters this gives us flexibility to monitor real-time policy changes in the data and update r 0 accordingly also because of just 4 compartments we require only a few disease-specific parameters the infectious period and mortality rate more complicated models need a larger number of parameters since the values of these parameters are not known accurately at this point of time it makes these models prone to over-fitting a fewer number of parameters also means that our model is region agnostic and can be implemented on national and state levels all over the world with minimal modification 2  cc-by-nc 40

theory we can do a sanity check on the inferred values to see if they agree with what is known at this point of time this can also be used in principle to compare the effects of different policies in mitigating the spread of the virus by comparing the variation in the reproduction number further we believe that any modelling effort must strive to be as transparent as possible this is because to the non-expert the projections churned out by sophisticated mathematical machinery seem to carry more weight than they really do in reality given the large number of variables involved most mathematical models end up being nothing more than educated guesses and are only as strong as the assumptions they implicitly make therefore we believe it is critical that all results should be made publicly available and the methodology explained in as detailed a manner as possible many models we have mentioned above do not do this they have not open-sourced their code completely and it is not possible or is very difficult and time-consuming to replicate their results by reading the technical reports alone in contrast we have completely open-sourced our code with relevant documentation so that the community can critique our assumptions and contribute their own ideas to improve the model since it is impossible to predict with 100 accuracy the death count into the future no model can be complete without providing confidence intervals for its projections we present a novel strategy to compute these confidence intervals from first principles with the empirical claim that most of the time the observed death counts will fall within these intervals an sird model is described by the following coupled differential equations here s i x are respectively the fraction of the population that is susceptible infected and deceased we omit the number of people who have recovered because we do not fit our model on that data t inf denotes the median amount of time a person stays infectious  x is average number of people who die from covid19 in a day as a fraction of the total number of active cases on that day r is the reproduction number of the disease which measures the average number of people an infected person transmits the disease to r  1 implies that the case count rises over time while r  1 implies that the case count diminishes over time with the rate of spread being determined by r note that in general r varies with time depending on the extent of social distancing practiced note that  x and t inf are spatially-invariant and time-invariant properties of the disease they depend on the virus specifics and how the human body responds to it thus this parameters can be bounded in a small range based on preliminary studies from wuhan and europe where cases of covid19 have been large we then see that all the information about the progression of the disease lies in a single parameter -r this is the major advantage of using a simple model we do not have to deal with lots of uncertain parameters that influence the final curve in unpredictable ways we can focus on estimating r as best we can further r is a well-established measure of disease spread in epidemiological literature which means there are already many existing estimates of r which our model can leverage r is a function of time and depends on among other things the lockdown and social distancing measures adopted by each country to estimate r we leverage open-source real-time social distancing data published by google 5  which allows us to model various mitigation measures by just two parameters as described below while the social mobility data does not account directly for various measures such as contact tracing and mask usage we nonetheless postulate that the timing of these measures is correlated with the timing of social distancing measures indicated by the mobility data the data available in aggregated form shows how the number of visitors who go to or spend time in categorized places change compared to pre-covid days a baseline day represents a normal value for that day of the week the 3  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the

categorized into retail and creation grocery and pharmacy parks transit stations workplaces and residential additionally for a sanity check we looked at the smartphone penetration in the country to validate the model the report by statcounter 6 suggests that android based smartphones constitute more than 95 of all smartphones being used in the country in april 2020 with this size of market share the open source data-model performs well we construct a social distancing covariate st from the changes in social mobility at various locations where each of the terms on the rhs above denote percentage change from baseline in mobility at the following locations  i r t -retail and recreation  i g t -grocery and pharmacy note that we ignore residential mobility data as residential mobility does not contribute to the spread of the disease next we smoothen the covariate st by applying a savitzky-golay filter followed by convolution with a localized gaussian multiple times the goal is to smooth out weekly variations in the data but not distort the overall profile of the curve this gives us st the smooth social distancing covariate since we only care about the timing of social distancing measures to relate st to r we introduce two parameters r min  r max  the r values when st is minimum and maximum respectively we then define r as a linear interpolation function of s between these two values mathematically where s max  s min are the global maximum and minimum values of st further we introduce a fixed lag  sd which equals the median time from infection to death this is because st influences the number of infections at time t the effect on deaths is seen only later where social distancing data is not available we naively extrapolate the existing data into the future as well as the past concretely we assume that past values equal the earliest value we know and future values equal the latest value this amounts to assuming that existing social distancing measures will continue into the future this assumption can be altered as we learn more about the disease and mitigation strategies in the future we solve the differential equations using a simple iterative procedure where the values of the next day are determined by the values of the previous day  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

more complicated numerical techniques like the runge-kutta methods because they proved to be too computationally intensive to fit a large number of models additionally for our purposes the above recurrences yield a reasonable approximation note that to solve the system of differential equations above we need to specify an initial condition in particular we need to specify initial values for time t and each of s i x since the set of differential equations 1  3 is valid at all points of time we can arbitrarily choose a starting point we start the model just before we get the first death obviously s t0  1 x t0  0 we choose i t0  1  x p where p is the population this choice implies that at day 1 there will be exactly one death since real death counts are discrete we choose t 0 in a narrow interval around where the actual death count start to rise to prepare the daily death counts we obtain raw death counts from two sources -john hopkins 7 and the covid19indiaorg 8 a volunteer-driven tracker project we then smooth this death count using a combination of savitzky-golay and gaussian convolution filters care needs to be taken to not distort the peak too much as with a large amount of smoothing the peak tends to decrease in height finally to fit the data we do a fine-grained brute force grid search 9 over the possible parameter values we provide and obtain a prediction with the lowest mean squared loss in general we fix  x  16e3 this implies a mortality rate of 08  sd  23 vary t 0 within a small margin near the beginning of the death count curve and vary r max from 14  28 and r min from 07  095 predicting the peak height and position are quite tricky because the beginning of the curve looks quite similar for different values of r further the peak can be quite sensitive to the values of r max and r min  r min is especially hard to estimate because it depends on the death count close to or after the peak after social distancing measures have been put into place we discuss these issues in greater detail in the following section let m be the random vector corresponding to the choices for variable parameters in the model then the density function f m constitutes a prior on the choice of these parameters as an approximation we assume uniform priors on the parameters this can in principle be extended to other priors this is reasonable because from our knowledge of other countries we can place bound r quite confidently whereas pinpointing a single value of r is very hard further we assume that the data y t  ht m  n 0  2  where h is the hypothesis sird model y t is the observed deaths on day t and y is the vector of observed deaths note that we can assert that we only include parameters in our confidence interval which have probability atleast where ly m is the average root mean squared loss between y m this means that 7 is equivalent to  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

simplifying this we get note that because of the uniform prior the rhs is independent of m further for a theoretical perfect fit  1 and pm  m  1 making the first term zero therefore we can interpret the second term 2 2 1  2 as the minimum loss or the loss of the best fit curve this gives us a metric for choosing admissible values of the parameter m where  is a constant we choose and m  are the best fit parameters since our brute-force algorithm gives us the average loss for each possible m we can select those m for which the loss satisfies the above inequality having obtained a set of values of m we obtain the corresponding curves for them and plot the minimum and maximum predictions for all these curves to obtain a confidence interval note that the acceptable range of ly m grows smaller as t max increases ie as we get more data this agrees with our intuition which says that as we get more data the confidence interval should become narrower for fixed t  in practice we start with a conservatively high value of  200 as we get more data we increase  if the actual values fall outside the confidence interval the initial value of  is chosen based on empirically fitting the model to different countries and observing that this value gives reasonably sized confidence intervals here we present results for three different regions whose death count peaks have passed all three -spain nyc italy were badly effected by coronavirus as india is likely to be we use these curves to validate the values we have chosen for the fixed parameters and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model more detailed plots can be found on the git repository table 2 contains the graph for our projections each row contains projections for one region across a row we vary the number data points we fit the model on and obtain projections for the remaining times and compare them to the actual death counts note that in each figure the area shaded red contains points the model has not been fitted

fitted on breakpoint denotes the number of data points from the beginning which are included in the train set for example a breakpoint of 60 implies that the first 60 datapoints are used for fitting and the rest are ignored it is worth noting that for nyc italy and spain our model predicts r min  1 indicating that social distancing measures have been effective in these places which is indeed the case also notice that as we expect with more data the uncertainty interval narrows and converges to the observed data we now include predictions for two critical regions in india -delhi and maharashtra both badly affected by the virus note that the uncertainty intervals for maharashtra in the beginning of the curve are very high this indicates that the model does not fit well to the initial part of the curve this might be a consequence of a the fact that maharashtra is a large state and different parts of the state are affected differently by the virus a model fit to mumbai would perform better b the timing of the drop in st does not track well the timing of prevention measures taken in the state on the other hand the model performs quite well on delhi this is likely because delhi is much more homogeneous in terms of demographics and is more well-connected this means that google mobility data is likely to reflect well how much people are social distancing note that the current projections in delhi assume that social distancing will continue at lock-down levels this is likely to not be the case as delhi has started re-opening nevertheless the government is still attempting to aggressively identify and quarantine so-called containment zones 6  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license

going to severely affect the elderly those with co-morbities and our frontline workers it is hoped that through these results we are able to emphasize the urgency with which the india needs to find an

dashboard which shows projections with uncertainty intervals in real-time for all districts in india further we can allow the user to transparently adjust r to understand how critical social distancing is to contain the spread  improving uncertainty estimation currently we choose  based on empirical conditions which is to say we run the model on many different countries and choose  for which a large majority of predictions fall within the confidence interval can we choose  in a more principled manner  collaboration with mohfw a big reason for undertaking this project was that we recognized the urgent need to come up with effective strategies to combat covid19 given that iit delhi is a well-respected institution we hoped that through the i4 students challenge we would be able to communicate this urgency to the government if we can collaborate with policy-makers at the ministry for health and welfare we believe this model can help many people in the days to come please feel

trenches diego de leo marco trabucchi   while we are writing this commentary from italy april 10th it appears that the number of people tested positive to the virus in the united states has almost quadrupled the number of people found positive in our country however italy counts a disproportionately high number of deaths china  the country where everything reportedly originated  has now smaller figures than those of the us italy spain and germany these countries together make more than one million people detected as infected worldometers 2020 not much can be said about the reliability of these figures or their comparability it is good to say that the numbers are based on subjects who tested positive to the swab unfortunately italy has lost the opportunity to keep reliable records of those subjects so it is not known what is the percentage of those who repeated the test several times but are represented as different individuals equally unknown because not standardized are the criteria for which the tests were performed if to patients with initial symptoms fever fever and coughing fever coughing and dyspnea what with full-blown clinical syndromes severe symptomatology to individuals potentially exposed by contiguity or direct contact living in the same environment does not necessarily imply proximity or contact etc in essence it is not known in which of these situations the swabs have been made in this way  we believe  a big opportunity to study contagion modalities has been lost each region of italy has run autonomous strategies to protect its citizens and counteract the disease this has applied also to test-related policies thus aggregating data from regions looks like a problematic though unreliable process we were expecting tests to be performed to all health personnel of common health settings from general medicine surgeries to protected residences including those for older adults to emergency departments and to general hospitals unfortunately this elementary strategy to guarantee that health professionals were sufficiently protected toward the virus was not applied with due care and up to date the number of doctors who died from the infection during their professional activity is unbearable 109 victims at the time of writing the number of other health workers who have lost their life is also tragically unbearable 28 it has been reported that the costs involved in performing the tests in appropriate numbers at least to all health professionals and people presenting with light symptoms are too heavy and the availability of skilled technicians and reagents for carrying out the tests is scarce in italy and probably elsewhere nothing is and will be like before the pandemic for the moment we must overcome the crisis but there could be a lot to say on a clinical level on that of the organization of services and on how to protect the life of our older adults the latter have been too affected by imprudent and superficial colleagues to feel accepted by the community again in a few days in deciding if the death was by coronavirus or with coronavirus we have undone decades of geriatric education but above all we have destroyed a fundamental relationship of trust how will we approach patients if they are now convinced that today we ask for their age to make critical decisions intubation and maybe tomorrow the administration of expensive drugs a discrepancy between the gift of a long life and public acceptance of older adults is increasingly noticeable and clearly expressed by the deprecated document on damages caused by longevity which christine lagarde now the president of the european central bank spoke about a few years ago 2012 old people live too long and this is a risk for the global economy we must do something urgently the scenario we are witnessing today is characterized by different situations in which people affected by covid-19 are forced to live the main ones are schematically summarized below even if there are significant differences related to the different organization of services in the regions a older adults who remain at home even when the first symptoms appear are entrusted in most cases to themselves and to the care of their loved ones family doctors are afraid they tend to block visits and families do not call emergency services because they fear seeing the family member get on the ambulance and not being able to greet himher before they die so they keep the sick  especially if a senior  in their homes assist them with fear and affection until the negative or positive resolution of the clinical picture there is no mention of swabs or blood chemistry analyses let alone ct or other scans our fellow citizens risk ending their lives without even being told what is happening to them many seniors live alone many have limited or no familiarity with the internet and are poorly connected with other family or community members newman and zainal 2020 some die in complete isolation and their corpses are discovered many days after death gazzettino 2020 b in the last couple of months the people who live in nursing homes have been completely forgotten by administrative powers frail older adults are certainly the subjects who have suffered the most from the difficulties of the italian health system in cities of lombardy such as bergamo and brescia the deaths have followed at an impressive rate giving rise to sad images in the televisions of the italians of long lines of military trucks carrying coffins to incinerators often very far from the place of origin of the deceased as reported elsewhere trabucchi and de leo in press in just 20 days in the nursing homes of the province of bergamo lombardy which have a total accommodation capacity of 6400 beds there were more than 600 deaths which is a hecatomb the real dimensions of the phenomenon will only be known after some time it is probable that the number of infected people is far greater than that officially reported it is also likely that the number of deaths is far greater than that officially attributed to covid-19 no attention was paid to those who manage the residences no support in terms of means of protection the possibility of making swabs or even economic support in the face of damage caused by the release of beds caused by the death of guests the access of new guests has been blocked but the residences are increasingly pressed to admit elderly people discharged from hospitals the staff is exhausted as a consequence of heroic commitment in small communities the warmth that stirs around the residences compensates for the solitude of guests and operators but this is not the case in large centers where the bigger turnover of personnel makes the atmosphere more impersonal in any case since doctors and other operators get sick in rapid progression  and despite the extreme commitment of those on duty  guests feel progressively more fearful and abandoned c in italy hospitals are at the center of the covid-19 cyclone the attention of the media and the whole nation is focused on them schematically the hospital system moves according to this model a the emergency department where patients arrive after days spent at home sometimes already exhausted by the disease it is rarely possible to send them back home in most cases they are kept under observation waiting for a bed b resuscitation units where patients are intubated and followed mainly by doctors specialized in anesthesia and resuscitation and c departments where patients are treated with oxygen therapy with different levels of intensity and checked for overall health conditions including psychological problems at this point in time all remaining wards for the management of the diseases that normally refer to hospitals are in progressive reduction to cope with the emergency resuscitation units were built in record time and entire hospitals were reconverted into the care of covid-19 unfortunately the pandemic has found the country largely unprepared and unable to provide the necessary protection in time even to its health workers resulting in serious shortcomings regarding the supply of eyeglasses masks gloves and gowns as said this has resulted in the loss of far too many health professionals lives the very serious difficulties in assisting critical situations combined with the scarcity of places suitable for the reception of patients in severe conditions and the lack of a sufficient number of ventilators have given rise to very painful ethical choices for health professionals on whom to privilege in the care with available equipment rosenbaum 2020 d from hospitals patients are discharged when they achieve clinical recovery they can return home or to low-intensity hotels where they can manage themselves in isolation the problem of older adults remains unsolved often after reaching clinical recovery they show such a degree of disability that returning home is not possible and it is difficult to resort to rehabilitation or long-term care facilities the described picture seems to apply to many northern territories of italy any criticism must be postponed however we seriously doubt that transferring people discharged from hospitals to rest homes may represent an appropriate choice and certainly we should find a way to respond to those families that cannot accompany their loved ones to intensive care units and are left without any information and prognostic indication this often means that the patients were kept too long at home without effective tools to catch the signs of aggravation in time which is frequently sudden and characterized by the discrepancy between symptoms and objectivity eg oxygen saturation or temperature the south of italy is generally less equipped than the north of the country and grave concerns rest on a possible dramatic evolution of the next few days over there social distancing and isolation remain at the moment the only strategies available to citizens however the latter need to feel supported by governments mental health should soon regain a very high status on the agenda of all nations especially if confinement at home expects to be very long and financial family and relationship problems risk to aggravate a future now seen with serious concerns and deep anxieties there are too many unanswered questions regarding the disease and even the duration and quality of immunity post-infection remain a big question mark while waiting for a vaccine to be ready several protocols and drugs are being proposed by clinicians none  at the moment  appears as particularly promising however we remain confident that a serious and open collaboration among researchers institutions and countries across the globe will offer concrete hope for our future for the time being the mental health of people needs to be supported in any possible way social distancing loneliness forced isolation and fear of contracting the illness are all big challenges for the general population facing the expansion of the epidemic but the risk of psychological consequences can be greater for the frail senior armitage and nellums 2020 we need to activate all possible opportunities to offer help at least in the form of tele-assistance to our patients krysinska and de leo 2007 psychological support should be made available to all via ngos and public services with contact with psychiatrists and other physicians actively established as much as possible health professionals should contact their patients and make the continuity of care a reality as soon as possible active outreach seems to be imperative especially for older adults de leo et al 2002 in order to counteract feelings of abandonment and disempowerment that covid-19 is imposing on all community members especially to the most fragile ones  dynamic tracking with model-based forecasting for the spread of the covid-19 pandemic ian cooper argha mondal chris antonopoulos g  in this paper a susceptible-infected-removed sir model has been used to track the evolution of the spread of the covid-19 virus in four countries of interest in particular the epidemic model that depends on some basic characteristics has been applied to model the time evolution of the disease in italy india south korea and iran the economic social and health consequences of the spread of the virus have been cataclysmic hence it is essential that available mathematical models can be developed and used for the comparison to be made between published data sets and model predictions the predictions estimated from the sir model here can be used in both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the spread it gives an insight into the spread of the virus that the published data alone cannot do by updating them and the model on a daily basis for example it is possible to detect the early onset of a spike in infections or the development of a second wave using our modeling approach we considered data from march to june 2020 when different communities are severely affected we demonstrate predictions depending on the models parameters related to the spread of covid-19 until september 2020 by comparing the published data and model results we conclude that in this way it may be possible to better reflect the success or failure of the adequate measures implemented by governments and individuals to mitigate and control the current pandemic  the covid-19 pandemic becomes most significant and devastating health threat in different countries around the globe 1 2 3 4 5  unfortunately the death rates have been increasing in an unprecedented way the disease has serious impact on the society and social consequences it has been shown that millions of people all over the world have been extremely affected due to the spread of the virus 6 7 8  the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 and named as covid-19 1  the novel strand of coronavirus was first identified in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 causing a severe and potentially fatal respiratory syndrome known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 9 10 11  after more than six months despite various steps to stop the spread of the virus by governments by june 2020 most countries have been affected and the total infections around the globe has exceeded nine million and the number of deaths is approaching half-million in the absence of a proper vaccine or medicine from the last couple of months self-quarantine social distancing frequent hand washing and wearing an antiviral face mask have emerged as the most widely-used strategies for the mitigation and control of the current pandemic 12 13 14 15 16  some countries have been more successful in controling it for an extended period than others thus it is imperative that mathematical models can be used to monitor the spread of the virus to give a scientific basis for the control measures implemented by governments and to assess their success 17 18 19 20  such models can be used to predict the number of infections and deaths in the near future to monitor any changes in the trends of the spread of the infection and provide estimates of time scales involved using mathematical models one can gain a better quantitative understanding of the spread and control of the virus as well as provide a theoretical framework to analyse the published data for the spread of the disease interestingly a second wave of infections can develop during a pandemic where the disease infects one group of people first then the infections appear to decrease but it is then followed by an increasing number of following-up infections by comparing published data with model predictions it is possible to detect this spike in infections early on and to judge the severity of the consequences if the upward trend in infections continues such insights can be drawn from the mathematical models that may be nearly impossible to discern from the data alone researchers have been working on the fast estimations of the outbreak dynamics its impact on people some possible required measures in the health system societies and so on a suitable model can be used for estimates using the up-to-date data sets of covid-19 cases in various communities recently there has been a number of published papers proposed to achieve the aim from modeling approaches using different parameters and various perspectives in different communities 10 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  among the epidemic models the most notable is the sir model 20 29 30 31 32  it is a popular model in disease modeling that is subdivided into three categories ie susceptible s infected i and removed r populations that interact in time t according to the kinetic method 10 20  this type of model may be appropriate to estimate the dynamics of the covid-19 outbreak and it is based on available published data sets for example in 34  with the sir model the data and model parameters can be updated on a daily basis to better estimate the progress of the virus spreading within a community an infected individual interacts with other system variables and transmits the disease with a certain rate if the other individual is susceptible an infected individual may recover or die at a certain rate the model dynamics can be described as a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations odes the dynamical behavior is completely determined by the rates of the three variables with particular initial conditions here we derive the conditions when an epidemic occurs and characterize its peak values for the data published in 34 for italy india south korea and iran the standard sir model assumes a homogeneous mixing of infected individuals and a constant total population with the susceptible population decreasing monotonically towards zero these assumptions may not be realistic though the standard sir model may not be applied successfully to study the evolution of the virus in countries such as india and iran for example that we study here where surges occur in time here we adopt a revised approach that allows for the inclusion of surges in the number of infected people the improved explanations of the sir model adopted here do not consider the total population or a homogenous mixing of infected individuals within a community rather as people become infected and move about more individuals are added to the susceptible population hence the susceptible population is considered as a variable that can be increased at various times to account for newly infected individuals spreading throughout a community 32 33  ie to surges the sir model in different forms have been used in some previous studies to investigate the spread of covid-19 10 20 21  here we show that our approach of the combination of the standard sir model and the inclusion of surges allows for the detection of the early onset of spikes in infections or the development of second waves we used covid-19 data sets 34 in the form of time-series from early to mid 2020 with various starting dates for italy india south korea and iran these data sets can be compared with the predictions of the sir model used here by doing so one can make more informed decisions about the trajectories of the virus in these countries there are also some limitation to consider the data sets published may not be complete also countries report their data using different ways of counting visual inspection of plots of the data sets against model predictions is the basis for choosing values of the input parameters in the model although this is very subjective it may be a better approach than using an automatic optimization program for calculating the input parameters the sir model has previously been applied to italy india south korea usa china australia and the us state of texas 33  here by manually adjusting the models input parameters the models predictions have been able to track the trajectory of the cumulative total number of infections the current active number of cases the number of recoveries and deaths reasonably well by visual inspections for all countries considered the countries selected for this study have very different trajectories for the evolution of the number of infections in italy the peak in the number of active cases occurred around 19 april 2020 and this number has steadily declined ever since 4 5 10 12  unfortunately important factors such as population density insufficient evidence of various symptoms and transmission mechanism make it difficult to deal with such a pandemic especially in a high population density country such as india 27 35  the virus is out of control in india and consequently the number of infections and deaths is now increasing at an alarming rate south korea is acknowledged as one of the countries that have been most successful in controlling the spread of the disease however in early june the number of infections has started to increase again by using the sir model we can estimate how serious this event may be in the beginning of may 2020 a second wave has developed in iran the first peak in active cases occurred in early april 2020 and the second peak with similar height has occurred in june 2020 using the sir model these events can be tracked and we can get a glimpse of what the future may hold especially at this time when many governments and people are thinking that the virus is over and want things to get back to normal the main goal of this paper is to compare the results between epidemiological modeling theory and actual data-driven results when fitting the model with data sets our approach and results provide a simple procedure to obtain the different dynamics relevant to control the spread of the disease in the studied countries as well as in any other country or community the paper is organized as following in sec 2 we introduce the sir model description with different populations and discuss its aspects in sec 3 we analyze the approach that we used to study the published data sets with our modeling approach and in sec 4 we show the results of our analysis for italy india south korea and iran finally in sec 5 we conclude our work and report the outcomes of the results and its relation with evidence already collected on the spread of covid-19 in these countries in this work we consider the standard sir model given by the system of three coupled non-linear odes 1 21 32 33 36  describing the evolution of the susceptible s infected i and removed r populations in time t it can be easily implemented to obtain a better understanding of how the covid-19 virus spreads over time within communities including the possibility of surges in the susceptible population thus the model is designed to remove many complexities in such a way that becomes useful both quantitatively and qualitatively to estimate different outcomes in particular it is represented by an autonomous continuous dynamical system that describes the time evolution of the following three populations 1 susceptible individuals st the particular individuals who are not infected however could become infected a susceptible individual may become infected or remain susceptible as the virus spreads from its origin or new sources occur more individuals will become infected thus the susceptible population will increase for a period of time surge period to other individuals who are susceptible an infected individual may remain infected and can be removed from the infected population to recover or die 3 removed individuals rt these are those individuals who have recovered from the virus and are assumed to be immune from being infected again ct or have died dt the time evolution of the three populations based on the above assumptions and concepts is governed by the following system of odes where a is the transmission rate constant and b the removal rate constant the sir disease transmission model is derived assuming several strong assumptions in particular it is assumed that the members of the susceptible and 1 can be solved using euler or the runge-kutta methods the evolution of the infected population is governed by the second ode in system 1 in the beginning of the spread of an epidemic where s  1 the number of infections increases exponentially i  i0 e ab t  then the rate of infection falls to zero at the peak where didt  0 when s drops below about 02 the infected population decreases exponentially as i  e b t  a set of solutions is shown in fig 1 for a particular choice of initial conditions and model parameters where one can see how the susceptible s infected i removed r and effective reproductive number r e  evolve in time next we discuss the importance of r e in the context of virus spread we can define an effective reproductive rate r e  where r e  asb this is important as the evolution of the disease depends upon the value of this rate when r e becomes less than one the infected population decreases monotonically to zero whereas when greater than one it increases crucially at r e  1 the rate of increase of the infected population is zero what corresponds to the peak number of active infected individuals thus there is a critical value for the susceptible population s c  ba the number of active cases only declines when s  s c  the reproductive rate r e and critical susceptibility s c act as a threshold value that determines whether an infectious disease will quickly die out or continue to grow as the existence of a threshold for infection is not obvious from the data it can be discerned from the properties of the sir model 1 what makes it a powerful tool in understanding and predicting the spread of an epidemic such the one due to covid-19 the rate of increase in the number of infections depends on the product of the number of infected and susceptible individuals an understanding of system 1 explains the staggering increase in the infection rate around the world and currently in india the spread of the virus can only be contained when the number of susceptible individuals decreases with time our analysis shows that one cannot get accurate predictions by applying the sir model to the data for the pandemic in india figure 2 identifies the problem in applying the sir model to the indian data starting on 14 march 2020 the model and predictions are only in agreement at the start of the pandemic the number of active infections in india does not reach a peak it keeps getting bigger and bigger however modifying the sir model by resetting the susceptible population at surge times it is possible to fit the model predictions to all the available data therefore applying the sir model to the indian data augmented by the introduction of surge times in the susceptible population one can make a quantitative analysis due to the spread of the virus in the country in most of the countries such as india there is not a homogenous mixing of the infected and susceptible individuals within the population only part of the total population will become susceptible to infected individuals when infected individuals persist and move about within a community further individuals may become susceptible to the disease the susceptible population will not necessarily decrease monotonically with time as susceptible individuals become infected these new infections act as a source for more individuals to become susceptible this gives rise to a positive feedback loop leading to a very rapid rise in the number of active infected cases in a surge period where the number of susceptible individuals increases instead of decreasing here the sir model 1 is considered in such a way so that at any time t s  the susceptible population can be reset to s s t s  accommodating for surges the system 1 is solved for the variables s i and r where s r and i  0 1 these populations are multiplied by a scaling factor f to give the number of individuals in each population group to match the model outputs with the published covid-19 data sets in 34  the solution gives only the values for the removed population r as a function of time t individuals removed from the infected population r have either recovered c or have died d where r  c  d the number of deaths d is estimated by fitting a function in the plot of the data for the number of actual deaths versus the data for the number of removals a non-linear function used to find the number of deaths d from the number of removals r is given by where d 0 and k 0 are constants that are suitably selected to give the best-fit between the function and the data with an example shown in fig 4 for data from italy the number of recoveries c is then simply c  r  d the model input parameters are the population scaling factor f  the initial infected population i0 the initial removed population r0 the rate constants a and b death constants d 0 and k 0  and the surge periods t s and s s  this set of constants is appropriately considered to best-fit the model predictions with the data sets 34 for each country in our study as new data become available a small amount of adjustment to the input parameters in model 1 can be made to get a better agreement between the model predictions and the data for each population the model cannot predict the time and height of the peak in the number of active infections however if the number of active infections keeps increasing the variable s can be increased which has the effect on increasing the peak value for active infections and delaying the time at which the peak value will occur the adjustments that are necessary in resetting the value of s are an important indicator of the success or failure of government actions in controlling the spread of the virus high values of resetting of s and a high reset frequency indicates that the spread of the virus is not contained in the community only when the susceptible population decreases towards zero the number of active infections also declines to zero although the peak for active infections has not been reached in india the model augmented by the introduction of surges as proposed here gives the estimates of the duration of the pandemic and minimum estimates for the total cumulative number of infections and deaths what allows for valuable forecasts data have been collected from 34 for italy india south korea and iran until the end of june 2020 the system of eqs 1 was solved by using the fourth order runge-kutta method the model predictions and data for each country are displayed graphically for a period of 200 days the crosses are for the data and the smooth lines for the model predictions from 1 the adjustable model input parameters are the population scaling factor f  the initial number of infections i0 the initial number of removals r0 the transmission rate constant a the removal rate constant b and the constants k 0 and d 0 to calculate the number of deaths from the number of removals r the results of our study are then shown in figs 2 to 13 the time evolution figures are the cumulative total number of infections i tot  the active cases i recoveries c deaths d and susceptible populations s not scaled the horizontal line gives the critical value s c and the dot gives the current value of s for the last day in the data the figures of the deaths d against removals r are used to find a function that best describes the relationship between d and r the figures of removals r against total infection i tot are useful for fitting the input parameters and may be useful as indicators of a change in trend or the peak in the number of active cases the plots of removals r against the number of active infections i are also useful for fitting the input parameters change in trend and identifying the peak in active infections the input parameters are adjusted by visual inspection to incorporate suitable values corresponding to the best fit of the model predictions to the published data as we have checked it may be possible to use an optimization program to fit the parameters however we found out that it will not necessarily improve the predictions in tracking the data due to the quality of the recorded data we start by analysing the data from italy and then move on to the studies of the data sets from india south korea and iran figures 3 and 4 show our modelling results for the data from italy the virus has left a trail of suffering throughout the country especially in the northern regions italy was the first country in europe to suffer severe effects of the virus 4 5 10 12 14  the numbers of infections and deaths increased very rapidly from mid-march until the end of april 2020 this led to hospitals being quickly overwhelmed and the government imposed a strict lockdown for two months the lockdown period was very successful with the peak infections of about 108 000 occurring around 20 april 2020 and the susceptible population falling below the critical value since the peak the number of active infections has consistently decreased as predicted by the model in all figures for italy our approach has been able to track the published data exceedingly well also the relationship between deaths and removals is very well described by eq 2 this initial sharp rise in deaths and then taping off in the number of deaths as the number of removals increases is a very common trend observed in other countries studied herein in early may 2020 people were allowed to move within their regions to visit family provided they wear face masks and some parks were reopened for exercise slowly restrictions are being lifted in the country manufacturers and construction firms have resumed work and shops are starting reopening there has been no need to apply any surges in the susceptible population and this is a strong indicator that so far the lifting of the restrictions has not faulted the downward spiral in the number of active infections the model predicts that by 13 september 2020 there will be about 35 000 deaths and about 240 000 individuals affected by the virus in the country the numbers of infections and deaths caused by the pandemic have been huge in italy however by the end of june the actions taken by the government have succeeded in controlling the spread of the virus and infections are seen to continuously decrease we can explain the reasons for the large number of infections and deaths in italy with insights gained from the sir model 2  there is strong evidence that in december 2019 people were already infected although the first reported case of an infected individual was not until 31 january 2020 the rate of change of the infections depends upon the number of infections and the number of susceptible individuals as given by system 1  during december and january 2020 the infected people many of them asymptomatic lead to an increase in the susceptible population so from a starting point with low number the number of infections ballooned very rapidly following initially an exponential increase the recorded number of active cases on 29 february 2002 was 1049 3 march 2020 was 2262 and 10578 on 11 march 2020 governments and their advisors around the world often stated no urgent actions are required now as the active case numbers are low but this is the time when actions need to be taken as the initial increase of the spread follows an exponential increase as seen in model 1 the italian government was not fully aware of the presence of the virus early in 2020 hence did not take the necessary control measures to control the spread of the pandemic for example compare the spread of the virus in italy and south korea the south korean government took immediate actions in january and february 2020 to control the virus and near the end of june there has been only 280 deaths and less than 13 000 total infections this is probably due to the fact that south korea has a transparent and open system of government that has managed the crisis with relatively few deaths and infections authorities took a proactive approach to testing contact tracing treatment and isolation expedited by its world-leading technological capabilities and public healthcare system figures 5 and 6 display the estimate of the data and the model predictions 1 for india clearly as the end of june approaches the spread of the virus throughout the country is not being contained and the peak number of active cases may be a long way into the future the infected population is still increasing and a peak in the active infections has not yet been attained as shown in fig 5  the model is designed so that the models predictions track the published data hence the model cannot predict the peak number of active cases in the future however by adding surges the peak can be delayed and increased although the selection of models input parameters and surge times are subjective the data can be tracked quite successfully and can give estimates of the populations in the future and possible time scale for the number of active cases to drop to low values that allows for valuable predictions india is caught in a vicious positive feedback loop like the usa new infections result in an increase in the susceptible population as the disease spreads then these individuals may become infected and the cycle continues this cycle is difficult to terminate resulting in the number of infections getting larger and larger one of the major methods in controlling the increase of infections is to test contact trace and quarantine however when there is such large numbers of infections as in india and the usa this method is not practical figure 6 shows that the peak in the number of active cases may not occur for some time the observation of the susceptible variable s shows that the susceptible population has to be repeatedly reset to higher values this is a strong indicator that the spread of the virus is not contained in india the plots for the removals against infection or total infections show that the data has not reached the knee section of the models prediction again providing evidence that the peak in the active infections may not occur any time soon it is most likely that in the near future there will be an alarming increase in the number of new infections and deaths in india the model predictions make it possible to consider many of the scenarios that may result south korea has a transparent and open system of government that has managed the crisis with relatively few deaths and infections authorities took a proactive approach to testing contact tracing treatment and isolation expedited by its world-leading technological capabilities and public healthcare system lives for many in south korea have more or less rolled on as usual it is mandatory to wear masks on public transport and most south koreans wear masks when going out south korea has tried to remain as open as possible by responding proportionally to the scientific assessments of the risks however there has been a spike in the number of infection in the early part of june 2020 the new clusters of infections may have been the result of clubs and bars re-opening south korean authorities have acted swiftly by isolating some areas testing and contact tracing and some schools have been forced to close just days after reopening the model 1 can estimate this spike in the number of active cases by including surge periods where the susceptible population is increased for the models predictions to track the data figures 7 and 8 show the graphical comparisons between the data and model predictions for south korea when surge periods are included whereas figs 9 and 10 show the predictions if no surges were applied table 1 summarizes some of these predictions according to model 1  if the current trend in infections continues then the impact of the spike in infections will not have any serious impacts however if these minor upward trends continue it could lead to a very different outcome one can identify a change of a trend for infections when there is a departure between the trajectories of the published data and model predictions examples of changes in trends are indicated by the ellipses which are added to the plots in figs 9 to 11 actually the disparity between the published data and model can be used as an early warning sign of a new outset of the virus in the community this break in downward trend in active cases is found when the model has been applied to china and australia in june 2020 as shown in fig 11  in particular it was reported on 11 june 2020 that there has been a cluster of infections arising in beijing it ended a run of 55 days without reported local transmission authorities have responded quickly with strong adequate measures another example is what happened in victoria in australia where there has been a relative small spike in the number of infections as restrictions have been progressively been removed some of these restrictions are now being reversed on 22 june 2020 one million people in melbourne have been asked not to travel outside their area and remain at home as a consequence of this spike  iran is one of the worst-hit countries in the middle east and started easing its lockdown in april 2020 after a drop in the number of deaths now the fears that iran is in the grip of a second wave of coronavirus have been realized figure 12 shows that a second wave of infections started in early-may 2020 and by the end of june 2020 the peak in the number of active cases equals the height of the initial peak in april the second increase seems to be part of a second surge as there is a small decrease following the second peak after 24 june 2020 in contrast there is no second wave surge for india see subsec 42 and the usa 33 as the first peak number of active cases in these countries has not yet occurred government authorities in iran have been reluctant to acknowledge that they may have lifted restrictions prematurely and in june 2020 many more restrictions have been lifted such as the opening of mosques shops and offices figures 12 and 13 highlight the dangers ahead for iran it is uncertain how large the second peak in active cases will be and the trend shown in fig 13  the plot of deaths against removals shows an accelerating number of deaths given by the data whereas the current model shows a tapering off in the number of deaths there is a high probability that the number of deaths will far exceed 10 000 it has been reported in the public media that the sc is the critical value for the susceptible population s the surges applied in may and june 2020 are such that s  s c  while s  s c  the number of active cases will continue to increase as of 24 june 2020 s  s c and the number of active infections has started to decline again actual number of deaths may exceed the reported deaths by a factor ranging from 5 to 10 the number of infections and deaths will continue to increase unless governments and individuals take actions to prevent people becoming susceptible to track the data a number of surges in the susceptible population s is necessary the resetting of variable s is very subjective however the numbers used are not as important as the fact that the susceptible population is increasing and when this occurs the spread of the virus is out of control and the number of infections will continually increase how the virus spreads in a community is a complex issue affected by many factors in this paper the proposed approach is designed to remove many of these complexities and yet to be useful in both quantitative and qualitative ways this is accomplished by including surge periods where the susceptible population can be reset to larger numbers allowing for the tracking of the published data sets where new clusters of infections occur in the community the frequency at which surge periods are needed to be applied and their magnitudes are good indicators that the spread of the virus is not under control in the community although the sir model cannot predict the severity and time of the peak in the active infections the peak in the number of active infections and the number of deaths it does give minimum estimates for the duration of the virus the total cumulative number of infections the peak in the number of active infections and the number of deaths the model and approach used here may be a useful tool in detecting the early onset of further waves of infections allowing for governments and authorities to take appropriate measures to contain them the virus has severely impacted all aspects of our lives around the world for more than six months now 12 19  typically the half-life for the decrease in active cases is around 18 days for india if the peak in active cases occurred at the end of june and there were no further surges then it would take five months for the number of active cases to drop to less than 500 even after a peak there is a strong probability that there will be periods when the number of infections spike again as in iran and south korea therefore it is imperative that governments and individuals do not assume that the virus is going away and maintain or even increase measures that have been confirmed to prevent individuals becoming susceptible to the disease only as the susceptible population converges to zero the number of active cases goes to zero as well if completely reliable data are available the model provides an effective tool to track the spread of the virus and provide insights into the management of the control measures implemented by governments within a community in this paper the sir model has been applied to data from italy india south korea and iran a strength of the modifications in the sir model lies in the fact that as new data are added daily the model parameters are easy to adjust and provide the best-fit curves between the data and the model predictions by comparing the data with the model predictions it is possible to reach conclusions based upon science about the effectiveness of control and adequate measures implemented by governments and people within a community finally for the virus to be controlled and to limit its impact on society various governments have imposed drastic actions to prevent people to become susceptible to the disease some actions that are proving to be successful include total lockdowns testing contact tracing of people who may have been in contact with an infected individual and then isolating them isolating suspected individuals restrictions on the movement of people restrictions on large gatherings hygiene measures such as washing hands and wearing face masks particularly on public transport or in crowded indoor spaces by using the predictions of mathematical model and comparing it with published data one is more able to assess actions that have been taken to control the spread of the virus now such advanced policies and strategies are needed to overcome the situation researchers from various disciplines have been working to deal with this pandemic by providing novel approaches optimal policies mathematical methods for predictions biological phenomena and chemical drugs to mitigate the effects 12 37 38 39 40   tackling the global challenge humanitarian catastrophes kenneth iserson v   acute crises cause unstable or dangerous conditions suddenly and for the most part unexpectedly which demand timely intervention to alleviate the situation1 these include cataclysmic natural events and potential pandemics as well as human-caused horrors such as wars and genocide typically when we imagine a humanitarian catastrophe our minds first picture the devastation that natural disasters produce thousands of people die and millions of lives are devastated annually as the result of hurricanes typhoons tsunamis wildfires tornados earthquakes floods volcanic eruptions landslidesavalanches heat waves and blizzards after natural disasters personal emotion and media coverage play a large role in whether and how much assistance is provided as social beings the suddenness of natural disasters triggers profound feelings of empathy which may prompt impulsive actions such as monetary donations our response to natural disasters strongly relates to how extensive and for how long the media cover the story the media play to peoples skewed risk perception reacting more to death clusters in sudden catastrophes than to scattered deaths from more routine causes such as occur with cancer attributable to cigarette smoking equivalent to three 747 jumbo jet crashes daily2 or traffic deaths equivalent to a daily 100-passenger regional jet crash34 eventually even after the most devastating natural disasters media and donor fatigue set in and the response dwindles as occurred after the 2010 earthquake in haiti an epidemic exists when there are more cases of disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time5 an infectious disease becomes pandemic when it affects large numbers of people across a very wide area such as on multiple continents6 endemic diseases with a stable prevalence are not pandemics pandemics may stem from natural causes or from the accidental or intentional release of biological warfare agents78 human immunodeficiency virus hivaquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids is the only current pandemic however unless they are recognized and stopped early future pandemics will inevitably result from novel influenza strains as they have over the past centuries they may also stem from viral hemorrhagic fevers eg ebola lassa hanta bas-congo hemorrhagic fever antibiotic-resistant bacteria eg methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa enterococcus extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis other viral diseases eg severe acute respiratory syndrome 2012 sars-like coronavirus prion diseases eg creutzfeldt-jakob disease or diseases caused by as-yet-unrecognized agents self-preservation motivates interventions to prevent pandemics these diseases pose the risk of worldwide devastation affecting all populations regardless of their geography economic status or ethnicity this awareness has resulted in greater international cooperation than any other disaster mitigation effort despite occasional failures as when countries hide evidence of potentially pandemic diseases the international community has repeatedly seen the benefits of such cooperation war is an organized intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities a form of political violence war is intended as prussian military general and theoretician carl von clausewitz wrote to compel our enemy to do our will910 this form of politically motivated violence has occurred in every societys history its characteristics include extreme aggression social disruption and usually high mortality11 genocide often closely linked to war is an attempt to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group 12 genocidal acts include killing members of the group and causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group 12 they also include deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about a groups physical destruction in whole or in part imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group12 decisions to use military interventions or threats to intervene to stop or prevent wars or genocide would seem to depend primarily on treaty obligations as with natural disasters however intervention may also depend on the slant and intensity with which media cover the violence and a potential intervening nations emotional investment and perceived ethnic ties to those involved more pragmatically the chance of intervention occurring also may depend on national and international political gamesmanship the economic hardship due to supplying troops and whether appropriate types and numbers of troops are available chronic or cyclical disasters occur over decades and generations with little change for large portions of the worlds populations these conditions produce water and food insecurity debilitating and life-threatening endemic diseases and the subset of neglected tropical diseases and displacement from countries or homes making them refugees or internally displaced persons idps we intervene in all these situations for similar reasons a water crisis occurs when the available potable unpolluted water within a region is less than needed about 56 billion people 2011 or 80 of the worlds population live in areas with threats to water security13 there is still inadequate access to safe drinking water for about 884 million people and for sanitation and waste disposal for 25 billion peoplemostly in poor and conflict prone countries 1415 diarrhea due to contaminated water is the biggest killer of children in sub-saharan africakilling more than aids tuberculosis tb and malaria combined16 food insecurity means that over time people have insufficient quantities of food on a consistent basis food availability and insufficient resources to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious diet food access and use their food optimally with adequate water and sanitation food use1718 undernourished or chronic hunger means food intake that is insufficient to meet dietary energy requirements continuously19 the united nations food and agriculture organization fao estimates that 33 of 193 countries have critically inadequate food supplies worldwide at the beginning of 2009 around 963 million people were undernourished or chronically hungry due to extreme poverty while up to 2 billion people lacked food security intermittently due to varying degrees of poverty most undernourished people live in developing countries about 65 live in india china democratic republic of congo bangladesh indonesia pakistan or ethiopia the highest proportion of undernourished people is in sub-saharan africa where 1 in 3 people are considered chronically hungry20 endemic infectious diseases are those that remain prevalent in a particular locality region or population without the need for external inputs the best-known examples are tb and malaria both of which run rampant in the most-impoverished countries both diseases now receive worldwide attention with extremely drug-resistant tb potentially becoming pandemic the world community has for the most part ignored many lesser known neglected tropical diseases ntds because climate vectors and reservoir hosts restrict them primarily to tropical regions21 even though ntds cause millions of years worth of disability table 1 the world has largely ignored the world health organization who-recommended strategic interventions that could control prevent and even eliminate various ntds these measures include preventive chemotherapy intensified case management vector control provision of safe water sanitation and hygiene and veterinary public health 21 a refugee is a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country22 a 1967 united nations un protocol expanded this definition to include persons who have fled war or other violence in their home country 23 displaced persons generally refers to refugees who have left their home countries because of war rather than a fear of persecution or have been forced to migrate within their home countries internally displaced persons idps the convention governing the specific aspects of refugee problems in africa also includes people who have left their countries of origin due to acts of external aggression occupation domination by foreign powers or serious disturbances of public order24 interventions in chronic crises are both altruistic and highly political and they generally focus on the uns 8 millennium development goals mdgs25 all 193 un-member states and more than 23 international organizations have agreed to work toward achieving the mdgs by 2015 these goals are those mdgs directly related to what have been categorized as chronic humanitarian crises include 1 food insecurity 6 endemic diseasesas well as to hivaids the one current acute pandemic disease and 7 which includes water insecurity the mdgs originated with the organisation sic for economic co-operation and development oecd a group of the most-developed democratic countries devoted to a free-market economy primarily tasked with stimulating economic progress and world trade the oecd formulated a strategic development framework for the entire world based on resolutions of international conferences and summit meetings further refining the resolutions at international meetings the un general assembly approved most of their recommendations as mdgs in 200026 while world pressure and an obligation to fulfill international promises have played a role in trying to meet the mdg objectives the major impetus has been the availability of a large amount of money generally non-governmental organizations ngos are the boots on the ground that can make progress toward meeting the mdg objectives and most ngos follow the money the un for example now provides funds through its various arms to advance these goals as do individual governments not only has specific aid been supplied by various countries but affected countries have also been able to make more internal funding available with backing from the g8 finance ministers in 2005 most of the worlds major financial giants eg world bank international monetary fund and african development bank cancelled up to 55 billion in debt owed by heavily indebted countries so that they could put the money into programs aligned with the mdgs crisis intervention should have the same goals in acute and chronic situations although they will often differ in their speed scope and techniques responders whether they be from ngos or governments ideally assist local governments and agencies by providing short- and long-term planning for and an initial supply of water sanitation food and nutrition agriculture shelter healthcare government infrastructure economy and safetysecurity while accomplishing this mission responding agencies have a duty to ensure both quality maintaining a minimum standard of service and accountability being answerable to those who receive the assistance and those who finance it soliciting funds constitutes an inevitable part of ngos response to both acute and chronic humanitarian catastrophes these organizations often raise funds using pictures of starving babies and bloated corpses coupled with wildly overblown statistics as charny wrote repeated use of these images has dulled the public to real suffering while encouraging the public to view people as unable to solve their own problems27 the public now recognizes these appeals as sordid hype that results in donor fatigue if not disgust unfortunately it then becomes easier to ignore reports that accurately depict dire situations in subsequent disasters while ethical guidelines exist for fundraising even the most reputable organizations still use these unsavory methods and few regulatory agencies spend much time policing the plethora of fraudulent disaster-related fundraising2829 many items provided to affected areas from both the private and public sectors are often inappropriate for the circumstances such items include outdated or unneeded medications used clothing that local people will not wear and unsuitable tools or shelters although they may have the best motivations many relief workers lack even the most rudimentary knowledge about the country in which they are working including the basic language cultural political and technical skills required in that situation in addition they often have no logistical support and thus must consume resources that the local population desperately needs30 according to whos global outbreak alert and response network goarn today there is growing recognition that an outbreak anywhere can potentially represent an emergency of international public health concern31 response to these threats is coordinated through goarn and the us centers for disease control and preventions global disease detection and emergency response gdder goarn combats the international spread of infectious outbreaks and helps build capacity to prepare for epidemics from known and emerging diseases through a collaboration of existing international institutions and networks32 gdder uses non-traditional surveillance methods to provide early warning about international disease threats and provides experts for a rapid worldwide response33 legally termed humanitarian interventions military force may include a variety of actions often designated with these murky and overlapping terms peacemaking support mediation and military actions to achieve a cease-fire peacekeeping maintain implement and monitor agreements to prevent further hostilities and peace-building help with final implementation of agreements and rebuilding the society the lack of clarity in defining these roles may make all sides in the conflict mistrust these multinational forces in addition these roles may be compromised since military culture assumes a certain independence and superiority of mission over that of longer established disaster managementhumanitarian assistance efforts that may cause displacement marginalization and increased tensions with local partners 34 the underlying ethos of disasterhumanitarian relief activities is to do well rather than simply to do good in other words because these situations are so complex and often involve so many organizations with different resources expertise and agendas beneficial motivations are insufficient instead the aim is to achieve constructive long-lasting solutions ideally there would be ethical and legal standards to guide various aspects of our response to humanitarian catastrophes including when and why we should intervene and how to act when we do unfortunately few unambiguous standards exist the most problematic area concerns the criteria for when and why we intervene whether it is a civilian or military or an acute or chronic disaster disaster interventions optimally protect people and safeguard livestock shelter and other essential property thus the ideal criteria for intervention are needs driven interventions should occur when an infusion of resources will prevent human suffering or at least help suffering populations regain stability yet experience shows that media coverage political expediency and non-governmental humanitarian agencies ngha pre-set agendas and available resources actually guide our interventions how we act once we decide to respond has more easily identifiable guidelines although these too can be vague research on all aspects of human catastrophes has languished especially that dealing with the optimal criteria for and efficacy of different types of disaster response in part this has been due to inadequate resources however it also stems from researchers queasiness about intruding in the midst of crisisand from the responders negative reactions to their efforts however the lack of evidence-based criteria for many disaster interventions raises ethical concerns about when why and how we should respond to humanitarian catastrophes ethical issues also pervade any disaster-related research project current thought which is based on us national institute of mental health guidelines is that such research must undergo the same rigorous ethical tests that guide all other research this includes the assumption that those affected by a disaster retain the capacity to provide informed consent although capacity assessment may need to be part of the protocol they also imply that while disaster-affected populations and responders if they are being studied are not vulnerable researchers should still assess a studys risk-benefit and its effect on the subjects as in other research investigators should maintain confidentiality and privacy subjects should receive study results and redundant research should be minimized39 refugee law determines which groups are eligible for special assistance through the un or other governmental bodies related to but distinct from international human rights law refugee law comprises both the un convention and more limited instruments from various regional bodies human rights law derives from a series of advisory non-binding declarations and binding conventions most frequently cited is the so-called international bill of human rights which includes the uns universal declaration of human rights 1948 and two conventions treaties passed by the general assembly in 1966 the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights both went into force when sufficient members signed and ratified it in 1976 numerous advisory declarations from the un and other international bodies as well as global and regional conventions treaties make up the balance of international human rights law the nature of and actions taken during governmentalsupragovernmental un nato etc interventions follow international humanitarian law or the law of armed conflict table 4 rules and principles that seek to save lives and alleviate suffering during armed conflict 41 these include the law of the hague once referred to as the law of war proper the geneva conventions and subsequent treaties and protocols 1864 to 200542 although not all were initially legally binding they have in many cases evolved into enforceable customary international law when considering how effective our responses and their results are to humanitarian crises we can best judge them through our success in achieving the relevant mdgs or the general results of our interventions in most acute crises most of the mdgs 21 targets and 60 official indicators have a deadline of 2015 with 1990 as the baseline year25 subsequent sections will review the progress toward the mdgs related to food and water insecurity and to preventing and treating debilitating endemic and pandemic infectious diseases the numbers in parenthesis are the official designators for that mdg target the data are official government-supplied statistics supplemented by information from international agencies 43 after large natural disasters civilian and governmental relief agencies generally provide excellent and rapid immediate relief the many natural disasters each year bear that out yet in cases where recurrence is likely these agencies have had little effect on mitigating similar future devastation or damage or destruction through long-term planning global pandemics have largely been prevented or other than hiv quickly contained when international cooperation has been functional chinas denial of sars allowed it to spread wider than it might have otherwise44 who and the cdc have not only provided experts to help identify and contain potential outbreaks but also trained and equipped many laboratories and clinicians around the world to assist in these efforts fewer people have becoming infected with hiv in recent years with 27 million people being newly diagnosed in 2010 21 lower than the 1997 peak45 yet the international community did not meet the target of universal coverage of the 137 million infected individuals46 access to treatment did increase in all regions so that at the end of 2010 65 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy for hiv or aids in developing regions eastern asia had the largest gain in coverage 38 while sub-saharan africa where more than 50 of eligible people do not receive antiretroviral therapy had a 20 increase 47 the efforts to prevent or stop genocide have not been successful this requires humanitarian military interventions and the legal basis for these interventions remains sufficiently nebulous so that long delays and many deaths commonly occur before supragovernmental bodies take any action as a result the 1994 rwanda genocide left 800000 tutsis dead the serbian genocide in srebrenica resulted in about 8000 bosniak deaths and genocide is ongoing in darfur sudan the international community has had even less success in preventing armed conflicts while overt global warfare has not occurred since world war ii a nearly constant succession of at least 44 civil and regional wars have resulted in approximately 6 million deaths the most easily measurable statistic and have caused large-scale disabilities social disruption economic hardship population dislocation and long-term emotional damage current conflicts that cause at least 1000 deathsyear are taking place in columbia afghanistan somaliasomaliland pakistan mexico south sudansudan syria and iraq48 other than iraq sub-saharan africa countries account for all those with more than 20 battle deaths100000 population annually49 most chronic humanitarian crises can be assessed using the relevant mdgs another assessment factor not included in the mdgs is the number of refugees and idps refugees and idps have been increasing in number despite a recent increase in repatriation at the end of 2011 about 425 million people worldwide were refugees due to conflict or persecution developing countries that can ill afford it host 4 out of 5 of these refugees in december 2011 the largest refugee populations under the uns care were from afghanistan 27 million and iraq 14 million about 264 million people are idps and remain within their countrys borders 50 the world seems to have met this target the proportion of people using an improved water source rose from 76 in 1990 to 89 in 2010 with more than 2 billion people gaining access to improved drinking water sources such as piped supplies and protected wells however not only do rural areas disproportionately lack improved water sources 19 compared to urban areas 4 but also all figures may be overestimates since they do not reflect the reliability and sustainability of a safe water source46 more troubling the un estimates that by 2025 18 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity51 falling short of the target recent estimates show that about 850 million people 155 of the worlds population live in hunger even though incomes have increased 46 six million children die of hunger every year17000 every day52 a key marker for hunger is the prevalence of underweight children less than 5 years old slow progress although insufficient to reach the global target by 2015 has nevertheless resulted in a decline in underweight children less than 5 years old in the developing world from 29 in 1990 to 18 in 201053 yet progress has been spotty with nearly one-third of children in southern asia being underweight in 2010 46 the prevalence of child stunting a key marker for hunger undernourishment defined as low height for age fell from an estimated 44 in 1990 to 29 in 2010 which still leaves millions of children at risk for diminished cognitive and physical development resulting from long-term under-nutrition53 reported malaria cases fell by 17 since 2000 and by more than 50 between 2000 and 2010 in 43 of the 99 countries with endemic malaria 46 yet the momentum in addressing this devastating disease is slowing largely due to inadequate resources and increasing plasmodium resistance even at its 2011 peak of 19 billion international funding was well short of the 5 to 6 billion required for universal access to malaria prevention and control measures simultaneously p falciparum resistance to the main treatment component artemisinins is increasing and anopheles mosquitoes have increasing resistance to the pyrethroids used to treat clothing and insecticide-treated mosquito nets itns possibly more important in preventing insect-borne diseases other than malaria itns were used by 39 of children in sub-saharan africa in 2010 compared to 2 in 200054 however there is no data on another mdg indicator the proportion of febrile children less than 5-years old who were treated with appropriate antimalarial drugs according to the uns 2012 millennium development goals report the world is on track to achieve the target of halting and is beginning to reverse the spread of tuberculosis while the estimated 2015 global mortality from tuberculosis will have decreased 50 from that in 1990 more than one third of new cases still go unreported and are not treated in a who-recommended directly observed therapy short-course dots program 46 of most concern to global health personnel 84 of the estimated 290000 cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis are not being diagnosed or treated appropriately 55 little data exist on the other diseases addressed in the mdgs however progress is being made to prevent many of them one of the greatest successes has been with trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness an epidemic in africa that mobile teams arrested by systematically screening millions of at-risk people56 another mdg indicator 43 is to immunize 1-year-old children against measles since that frequently lethal disease causes epidemics in many poor populations according to the report through increased routine immunization coverage and large-scale immunization campaigns sub-saharan africa has made the most progress with an 85 per cent drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2010   yet recent complacency and declines in political and financial commitments to measles control have resulted in large measles outbreaks globally57 although they are mdg indicators the un has failed to report any progress either in providing access to affordable essential drugs in developing countries or in increasing the proportion of people with access to affordable essential drugs on a sustainable basis58 the data documenting the worlds response to humanitarian disasters suggest that we can do better specifically improvements should include  experiences and psychosocial impact of west africa ebola deployment on us health care volunteers robyn gershon liza dernehl a ezinne nwankwo qi zhi kristine qureshi   infectious

3 many if not most of these bioevents have been caused by emerging pathogens which are described as newly appearing or reappearing in the population or rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range4

5 in the past few decades alone more than 85 emerging pathogens have been identified including hiv multidrug resistant tuberculosis mdr-tb west nile virus hanta virus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars h1ni influenza middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers chikungunya virus and most recently ebola and zika viruses3

8 the risk factors for the increasing incidence of bioevents worldwide include human population growth inadequate health care and public health infrastructure increased globalization land-use that facilitates zoonotic transmission climate change declining vaccination rates and overuse of antibiotics9
 potentially lethal bioevents present significant risk of morbidity and mortality to exposed populations and to health care workers who may come into direct contact with infected patients or their specimens the risk of exposure and infection is especially of concern in the early stages of outbreaks as information regarding transmissibility may be limited while at the same time effective vaccines or other pharmaceuticals may not yet be available when bioevents occur in countries with limited health care resources the international community is generally highly responsive in providing much needed support to these hot zones this type of assistance was especially important during the 2014-2015 west africa ebola epidemic within a week of the initial case report in april 2014 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc sent an expert team to guinea within the following months over 2000 other cdc employees deployed in response to outbreaks in guinea liberia and sierra leone with many more working on the public health response from the cdc headquarters in atlanta georgia10 other governmental agencies eg united states agency for international development from the united states us and many other countries and more than 65 non-governmental agencies most prominently mdecins sans frontires msf doctors without borders and partners in health also sent health care volunteers on medical missions to west africa to respond to the epidemic and to provide care to patients with ebola virus disease evd11 it is estimated that ultimately thousands of health care workers from throughout the world voluntarily deployed to the west africa ebola epidemic even though the health care response was substantial there was some concern within the international public health community that a more rapid and robust response was warranted12 local west african health care systems were quickly overwhelmed and the result was deadly as of may 2016 over 11000 deaths were reported among the estimated 28000 suspected probable or confirmed cases of ebola average case fatality rate 3913 according to a 2015 world health organization who report infected health care providers had an even greater risk of mortality during the epidemic over 50 418814 of ebola infected health care workers died with the highest case fatality rates 68 observed among nurses 19328514 the impact on the health care workforce in affected countries was sizeable according to a lancet report published in july 2015 guinea lost 145 of their healthcare workforce while liberia and sierra leone lost 807 and 685 respectively15 it is important to note that in some of the areas severely affected by the ebola epidemic health care access was already severely limited with roughly only one or two doctors per 100000 people16
 the us health care response to the ebola epidemic exemplifies the countrys long tradition of humanitarian health care volunteerism although there is no mechanism currently in place to track this an estimated 200000 health care personnel from the us are believed to volunteer each year to underserved or disaster-affected areas around the world17 many volunteer through the more than 1000 non-governmental sponsor organizations which may be faith-based university-based or sponsored by educational or corporate entities these organizations recruit through their internet presence word-of-mouth or through targeted advertising a recent survey of 177 voluntary health care organizations found that more than half accepted 75 or more of all health care applicants into their volunteer programs17 the same survey also found a wide range of preparation provided to volunteers ranging from simply providing an orientation packet of materials to extensive in-person training for ebola deployments the cdc developed an intensive experiential training course for us health care workers deploying to west africa over 600 us workers eventually received this training18 similar courses were developed by msf and who19

20 even with this extensive training in place some experts including leadership at numerous us academic medical centers urged caution to staff and fellows considering voluntary deployment this was due to concerns regarding the effectiveness and implementation of safety precautions the high fatality rate and the lack of effective treatments at that time21
 in general most us humanitarian health volunteers report very positive deployment experiences anecdotally some us volunteers to the west africa ebola epidemic similarly had positive experiences and reported feeling privileged and grateful for having had the opportunity to serve22

23

24

25 however research on the experiences and especially the emotional impact of deployment to the ebola epidemic among us health care professionals is very limited adverse psychosocial impact of deployment on disaster volunteers has been well documented even among highly trained and well prepared volunteers26

27 this study was designed to improve our understanding of the impact of health care deployment to high risk outbreaks strategies suggested here for reducing risk of adverse effects in volunteers may be applicable to other deployments to international hot zone disasters 
study design
 semi-structured interviews were conducted with us health care workers who had recently returned from voluntary deployment to the west africa ebv outbreak data were analyzed using qualitative techniques 
study participants
 potential participants were identified using a snowball sampling strategy and contacted via email in this initial contact the purpose of the study was explained as well as the study methods the human subjects protections in place and the eligibility criteria for participation which included recent deployment to west africa ebola epidemic liberia sierra leone andor guinea and current employment as a health care worker in the us this study had prior approval from the office of the committee on human research at ucsf study  15-15914 participant characteristics are shown in table 1 

 
data collection
 drawing upon available information on humanitarian health care a semi-structured interview guide was developed sixteen interviews lasted an average of 45 minutes in length and were conducted from may to july 2015 via phone skype or in-person all interviews were audiotaped with prior knowledge and approval of the interviewee participants were informed that the tapes would be destroyed upon completion of the study each participant was assigned a unique code number and no personal identifiers of any kind were noted in the tapes or transcriptions all study materials were stored in password-protected files on an encrypted computer only available to the research team all study materials are available by contacting the corresponding author

 qualitative thematic analysis was used as the analytic framework for identifying themes relevant to the experiences of the participants before pre during peri and after post their deployment two research team members reviewed the first three transcripts to develop a list of codes and a coding manual that defined the common terminology to describe the themes identified the remaining transcripts were then inductively open-coded by two independent reviewers followed by thematic analysis using the constant comparison methodology28 to help ensure that the coding was both valid ie well grounded in the data and supportable and reliable consistent in meaning the criteria for assigning a specific code to a block of text was well documented the coding scheme and codebook was refined and expanded upon to reflect and incorporate emerging insights throughout the coding process discrepancies in coding were discussed and mutually resolved 
pre-deployment
 
motivation to volunteer
 the most frequently cited motivation for volunteering was the belief that the participants skills were needed and therefore there was a perceived ethical obligation to volunteer as noted by one participant for me it was just the right thing to do i felt like i had something that i could do to help and i wanted to do it several participants noted a commitment to social justice and health equity and were thus drawn to serve people in need experiences with other humanitarian health crises usually in the aftermath of disasters such as the 2010 haiti earthquake or past experience on medical missions in other parts of africa were also motivators one participant stated having worked there previously having had very close west african doctor friends die you cant just stand there and bear witness 
fear for self and fear and concern of family and friends
 even though participants were highly motivated to volunteer early unfolding reports29

30 led many participants to question their decision to volunteer instead of backing out several said that they just resigned themselves to going even though they had a sense of foreboding and fatalism about the deployment the week that i was going to go the cdc said 14 million people could be infected i saw that and thought im not coming out of this family members especially parents did not want them to go this led some participants to avoid telling anyone about their decision in some cases secrecy was extreme as recounted by one participant i didnt tell my parents until i was in the airport leaving another participant similarly did not want to tell people about her upcoming deployment i didnt really talk to anyone about it when i left i had a very morbid feeling you know i was so scaredi dont know it felt too morbid and that it would be like  oh we better say goodbye in case she doesnt come back instead of reassurances from family and friends negative reactions like these were common as one participant recalled there was so much hysteriapeople thought i was going to die so it felt like you were jumping off a cliff 
training
 the length and quality of training varied in the very early stages of the epidemic participants already working in other parts of africa reported that they received their training in other non-affected countries typically provided by their sponsoring agencies others received training at cdc with additional hands-on training at the deployment site some participants especially those who had deployed early in the epidemic felt that they had not received adequate training and thus felt unprepared as reported by one participant they the sponsoring agency handed me a viral hemorrhagic fever guide i read it on the plane showed up but i had no real idea of what i was doing as the outbreak progressed cdc began offering extensive training at a facility in anniston alabama and all of the subjects who took this training spoke very highly of it especially with respect to their confidence in using the required personal protective equipment ppe training on the complex process of donning and doffing ppe was universally regarded as critical in keeping them safe as was the simulated practice of working while wearing the ppe several study participants thought that their training did not address their perceived lack of cultural competency as reported by one participant theres a lot beyond the training on infection control practices that i felt completely unprepared for there could have definitely been a lot more preparation on a cultural levelin terms of cultural norms and acceptances language and perceptions of westerners that would have been extremely helpful 
peri-deployment
 
first impressions
 by any measure and at multiple levels the early humanitarian response to the ebola epidemic was extraordinarily challenging health care facilities and systems already severely under- resourced in the affected areas were strained to the limit us health care workers even those with prior humanitarian deployments were shocked by the local conditions one participant who deployed very early in the epidemic august 2014 described his first impression of the ebola treatment unit etu where he was assigned as a real horror show living conditions were unexpectedly austere even for those who had previously volunteered in other resource-limited countries most participants said they had been provided with a bed and a mosquito net but that running water potable water electricity working toilets and showers were scarce making it difficult to maintain personal hygiene 
lack of organization and role clarity
 lack of organizational management of the medical mission was reported some noted that the people in charge were making poor decisions especially regarding scheduling and assignments these problems were compounded by a lack of communication clear policies and procedures were lacking as one participant noted it seemed like policies were being formed by whoever was in charge the person in charge changed every three hours because of severe staff shortages participants had to perform new types of tasks one physician noted i hadnt put in an iv in probably 10 years i had to mix all of the drugs myself that is not typically part of my daily workload that was certainly stressful others reported feeling underutilized one nurse stated i felt like i wasnt a very effectively used resource in the sense that i spent like 2 weeks of my time there doing kind of menial tasks because they didnt have another role for us to play 
lack of resources
 before international teams arrived to help set up functioning etus the delivery of care was extremely constrained not only by a lack of staff but also by a lack of basic resources medical supplies and equipment infrastructure facilities lacking beds running water sanitation electricity etc and systems management protocols for care delivery as one participant noted it was an absolutely resource limited setting in some etus patients were not housed based on their health status but by the availability of beds or in some cases cots or mattresses on the floor family members were placed in the same room regardless of their health status as recalled one participant seeing the horror of a person who had ebola yet still alert sharing the same room as family members succumbing to evd was just a terrible terrible thing to see because it was not feasible to have health care workers continuously monitoring the patients housed in the etus sometimes patients were in the same room for extended periods with others who had died from ebola many patient deaths including deaths unrelated to evd were thought to be directly linked to a lack of resources as retold by one participant i remember one baby who was about four months old suspected of evd as the mother had died of it at that time because we were minimal staff and because of the lack of electricity and concerns for safety we did not have a night shift this baby was lying on a mattress by itself obviously really dehydrated and soiled we cleaned the baby tried to feed the baby and we didnt have any diapers any baby bottles we didnt have small enough ivs to even attempt an ivwe went in several more times that day fed the baby with a syringe gave it some acetaminophen the next morning we went in and the baby was dead in my mind the baby basically starved to death because the baby wasnt symptomatic for ebola 
feelings of depersonalization
 these types of extreme experiences led some participants to feel emotionally withdrawn from their patients one participant noted i felt like this was the only way to protect myself and continue to be productive its really hard to desensitize yourself like that but you have to as a protective measure 
fear of contagion and illnesses suggestive of evd
 thoughts of getting infected were the uppermost concern for most especially during the beginning of the deployment when they were still becoming acclimated to the etu and whenever there was a breach in infection control protocol and practice for some fear was constant one participant recalled constantly thinking dont let me get ebola dont let me get ebola many reported getting sick during their deployment with symptoms that were suggestive of ebola infection fortunately none of the participants in this study became infected with ebola there have been nine cases of evd reported among us health care volunteers with one death31

32 most of the illnesses experienced during deployment were believed to be related to contaminated food andor water 
difficulties with the personal protective equipment and infection control protocols
 the donning and doffing procedures for ppe were time consuming taking about 20-25 minutes before and after working in the etu the ppe was also reported to be uncomfortable and claustrophobic in spite of the limitations of the ppe strict adherence to infection control measures within the etus was strongly encouraged as one participant noted when youre getting ready to go in all the nurses would do a huddle and make a plan decide who was going to do whatand then we would say a prayer as a group before going inbasically for a safe return and see you on the other side several noted that by the time they actually entered the etu they were already sweating profusely and their goggles had fogged up high heat and humidity made it impossible for most to work in the etus any longer than 2-3 hours the ppe was also seen as a barrier to patient care one participant summarized her experience with ppe you do the best that you can with body language and voiceyoure always in a hurry after an hour you were really putting yourself at risk for passing out because of the heat always being rushed by that clock ticking and i think we all felt guilty about rushing out but there was just no way around it 
altered standards of care and ethical conflict
 many of the participants remarked that the hardest part of delivering patient care in the etus was the adjustment to altered standards of care in the us we adhere to basic and fundamental ethical principles of patient care which include respect for persons and their autonomy the concepts of beneficence non-maleficence do no harm justice and fairness to all patients while we recognize that emergency situations may require alterations to usual practices due to resource limitations many of the participants reported that nothing could have prepared them for the constraints that they now faced the inability to provide the quality and level of care that participants were used to delivering was an important source of stress and frustration as noted by one participant even ivs were considered to be a very invasive procedurethere was a ward where people could go to get themnot very many people got to go to that wardeven if they were critically ill they still had to be healthy enough that we could justify taking them to the iv ward they didnt qualify for iv because theyre probably going to die anyway nevertheless some participants manage to adapt one nurse reported that she was able to keep going by constantly reminding herself im doing the best that i can with what i have and thats all i can do witnessing unnecessary patient suffering due to shortages of drugs and other resources was extremely disturbing to all participants lack of pain medications was especially concerning as reported by one participant we didnt have any narcotics so pain control was really challenging we didnt have fentanol we didnt have morphine we didnt have anything like that others recalled wishing they could give their patients any small measure of comfort as one nurse said even little things could mean a lot like to get a cold coke would be an amazing treat but we didnt have these little things that would have made them feel so happy and maybe even help them a little bit that was hard another key source of concern for many participants was witnessing undignified death as noted one participant its one thing to die alone and then its another thing to die in an environment where its hot and dark and theres plastic tarps and chlorine smell and youre on a cot as people come in wearing these big suits and leaving and to die that way after suffering for days by yourself i remember that very vividly while all the participants had prior experience with patients dying none had previously experienced mortality rates this high as one participant recalled literally the bodies were stacking up outside the wardi mean there were many days when there were six to eight occupied body bags lying outside the ward we just had too many bodies one physician recalled that 50 of the patients on the 60-90 patient etu died every day 
safety and security
 in our sample of 16 participants over 80 reported a breach in ppe while working in an etu although the etu was the most common place that subjects felt at risk of exposure there was also the potential for exposure out in the community as one participant recalled upon reporting to a local community health center i walked in on a local doctor caring for a patient who clearly had ebola he had decided to treat the patient there because there were no beds available in the etu i didnt touch anything but still i walked in i could imagine all kinds of ways that i would have had no idea that ebola was right there under my nose the prevention of ebola exposure while a common cause of concern for participants was not the only concern maintaining personal security was also a source of worry one participant was the victim of a violent mugging i got jumped and mugged and had everything stolenpassport credit cards everything there were some bruises and what not but it was more mentally what it did to me i actually thought i was going to die i couldnt trust anyone anymore several participants mentioned feeling threatened by community members who were angry and afraid of the etus and the health care personnel working there family members of etu patients also sometimes threatened violence driving from one location to another was an additional cause for concern as recalled one participant there was definitely a sense of hostility in some of the deployment areas even though we had the ebola team sign on the car there were some checkpoints where we had to get out of the car and hand over our passports there was anxiety about what would happen 
fatigue
 the workload was very taxing as staffing was limited and patient load extremely heavy at least two participants said they started their deployment working 12 hour shifts six days a week one participant reported that in his etu which had over 70 patients each day even though it was originally designed for 14 people - there were only two staff members because of the staff shortages participants said they felt guilty if they took a day off to rest as noted by one participant the one day off a week policy was there but it was on an honor system that many didnt abide by because its the guilt you feel obviously the local health care workers arent taking that day off patients arent taking that day off soit was initially recommended and eventually required as the strain became more apparent there were a couple of times where participants felt so overwhelmed and exhausted that they had considered leaving as one noted we had discussions about whether or not we should stay in the end we always decided to stay 
post-deployment
 
quarantine and sense of isolation
 most participants reported that their reentry experiences were very stressful as illustrated by the following recollection the airport was just awful they sent you back into this little office  i coughed one time that led to me being put into a room that was the equivalent of a jail cell metal bench metal toilet without a lid and a camera two doctors in full ppe came in and questioned me in our sample once participants returned home they were placed in home quarantine this was also reported as an extremely stressful time as one participant noted i had to do a 21-day mandatory quarantine and observation period i actually oddly found this to be the most traumatic part of the whole thing i come from a very small town and everyone kind of knows everyone elses business my family was basically convinced that i was going to die of ebola at any moment i did my quarantine at my parents but i had to have my own room my own utensils and plates my own bathroom i wasnt allowed to touch anyone i had to maintain a three foot radius at all times i wasnt even able to have a very close conversation another participant mentioned that she lost a lot of friends during quarantine because nobody would even pick up the phone it was just awful lack of physical contact during the quarantine was problematic for some many had not had any physical contact for many months one participant reported that she had not touched a single person from early november until the end of january and then suddenly 21 days was over my public health nurse came to my house on day 21 and we realized it was overand i dont have ebola and she gives me a hug and i was likeoh my godyoure the first person that has touched me in 3 months and nowlike im terrified i miss my 3 foot bubble just because i felt very secure now when someone reaches out for a handshake or a hug  im like are you sure you know what youre doing even after the quarantine period was over some wanted to be alone as recalled one participant as soon as the quarantine was over everyone wanted things to go back to normal as if nothing had happenedbut i didnt want to see anyone i was so used to being alone still at least one participant reported more positive experiences upon their return most people were great the problem was the 5 who were freaks about it 
stigmatization lack of appreciation
 participants reported that they felt anger and resentment from their family members and friends upon their return they felt unprepared for the reactions of those around them as expressed by one participant no one wants to be around you- even after the quarantine is over i was like oh my gosh people dont want to be around me i felt very nave and stupid for not foreseeing it like i was making plans like nothing was wrong but nobody wants to deal with you some wanted validation of the risks they had taken by volunteering they wanted the public to know what they had been through and how they had put their own lives at risk to help protect others participants felt that their efforts not only helped people in west africa who were directly affected but that they also helped to prevent the spread of ebola to other countries including the us they wanted the authorities to confirm that the volunteers were not reckless but rather that they were selfless they felt like heroes and wanted to be appreciated for their volunteer efforts but instead some reported feeling stigmatized upon their return because as one participant stated people were being selfish and only worried about their own health and not how the ebola response effort was about the health and well-being of total populations another participant felt that the attitude in the us was im in the us and this doesnt involve me so why should i care several participants experienced stigmatization as did their family members as reported by one participant not only was there fear and stigmatization against me but against my family as well my mom volunteers at a school they told her not to come in 
grief depression and guilt about leaving
 participants reported feelings of grief mourning sadness depression remorse and regret upon their return as one participant said oh we could have done much much more others reported feeling as if they were on an emotional roller coaster as one participant noted i felt disappointed and defeated other times i felt ok i did everything i could this is good so up and down it was a nightmare another participant described how he had felt upon return i was a total mess because it was right back to work everyone wanted to tell me how amazing i was but i felt just horrible inside it was hard to dialogue with people about it difficulty sleeping was also reported to be a problem for several participants once they returned home several mentioned that they had been offered mental health services upon return although most did not utilize it the reasons for not using varied from i didnt think i needed it at the time to it was too impersonal by phone by skype those that did use the offered services found them to be very useful one participant was particularly grateful to an occupational medicine physician who called and checked on her well-being for days and weeks after she returned home but in general most participants did not feel that they had received adequate counseling resources some expressed remorse about leaving their ebola deployment when their assignment was completed as noted one participant i did not want to leave after 9 weeks there it was really hard to leave there were still so many people needing care still so many cases and so much to do i felt like i was abandoning the people there including the nationals still working there 
self-doubt disillusionment re-entry stress symptoms of ptsd reflections
 upon return several participants started doubting the meaningfulness of their deployment one participant reported i had this whole questioning of myself and my role in humanitarian responseand then just the stigmatization following all of it you know i kind of came to the fact that all of this is dirty and humanitarian response is going to have some of its dirtiness nothing is as altruistic clean and fair as you think it is everything is complicated and not everybody is in it for the purpose of helping each other out another participant noted the deployment really was an eye opener it showed me where the deficits are within all these international humanitarian organizations many were dismayed by the inequalities they saw between the us health care workers and local health care workers especially in terms of treatment when a worker became ill they also were upset by the fact that local health care workers sometimes did not receive their promised pay transitioning back to everyday lives was difficult for many as one participant recalled when you come back you dont have that grieving time you dont work through any of the emotions and everything you just put everything on hold at that time there just wasnt any time for debriefing- to help reacclimatize returning to your homes in hindsight i think it would have really been good to have had debriefing others mentioned feeling isolated because the only people that they felt they could really talk to and who understood what they were feeling were the people who had deployed with them as noted by one participant you breathe you eat you sleep it for 24 hours of every day its not like you can come back home and relax with your family your heart is just not into it another participant similarly found his reentry disquieting reentry was really really rough i spent a lot of time just sitting in my office staring out of the office i mostly internalized it i drank a lot several doubted they would do another deployment like this and if they did certain conditions would have to be in place as one said id have to know that what i was doing was making such a huge difference that it was worth it to be freaking miserable for 21 days sadly others reported a loss of sense of purpose in life once they returned as one physician reported simply put ive just lost my way when i got back the problems were still there but it felt like i was just finished with the way i had been living no worriesyoure gonna die anyway in this outbreak reforming a new life has been tough i guess you could call it ptsd im proud of what i did but in my personal life ive paid a heavy price 
positive reflections
 despite these predominantly negative findings some positive experiences and feelings were noted as well for instance almost all participants reported a very strong sense of comradery and teamwork within their group there were also many reports of feeling a great deal of respect admiration and appreciation for the skills commitment and hard work of the nationals and other team members that they worked with in spite of the personal toll of the deployment several said were inspired to continue to volunteer as reported by one participant it renewed my commitment to health justice and health equity for everyone and as noted by another i would volunteer again now that i have a better understanding of what needs to be done in an outbreak both in terms of preparedness and response in this study we found important gaps in preparedness at each stage of deployment with perhaps the most important deficiencies noted in the pre-deployment phase one of the difficulties in making recommendations for improvement is determining who the recommendations should target is it the sponsoring agency is it the person wanting to volunteer is it the professional organization representing these us health care workers it seems reasonable to assume that the responsibility for ensuring a safe and effective high risk deployment should be shared among all key stakeholders most importantly the international community specifically who has a responsibility for ensuring efficient and rapid response to future outbreaks in particular the who department of pandemic and epidemic diseases provides strategic leadership in support of affected countries with limited resources the who working in concert with their international partners should develop preparedness recommendations that aim to protect the health and well-being of all health care volunteers recommendations should target the pre-deployment stage starting with the provision of clear accurate and realistic information about the mission the conditions in the field and the steps that will be taken to help protect the health and safety of volunteers sponsors of medical missions are responsible for providing high quality training such as the training developed and provided by the cdc and other organizations in response to ebola hands-on simulated training is essential for complex infection control practices that may be unfamiliar to most health care volunteers this training should be mandatory and verified preferably by high level us public health agencies prior to any high risk deployment specialized counseling at the pre-deployment stage should be targeted towards both volunteers and their families in order to help reduce fear anxiety and resentment of family members pre-deployment counseling might also help volunteers cope with other types of stressors they may commonly face during the deployment fear work-related problems mental and physical exhaustion as well as after the deployment quarantine challenges shunning stigmatization and sense of isolation volunteers must be provided with full disclosure of the procedures that will have to be followed upon return in terms of quarantine this is especially important because the us does not have extensive experience or uniformity with regards to quarantine policies or procedures and there was and remains a lack of standardized management of health care volunteers returning from highly contagious and lethal infectious disease deployments33

34 volunteers to hot zone missions need to know what to expect upon initial reentry into the us and upon return to their particular home state and local jurisdiction as quarantine laws vary considerably around the country35 for large scale events the cdc has an important role to play to help reduce stigmatization of returning volunteers and their families by launching general public information campaigns these types of campaigns might better prepare communities to both send and receive returning volunteers sponsoring organizations also have a responsibility in assuring that there are support systems in place for volunteers and their families if needed upon their repatriation back home health care workers interested in volunteer work similarly have important preparedness responsibilities first it may be prudent to consider volunteering locally or nationally before agreeing to overseas missions because the us is one of the top five nations worldwide36 in terms of natural disaster occurrences there are many opportunities for health care workers interested in volunteering for disaster response for example the national disaster response system ndms which include the disaster medical assistance team and the national nurse response team are excellent volunteer options to explore36 another good option is the medical reserve corps mrc37 a national network of volunteers that are organized locally to improve the health and safety of their communities health professionals can also volunteer through the american red cross38
 before considering an overseas medical mission potential volunteers should review as much information provided by the sponsoring organization as possible as well as more general published information39 volunteers need to assure themselves and their families of the capabilities of the sponsor organizations a list of non-governmental organizations that meet certain criteria is maintained by the national voluntary organization active in disaster nvoad40 sponsors should have proven track records of effective humanitarian medical response missions in resource-poor countries including their ability to maintain an adequate supply chain of necessary ppe21 they must also provide a clear understanding of what the volunteers roles and responsibilities are likely to be in order to limit misunderstandings on-site volunteers can pre-register with sponsor organizations in order to obtain advanced verification of credentials and licensure which can then facilitate rapid deployment41
 potential volunteers should also avail themselves and their families of the many excellent no-cost training basic disaster preparedness programs so that they are better prepared to serve as a disaster volunteer information on these programs is noted in table 2 training programs that address cultural competency and cross-cultural job performance may also of value to volunteers with information provided by the sponsor on the prevailing cultural norms of the host country volunteers can become more competent in this regard a good review of this is provided in a 2009 rand publication42
 

 the responsibility of the sponsor should not end when the volunteers tour of duty ends if volunteers have to be quarantined upon their return home the sponsor should ensure they have policies and protocols in place to support the volunteer during quarantine the sponsor should also ensure that the volunteers have mental health care resources available at all stages of deployment a good resource for additional information on the maintenance of psychological well-being of volunteers is provided by the substance abuse and mental health services administration samsha43 they urge disaster responders to take advantage of their extensive resource list to help them maintain their psychological well-being before during and after a disaster deployment participation in support groups comprised of volunteers may also be advantageous mental health aspects of deployment are of particular concern we noted a striking similarity between post-deployment feelings reported in this study with those reported by returning war veterans recent scholarship on a relatively new phenomenon referred to as moral injury may have some relevance here moral injury is believed to result when military personnel are confronted with ethical and moral challenges that transgress deeply held beliefs and morals44

45 in our study participants frequently witnessed suffering undignified death and limited ability to provide quality of careand these exposures may have resulted in moral injury as the symptoms commonly associated with moral injury shame guilt remorse and demoralization45 were frequently reported by our study participants while moral injury is different from post-deployment mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd co-morbidities with this and other mental health disorders are not unusual45 since the short and long term mental health impact of hazardous medical mission deployments has not been well characterized in volunteers additional studies on this are warranted despite the potential study limitations which include small sample and self-report selection recall and social desirability response biases important in-depth information was obtained that can inform our understanding of the potential adverse impacts of high risk medical deployments additional studies are warranted to develop and evaluate best practices preparedness programs for high risk medical missions there is also a need to assess pre-deployment counseling on health and mental health outcomes in medical volunteers the urge to do something to help in an international medical crisis is understandable and admirable but the adverse impacts reported by participants here  at every stage of deployment suggest that preparedness for these missions needs improvement and at the very least high risk missions should be limited to more seasoned and well trained for conditions in the field personnel while volunteering for a medical mission during a health crisis can be very rewarding both professionally and personally it can also be very disruptive and impactful all volunteers for high risk missions must be made fully aware of the risks they are going to face and the potential consequences which may include illness quarantine and even death the challenges of delivering care under extremely constrained conditions may be overwhelming for some people and it is imperative that volunteers have realistic expectations of conditions in the field as well as a good understanding of how this deployment may affect their lives  before during and after deployment organizations sponsoring medical missions have a great responsibility to protect the safety and security of their volunteers by providing them with adequate training and ensuring that the medical missions are well managed they also must ensure that their volunteers have appropriate counseling and mental health care resources available at every stage of their deployment support for a national us program that can provide oversight of high risk medical missions is advisable especially since it is inevitable that there will be future outbreaks because the health and safety of volunteers for these types of missions may be at risk preparedness of all key stakeholders is essential the heroism of ebola mission volunteers was appropriately honored by the 2014 times person of the year award and we can further honor their bravery and sacrifice by ensuring that future volunteers to high risk missions will be as well prepared as possible such efforts will serve to protect the volunteer as well as the international community including the us correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to robyn r m gershon mhs drph institute for health policy studies university of california san francisco tel 415 476-1890 email robyngershonucsfedu the authors declare that they have no competing interests all relevant data are within the paper and its supporting information files 

  another invisible enemy indoors covid-19 human health the home and united states indoor air policy jamaji nwanaji-enwerem c joseph allen g paloma beamer i   following the emergence of the novel respiratory virus sars-cov-2 covid-19 many environmental health experts quickly identified the potentially disastrous public health ramifications of concurrent infectious and air pollution-mediated disease 1 however much of this discussion has focused on the outdoors annually 38 million people worldwide prematurely die from illnesses attributable to household air pollution 2 in the united states radon a major indoor air pollutant is the second leading cause of lung cancer and is responsible for 1500020000 deaths each year 3 although stay-at-home orders and remote workinglearning have increased the relevance of home indoor exposures to all persons there are still certain vulnerable populations that bear a disparate burden of avoiding the virus outdoors and being exposed to nontrivial pollutants indoors these populations include children the elderly individuals with preexisting conditions native american tribal nations and households of low socioeconomic statusparticularly those in multifamily buildings 47 to be explicit this is not a call for ignoring social distancing and other public health orders rather similar to efforts drawing attention to increases in domestic abuse and the mental health consequences of isolation 8 9 it is an opportunity to name poor household indoor air quality as a long-standing public health issue with increased relevance during the present pandemic one common misconception is that the indoor air environment is simply a reflection of the outdoor milieu however this is not always the case outdoor air pollution penetrates indoors and because americans spend a majority of their times indoors 90 the majority of exposure to outdoor air pollution occurs indoors nevertheless there are distinct important sources of indoor air pollution 10 fireplaces kitchens furniture wall insulation and personal care products are just some noteworthy sources of indoor pollutants household cleaning products are a particularly relevant source of indoor pollution at this juncture in time given that many people may be cleaning more frequently and with stronger disinfectants to reduce rates of viral infection furthermore efforts to make homes airtight to improve energy efficiency have created buildings with reduced outdoor ventilation rates resulting in the buildup of indoor pollutants to harmful levels that would be otherwise unacceptable outdoors 11 12 importantly the toxicity of indoor air extends beyond the health effects of individual pollutants the reactive chemistry of pollutants can be an additional source of harmful indoor chemicals including secondary ozonides oxygenated volatile organic compounds and hydroxyl radicals 13 finally the microbiota of the indoor environment is becoming an ever-more appreciated contributor to indoor air quality 14 15 existing studies demonstrate that indoor air microbiomes are quite diverse and can have meaningful impacts on human health 16 although individuals are primarily concerned with the burden of covid-19 in their indoor air aerosolized covid-19 does not exist in isolation hence recognition of all airborne microorganisms and how the indoor air microbiome may interact with many of the aforementioned chemical exposures is important for building a more comprehensive understanding of indoor air quality in contrast to the outdoors where federal mandates like the clean air act of 1970 have been passed to maintain air quality direct top-level legislation for indoor air quality has been lacking the environmental protection agency epa indoor air quality program was slated to be cut in the 2019 federal budget and at present the epa does not regulate indoor air 17 some may point to the us housing act 1937 the safe water drinking act 1974 the residential lead hazard reduction act 1992 and the updated toxic substances control act tsca 2016 as examples of legislation addressing the indoor environment however these measures are indirect in that they limit the introduction of harmful substances that are brought indoors but do not regulate the indoor environment itself they have also demonstrated weaknesses in effectiveness for instance despite the tsca the epa still identified the need to offer a final ruling that any discontinued uses of asbestos cannot reenter the marketplace without epa review in april of 2019 18 this ruling is particularly concerning as it opens the door for the epa to reconsider uses of asbestos and could result in the reintroduction of asbestos to the marketplace in lieu of federal indoor air mandates some states have offered legislation to control the air in schools and other buildings still efforts directed at private homes remain limited moreover these state-level policies leave a patchwork of national coverage 19 the existing discrepancy in the frameworks for regulating outdoor and indoor air can be partially explained by the perception of outdoor air as a shared public good but indoor air as a discrete personal resource with non-communal impacts 20 yet covid-19 demonstrates how this logic easily falls apart the main premise for social distancing and stay-at-home orders is to safeguard the individual and society at-large from peaks in infection that would overwhelm the nations healthcare system nevertheless one can imagine a young boy already living with severe asthma who now has to spend all of his day in a dilapidated urban project apartment after being exposed to mold and secondhand smoke from his neighbors he too finds himself rushed to a hospital in this common scenario society fails to gain the full benefits of stay-at-home orders because the healthcare system is utilized regardless and those most at-risk for covid-19 complications are also placed at greater risk of exposure still as we push for broader pieces of legislation to protect our indoor air what can that young boy do to potentially mitigate the impacts of harmful indoor air on his health what can other individuals do to protect themselves and their loved ones during these times of home isolation and beyond when entering the home remove shoes at the door to avoid tracking harmful particles inside if someone in your household has covid-19 or is a healthcare worker consider using a high-efficiency particulate air hepa purifier in the home even though these purifiers are not completely protective against the virus hepa filters remove particles of 03 m and a coronavirus is 01 m they can help remove other pollutants and larger viralmicrobiome agglomerates from the air if it is safe to do so opening up windows can improve indoor air circulation and dilute indoor contaminants if cooking make sure the kitchen remains well-ventilated to avoid harmful exposures to fumes and particulate matter finally when cleaning avoid the overuse of chemicals and air fresheners that may simply be contributing additional hazardous substances to the air although there will be limits eg financial logistical safety to the extent to which individuals can fully implement these and similar protective measures in their personal lives we hope for these suggestions to be a helpful starting place by continuing to raise awarenesstogetherwe can help actualize a future where fewer people succumb to indoor air-related disease  covid-19 fear quackery false representations and the law qc ian freckelton   when

theories can seem appealing knapp 2020 van prooijen  douglas 2018 there can be other consequences too anxiety fear and the beguiling temptations of a vulnerable patient group provide the unscrupulous with incentives for lucrative quackery and exploitation during a pandemic fuelled by alarmist saturation publicity and propagated by social media the contagion of fear stalks alongside the disease itself debiec 2020 honigsbaum 2009 honigsbaum 2020 resulting in a preparedness on the part of a cross-section of patients or potential patients to panic to suspend rationality and to invest hope in unlikely offerings of prophylactic agents treatments and cures taylor 2019 in addition during a pandemic more people than normal are spending time at home searching online for answers to the threats about which they have read in such a context false claims misinformation narratives and rumour-mongering on social media can achieve high levels of currency it is important in such a context for government messaging to work against fears dread honigsbaum 2013 and anxieties it is also essential for the community to be provided promptly and consistently with comprehensible scientifically-based information so as to make sound therapeutic decision in their own and the communitys best interests garrett 1995 garrrett 2000 citizens need to be protected against the misrepresentations and false facts ball and maxmen 27 may 2020 propagated by unethical purveyors of spurious or unproven treatments and medical instruments this article contextualises inappropriate representations about preventing treating and curing covid-19 within the historical backdrop of quackery and charlatanism during previous pandemics it reviews the extent of false claims in the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic and reviews legal responses taken in diverse countries to protect patients against unscientific overtures and promises about treatments remedies and preventative options it argues that the combination of robust consumer protection measures and ongoing publicity from public health authorities is critical for the protection of members of the community who may not be in a position to exercise medico-scientific discernment in their own best interests death engages multiple triggers for anxiety and fear menzies menzies  iverach 2018 but pandemics carry particularly emotive connotations  not just because they bring with them the prospect of terrible numbers of fatalities our sense of trust is challenged by what is liable to be a pandemic of fear  not only are we afraid of the emerging infection but we become fearful of those around us as it may be they who are the sources of potential transmission of a fatal infection to us strong 1990 293 as taylor 2019 5 has observed pandemics are ubiquitously disruptive they are associated with a score of  psychosocial stressors including health threats to oneself and loved ones there may be severe disruptions of routines separation from family and friends shortages of food and medicine wage loss social isolation due to quarantine or other social distancing programs and school closure in addition hospital and medical facilities can break down under the pressure of patient numbers to which they cannot cater there can be a feeling that the fabrics of our communities are buckling and social structures are faltering under the pressure of the medical crisis a pandemic arises from virulent pathogens shah 2016 206 and exposure in significant part is involuntary it can be fatal for any given person it is not visible and it is hard to prevent and problematic to treat effectively during a pandemic citizens are particularly dependent on government authorities for information guidance and protection but the ability of such authorities to manage the risk to the community often does not always command universal confidence lu 2015 non-compliance with governmental exhortations and even orders can exacerbate the levels of transmission risk media treatment and some authors accounts can be framed in a way that unhelpfully generates panic an archetypal example of such anxiety generation occurred when preston 1995 wrote of the ebola virus transforming virtually every part of the body into a digested slime of virus particles see too quammen 2014 46 preston 2009 perceptions of the relative impotence of doctors in the face of a pandemic can propel some who may already have been suspicious of mainstream medicine to become mistrustful and disillusioned with it and to search for other options even if from a rational perspective they are unlikely to be efficacious and they may be manifestly unscientific for some years virologists have spoken apocalyptically about the potential for a plague that will endanger the viability of the human race larry brilliant in a 2006 ted talk for instance related how in a survey he undertook of leading epidemiologists 90 said they thought there would be a catastrophic pandemic in their lifetime in which a billion people would become ill and up to as many as 165 million people would die accompanied by a global recession see too shah 2016 in short pandemics are the domain of linguistic hyperbole unhelpful predictions of a viral armageddon and a forum for anxiety-inducing prognostications as sontag 1988 4142 observed in illness as metaphor 
nothing is more punitive than to give a disease a meaning  that meaning being invariably a moralistic one any important disease whose causality is murky and for which treatment is ineffectual tends to be awash in significance first the subjects of deepest dread corruption decay pollution anomie weakness are identified with the disease then in the name of the disease that is using it as a metaphor that horror is imposed on other things the disease becomes adjectival
 pandemic fear creates black humour brig 24 march 2020 but it also makes people hyper-vigilant it impels them to notice things they might not otherwise have noticed to pay attention to certain associations and ignore others to remember prophecies they might previously have dismissed as absurd spinney 2017 75 mediaeval chroniclers relate how bizarre sightings of unnatural phenomena occurred in the period leading up to the onset of the black death giving a fillip to public panic and the miasma theory of pandemics - that a miasma bad air unleashed by god was the cause of the disease scapegoating and discrimination too are a common response in face of a pandemic mcneil jr 2009 cooke 2009 during the antonine plague of 166 ce for instance there was an eruption of persecution of christians who were blamed for the plague by reason of their rejection of local gods their blasphemies and their indulgence in black magic seaman 2018 between 1347 and 1352 during the black death there were multiple attacks on members of social minorities including those suffering from leprosy mental illness and foreigners colet santiveri ventura saula  galdacano 2014 they were an example of a fear-induced reaction in anticipation of or shortly after outbreaks of plague too jews were accused of poisoning food wells and streams they were tortured into confessions rounded up in city squares or synagogues and exterminated mostly by burning en masse cohn jr 2007 jedwab johnson  koyama 2019 mcneil jr 2009 more than 200 jewish communities across europe were devastated during the years of the black death in particular in spain and germany cohn jr 2007 einbinder 2018 in more recent times discrimination in the form of assaults insults and business boycotts has taken place against chinese communities even during its earliest phases in italy fanned by claims that china was responsible for the covid-19 pandemic liu 18 february 2020 and references to descriptors such as the chinese flu and kung flu restuccia 22 june 2020 sojo  bapuji 2020 fear is apt to generate stress responses bennett 1998 meisenhelder  lacharite 1989 to which some persons are more predisposed than others by reason of a combination of genetic psychological biological educational and situational factors in face of the pressures of a pandemic we are all vulnerable but some amongst us have especial psychological frailties as a result of rigidities of personality particular levels of fearfulness or a propensity to anxiety that can be exploited this is the more pronounced in an era in which all forms of media including social media make information including alarmist and stress-inducing information the more accessible and ubiquitous it has been suggested that the speed of social media creates an echo chamber of skepticism and conspiracy theories gorter 2020 those who are less educated who have disabilities see kavanagh 2020 or who are socially isolated by reason of limited linguistic facility in their country of residence have additional vulnerabilities in terms of their ability to understand and process government-issued information this can leave them with impairments of health literacy at least in respect of the pandemic paakkan  okan 2020 emotionally and informationally isolated and prone to make decisions based upon fear and rumour the diathesis stress model is useful in this context it postulates that if the combination of predisposition and stressor exceed a threshold this can result in the development of pathology lazarus 1993 however at a subclinical level vulnerabilities can render people at risk for poor decision-making and inhibiting their capacity for clear thinking and the analysis of available information about how they should respond to risk pandemics generate high levels of anxiety paranoia stigmatisation and xenophobia taylor 2019 with the potential for maladaptive decision-making such responses can be exacerbated by cultural educational and religiose overlays that are apt to engender confusion guilt and anxiety as well as by emotive tropes encountered in a variety of contexts religion literature films and board and online games are a significant part of our shared cultural experience that frame our expectations and influence our responses to reality dehority 2020 for instance in the old testament of the bible plagues and pestilences which also ravaged the ancient world are depicted as a punishment by an often merciless god as a retribution for the commission of sins see eg exodus 9 14 numbers 11 33 1 samuel 4 8 psalms 8923 isaiah 9 13 as huremovic 2019 7 has observed throughout the biblical context pandemic outbreaks are the bookends of human existence considered both a part of nascent human societies and a part of the very ending of humanity the bhagavad purana pragmatically warned villagers to flee their dwellings as soon as dead rats were seen as dead rats were a harbinger of death in humans blaser 1998 liston 1924 in islamic tradition there are multiple exhortations as to how a person must respond in face of the danger of contagion  for instance the holy prophet recognised the urgency of preventative responses and preached the importance of travel bans and quarantine in places contaminated with disease in order to mitigate the spread of illness if you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land do not enter it and if the plague breaks out in a place while you are in it do not leave that place sahih al-bukhari similar depictions are found in literature it was homer who first used the term epidemios to describe those returning to greece while hippocrates employed it in a medical sense to refer to that which circulates or propagates in a country this paved the way for awareness of the potential for an infection to spread uncontrolled from one community to another thucydides recounted the fearfulness of the plague in athens between 429 and 426 bce and the breakdown of law and order 
there was no previous record of so great a pestilence and destruction of human life the doctors were unable to cope since they were treating the disease for the first time and in ignorance indeed the more they came into contact with sufferers the more liable they were to lose their own lives no other device of men was any help moreover supplication at sanctuaries resort to divination and the like were all unavailing in the end people were overwhelmed by the disaster and abandoned efforts against it history of the peloponnesian war ii viii512
 the better part of a millennium later procopius in his account of the justinian plague in 543 ce history of the wars ii 22 which the emperor himself termed gods education and john of ephesus called the chastisement pearce 2017 commented that the whole human race came near to being annihilated the accounts of both chaucer 13431400 in the canterbury tales ther cam a privee thief men clepeth deeth that in this contree al the peple sleeth and boccaccio 13131375 in the decameron in this sore affliction and misery of our city the reverend authority of the laws both human and divine was all in a manner dissolved and fallen into decay for lack of the ministers and executors thereof who like other men were all either dead or sick or else left so destitute of followers that they were unable to exercise any office wherefore everyone had license to do whatever pleased him postulated amongst other things that fear of contagion increases vices such as avarice lust and corruption both alessandro manzoni 17851873 in the betrothed i promessi sposi 1827 revised 1842 and history of the column of infamy storia della colonna infame and daniel defoe 16591731 in the diary of a plague year catalogued reactions of anxiety and desperation within milan and london respectively during pandemics manzoni described the fears of poisoning arising from scaffolding carried by workers in a cathedral in the betrothed and in a history of the column of infamy the belief that the plague had been caused by the actions of the evil the untori who were possessed by the devil resulting in the execution of the innocent and erection of a column in milan to commemorate the imposition of death on two greasers in the last man mary shelley 17971851 portrayed the need of the central character to stay away from others for fear of being infected and edgar allan poe 18091849 meditated on the role of the plague in being a purveyor of death similarly in the scarlet plague published in 1912 jack london 18761916 portrayed a post-apocalyptic scenario in 2073 following the spread of the red death in which an uncontrollable pandemic had depopulated the world 60 years before albert camus la peste 1947 in which the plague was posting sentries at the gates and turning away ships was a critique of repugnant materialism as well as disturbing account of cohabitation with death he described reactions of complacency that placed all at risk many continued hoping that the epidemic would soon die out and they and their families be spared thus they felt under no obligation to make any change in their habits as yet plague was an unwelcome visitant bound to take its leave one day as unexpectedly as it had come and anxious fears about the threat to come a pestilence isnt a thing made to mans measure therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind a bad dream that will pass away but it doesnt always pass away and from one bad dream to another it is men who pass away multiple films have portrayed the catastrophic impact of epidemics and in particular pandemics as a genre they have been described as reel bio-horror films sutton 2014 the andromeda strain 1971 based on the novel by michael crichton for instance depicts the spread of a deadly organism of extraterrestrial origin death in venice morte a venezia 1971 relates the story of a composer who travels to venice for health reasons but the city becomes stricken by cholera and the health authorities do not inform holiday-makers of what is happening for fear of the consequences in outbreak 1995 the setting is a fictional ebola-form of motaba virus in zaire which then spreads to a california coastal village via a capuchin monkey which is host to the virus the plot focuses on strategies including sinister military interventions and conspiracies to conceal the virus so it can be used as a biological weapon fatal contact 2006 portrays an american businessman who becomes infected with a mutated bird flu virus and brings it back to the united states it spreads around the world and riots erupt with armed mobs attempting to hijack vaccines and the pandemic continues to mutate causing further international waves of panic contagion 2011 portrays the medico-scientific quest for a cure to a virus transmitted by respiratory droplets and fmites it includes a sub-plot in which the jude law character a blogger spreads rumors about forsythia wang xia liu et al 2018 a herbal treatment he claims works to cure the virus the last days los ltimos das 2013 centres around a trend of agoraphobia and the panic where people die if they leave shelter extinction 2015 goes a step further portraying a post-apocalyptic world in which a virus has turned the populace into zombies the series of resident evil horror films starting in 2002 and followed by sequels in 2004 2007 2010 2012 and 2016 is based on attempts to control the spread of the t-virus that has escaped from a secret underground genetic research facility in 2015 containment set in a southampton apartment block explores a world patrolled by figures in hazmat suits keeping people within their apartments which no longer have electricity water or contact with the outside world repeating the refrain please remain calm the situation is under control there are many other popular exposures to pandemics which generate associations of fear panic and the imminence of human annihilation for instance the popular board game pandemic 2008 was based on the premise that four diseases had broken out in the world each threatening to wipe out a region the game accommodates two to four players each playing one of seven possible specialists dispatcher medic scientist researcher operations expert contingency planner and quarantine specialist through the combined effort of all the players the goal is to discover all four cures before any of several game-losing conditions global catastrophe are reached computer games about viral outbreaks are also prevalent and a potentially significant influence on the generation of gamers for instance in deus ex 2000 a lethal pandemic the gray death has ravaged the population there is no cure but a synthetic vaccine ambrosia can nullify the effects of the virus but is in short supply because of its scarcity ambrosia is available only to those deemed vital to the social order  and finds its way primarily to government officials military personnel the rich and influential scientists and the intellectual elite with no hope for the common people of the world riots occur worldwide and some terrorist organizations have formed with the professed intent of assisting the downtrodden in the last of us 2013 an outbreak of a mutant cordyceps fungus has ravaged the united states transforming its hosts into aggressive creatures known as the infected it is an action adventure survival horror game civilisation has been decimated by the infection and survivors live in heavily policed quarantine zones independent settlements and nomadic groups joel works as a smuggler and his task is to smuggle ellie who has been infected but it is believed her community may have a cure plague inc evolved 2014 is a real-time strategy simulation game where the player creates and evolves a pathogen in an effort to destroy the world with a deadly virus it and its predecessor

in a near-future washington dc in the aftermath of a potent strain of a smallpox pandemic engineered in new york city by an environmental terrorist in christian tradition world literature film board games and computer games pandemics have been vividly and emotively portrayed in diverse ways requiring urgent prophylactic or avoidance responses all of which are redolent with fear and paranoid ideation thoughts of the reader the viewer and the gamer are turned toward the potential for dire outcomes sometimes offence caused to the godhead is mooted as a cause for the threat frequently doubts are ventilated around the bona fides and effectiveness of the measures taken by government and public health authorities to contain and eradicate viruses and bacteria helplessness is a prominent trope and catastrophising can find expression in the form of both eschatological and apocalyptic ruminations about the consequences of the pandemic for oneself all whom one knows and even the future of humanity in all contexts global disaster is at hand armageddon is close this creates a fertile field for opportunists and charlatans as porter 1989 26 observed in the face of invasions of epidemic sickness there is desperation which in turn creates a voracious demand for a multiplicity of healers amongst whom are quacks thus a variety of influences can combine to generate high levels of fear and anxiety all of which can exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities and militate against calm and informed decision-making during a pandemic the russian flu is often described as the first modern influenza pandemic it took place between 1889 and 1892 and is believed to have killed more one million people honigsbaum 2020 including queen victorias grandson the duke of clarence honigsbaum 2011 mcginnis 1988 123124 newspaper advertisements touted many cures for the russian flu including castor oil bronchial inhalers and an electric battery quinine too was offered mcginnis 1988 doctors even promoted the idea that drinking brandy and eating oysters were a key to staving off infection knapp 2020 the best known questionable remedy proposed for the russian flu though was the carbolic smoke ball which consisted of a rubber ball filled with powdered carbolic acid snell 2001 the patient squeezed the ball sending a puff of acidic smoke up a tube inserted into the nostrils it was advertised with testimonials by well known personalities as was common at the time in the pall mall gazette offering a 100 reward to anyone using it correctly who then contracted influenza mcginnis 1988 124 the purveyor of the smoke ball deposited 1000 in the alliance bank in regent street to show the money was there coleman 2009 the carbolic smoke ball prophylaxis had a notorious legal outcome louisa elizabeth carlill purchased a ball from a chemist in oxford street london and used it as directed three times a day for nearly two months however she contracted the flu she claimed her reward but was rebuffed by the carbolic smoke ball company which replied to correspondence from her husband who had trained as a solicitor saying that if used properly it had total confidence in its product it failed to return her money this resulted in her suing the carbolic smoke ball company in the high court for breach of contract she succeeded carlill v carbolic smoke ball company 1892 but the company appealed to the court of appeal arguing that their advertisement was mere puff however this argument was rejected on the basis that the company had deposited 1000 to show its seriousness as mcginness 1988 127128 has observeda legal decision supporting that type of argument would only serve to encourage the telling of even more outrageous untruths advertisers could attempt with impunity to trap consumers with progressively bigger lies and then avoid liability by laughing at the gullibility of the gulled instead the court said that it was going to look at the contract as printed and to interpret it according to its plain meaning on the sensible assumption that what is exactly what mrs carlill and other buyers like her would have done
 secondly the company maintained that it had no way of ascertaining whether mrs carlill had followed its instructions correctly this contention was rejected by the court of appeal out-of-hand carlill v carbolic smoke ball company 1893 thirdly the company argued that an offer such as it had made could not be understood to have been made to the whole world this argument too failed with the court of appeal finding that the offer was clear and to a group of consumers and anyone fulfilling its terms could be deemed to have accepted the offer finally the company argued that the requisite consideration for a contract did not exist however the court of appeal rejected this too concluding that any use of the smoke ball would be likely to promote sales and thus be of value to the company thus mrs carlills use of the smoke ball constituted valuable consideration the outcome of the decision was an emphatic endorsement of contract law as a means by which the vulnerable could be protected against false representations which were not honoured during a pandemic the editors of the lancet exulted 
we are glad to learn that in spite of the ingenuity of their legal advisers the defendants have been held liable to make good their promise people who are silly enough to adopt a medicine simply because a tradesman is reckless enough to make extravagant promises and wild representations as to its efficacy may thank themselves chiefly for any disappointment that ensues still for this folly which is only foolish and nothing worse it is possible to feel sympathy when the disappointment comes it is a pleasant alternative to learn that the dupe has been able as in the present instance to enforce a sharp penalty and that the process of reaping a harvest from the simplicity of ones neighbours is attended with dangers of miscarriage which must materially diminish its attractiveness in the eyes of those people who supply the popular demand for quack medicines editorial 1892 see too simpson 1985

 catharine arnold 2018 ch 12 has documented how willingness to try anything during the spanish flu era was accompanied by a proliferation of advertisements in the west for influenza-related remedies 
from the times of london to the washington post page after page was filled with dozens of advertisements for preventive measures and over-the-counter remedies influenza proclaimed an advert extolling the virtues of formamint lozenges suck a tablet whenever you enter a crowded germ-laden place another advertisement announced as spanish influenza is an exaggerated form of grip readers should take laxative bromo quinine in larger doses than usual as a preventive measure for those who had already succumbed hills cascara quinine bromide promised relief as did dr joness liniment previously and mysteriously known as beaver oil and intended to provide relief from coughing and catarrh demand for vicks vaporub still popular today was drummed up by press adverts warning of imminent shortages
 carbolic soap was touted in the british midlands as a disinfectant and cleanser various forms of alcohol were touted as remedies for influenza 
in denmark and canada alcohol was only available by prescription while in poland brandy was regarded as highly medicinal one brave soul in nova scotia recommended fourteen straight gins in quick succession as a cure for spanish flu the result of this experiment was unknown if the patient had survived he had doubtless forgotten the proceedings entirely in britain the royal college of physicians stated that alcohol invites disaster a conclusion which was ignored by many the barman at londons savoy hotel created a new cocktail based on whisky and rum and christened it the corpse reviver arnold 2018 ch 12
 consumer protection by governments during the spanish flu was only in its infancy and relatively few measures were adopted by the state to inhibit false and misleading representations about medical products during the covid-19 crisis in 2020 spurious remedies were championed from early in the pandemic in many countries the issue became sufficiently serious that as early as 15 february 2020 the world health organization director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus identified that the world was not just fighting an epidemic were fighting an infodemic a component of which related to the propagation of conspiracy theories bogus cures and misinformation about the pandemic the world health organization responded by publishing an extensive list of myth-busters endeavouring to provide counter-information to issues such aswhether there are any drugs licensed for treatment or prevention of covid-19whether adding pepper to food prevents or cures covid-19whether house flies or mosquitoes can transmit covid-19the dangers and ineffectiveness of introduction of bleach or other disinfectantsthe dangers of drinking methanol ethanol or bleachthe inability of 5g networks to spread covid-19exposure to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25c does not prevent coronavirus diseasethe fact that being able to hold breath for more than 10 s does not mean a person is free of covid-19drinking alcohol does not prevent covid-19hot weather hot baths cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirushand-dryers are not effective in killing coronavirusthe use of ultra-violet lamps to disinfect hands and other areas of skinthe detection of covid-19 by thermal scannersthe utility of vaccines against pneumonia in relation to covid-19the effectiveness of regular nasal rinsing with saline against coronavirusthe efficacy of garlic as a prophylactic against covid-19the safety of younger people to covid-19the utility of antibiotics against the new coronavirusthe existence of any specific medications against covid-19 world health organization 2020
 particular risks are posed when market-surveillance on bogus cures is less available in the course of a pandemic as delese darko the chief executive of ghanas food and drug authority has observed in an atmosphere of desperation to explore unorthodox cures in spite of the lom initiative by which many countries in january 2020 pledged to prevent detect and respond to substandard and falsified medical products world health organization 18 january 2020  there could be an influx across porous borders of substandard medical products  including those for covid-19 knott 30 april 2020 this has led to fabricated versions of a number of products including chloroquine another issue is the availability of what have been promoted as covid-19 cures even including blood of allegedly recovered patients iggulden 30 april 2020 marketed on the dark web broadhurst ball  jiang 2020 martin 5 may 2020 although it appears that as of mayjune 2020 such forms of promotion and sale were not extensive they are particularly difficult to regulate effectively there have been some signs that the dark web has been prepared to self-regulate against false cures for covid-19 cuthbertson3 april 2020 but of its nature the dark web is largely unregulated from the outside and its encrypted environment is an ideal vehicle for the unscrupulous to exploit the fearful the desperate and the undiscriminating shah 19 may 2020 a troubling variety of false treatments for covid-19 has been touted by persons of influence including politicians and religious figures in the months after the commencement of the pandemic graham-harrison phillips ellis-peterson  burke 2020 it has been suggested that prominent public figures continue to play an outsized role in spreading misinformation about covid-19 brennen simon howard and nielsen 7 april 2020 in the united states president trumps unscientific enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine remdesivir azithromycin bleach and ultra-violet light is one example in brazil president jair bolsonaro went a step further and ordered the distribution of hydrochloroquine ogrady 23 may 2020 prompting a run on quina tea langlois 4 june 2020 while in belarus president alexander lukashenko propounded the idea of a vodka cure bennetts 29 march 2020 in madagascar president andry rajoelina endorsed the benefits of artemisia annua sweet wormwood a herbal remedy promoted as a treatment for covid-19 which prompted orders from equatorial guinea guinea-bissau niger and tanzania finnan 20 april 2020 nordling 6 may 2020 hirsch 13 may 2020 prompting denunciation by the world health organization regional office for africa as lacking a scientific basis vaughan 15 may 2020 in ghana a popular islamic cleric numerologist and philosopher mallam sham-una uztar jibril proclaimed that he had identified a cure to covid-19 in unspecified roots and leaves found only in saudi arabia and afghanistan i have discovered the cure to the deadly coronavirus  popular islamic cleric 27 february 2020 in iran it was reported that a muslim cleric advocated the application of what he called the prophets perfume under the nose of coronavirus patients in a northern iranian hospital in gilan province in korea the river of grace community church sprayed saltwater in parishioners mouths as a prophylactic agent shim 16 march 2020 cow urine as a covid-19 cure was promoted by a member of the legislative assembly in assam in india nath 2020 hundreds of people attended a gaumutra party sponsored by the hindu mahasabha and in march 2020 bjp mla in assam suman haripriya introduced a variation propagating that cow dung could also destroy covid-19 kundu 2020

covid-19 has been a global phenomenon and that a percentage of the time it has had highly undesirable and sometimes fatal consequences in the united states such consumer protection efforts have been pursued with energy but a wave of e-commerce sites has attempted to attempted to circumvent them selling phantom and bogus products which have made false or exaggerated claims about their capacity to counter covid-19 keller and lorez 24 march 2020 as early as the day after the world health organization designated covid-19 a pandemic new yorks attorney-general sent a cease-and-desist letter to a number of vendors who were passing off colloidal silver as a treatment they included the silver edge company letter officer of the attorney general 11 march 2020 whose micro-particle colloidal silver

harm hes caused any individual company or entity that deceives the public and preys on innocent civilians will pay for their unlawful actions letter office of the attorney general 12 march 2020 in addition the federal justice department directed all 94 united states attorneys to prioritise the investigation and prosecution of coronavirus fraud schemes with the public able to report such frauds to a national center for disaster fraud hotline department of justice 27 march 2020 by mid-april americans were reported to have communicated about us12 million in covid-19-related fraud losses christie and park 11 april 2020 the potential was even raised for those who threatened or attempted to spread covid-19 to be classified as having engaged in federal terrorism offences because of their use of a biological agent a further initiative employed was an order by the environmental protection agency epa in june 2020 to amazon and ebay to stop selling pesticides that made false claims to kill the novel coronavirus it applied to products such as the disinfectant known as virus shut out as well as methylene chloride which is hazardous and already subject to a partial ban in the united states united states environmental protection agency 6 june 2020 the epa also issued an advisory in relation to products making claims to kill coronavirus particularly disinfectants and pesticidal devices united states environmental protection agency may 2020 in the united kingdom too efforts have been made to quell false advertising about medications to prevent treat and cure covid-19 the united kingdoms medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra warned the public not to be fooled by products ranging from self-testing kits to antiviral misting sprays the mhra announced that in the early stages of covid-19 it had disabled nine domain names and social media accounts for selling fake coronavirus-related products and that it was investigating five further cases lynda scammell a senior enforcement advisor to the mhra made the point that there is no medicine licensed specifically to treat or prevent covid-19 therefore any claiming to do so are not authorised and have not undergone regulatory approvals required for sale on the uk market we cannot guarantee the safety or quality of the product and this poses a risk to your health the risk of buying medicines and medical devices from unregulated websites are that you just dont know what you will receive and could be putting your health at risk medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency 4 april

34000 unlicensed and fake products advertised as corona spray coronavirus medicines or coronaviruses packages were seized whilst there were no coronavirus related products found to have reached uk

 another body fined by the tga on this occasion a63000 was oxymed australia pty ltd this arose from alleged contraventions relating to the advertising of hyperbaric oxygen chambers not included in the australian register of therapeutic goods the advertisements made therapeutic claims to treat a range of serious ailments including covid-19 therapeutic goods administration 27 march 2020 for several years the genesis ii church of health and healing promoted a product known as miracle mineral solution mms which was marketed as containing a miracle mineral supplement it contained 28 sodium chlorite a chemical used as a textile bleaching agent and disinfectant in 2014 media reported that ten victorians had been poisoned by mms in the previous five years minear 2014 it reported that victorian poisons information centre specialist dr dawson macleod said that people had reported symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea after using mms with four having to be hospitalised he said it could cause potentially life-threatening illnesses and that the long-term consequences of using mms were not known the president of the australian medical association victorian branch dr tony bartone castigated snake oil salesmen for preying upon vulnerable people with magic potions theres no evidence whatsoever and certainly no clinical trials to suggest this is anything more than bleach it certainly should be banned minear 2014 this prompted the tga to publish an advisory stating that products containing this concentration of sodium chlorite pose a serious health risk if consumed by humans and should be labelled with warnings and the word poison mms is not approved by the tga for any therapeutic use in australia products that are used in the purification or treatment of drinking water and which do not make therapeutic claims are not considered therapeutic goods however based on the media reports the tga is concerned that some people may be using mms to treat illnesses or for other therapeutic purposes using mms in this way will not have any therapeutic benefit and may have toxic effects therapeutic goods administration 13 november 2014 on 13 may 2020 the tga issued twelve infringement notices totalling a151200 for allegedly unlawful advertising of mms and other medicines by southern cross directories pty ltd trading as mms australia stating that there is no clinical scientifically-accepted evidence showing that mms can cure or alleviate any disease the use of mms presents serious health risks and can result in nausea vomiting diarrhoea and severe dehydration which in some cases can result in hospitalisation it stated that its reason for action was alleged contravention of the therapeutic goods act 1989 cth and the therapeutic goods advertising code no 2 2018 in relation to advertisements therapeutic goods administration 13 may 2020 it also issued an advisory to consumers to be alert to misleading claims about mms for the treatment cure prevention or alleviation of disease in humans including covid-19 
mms is often marketed as water purification drops and may be offered under different names including miracle mineral supplement it contains a high concentration of sodium chlorite which is a chemical used as a textile bleaching agent and disinfectant products containing high concentrations of sodium chlorite pose a serious health risk if consumed by humans and should be labelled with the appropriate warnings mms has not been approved by the tga for use to treat cure prevent or alleviate any disease or condition therapeutic goods administration 8 may 2020
 the body fined was associated with the genesis ii church of health and healing its leader mark grenon had written to donald trump the united states president telling him that that chlorine dioxide is a wonderful detox that can kill 99 of the pathogens in the body he added that it can rid the body of covid-19 a few days later at his daily coronavirus briefing at the white house president trump promoted the idea that disinfectant could be used as a treatment for the virus stating that disinfectant knocks it out in a minute one minute he went on to ask a public health official is there a way we can do something by an injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so itd be interesting to check that pilkington 25 april 2020 in a number of countries concern has been expressed about the propagation of a diverse array of forms of false information online in relation to covid-19 in russia for instance investigators were announced to be considering whether to bring a criminal prosecution as a result of a youtube video falsely alleging that organs were being harvested from coronavirus patients for medical treatment of covid-19 prosecutors demand probe into fake news about harvesting of covid-19 patients organs 23 april 2020 in israel a rishon letzion resident allegedly sent a message in the name of the health ministry to his girlfriend who had returned from miami in an effort to get her to self-quarantine he was conveyed for investigation at the cybercrimes unit of the lahav 433 police anti-corruption unit for four crimes including publishing false information to cause fear and panic and transmitting false information he had used software to make his messages look as though they came from the health ministry he sent a message to the woman to quarantine herself and another to her friend telling her to keep her distance beiner 6 april 2020 perhaps the extreme end of repression of fake coronavirus news though raising the risk for government action to constitute an unreasonable contravention of human rights mcdonald 23 march 2020 occurred in cambodia a 14 year-old girl in kampot was detained and compelled to apologise publicly for writing in a message on facebook that there were three people ill with covid-19 at her school and that others had died from the disease vicheika  tum 14 march 2020 a number of factors can create a conducive environment for the making of false claims and communications online in the context of a pandemic anxieties and fears engendered by the pandemic can render people vulnerable especially in an online environment dread of contracting and being harmed by a disease such as covid-19 can be exacerbated by religious associations with pestilences and plagues literary traditions film portrayals and computer game tropes as well as factors such as personality issues educational deficits language limitations social isolation and disabilities alone and in combination such vulnerabilities are apt to be fanned by chronically anxiety-inducing media coverage an outcome is the potential for predatory opportunities to exploit those vulnerable to credulity and the suspension of faculties of discernment the reality of pandemic vulnerability raises the question of how most constructively public health authorities can respond in the context of the covid-19 pandemic to meet both conspiracy theories and therapeutic misrepresentations recent responses by some governments have provided a useful perspective firstly health messaging needs to be communicated in a calm and straightforward tone which does not exacerbate anxieties and irrational fears but rather encourages prudent care-taking conduct secondly there needs to be a continuing flow of medico-scientifically evidence-based education which works toward disabusing members of the community of misunderstandings fears and fallacies which otherwise may gain popular traction and exacerbate paranoid and anxiety pathologies as well as render people more prone to be victimised thirdly there is a need for governments to be assertive in taking preventative and deterrent action against those who are misusing the covid-19 era to enrich themselves opportunistically or to take advantage of those who lack the capacity to be discerning about false claims of capacity to prevent treat or cure the disease for good reason the traditional public health approach to such misrepresentations is to provide a clear warning initially to those responsible for such misinformation in the form of what in the united states are called cease and desist orders however where there is non-compliance in face of such governmental communications robust legal action needs to be initiated with condign imposition of penalties to deter and punish unethical quackery during a pandemic

  medical ethics in disasters james ryan m adriaan hopperus buma pcc charles beadling w aroop mozumder david nott m norman rich m walter henny david macgarty edmund howe g   
to outline the ethical issues that may arise during disasters at both the policy and clinical levelsframeworks and values will be discussed including the limitations of ethical analysisthere will be a focus on allocation of resources psychological reactions of both patients and providers and practical implications for policymakers and practitioners
 disasters frequently create demands that outstrip available existing medical and societal resources this may be particularly problematic for giving medical care because disasters may destroy the infrastructures necessary to both provide patients care and keep new health problems from emerging disaster may for example not only strike care providers and hospital facilities directly they may decimate communities capacities to provide food to the population and carry out critical waste disposal services all these effects may be most important to policymakers and care providers deciding triage priorities during disasters referring to just these two examples food and waste disposal services for instance care providers should treat first not only other care providers who can then take care of others but food preparers and waste disposal personnel likewise to save the most lives these two examples are just a few among many that warrant priority for this same reason this ethical question whom care providers should first treat is perhaps the most profound and controversial ethical question that disasters may pose disasters vary of course widely they include pandemics natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods and nuclear accidents each kind of disaster raises different ethical issues yet many remain common to all this discussion will focus on these common ethical issues it will use infectious disease as the principal paradigm representing other disasters the use of this disaster as a paradigm may be particularly useful because with infectious diseases new ethical problems may arise at different stages over time for instance during pandemics a first task may be to identify people already infected or possibly infected and to then isolate them so that they do not pass on their virus to others next contacts must be reached all such patients must of course also be treated but the numbers infected may increase and indeed multiply every week the discussion that follows will outline ethical issues that can arise during disasters at both the policy and clinical levels initially conflicting frameworks and values will be discussed the limitations of ethical analysis in resolving these conflicts will then be presented since the facts are a first step in ethical analysis possible psychological reactions of both patients and care providers during disasters will next be enumerated these reactions may vary and be quite uncertain both of these considerations may profoundly affect and indeed alter what policymakers and care providers should best do one plan may be best on paper if though in practice this plan is impossible to implement due to particularly peoples emotional reactions the best-laid plans may prove suboptimal ethical concerns involving the allocation of limited resources this most pressing of ethical issues then for all of the reasons stated previously will be the focus of the following discussion specific issues addressed will include also the practice known as tiering which occurs when more patients than are expected continue to arrive over time a scheme based especially on respecting peoples relations with each other posed in new zealand and finally international obligations practical implications for policymakers and clinicians finally will be discussed it will be suggested that although several ethical considerations that arise during disasters remain controversial other ethical guidelines now developed can be quite helpful due to these peoples greater dependency they require more resources thus if they are treated equally in theory fewer lives could be saved from a utilitarian standpoint treating these people equally may then not be warranted yet the principle of justice in the sense of all peoples lives being equal might require that these patients be treated equally even though this end result would most likely be nonutilitarian in its ultimate net effect the ethical principles of utility and justice may then here be in conflict as this example exemplifies however this use of justice is only one of the ways in which justice can be viewed and applied other equally valid meanings of justice are to help most those who are worst off and giving all an equal opportunity to live a full life as will be discussed this last application may support rather than conflict with the principle of utility ethical analysis may then serve to clarify the different ways justice can be applied during disasters this may in turn help clarify what should be done another value preventing harm may mean giving some resources during disasters to relieving patients suffering here justice for those worst off might require providing some care to people greatly suffering even though this might mean that some other patients as a result may die when otherwise they might have lived people unduly subject to suffering might be for example those who are bedridden and thus cant be moved during disasters but require ongoing analgesics for severe pain another most difficult issue is how if at all treatment criteria should change if and when the number of people needing life-saving treatment greatly increases this issue is the one referred to this as tiering other additionally more problematic issues involve finding ways to communicate optimal advice and available resources as equally as possible among poorer persons who may not have the same access to radios and televisions in some contexts andor live in extremely rural settings still others involve limiting individuals freedoms such as by restricting their freedom due to quarantines contact tracing and requiring the reporting of possible transmission of disease a particularly heartfelt additional ethical framework does not involve principles at all instead it primarily involves giving moral weight to people having and maintaining close caring relationships with one another 1 this perspective may be seen as including during disasters keeping people close to one another as in the same family together criteria for who is treated first during triage could however favour treating one family member on utilitarian grounds over another then particularly one family member may survive when another may not this most excruciating ethical dilemma arose in one hospital for example after hurricane katrina due to the flooding that occurred around this hospital only a few patients at a time could be rescued there by rescue boats here then this other moral framework the care perspective might apply thus these frameworks themselves in addition to different moral principles within the traditional framework using ethical principles such as justice and utility may conflict this other framework known as the ethics of care may give greater moral weight to maintaining the relationships between these people by giving a parent and child or husband and wife together greater priority thus in regard to the question who at a hospital stranded by a flood should be the first ones rescued this different framework might give more priority to saving all ones family members over applying usual more abstract ethical principles this second moral framework the care perspective also may apply more when care providers or others must decide when if ever they should put limited resources into relieving patients pain as opposed to saving patients lives here it is important to find some means of relieving patients pain but as just one example sufficient numbers of care providers may no longer be available to both provide pain relief and give life-saving care as another example further supplies of analgesics may no longer exist then some care providers might though be willing to stay behind as when others are being evacuated during a flood they may then devote themselves to relieving the pain of these patients as best they can shalev has said for instance when little can be done it is wise to reduce survivors loneliness 2 a related ethical question which ethical analysis may be unable to resolve is what care providers should do if a patient has severe pain they cant relieve he or she is expected to die no matter what is or isnt done and he or she asks for active euthanasia 3 4 what also should they do if these patients have unbearable pain but they arent competent or are children and what if in this last case the childs parents are present and plead with the care provider to relieve their childs pain by ending the childs lives should the parents requesting this make any difference some of the strongest arguments here are self-evident one value in regard to incompetent patients in extreme pain is for example justice they should have equal access to obtaining pain relief this application of justice may apply even or perhaps especially if they are children 5 children may not understand what they are going through for example and may as a result suffer more moral arguments against these are that life is sacred and in regard to competent adults versus other patients that the former should have at least some autonomy to die as they want a consideration particularly complex is how much moral weight if any should be placed on these patients not understanding why they are in andor being left in extreme pain this lack of understanding could on one hand perhaps be beneficial because these patients wouldnt know that their pain short of death might not be soon resolved this same lack could on the other hand though as already said deprive them of the gains they could have from knowing why care providers cant give them greater relief than they are how these many most difficult questions should be decided is itself of course also a critical question a conventional approach and answer is that these decisions should be made by legislators since they represent the majoritys rule yet ethically this approach may itself be unacceptably problematic this majority may be insufficiently aware of andor responsive to the needs of the few they may therefore be insufficiently sensitive to the needs of the worst off during disasters these people may include those emotionally or physically ill or bedridden as previously considered it may be that in regard to how these decisions are made then in making these prior decisions other approaches more likely to offset this risk should also or instead be carried out these approaches may include for example convening focus groups and other outreach efforts these endeavours should be designed particularly to acquire greater input from those likely to be andor know those who would or might be more disadvantaged during disasters than those closer to the average person among the greater population it is critical for policymakers and clinicians to know when asking these questions what ethical analysis can and cant be expected to offer ethical analysis can show the relative strengths and weaknesses of different arguments and this may help provide better answers but it often cant provide best answers this is because reasonable persons may reasonably differ on which among sound but mutually exclusive core values should prevail an example involving rationing is illustrative as indicated previously an ethical conflict may exist between the principles of justice and utility a most difficult question exemplifying this conflict involves age justice might for example support all persons lives being valued equally whereas utility might give priority not to saving the greatest number of lives but to maximizing the number of years in net effect those persons saved would live this value then might give greater priority to people who are younger the moral weight if any that age should have may then also differ and depend on which meaning of justice is applied that is people could be treated equally but not just in regard to their being able to continue to live they could instead be given equal opportunity to live to an older age according to this use of equity treating a 30-year-old and 80-year-old equally might mean giving priority to the 30-year-old since this would give the 30-year-old more equal access to living to be 80 this second use of justice would accord more with the principle of utility and accordingly add stronger support to the ethical argument for deciding in favour of utility this other second conception of justice has been referred to as the fair innings approach 6 this example of ones considering different possible applications of the principle of justice illustrates how ethical analysis may increase ones capacity to arrive at a better argument and thus how this analysis may make the end result better even though this analysis may not give a right answer a first significant behaviour people may have prior to and during a pandemic is to hoard medications here as in other such situations it could be hoped that people would not hoard treatments this expectation may however not be met as gostin states this altruistic consensus is comforting but may not reflect real behavior in a time of crisiswhich may include hoarding stockpiling and black marketeering 6 if hoarding occurs of course less treatment supplies will be available a second psychological possibility involves family members quarantined in their homes here as gostin declares home quarantines can only be morally justified in contexts where residential units permit asymptomatic individuals to remain confined without imposing risks on those with whom they live 7 family members already exposed may be instructed to remain separate from others not exposed even if family members know the importance of staying apart they may though engage in denial wanting to be with their loved ones they may not comply some people also may all live together in only one room then for them this desired separation may not be feasible if other living arrangements arent possible but they remain together those families who live in just one room may be treated unequally as again gostin says home quarantine can create divisions based on social class because the poor may not have homes adequate to protect the unexposed 7 as both these examples illustrate people may respond during disasters based on their feelings for others this is what of course the ethics of care approach to ethics takes most into account some people during disasters care so much for loved ones that they choose to stay with them even at much greater risk to themselves during floods as those caused by hurricanes for example people may be stranded with family members who are bedridden in their homes then those who could leave may later refuse to they may refuse to enter rescue boats for example because they could not take these family members with them some have even refused to leave pets parents even if adequately informed may also not take appropriate steps during disasters to vaccinate their children they may for instance fear that vaccinations would pose unnecessary risks further when persons are first exposed to an infectious agent they must be identified as potentially contagious one means of early identification may be by detecting a rise in peoples temperature people must not come in for this temperature testing this testing could be involuntary yet if it is not they may due to fear or denial not come in once identified there may be a need for contact tracing to locate and isolate all other persons exposed to a person who is infected as lo states public health investigations require cooperation to identify contactsvoluntary measures generally promote cooperation more than do mandatory ones 8 again it might be hoped that people infected would identify these other people but they may not here they may fear stigma or feel shame perhaps the greatest psychological concern that should be taken into account by policymakers and care providers before and during disasters is that people may panic 9 in 1995 in the democratic republic of the congo in response to ebola for example neighbours feared that even care providers and their families might be infected these neighbours reportedly then burned their homes 9 449 all these possible psychological responses suggest the need for appropriate preventive antidotes to the degree that these can be implemented in an effort to prevent panic for example due attention must be put in advance to achieving optimal true but reassuring communication 10 emphasis should be placed on informing the public as fully as possible what is being done for example to reduce this panic there is a tendency for people not faced with a crisis on the other hand to at this time overlook its importance to them resources should be allocated in advance therefore also to try to help overcome this source of resistance so that the public can respond in the most effective as well as calmest way possible if and as a pandemic occurs those responsible for having and making key resources available during a pandemic should do what is necessary then to be adequately prepared this preparation includes stockpiling medications having plans for delivering them and anticipating how this can be best accomplished so that those more disadvantaged such as groups in outlying areas can be adequately reached a gain from the practice of carrying out mock preparations for a disaster such as a hurricane drill is that institutions may find out that their plan is workable this knowledge may have the desirable secondary effects of increasing both care providers and the publics confidence that such a disaster can be survived at this same time that there is this need to plan and perhaps also carry out mock measures there is a need when disasters such as again hurricanes threaten to not implement these plans prematurely an example here is when the real likelihood of a hurricanes striking a precise area is extremely remote it would be possible in all such instances to institute full evacuation procedures at once this could save lives but also effect extraordinary costs reasonable criteria regarding when these responses should be triggered must be established beforehand on the basis of the best evidence available ethically though there is no place here for high-stake gambling it is better here to be safe than sorry during disasters care providers should be able to offer emotional support to their patients to the degree that they can even and especially when their patients are having most severe reactions when for example patients were feeling the panic previously described due to fear that they would acquire ebola in the belgian congo care providers should have when possible sought to continue to see that these reactions are misguided but self-protective behaviours so that with this accurate understanding of these patients these care providers would remain most able to help them 9 still care providers may of course be beset by feelings beyond their control in the democratic republic of the congo at this time for instance care providers felt fear fifty-five percent feared having pain and suffering 53  feared a horrible death 41  feared being separated from their loved ones and 23  feared being abandoned 9 during the sars outbreaks that occurred throughout the world between november 2002 and july 2003 as another example care providers feared that they too might also acquire sars and that they too could inadvertently spread sars to their families sars could be acquired from patients through respiratory droplets when they were within 6 ft of patients with sars in one sars ward in toronto 90  of the ward nursing staff became infected in a hospital in china 17 medical students acquired sars after doing physical exams on sars-infected patients 11 care providers detecting and treating patients with sars also had to try to determine whether a patients fever was or wasnt due to sars they knew that if they were wrong this could result in several peoples lives possibly being lost due to sars this one instance of undetected sars then could also continue to not be identified and go on to spread the infection care providers had to screen numerous people likely to have been exposed so that they could separate those who might have sars from others these fears in addition to those for themselves and for their families are obviously most distressful care providers during disasters also may find it highly stressful to not be able to treat patients as they would under normal circumstances 12 even when resources are available care providers may not be able to obtain adequate follow-up for patients 13 another source of stress for care providers during disasters is that their role or roles may be unclear although ideally an experienced triage officer is designated it may fall to the individual clinician to make allocation decisions until order is restored 14 their roles may conflict if they serve both the roles of triaging and treating patients for example as indicated in this statement when triaging they may be the one deciding to treat or not to treat a patient only later in a treatment role to be responsible for providing the same patient care bursztajn and brodsky two psychiatrists sought to study how care providers cope in what they hoped was a sufficiently analogous situation a conflicting triage context to be generalizable to their behaviour during disasters they studied care providers having such conflicting duties in a managed care setting they found not surprisingly that care providers feel conflicted care providers may regard their primary allegiance to be to the patient but may as a result of this inadvertently abandon their fiduciary duties this may in turn undermine the doctor-patient alliance this alliance they speculate is a protective factor in care providers being able to better bearing their feelings of uncertainty and grief 15 care providers may alternatively be so committed to their alliance with individual patients that they do not fully support allocation policies they may even choose out of loyalty to patients they have known and seen for years to store meds for them even when this might mean that they would not be able to distribute them more equally as public policies might require to others later their doing this would be seen as unconscionable from a traditional principled point of view since they would be violating justice in order to favour the interests of their own patients over those of others as lo states physicians who urge an exception for a particular patient should also be willing to support an exception for other similar patients 8 from an ethics of care perspective however this might not be at least so self-evidently or unequivocally ethically wrong care providers doing this could be viewed as even if violating more important values at least fulfilling their traditional commitment and an implicit promise to their patients to continue to put their interests first some of their patients might in fact expect this this dilemma of whether to treat all patients according to objective criteria to the degree that this is plausible during a disaster is best illustrated perhaps in regard to children this is also presently still controversial there is first here a question of whether care providers more subjective medical judgments should play any role here and if so how much these subjective medical judgments may be more potentially problematic in regard to children it is argued since children tend to evoke exceptional empathy thus some report that in general during triage children may be overly triaged or placed into groups such that care providers will treat them with greater priority than they should based solely on the severity of condition 16 17 there is also present controversy on an altogether different theoretical level people disagree on whether care providers should in general give children greater priority over others less or the same priority from a utilitarian perspective they will live longer yet if they are treated equally this will further more the principle of justice or equity if applied in this way some argue even that only children of a given age such as teenagers should be prioritized they assert that the death of an adolescent is a greater loss than that of a toddler or infant 18 children clearly have unique needs their body surface area-to-mass ratio and decreased subcutaneous tissue make them for example medically more vulnerable to hypothermia they also may be less able to communicate their needs and wants an additional problem involving children and more particularly their parents exceptional feelings for them noted previously is how care providers can determine accurately such answers as how long a child  much less any patient  has been infected when these answers may determine whether they will be treated and thus possibly whether this patient lives or dies one means of determining the duration of a patients infection is for example to ask when did you or your child first have this cough a care provider asking a patient this question might choose not to divulge why he or she is asking this question this ethically may be regarded rightfully as implicit deception by omission care providers may want to view this in other ways but the validity of any other view is open to question some ethical choices such as this one unfortunately involve extreme and painful ethical and emotional costs this situation may be then highly problematic for some care providers for both this reason and because the stakes here for patients are so high how patients answer may determine in triage situations as ive said whether they live or die if indeed care providers ask this same question to many patients andor parents over time these patients and parents may come to know prior to these care providers asking them what the consequences of their different answers likely will be thus care providers may for this reason feel that they should lie they may believe rightly that from the standpoint of utility if they do lie more patients will fare better this may of course make this situation more problematic for care providers who dont lie as well for these kinds of reasons then also it may be preferable for care providers to treat patients only on the basis of objective findings to the degree of course that this is possible these bases might not include then parents statements of how long their children have been stricken patients also then would not be placed in the position of having to decide whether to lie as parents might especially feel that they should and must to try to most help their children another psychological concern regarding care providers is the extent if any to which they will sacrifice the needs of their families for the public good they as others might want greatly to put their loved ones needs first this may mean to some that they should stay with them as opposed to going to work to help far larger numbers of patients a question posed regarding this is what if any sanctions should be brought against care providers who during disasters place their own families interests above patients by not coming in to work at their hospitals but instead remaining at their homes one view is that care providers being care providers should be trusted to put their patients first another view is that care providers not coming in should lose their medical licence to practice in light of these stresses some physicians who have treated patients with sars afterwards formulated ten lessons for future doctors treating patients during pandemics to share what they had learned one lesson was this during disasters mental health resources should be made available to both patients and staff 19 the primary ethical issue here is who among many should have greater priority for receiving limited medical supplies clearly to enhance a populations overall survival it is necessary to treat first those who serve most critical functions they must remain healthy to be able to help others thus the paradigmatic example of whom care providers should treat first is other care providers who provide direct care but those who serve essential functions include many more groups these people include for example other first responders such as ambulance fire and humanitarian assistance personnel security persons such as police national guard and i would argue now especially after 911 military personnel those who provide essential products and services involving water food and pharmaceutical supplies those maintaining critical infrastructures such as transportation utilities and communication and those maintaining sanitation such as undertakers cemetery workers and waste removal personnel among others 6 this group includes also those responsible for continuing government functions these people include key persons in executive legislative and judicial systems and those who support them 6 beyond those in these groups however the questions of priority become more taxing one approach is here for example to protect most more vulnerable groups such as the very old and very young as already in part mentioned since this in some regard most respects all peoples dignity though this at the same time violates utility factually though these groups may actually not be those most vulnerable seasonal influenza disproportionately burdens infants and the elderly but highly pathogenic strains may affect young adults as occurred with spanish flu 6 the elderly are more vulnerable but they also will benefit less as said because they will not have as long to live still even though this statement is valid peoples age may not of course reflect their actual health thus making cut-offs on the basis of age alone is ethically significantly problematic justice as stated here also may be applied in different ways an 80-year-old could have the same access to treatment as someone 30 based on justice but the fair innings principle might favour care providers treating younger adults children and pregnant women first another more vulnerable group is the poor the poor may be disadvantaged relative to other groups for many reasons as said for example they may relative to other people better off lack the same access to the media which may inform the public where they should go and when if poorer people receive less information or receive it in a less timely manner they will be disadvantaged accordingly as stated the poor may also be disadvantaged if they live in smaller homes they may in addition suffer more also for other reasons if quarantined for example they may have a greater need for lost income they also may not be in positions in which they can as easily take time off and still get paid a final example of a disadvantage the poor may experience may occur if they must travel to be at the front of a queue of people getting treatment policies may follow a first-come first-served principle if and when this is the case poor persons may lack equal access to transportation they may for example have to make several bus transfers to travel across a city this may take more time than others take this may allow others to arrive first and thus be before them in a queue perhaps the most troubling more specific ethical problem raised at least in theory by a pandemic is the question alluded to previously what if the number of patients stricken increases over time and is more than was initially expected suppose respirators are initiated on a small number of patients at first should this treatment be stopped after it has begun if the lives of more patients could be saved as a result of freeing-up these same resources if so how many more patients likely to be saved would this require three times as many ten times as many stopping these respirators to save more patients lives is known as the tiering approach under this approach the criterion for deciding who can receive treatment may become stricter over time as the number of patients infected becomes greater moreover ethically saving the most lives then may mean having to withdraw resources from patients who are stable or even improving 21 should this be done a first question here is as always practical would patients their loved ones andor society accept this if the public receives prior information and education regarding the rationales for this approach it may be that people could more readily accept this if it becomes necessary at some points however people may find such rationing schemes unacceptable even if they previously have been informed it may be though that this need for respirators wouldnt in some circumstances have to come about it may be that volunteers could manually squeeze airbags to breathe for these patients it may take just two volunteers taking turns to accomplish this 22 this possibility raises again in this different context the possible relevance of the ethics of care the national ethics advisory committee neac in new zealand recently in 2006 put forth a document stating its basic ethical aspirations during a pandemic for the publics response 23 this document stressed the importance of giving exceptional priority to peoples relationships the neac there in general puts the community first 24 the neac would for example send volunteers to rural people to rescue them when necessary it would also send volunteers to peoples houses when they couldnt be reached by phones it would also seek to make up for past wrongs to a group there called the mori that occurred in a prior pandemic in 1918 it would give this group priority during disasters the ethical principle it would enact here is compensatory justice 26 here a support team would also help staff cope with its many demands further since staff would take on greater risks as risking their contracting influenza due to caring for patients treatments for staff would have priority if this occurred people would also in this event contact and specially support these care providers families and express their exceptional appreciation of staff taking on this additional risk 2 the public would be informed of all this this priority is not however without bounds if other patients needs are significantly greater than those of staff members these other patients needs will prevail 2 how finally here would the neac resolve triage conflicts when some can receive medical care but others cant this determination would be made on the basis of who would most benefit and if this cant be determined decided on a random basis those making these decisions would not however discriminate against people with disabilities rather extra support would be provided to those who take on exceptional responsibility for others 2 this document states explicitly that policies that are constructed with able people in mind potentially disadvantage those with disabilities thus this document recognizes and acknowledges that especially during a pandemic people with disabilities may be particularly vulnerable to being further disadvantaged by policies unless special consideration is given to avoiding this outcome 2 in a pandemic all persons are at risk but those living in more remote areas may have less direct access to treatment as stated they may also though be at less risk of exposure than others thus even though these persons may in this first way be at greater risk their greater relative safety from becoming infected may offset this the same amount of resources may then ideally perhaps be initially provided to different places in the same city that have similar population densities one approach to dividing resources after a pandemic begins then is to determine subsequently all these same areas needs on an ongoing regular basis such that if and when there are disparities resources can be shifted from places doing better to those places not doing as well ethically analogously better-off countries should consider other nations that have greater needs these countries may also lack the same means to help themselves as gostin states this really can have devastating consequences for resource-poor countries that cannot compete economically for expensive countermeasures 6 the ethically highest road any country can take may be to help other nations even though this is to some degree to the detriment of ones own citizens here the practical limiting factor may be of course what the people in the better-off country will tolerate people may though be more willing to make such sacrifices if they are better informed here though as with mock hurricane drills there is again a real factor regarding what risks can be anticipated by other countries and what is their likelihood here again the facts and in this case the uncertainty of these facts may be even in theory as important in determining what a better-off country should do as any other factor there are in the view of gostin an eminent lawyer and ethical authority in this area five major ethical principles that policymakers should particularly take into account when designing policies to be implemented during disasters 7 the first principle as noted is utility this principle typically involves saving the greatest number of lives some additional values not based on consequences should possibly prevail an example already considered is the value of justice another is respecting persons as by telling them the truth keeping promises to them and insuring that they are adequately informed an example in another non-disaster context illustrating how important these latter deontological or non-consequence-based values is our present practices when doing research a person cannot be enrolled in a protocol against his or her will since this would violate this persons autonomy despite the possible gain to others likewise it may be also that during disasters some similar dis-utilitarian outcomes should be absolute and built in an example might be an absolute prohibition against active euthanasia another example mirroring the new zealand model might be equally treating people dependent on others this might be done despite its foreseeable result of saving fewer lives the second principle is to respect peoples dignity as indicated already here though it may be that utilitarian concerns still should prevail even when there is only a threat of great harm to many this precautionary principle holds that there is an obligation to protect populations against reasonably foreseeable threats even under conditions of uncertainty 7 here though there is also an ethical requirement that the least restrictive or least intrusive alternative that will still achieve the same objective should be implemented 7 an example is this during pandemics peoples interest in privacy though important is of only secondary importance the third principle of utmost importance is that of justice also considered earlier justice requires that the benefits and burdens of public health action be fairly distributed 7 here as an example already discussed people who are poor may have less direct access to acquiring protective medications andor treatments again compensatory practices may be adopted though these too might go against achieving maximal utility the fourth principle is what gostin refers to as procedural justice or fairness procedural justice requires a fair and independent hearing for individuals who are subjected to burdensome public health action 7 an example here is that people shouldnt be subject to undergoing personal harm without their having access at some time to making an appeal people during a disaster may for example as stated lose income if they stop work to care for members of their family if this occurs it may be that they should be able to appeal for compensation as on the ground that if they hadnt cared for a family member at this time he or she would have gone without it the fifth principle which gostin sees as non-negotiable is transparency this principle requires all institutions including government officials and care providers to make decisions in an open and fully accountable manner 7 a foremost rationale for transparency is that if a policy is unfair this requirement allows other people to better review this then as a result practices later can be changed ethically also of course this respects all people maximally by keeping them more fully informed groups should then be made available to provide these reviews and these groups should be balanced the judgments they make should not reflect of course a tyranny of experts 24 care providers must care for their own physical and emotional needs to be able to best care for others their psychological needs are like their patients thus they may be best able to reduce their intensity by attending to such personal physical needs as being warm fed and safe from danger 32 care providers also may fare psychologically better if through planning they are as prepared as they can be and thus gain comfort from this belief 33 they should not though try to be heroes because their being too courageous during disasters can actually prevent the providers from being able to do all for their patients how during disasters care providers often are an overlooked highly stressed group they may be expected to carry on in ideal ways by those whom they treat these ideal ways include for instance their being able to bear being away from their families without worrying their always being good to their patients and their not having the need to express their own worries fear and even despair 33 further during disasters care providers may feel it is right and indeed only right for them to help their patients as much as they can 10 thus they may continue to do this even when they themselves need sleep food and time for respite care providers should for this reason it is advised arrange to have a buddy this buddy can tell those when necessary that they need to stop treating these patients for any or all of these reasons these buddies in turn should have some preparation for serving in this role themselves they should for example be prepared to accept that their asking these care providers to sleep eat and take these times off may result in these care providers at these moments resenting them 10 care providers should also as noted not accept taking on potentially conflicting roles such as triaging and treating if possible if they perform these conflicting roles patients may be more likely to perceive them as being more willing to betray their interests by switching back to meeting the needs of the many if these care providers see this as necessary at a later time 34 their greater patients distrust of them may be as stressful as any other factor disasters may pose unique ethical dilemmas care providers analyzing some of these dilemmas prior to their occurring may help suggest ways in which they can be best resolved or at least help prepare them for what may occur policymakers likewise by anticipating these problems may be better able to reduce them these analyses usually wont though provide right answers rather reasonable persons will still reasonably disagree then what may be important and indeed most important is that these disagreements are decided in a way that many or most see as sound and fair such analyses may on some occasions however suggest outcomes that may go against common logic they may suggest for example that care providers triage people during disasters in a less than the most utilitarian way this may involve their not pursuing only the greatest good for the greatest number they may give instead some moral weight to values not based only on consequence such as their respecting patients and treating them justly they may even not give priority to ethical principles at all they rather may give priority to an ethics of care  the december 2019 new corona virus disease sars-cov-2 outbreak a behavioral infectious disease policy model the december 2019 new corona virus disease sars-cov-2 outbreak a behavioral infectious disease policy model jeroen struben  since the december 2019 coronavirus sars-cov-2 outbreak began to spread globally significant variation has emerged and sustained among countries responses and successes we outline a flexible behavioral dynamic and sectorial epidemic model of both virus transmission dynamics and endogenous policy and citizen responses the model allows exploring distinct policy interventions comprising general and targeted testing and social contact reduction efforts calibrating the model to the ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic at the level of continents we demonstrate how the early and extensive buildup of testing and social contact reduction efforts interplay to suppress the outbreak further through a synthetic dynamic analysis of virus resurgence and of stratified case severity across population segments we show the importance of targeted approaches for effectively reducing the multifaceted impacts of the outbreak finally to aide critical collective involvement of policymakers volunteers citizens and media for successfully controlling outbreaks as these a version of the model is also available as a free web-based management flight simulator  response to the progression of the outbreak populations alter their social contacts and how policymakers and health experts ramp up testing and reporting and implement policies related to social distancing the model differentiates reactive and proactive testing approaches as well as differentiates interventions such as general population social distancing home confinement of suspected populations and quarantining of positive cases detected importantly in the model as in real life citizens and policy makers respond to reported -not actual -data of a progressing virus outbreak each of these behaviors in turn alters the outbreak path itself the model tracks key epidemic variables over time including the population within the various epidemic stages and the reproductive number -the average number of secondary cases that one case generates over the course of its infectious period as well as clinical data hospitalizations deaths and behavioral data such as the degree of social contacts and home-confined population reported versus actual cases etc the model is generic in the sense that it can be used to explore how the dynamics change depending assumptions related to infectious diseases such as sars hiv h1n1 and h5n1 influenza and ebola 1 as well as can handle differing assumptions about citizen and policy behavior across populations within and across socio-demographic segments here we use the model to explore both current questions about managing the december 2019 sars-cov-2 outbreak and future questions about managing resurgence we develop a baseline run that calibrates the most important parameters against the rapidly developing data and literature on the ongoing sars-cov-2 outbreak roser ritchie and ortiz-ospina 2020 dong du and gardner 2020 the lancet 2020  disaggregating our baseline at the level of continents we demonstrate how differences in early and extensive testing and extensive social contact reduction measures interplay and can explain different outbreak pathways across regions we also highlight the challenge of catching up once falling behind in curtailing the outbreak we then use the model to perform synthetic dynamic analysis of virus resurgence and of differential eg age-related vulnerability to the virus across population segments we show the importance of targeted approaches for effectively reducing the multifaceted impacts of the outbreak while stylized the model demonstrates the fundamental complex dynamics of infectious diseases caused by both virus transmission and human behavior powerful positive feedbacks that accelerate infections combine with delays in infection detectability inertia in the buildup of testing capabilities and with challenges in rapidly limiting human contacts together these factors lay the ground for the risks associated with wait-and-see approaches to epidemic outbreaks in showing these interdependencies the model further helps understand how swift and comprehensive responses can reduce the impact of epidemic outbreaks in clarifying these endogenous dynamics our model provides insights that are fundamentally different from but complement policy models that study interventions as exogenous shocks kissler et al 2020  by allowing the exploration of different intervention strategies through endogenous behavior -from social distancing advice to self-home confinement  and enforced quarantine we provide a general quantitative framework for better understand under what conditions measures are critical for successful reversing epidemic growth if applied efficaciously at an early stage of an outbreak or during the later stage of resurgence management finally because much of the success depends on collective involvement from not only experts but also policy makers local volunteers citizens and media that all need to better understand these dynamics a version of the model has been coupled to a free online behavioral infectious disease simulator struben 2020  that enables users to explore the impact of government and citizen responses and how they could alter the course of a pandemic in the remainder we provide a short background of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak the responses and of the existing relevant literature we then and perform a number of calibrated and stylized simulations to demstrate the value of the model we end by discussing next steps from december 31 2019 march 3 2020 a total of 44 patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in china on january 07 2020 a new type of coronavirus was isolated by the chinese ministry of health soon the chinese ministry of health reported the cases exposure history to the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan the second week of january 2020 other countries identified confirmed cases related to traveling overseas including japan thailand south korea reported cases went from over 150 thousand by mid-march to over 125 m on april 6th with over 65 thousand reported deaths in a total of 180 countries roser ritchie and ortiz-ospina 2020 korean cdcs 2020   the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 earlier provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov is thought to spread from person to person through droplets and contacts when a person with the virus coughs or sneezes and by touching objects contaminated with the virus then touching ones eyes nose or mouth sars-cov-2 causes the respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019  hereafter we solely use the acronym sars-cov-2 indicating either main symptoms include diverse symptoms from respiratory infections ranging from mild to severe such as fever malaise cough shortness of breath and pneumonia in addition phlegm sore throat headache hemoptysis nausea and diarrhea also appear elderly immunocompromised patients and patients with underlying medical comorbidities are most likely to be in critical condition or die from the virus best current estimates suggest a case fatality rate cfr for sars-cov-2 of about 1-2 shim et al 2020 who 2020b  much larger than the order of 01 for a moderate seasonal influenza yet there is still much uncertainty about this number because of the often limited testing capabilities and endogenous factors such as hospital overload ghaffarzadegan and rahmandad 2020  further estimating the cfr requires information about the number infected the denominator yet this number is hard to detect because of the large number of cases with mild andor flu-like symptoms for example about 80 of people with sars-cov-2 has mild or no symptoms while 20 has severe symptoms with about a third of those latter group becoming critically ill ecdc 2020 the extent of an epidemic outbreak is affected by key virus transmission parameters estimating values of parameters such as infectious contacts and duration of infectivity is of critical interest to those seeking to impact this anderson et al 2020  compared to influenza or ebola transmission is rapid due too high infectivity the duration of the infectious period for sars-cov-2 is estimated to be 5-10 days zou et al 2020  after an incubation period of 2-14 55 average days the incubation period for sars-cov-2 is about 5-6 days li et al 2020  the fundamental metric transmissibility of a virus the basic reproduction number r0 -representing the number of people infected during once infectivity at the first infection -is estimated to be on the order of 24-33 quite higher than that for seasonal flus or ebola chowell et al 2004  but lower than for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars lipsitch et al 2003 read et al 2020 walker et al 2020  estimates using this reproduction number suggest that globally an unmitigated sars-cov-2 epidemic would lead to about 70 billion infections walker et al 2020  given the case fatality estimates this could potentially result in resulting in 40 million deaths an unmitigated scenario while important as reference is unrealistic because transmission rates decline as no matter how governments and citizens will respond as reported cases and deaths accumulate leading to reduced contacts however with such a high basic reproduction number outcomes must be seen in not only the total number of deaths but also the peak load on the health systems and the risks of resurgence therefore key policy questions are what set of responses and their timings help manage the outbreak path in the short and longer run ferguson et al 2020 pueyo 2020  and at what cost eichenbaum et al 2020  responses in asia south korea hong kong singapore mainland china and to some extent japan show that active policy measures such as quarantine social distancing and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic who 2020b while the outbreak has been contained within multiple countries through early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals in many other countries this has not been the case 2 to illustrate consider the outbreak and responses across three continents  figure 1  the three graphs show respectively cumulative reported cases per million people pmp cumulative tests performed pmp and metrics of social activities starting from the day of the first case reported case to the who december 31 2019 time  0 in the figure until april 8 time  100 the first reported cases within south korea italy the first known epicenter in europe and united states occurred all within one day january 18-19 2020 figure 1  top left initially reported cases were much higher in south korea suggesting it had become an epicenters however the fate of the countries differed considerably during the following 90 days whereas in south korea reported cases stabilized under 200 pmp by early march in italy by the end of march it was at 1700 cases pmp whereas in the united states by the end of march there were already 527 reported cases pmp case reporting however is not independent from case testing in south korea it took 43 days to get from the first reported case to 2500 tests pmp at which point there were 68 reported cases ppm italy reached 2500 tests pmp 15 days later with reported cases ppm at 291 ppm  the united states reached this on march 27 26 days later than south korea at which point there were 260 steeply growing cases ppm with exceptions such as iceland testing has lagged more in many other countries ----------figure 1 about here ------------south koreas approach reflects a more proactive approach beyond just testing in particular south korea has focused on early detection of persons at risk and so to identify and then isolate the virus korean cdcs 2020 as part of this south korea implemented a policy of early and widespread identification of suspected cases through targeted testing and isolation of suspected cases -family members and through contact tracing those that are thought to have been in close contact with positive cases the quarantining and monitoring of positive and suspected cases involves follow up according to specific protocol and timing finally efforts are done to build capacity of local government build systems of cooperation between affiliated organizations and educate and raise public awareness among the community korean cdcs 2020 in europe confinement policies have been implemented but often much more slowly yet they have more focused on confinement of the general population italys general lockdown commenced in the center and was gradually expanded to northern provinces march 8 in the united states despite urging from public health experts by eatly april some states and counties have taken limited action with beaches and restaurants still open axelrod 2020  indeed social activity has taken much more time to slow in europe and north america figure 1  bottom showing short term air bb lettings and mobility trends for places like public transport hubs such as subway bus and train stations  these contrasting results suggest that a mixture of interventions are considered to affect outcomes research suggests the importance of not only testing and general social distancing as often practiced in epidemic outbreaks jefferson et al 2008  but also more targeted approaches fraser et al 2004 wong et al 2016  yet outcomes will be very sensitive to the actual actions taken some of which depend on specific regional conditions we develop a computational model of infectious disease outbreak dynamics that captures the distributions of times to symptoms and infectiousness for the etiological agent concerned and consistent with earlier theoretical studies but that is also sensitive to the socio-behavioral complexity of policies and citizen response the model focuses on an infectious disease outbreak throughout its epidemic period while the main focus of the model is highlighting interactions among key policy levers and citizen responses and with virus transmission dynamics transmission and behavior can be affected considerably by geographic and by socio-demographic conditions for example the perceived severity of the outbreak at which policy makers and citizens begin to respond to the outbreak -differs by region and is in the baseline lower for the early asian countries than for others regions to allow exploring key sensitivities to demographic variation he model disaggregates into n demographic segments these sections can be used to represent geographical regions such as continents countries provinces for example as long they are sufficiently large so that individual contacts are less important the sectors can also be used to represent different socio-demographic segments older versus younger populations vulnerable versus less vulnerable groups within a geographic region in what follows we highlight only the key model concepts structures and variables figure 2 provides a high level overview likewise the accompanying figures show simplified representations of the model sections the online appendix 3 appendix a1 lists the model equations in the same sequencing as below and provide additional visuals the model itself is also available for download ----------figure 2 about here ------------ the core of the model forms a classic epidemiological compartmental model called the susceptible-exposed -infectious symptomatic-recovered seir model  figure 3  commonly used by epidemiologists hethcote 2000  the infectious population transmits the virus to susceptible population within demographic segment d   4 through infectious contacts at infection rate       infectious contacts may come from the symptomatic population in any demographic segment d  as well as from exposed population  being in contact with susceptible population at contact rates    and   the contact rate of the exposed population the contact rate prior to the outbreak forms a reference for variation in social contacts across population segments and time those with symptoms tend to have lower contact rates than those without if you feel sick you tend to stay at home more even absent any awareness of a virus outbreak further contacts change over time in response to the outbreak infectious contacts further depend on infectivity the probability of infection given contact between a symptomatic and an infected person while infectivity of the he symptomatic population   tends to be higher than of the exposed population   viral load measures suggest that in the case of the sars-cov-2 infectivity commences before the onset of first symptoms ferguson et al 2020 pan et al 2020 zou et al 2020   then the virus transmission simplified form is given by 5   0                  1  where    are equal to the contacts within segment  adjusted with relative cross-segment contacts            infected people remain exposed during a latent or incubation period  at which point they may begin to show symptoms details of a more disaggregated symptomatic stage including parameters marked with  are discussed below subsequently depending on the case lethality fraction those in the symptomatic stage either recover or die after figure 3 right ----------figure 3 about here ------------ the structure of the symptomatic population is further disaggregated figure 4  highlighting that symptoms may vary considerably across those infected ecdc 2020  only a small fraction of those infected has severe symptoms defined here as those requiring hospitalization those with severe symptoms progress from a pre-hospitalization stage time to hospitalization 9  to the hospitalization stage time to recover from hospitalization   after which they either recover or die depending on the actual not reported lethality fraction of the severe cases  all of the mild cases recover after a time to recover   ----------figure 4 about here ------------infectivity can differ from symptoms early research suggests that viral load is fairly constant for a period of time defining the average days infectious explicitly as the period during which people exhibit symptoms and possess the infectivity virus transmission depends not only on exogenous virus-related transmission parameters but also on behavioral responses from citizens and policy makers as they respond as they perceive a more severe outbreak as the population adjusts social contacts infectious contacts and transmission change too in the model social contacts by the symptomatic population as well 5 this is a simplified representation of the virus transmission rate in the model the stocks of exposed and symptomatic populations are each disaggregated into different stocks with different contact rates for example part of either stock population segment may be quarantined or home isolated discussed below further average infectivity needs to be adjusted for the fraction of the various symptomatic populations that are infectious  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

of a perceived outbreak  figure 5  the population in the symptomatic state may reduce contacts in four ways i positive tested detected cases admitted to hospitals or detected elsewhere being quarantined quarantined ii undetected being associated with detected cases through targeted search being home-isolated suspected symptomatic cases being home-confined iv undetected symptomatic cases reducing contacts voluntarily or urged by governments beyond what they prefer because of sickness symptomatic contact reduction iv undetected cases reducing voluntarily or urged by governments general

population may reduce contacts in two ways i undetected cases being associated with detected cases and home-isolated suspected exposed cases being homeconfined  ii undetected cases reducing social contacts voluntarily or urged by governments general social distancing in the model aggregate social contacts for both the exposed and symptomatic population forms a weighted sum across populations subjected to the respective contact constraints further the effects are multiplicative for example the combined contact reduction effect  for someone being both home confined with effect   and subject to social distancing with effect   equals  1-1-  1-  indicated contacts for the symptomatic population example then are where a is the normal contact rate of the exposed population is the relative contact rate of symptomatic population compared to the normal contact rate of the exposed population the endogenous contact reduction effects adjust to indicated levels those quarantined and home-confined adjust contacts as they are being transferred to their new state contact reductions for those within their state adjust changing indicated levels of social distancing over adjustment time d  for example for social distancing  adjusts to the level indicated by social distancing  finally the newly symptomatic population adjust behavior of the symptomatic population over time this adjustment of contacts towards symptomatic behavior is captured through a co-flow structure sterman 2000  the adjustment of contact reduction through each of the above contact reduction responses depends the perceived outbreak level   relative to the reference breakout level hq  the actual responses depend on three factors first the sensitivity to an increase in the perceived outbreak captures heterogeneity in responsiveness to the perceived severity of the outbreak second there are limits to how much each response is able to reduce contacts this limit may come from implementation challenges quarantining may still lead to health worker infection enforceability limits home isolation is not defined properly practical limits those being home-isolated still need to go out to buy groceries or simply because not everybody complies for the social distancing effect   with  sensitivity and maximum contact reduction st the formulation is  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is

preprint as policymakers and citizens alter their behavior in response to the severity of the perceived outbreak and so affect virus transmission rates they respond to reported not actual data about positive tests and deaths media and experts report different metrics about the virus but reported absolute cases and deaths tend to dominate the media and affect population behaviour xiao et al 2015  we formulate the perceived outbreak level  as a weighted function of the reported deaths  and reported cumulative cases         1       with  weights of reported deaths case testing follows two main approaches reactive and proactive first reactive testing is driven by the symptoms occurring under the currently undetected symptomatic population de omitting demographic index d within any of the states       -either the early or advanced for mild or severe cases  figure 4  this happens when the population either self-reports their symptoms or is hospitalized with symptoms the reactive testing process for all states i is identical appendix figure a 1 visualizes the testing process for hospitalized population advanced-severe  positive tests equal the fraction of actual cases tested d times the case detection fraction  and the fraction of actual tests being positive d   d  d  second proactively experts can perform field tests provided available capacity there are two types of field tests sampling and targeted testing indicated by index     appendix figure a 2 shows the relations targeted testing may involve methods such as contact tracing testing and occurs within a small targeted sample of the population with relatively high likelihood of positive case detection however this approach requires efforts identifying potential positive cases tracing this back requires effort in addition for contract tracing to be effective a sufficient large amount of amount of positively tested cases need to be traced positive testing over time to identify and test potential case j

immunity loss rate is switched off for the purpose of this analysis to illustrate the value of the model for policy analysis and to demonstrate its flexibility we perform three different experiments the first involves the construction and analysis of a baseline case that builds through calibration on the actual sars-cov-2 outbreak in the second experiment we perform a sensitivity analysis of this baseline case centered on policy and citizen responses to the outbreak in the third experiment we perform an analysis about managing resurgence by lifting social distancing policies using hypothetical

-table 1 about here ----------------------table 2 about here ------------ figure 6a shows the resulting simulation run of the cumulative reported and actual and for the relevant time horizon the data on reported cases for asia europe and north america reported cases are on average about 19 of actual that is -on average 19 of cases are detected 6 figure 6b provides more details about the underlying dynamics showing a number of different indicators of the outbreak including related to case detection the top left graph in figure 6b shows see that the reporting fraction for the mild cases is much lower than for severe cases 15-25 versus about 90 asia has a higher detection fraction of the mild cases than the other regions this is in part the result of proactive -field-based -testing and monitoring the top left graph shows the social contacts for exposed population reducing due to social distancing and to some degree home confinement of targeted policies mostly in asia as more cases get detected governments and citizens respond and reduce action asia has a strong sensitivity of social distancing to the outbreak and hence a strong balancing feedback loop b3 figure 5  however the slopes in contact reduction do not differ much across regions this is because the weaker response in europe and north america has the effect to increase transmissions in turn inducing a stronger response than is needed in asia ----------figure 6 about here ------------infectious contacts together with transmission delays incubation time -the time before symptoms begin to appear -and duration of infectivity -of the symptomatic population determine how many people an infectious person infects during its infectivity affecting the likelihood and extent of the epidemic outbreak the basic reproductive number r0 captures how transmission parameters as social contacts affect the initial growth rate of the outbreak it is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host population where everyone is susceptible dietz 1975  a value of r0  1 implies that an epidemic can get started the reproductive number r  figure  5b  bottom left captures how changes in transmission parameters as social contacts as well as changes in the remaining susceptible population which is negligible here affect the growth rate of the active cases and thus of the outbreak over time the reproductive number begins at around 3 close to estimates of the basic reproductive number r0 read et al 2020  it then first goes below 1 in asia followed by europe and north america and the total including other continents figure 6b bottom right shows the over-time population distribution of the population exposed quarantined symptomatic non-detected hospitalized and cumulative deaths the figure highlights the lags in peaking from exposed towards hospitalized global hospitalized populations peak later than others early may at around 350 thousand people this is most likely an underestimation of both timing of peak and quantity 6 a note of caution any simulation but in particular those looking forward during a developing case as this one should be interpreted with great caution and scepticism for at least three reasons i there is still much uncertainty about transmission parameters ii estimation of behavioural parameters is done at a very aggregate level and with a bias towards the asian and early european outbreaks this does not necessarily are a good representation of other regions iii forward looking outcomes do not incorporate future policy and citizen actions that may different from those simulated here yet the uncertainty is fundamental to the problem itself our main purpose is to develop and enhancing a grounded understanding of the problem to build confidence in and allow challenge what are brought forward as plausible explanations and support in the best way those policy decisions that need to take place under this great uncertainty  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint  httpsdoiorg10 1101 the baseline results suggest that the stricter measures in response to the outbreak were critical in curtailing the outbreak we now examine the interaction effects between interventions more closely we next examine the effect of hypothetical changes in policy and citizen responses to the outbreak -and in particular on actual and reported cumulative cases figure 7  we alter three distinct parameters the reference virus outbreak level hq rob behavioral social distancing exponent exposed h sde the cumulative hospitalization for testing growth rate   tst the threshold for building testing capacity as well as their joint effect all the effect of high responsiveness vs low responsiveness values are shown for north america high low indicate parameter settings that correspond to high low policycitizen responsiveness to the outbreak table 3 shows details on parameter ranges compared to the baseline once can see that a more responsive government to the outbreak citizens social distancing and earlier testing ramp up all have the effect to reduce cumulative cases the low parameter values are approximately equal to asias baseline values hence the results suggest that each of the policy measures taken -earlier and more extensive can help reduce the outbreak on the other hand any reduced responsiveness greatly exacerbates the outbreak further we see a strong interaction effect among socio-behavioral responses see all vs individual changes reported cases bottom left tend to be less responsive -in particularly visible for the interaction effects this is because the increased actual cases creates precisely those problems that make it hard to keep up with testing this observation is important because reported cases are main drivers for decisions and citizen responses this itself contributes to the strong effects we observe in the actual cases further deaths white bars correlate more with the actual than with reported cases while it is problematic to respond to reported deaths with lags between infection and death being 3-4 weeks the sensitivity analysis shows the risk of underestimating the effects of too little action when driven by reported cases especially when relative reported cases are low figure 7 top right highlights these amplification effects from response interactions and in particular from the delays in the system showing hospitalizations while actual cumulative cases are strongly sensitive to changes in behavioral responses lagged elements in the system such as hospitalization experience even stronger amplification compare with actual cumulative cases in figure 6   figure 8 further highlights the strong interaction effect between behavioral responses to the outbreak figure 7 left shows the joint effect of social distancing and the threshold for building testing capacity while a moderate higherlower response has the effect of reducing lighter colorsincreasing darker colors actual cumulative cases their joint change strongly amplifies these effects for example policies that stimulate social distancing are greatly enhanced when policy makers and citizen have a more accurate perception of the extent of the outbreak figure 8 right shows even more clearly the hurdle to implementing effective policies during the outbreak because of such interaction effects the figure shows again testing sensitivity but now interacting with the clustering parameter indicating the efficiency at which detectablesuspected cases  those that have been infected by others are actually identified and tested the map indicates that improving this effectiveness does not necessarily help this is so because successful targeted testing requires a lot of detectablesuspected cases thus absent capacity to identify cases in the first place one cannot find others through such targeted approaches one need a combination of high effectiveness in identifying of both early testing buildup note the positive feedback that acts to move efforts towards downstream-reactive testing -away from pro-actively identifying testing and isolating upstream exposed and symptomatic populations once testing capacity falls behind most cases are identified in the hospital or through severe-symptoms in the late stage  figure  a7 shows the positive feedbacks involved in detail by then those have infected many others but at this point there is also little opportunity to both identify and test those that they infected instead slack in testing capacity frees up resources for proactive testing and helps build up a stock of potentially identifiable existing and future cases the results highlight the extraordinary measures in many of the early outbreak countries were critical to control the outbreak in particular the combination of testing and finding ways to reduce general social contacts are critical more targeted approaches can work as long as complementary resources identification ability testing monitoring are available we also ran the model without interventions and testing leading to herd immunity at a recovered population of 68 b people with 900 m remaining susceptible while not every country has the same ability to together this suggest that controlled mitigation -considered in various countries -without other ways to immunize would be near impossible in the following experiment we focus on the challenge of managing resurgence because in the short run -without available vaccines -building up herd immunity is not likely a feasible strategy ferguson et al 2020  it is highly likely that additional waves of outbreaks will occur in the near future different from a first wave during resurgence testing capacity will likely be available hence in this phase pro-active testing approaches community oriented andor contact tracing will be a feasible as a policy even when not so during the first wave to illustrate how this may work consider a stylized region of 16m people the approximate size of a metropole like new york or paris of the hard-hit region of northern italy or of a country like the netherlands at time zero we introduce an outbreak with 100 undetected infections with characteristics identical to that of sars-cov-2 finally to allow resurgence we let policy makers and citizens respond to the reported active not cumulative cases table 2 shows all parameters different from the baseline figure 9 shows simulations using these synthetic data varying proactive testing effectiveness measured by the clustering parameter   first notice that all scenarios respond similarly to the first wave irrespective of proactive testing effectiveness this is so because as before testing is capacityconstrained therefore proactive testing can do little to alter the path of the first wave during which testing capacity is being built up and lags we note further that this firs wave is similar to what it would have been in case of a population responding to cumulative cases ----------figure 9 about here ------------however in this experiment at some point the virus outbreak appears to be receding as reported actual cases go down considerably bottom left as social distancing rebuilds right the virus can transmit again easier among the population allowing a second wave to commence and so forth while the oscillating resist suppression in the base case proactive testing effectiveness higher   is very effective in dampening the oscillation the rapid detection of new cases takes an important share of the newly introduced symptomatic population out of contact bottom right symptomatic population remains at a relatively low level the policy is very effective in not only reducing oscillations and overall emergence of  cc-by-nc 40 international

2020 new cases but also strongly suppresses oscillations and increases of social distancing but also restores a fairly high but not 100 level of social contacts for the general population besides showing the importance of targeted policies this experiment highlights the importance of differentiating constructs to identify policy levers symptom severity hospitalization and case fatality fraction differs considerably across age groups with the older population being disproportionally vulnerable to the impact of the virus russel et al 2020 russell et al 2020  in a final analysis we use the model segmentation to help better understand how these differences affect the different population groups as well as the overall outbreak dynamics to illustrate the value of analyzing this in more depth we focus in particular on explaining the role of different social interactions across these segments in different countries in explaining the outbreak patterns we perform an analysis in the same stylized way as the previous experiment doing this helps focus on the key dynamics at work we again use a stylized region of 32m 216m people but now we differentiate the population into two age cohorts differentiating those that are more and less vulnerable consider older and younger populations though note that the distinction can also proxy other stratifying variables such as income or race we control the difference between the segments by varying their relative case fatality    holding the average case fatality constant testing capacity grows as before with an initiation threshold of 100 hospitalized cases at time 0 we introduce again a sars-cov-2 outbreak with 200 undetected infections but only within the less vulnerable population segment see table 3 for parameter details figure 10 shows the results the graphs show on the horizontal axis the relative case fatality  across the segments relative to within segment contacts a value of one indicates that the fraction of severe cases and therefore the same case fatality rates is identical in the two segments while moving to the left signifies a relative severity of cases and with that case fatality that increases for the vulnerable population the left graph shows the actual cases left vertical axis as share of the population and deaths right vertical axis percentage of total population in the stylized simulation we also vary relative contact rates between the segments      continuous dashed lines have high low intersegment contacts when varying contact rates between segments we control for total contact rates within the population the right graph shows the cumulative death fraction in three different ways total versus reported total versus actual cases and as the share of vulnerable population to the total for reference one can see that this share reaches to 50 at high intersegment contacts when z  the graph shows a number of interesting insights about how cases and deaths develop as we vary these two parameters in particular when case fatality is very uneven actual cases increase left graph this is so because low vulnerability implies mild on average milder symptoms and because of that lower detection with low reporting there is little policy response and infections can easily spread among the less vulnerable populations a relevant but not unrealistic starting condition in this analysis is that the outbreak initiated among the young population for example in regions like new york city it appears that socially active younger population with mostly mild symptoms one can envision that the virus has spread rapidly but fairly undetected for a while the results further show that the worst case in terms of absolute fatalities high variation in case fatality and relatively high contacts between the population segments disproportionally affects the vulnerable population dashed line top right this is so because after the virus spread has spread among those who are less vulnerable it can easily spread to the vulnerable population segment at which point it is uncontrollable it is the latter that may have be playing part in italy with relative contacts across generations generally being larger than in many other countries  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint  httpsdoiorg10 1101 while only a synthetic analysis this analysis on stratified vulnerability may partially help explain variation in reported cfr across counties or why the reported cfr in some countries seem low for a while only to go up later these insights also may have policy recommendations may vary depending on the demographic makeup for example when relaxing general confinement policies or when managing resurgence should populations that are deemed more vulnerable remain longer isolated at home based on the insights here that may be a feasible direction though provided that mild cases can be monitored and isolated ----------figure 10 about here ------------ this paper developed the behavioral infectious disease model which aims to help improve understanding how the virus transmission characteristics and policy and individuals responses to a virus outbreak interact to generate outcomes with this we provided a general quantitative framework that can help understand under what conditions what combinations of interventions are successful alter the course of the epidemic it allows considering reduce not only deaths but also critical societal and economic costs of an overloaded health system and of widespread and recurrent social distancing the model builds on existing seir based epidemic modeling transition capturing the virus transmission dynamics as well as how in response to the progression of the outbreak populations alter their social contacts and how policymakers ramp up testing and reporting and implement policies such as quarantining self-isolation the model incorporates some key behavioral aspects that policy makers need to consider -including imperfect compliance as we showed the model also treats critical constructs at a more fine grained level mild versus severe symptoms reactive versus proactive testing interventions for general suspected versus detected populations and interactions across sociodemographic and geographical segments through these features the model can be used to evaluate the impact of diverse in particular non-pharmaceutical public health control measures to consider interaction with testing and reporting and citizen response we provided some illustrations using the model to explore both current questions about managing the december 2019 sars-cov-2 outbreak and future questions about managing resurgence we showed the interactive effects of distinct policies andor of citizen behavior and policies we also showed the longer term interactive dynamics of resurgence and key policy levers for addressing this our findings raise important questions about the means by which such targeted policies can be implemented without compromising citizen privacy our final analysis demonstrated the value of strategic disaggregation to generate important insights -such as inequality issues that affect both segments overall outbreak dynamics together the analysis shows the nature of non-linear and multi-feedback system being resistant to change our analysis shows what is generally true for complex dynamic systems significantly altering the pathway of a focal variable within the system requires a mix of interventions is required to address different positive feedback loops and delays within the system the model is available

closures quarantine targeted versus general or case testing and reporting users can also vary a range of assumptions about the disease transmission parameters infectivity contact rates incubation time duration of infectivity or alter the regional characteristics population size interregional contacts for reference users can also observe reported data on the outbreak the model and analyses suffer from usual limitations first the relatively aggregate representation of population segments implies that important dynamics may be missed for example particular social network structures may help explain the dynamics such as the emergence of super spreader clusters the current model also leaves out important structure such as endogenous infections and case fatality within the health providing system eg in hospitals or the effect of hospital load on case lethality finally given the preliminary and aggregate calibration one should be careful to draw strong conclusions from the quantitative results a country-level calibration analysis using countries with varying epidemic pathways and policies is a clear next step yet our analysis at the aggregate level shows that fundamental dynamic insights can be derived with a relatively aggregate model in particular when where there is on the ground learning in a turbulent and dynamic environment with limited and emerging data as this case it is critical to have a tool that allows investigating and provides sufficient clarity so that it can forms the bases for policy discussions that are grounded in science and in formal representations

treatments3 distress from symptoms and suffering during the end-of-life phase can be significant46 impacting on the child and their familys quality of life78 in addition many children and young people who die from cancer continue to have high-intensity treatments towards the end of life910 with nearly half dying in the acute care setting11 despite preferences from the majority of children and their parents for being at home during the end-of-life phase1213 palliative care defined by the world health organization who as the active total care of the childs body mind and spirit    that begins when illness is diagnosed and continues regardless of whether or not a child receives treatment directed at the disease14 is recognised as an important component of children and young peoples cancer services1516 in addition and over the last 30 years specialist paediatric palliative care services for children and young people have been developing in many countries including the united states canada united kingdom and across europe17 the english national health service nhs defines specialist paediatric palliative care as a consultant-led multi-professional specialist palliative care team    led by a medical consultant working at paediatric palliative care competency level 416 in practice however the models of providing specialist palliative care vary within and between countries including for example hospital- and community-based teams which support all children with life-limiting conditions18 teams embedded within paediatric oncology departments joint working with or hospice-led provision and specialist nurse-led teams as well as services led by a paediatric palliative care consultant171920 even within the developed world the availability referral and uptake of specialist palliative care among children and young people with cancer remains low and variable between and within countries and settings and it is not clear to what extent these services are addressing all aspects of palliative care as defined by who172125 for children with cancer referral to palliative care also often occurs late in the trajectory of illness sometimes only days before death2627 recent systematic reviews suggest that access to specialist palliative care services is associated with improvements in quality of life symptom control perceived support reduced time in hospital less invasive treatment and greater advance care planning192829 however these reviews have aggregated the results for children and young people across conditions and the evidence for those with cancer remains unclear because of conflicting results between individual studies28 and the lack of work exploring condition-specific factors that may influence access to and benefit from specialist palliative care services3031 a rigorous review of the evidence on the impacts of specialist paediatric palliative care for children and young people with cancer and their families is both crucial to informing debates within paediatric oncology regarding the positioning and role of these specialist services and for future service development this mixed-methods systematic review

and young people with cancer andor 2 data were reported separately we defined specialist paediatric palliative care as care provided by multidisciplinary teams or palliative care services which included clinicians eg oncologists paediatricians nurses with paediatric palliative care training or services who self-identified as providing specialist paediatric palliative care we included services delivered in different settings eg inpatient community or home settings and both liaison services eg supporting the childs usual care team and services directly supporting children and their families although broad this reflects the varying provision of specialist palliative care for children within and between different countries and so enabled us to synthesise the evidence about these specialist services to understand the different perspectives on referral to specialist palliative care services studies that included the following participant groups were eligible children and young people parents including bereaved other family members and health and social care staff no comparator was required we excluded case studies review articles descriptive theoretical or clinical opinion articles conference abstracts and articles not published in the english language we also restricted the eligibility to studies conducted in high-income countries defined as oecd organisation for economic co-operation and development33 member countries because of the very different healthcare infrastructure and status of specialist paediatric palliative care in developing countries17 electronic databases cinahl cochrane database of systematic reviews cdsr embase medline psycinfo were searched on 27 june 2017 from 2000 in line with increasing availability of specialist paediatric palliative care services internationally19 the search strategy consisted of terms and synonyms for malignancies and children and specialist paediatric palliative care see supplementary information appendix a reference lists of included studies and relevant literature reviews were checked and backward and forward citation searching of included studies and pubmed-related articles link searches were undertaken an update search in medline which identified all the eligible studies in the original search was performed on 13 september 2019 titles and abstracts were screened in covidence34 and relevant full-text articles were retrieved and independently assessed for eligibility by two reviewers with disagreements resolved via a third reviewer35 reasons for exclusion at full text were recorded data on study characteristics methods study focus eg impact andor factors affecting access and quantitative outcome data were extracted into microsoft excel using a pre-piloted data extraction template qualitative data including author-reported results direct quotations and results tables were imported into nvivo version 1136 for analysis data extraction was carried out by one reviewer and checked by a second the mixed methods appraisal tool mmat3738 was used to appraise the methodological quality of all included studies mmat comprises two generic screening questions and an additional four criteria for use with specific study designs criterion assessments eg is the sample representative of the population under study are categorised yes no or cant tell an overall quality score of 0 25 50 or 100 based on how many study design specific criterion were met those categorised as yes was calculated for each study the quality assessment was undertaken independently by two reviewers and informed the synthesis methods and reporting of the review results along with identifying needs for future research we did not exclude studies based on quality assessment an integrative narrative synthesis was planned drawing on interpretative review methodology39 with thematic analysis as the principal method of synthesis40 the synthesis plan outlined in the protocol32 was modified following an assessment of the potential for aggregation configuration and integration of study findings the final method involved separate syntheses of data reporting the impact of specialist paediatric palliative care and factors affecting access both included quantitative and qualitative data each comprised the following steps of the 42 included studies 11 examined the impact of specialist paediatric palliative care4448575862646670737488 14 explored factors affecting access234345566568717576788389 and 17 studies investigated both4647495559616367697277848790 see table 1 for study characteristics using the mmat 25 studies were categorised as quantitative non-randomised 12 as quantitative descriptive and 5 as qualitative studies the majority of studies were conducted in the united states n  28 others were in the united kingdom n  3234776 canada n  350516372 germany n  3577390 france n  187 switzerland n  179 israel n  149 and two in multiple countries6571 thirty-one studies all quantitative examined the impact of andor characteristics of children receiving specialist palliative care 24 included a comparator group of children not receiving this234351546478868890 1 compared children receiving late and early specialist input52538485 and 6 used a single-group study design666769707374 of the remaining 11 studies 6 quantitative and 5 qualitative 10 explored the views of healthcare staff6571727577798389 and 1 the views of parents and young people68 of the 31 studies examining outcomes andor characteristics of children the majority n  21 drew their sample of children and young people from a single centre several studies used the same or potentially overlapping samples as other included studies see figure 2 in total data for 7933 children and young people 4289 of whom had received specialist palliative care compared to 3644 who did not were included while the majority n  23 included children and young people with any cancer eight studies concerned children and young people with particular diagnoses or treatments see table 1 for details4456616266676978 overall these 31 studies address diagnoses from infancy to young adulthood with only three studies focused on young adults which included any malignancy545886 five studies included some children and young people with conditions other than cancer6167707388 of the 11 studies exploring stakeholder views 3 recruited paediatric oncology staff from single hospitals75778283 and 1 from multiple hospitals7980 1 recruited staff involved in providing palliative care to children with cancer from primary tertiary and community settings76 4 recruited paediatric oncologists via professional organisations65717281 and 1 recruited parent and young person dyads from three hospitals68 in total these studies represented the views of 1133 physicians 986 other healthcare professionals mainly nurses social workers and other staff working in paediatric oncology but also in palliative care and other settings 129 parents and 129 young people we identified five broad service types from the included studies hospital-based palliative care teams with referral triggering an initial consultation465053586164676973757782858788 n  17 hospice services234547555659606586 n  8 home-based services48577090 n  4 integrated oncology services4466 n  2 and an integrated oncology inpatient unit49 n  1 three studies referred to palliative care consultation only435478 and three a palliative care team687981 although it is likely that these were all referring to hospital-based teams of the remaining four studies three included a range of models717289 and one referred to specialist paediatric palliative care explicitly but did not define this76 very few studies provided specific details about the team or service providing palliative care in terms of skills mix role and the extent of provision there were also some anomalies between studies for example five studies used hospice discussions or enrolment as an outcome of specialist palliative care4661626490 whereas in other studies hospices were defined as the source of specialist intervention not all studies investigating hospice settings specified the characteristics eg adult vs childrens hospice and it was difficult to determine what home-based services might comprise among the studies exploring stakeholder views three offered only hypothetical models for participants to consider687576 and three focused primarily on views about early integration of specialist palliative care which was defined as close to the time of diagnosis687581 only two studies accounted for the timing of the initial palliative care consultenrolment when deciding which children to classify as having received specialist intervention one only included children who had received specialist palliative care for more than 30 days63 and the second for more than 1 day54 a third study which compared early and late interventions included all children receiving specialist palliative care but defined early provision as that received for more than 30 days5253 only two studies explored how the duration of specialist paediatric palliative care exposure affected outcomes6170 the quality and reporting of studies varied greatly among the 37 quantitative studies with scores ranging from 0 to 100 see table 2 there were concerns about the representativeness of samples in 14 of the quantitative studies due to the single-site design of many studies long study period and inappropriate participant selection or recruitment methods44464851545761626470728689 assessment of representativeness was not possible in another seven studies because of poor reporting66687378818990 in eight studies there were concerns about the comparability of groups eg use of historical cohorts different participant characteristics which were not accounted for in the analysis445051545557586290 although inappropriate measures were identified in only three studies50515666 wider concerns about measurement were evident across studies these included how receipt of specialist palliative care was determined eg from day of initial palliative care consultation whether outcomes could be attributed to specialist provision or care from the primary oncology team potential recall problems in studies using bereaved parent-reported outcomes and failure to take account of the chronology of variables for example having a do-not-resuscitate dnr order was a predictor of specialist palliative care in some studies465960 and an outcome in others5458 determining the extent of these limitations was hindered by poor reporting of study methods the five qualitative studies75777983 used appropriate methods for sampling data collection and analysis however there were limitations to the transferability of findings due to the single-site design in three studies757783 and for the third the time period elapsed since the study was conducted published in 2001 when specialist paediatric palliative care for children with cancer was at an early stage of development76 a total of 17 distinct outcome domains were identified and these were categorised under one of six overarching categories advance care planning n  9 studies end-of-life care provision n  16 location of death n  18 childs quality of life n  6 family support n  3 and service satisfaction n  7 the synthesis of results by category and outcome domain is summarised below and in detail in table 3 the outcome domains were of end of life discussions and decisions about attempting resuscitation dnr orders and the timing of these provision of specialist palliative care was found to be associated with an increased likelihood of end-of-life discussions being documented in all six studies that measured this505461626474 with evidence from two studies that these occurred earlier in the childs illness in those receiving specialist palliative care6164 six studies found that dnr orders occurred earlier in care trajectories in those receiving specialist palliative care465455586264 however the evidence about whether a dnr order was more likely was mixed465455616264 there was evidence from the seven studies which measured treatment intensity54586163648788 that children who received specialist paediatric palliative care were less likely to receive high-intensity treatments and to spend less time in an intensive care unit icu during the end-of-life phase compared to children who did not receive this there was also evidence from the five studies which assessed hospital admissions either the duration of stay or the number of admissions that children who received specialist palliative care spent less time in the hospital than those who did not4447557090 only one study compared the types of admission here specialist palliative care was only found to decrease the number of planned admissions47 two studies examined the cost of care also focusing on hospital admissions but did not find any significant differences between before and after specialist input70 or between those who received specialist palliative care and those who did not54 there was no evidence to suggest that hospice care either enrolment or utilisation changed as a result of specialist involvement from the four studies that explored this46616290 outpatient care90 home-based care57 and preferred location of care51 were each assessed by a single study so no conclusions can be drawn about these a total of 17 studies examined differences in location of death between children receiving and not receiving specialist palliative care a consistent finding across studies was that children who received this were less likely to die in icu4952545758616484 however studies varied in whether or not they found differences in the proportion of home or hospital deaths464857596062647390 for example the study comparing early and late involvement of a hospital team found that late access children were nearly five times more likely to die in icu than at home or in a hospice but observed no differences in terms of non-icu hospital versus homehospice deaths52 however they did find lower odds of hospital deaths when comparing hospice and no hospice involvement84 just four studies investigated the impact of specialist palliative care on whether children died in theirfamilies preferred location of death48515790 three of which found that congruence between preferred and actual place of death increased with specialist involvement485190 this theme included three outcome domains quality of life comfort and symptoms data were primarily from parent-reported measures collected after a child had died two studies measured quality of life but did not use validated measures one found that children receiving specialist paediatric palliative care had more fun and more events adding meaning compared to children not receiving this but found no differences in how afraid or peaceful they felt48 in the second 70 of parents strongly agreed that these specialist services improved their childs quality of life but there was no comparator group66 the study which measured comfort also with no comparator found an increase in comfort levels over time reported by parents but no change reported by children this was the only study that used a child-reported measure67 although three studies suggested that treatment of symptoms increased with specialist involvement577490 there was little evidence that the extent of symptom controlsuffering from physical and emotional symptoms differed between children receiving and not receiving specialist palliative care indeed high levels of suffering from symptoms were described by the four studies which assessed this48576490 only three studies investigated whether specialist paediatric palliative care affected provision of support to family members or the impact of that support one study found that use of bereavement support for parents and siblings was more likely if a child had received specialist input62 two studies found that specialist palliative care increased parent preparedness for the end-of-life phase of care6466 all seven studies six surveys666769727390 and one qualitative77 assessing this reported high levels of family and professional satisfaction with specialist palliative care with reported benefits including expertise in pain and symptom management time to plan end-of-life care with families and meeting psychosocial and family needs none of these studies included a comparator group although one reported increasing parental satisfaction in line with increasing provision of specialist services the synthesis of studies exploring factors affecting specialist paediatric palliative care access identified four overarching categories each containing several linked themes sociodemographics n  14 studies disease profile n  22 studies end-of-life care characteristics n  18 studies and acceptability of specialist paediatric palliative care n  17 studies the synthesis of results by category and theme are summarised below and presented in detail in table 4 multiple quantitative studies which investigated the sociodemographic profile of children andor their families receiving and not receiving specialist palliative care consistently showed that access was not associated with a childs gender47495359616378 or ethnicity454749505359617885 there was mixed evidence about whether a childs age4749505355616378 or the socioeconomic status of their family eg deprivation education47505963718789 influenced access only one or two studies investigated language4659
rurality5563
religion4659 and distance to treatment centre63 so it was difficult to draw conclusions about these factors just two of the studies exploring staff attitudes assessed sociodemographic factors focusing on lack of insurance coverage7189 the majority of participants in both studies did not view this as a barrier to referral out of 12 studies examining type of cancer 10 found that children with solid tumours were more likely to receive specialist palliative care than children with haematological malignancies4647495053555961637886 six studies investigated whether disease status eg prognosis relapse was associated with access no consistency was found across these with some studies reporting conflicting results464950545561 in contrast all the studies investigating staff-reported practices consistently identified children with a poor prognosis as those most likely to be referred657172757779818389 staff in two studies believed that this could result in referrals that were too late for children to benefit from specialist input7179 uncertainty about a childs prognosis and about the benefits of introducing specialist palliative care earlier in the disease trajectory eg around diagnosis were identified as key barriers to a timely referral6571757779818389 although non-physician professionals7581 and families68 were more receptive to early integration than physicians automatic referral triggers were used by the majority of providers in one study however in line with reported practice most encouraged referrals for children during the end-of-life phase of care71 the end-of-life care provided to children was found to influence whether or not children received specialist palliative care four studies consistently found that advance care planning eg documented advance directives or dnrs hospice referrals was associated with an increased likelihood of specialist involvement or earlier compared to late involvement46535559 provision of palliative care by the oncology team we already do palliative care was also reported by oncology staff to influence referral practices6571727579 and to impede oncologists abilities and willingness to identify needs for specialist input in their patients and practice something that was reported to encourage referrals65717275777989 similarly young people were more likely to accept specialist input if they had specific unmet needs for example pain and poor quality of life68 although staff in one study were concerned that parents might not discuss their childs palliative care needs during active treatment81 there was conflicting evidence about whether treatment intensity eg phase 1 trial enrolment influenced access to specialist palliative care434650535661 and this mirrored varying beliefs among oncology staff and families about whether children receiving active treatments should or could be referred6568717275 staff acceptability of specialist palliative care was reported to influence access in 16 studies family acceptability was identified in 13 although families views were sought in only three of these6769 eight studies measured intervention uptake to explore acceptability2346616367698990 these reported varying rates of referral and uptake of specialist palliative care but provided evidence of increasing involvement over time staff uncertainties about the benefits of specialist palliative care and about how a specialist service differs from care provided within oncology the added value of specialist paediatric palliative care were identified as key barriers to referral68757779818389 concerns that bringing in a new team could undermine continuity of care and impact on relationships with families were also reported to influence referral practices687275777989 as were perceptions about availability and capacity of specialist palliative care services perceived availability657172 staff in eight studies identified the association of palliative care with end of life what specialist paediatric palliative care symbolises as a barrier to access72757779818389 a clinicians emotion about a family and their readiness to accept a childs prognosis and discuss this were identified as additional challenges757779818389 and contributed to what was described as the emotional labour associated with introducing a service which staff participants referred to as death nurses76 the death team77 and the death squad75 a perception that oncologists need to control patient care clinical ownership was identified as a further barrier to specialist palliative care referral and could deter others involved in a childs care from recommending this for a family75818389 oncology staff reported that family readiness75778183 and family resistance6571727989 could affect access although views on this varied for example 60 of paediatric oncologist respondents in one survey believed that their patients had negative perceptions of specialist palliative care but very few 4 reported that patients refused a referral72 in another study only 38 of staff participants identified family resistance as a barrier89 and the study that explored young people and parents attitudes found mainly positive views and very few participants 2 and 8 respectively believed that referral was associated with the loss of hope for a cure68 which was a fear commonly reported by staff727577798389 this systematic review found evidence that children and young people with cancer who receive specialist paediatric palliative care are more likely to be engaged in advance care planning receive less intensive care at the end of life and are less likely to die in hospital compared to those who do not receive this some of the included studies also indicate that these differences may be more marked when children receive specialist input for a longer duration before they die the review did not find that receipt of specialist palliative care is associated with improved quality of life or symptom control however no conclusions can be drawn because of the significant methodological limitations of the seven studies investigating this485758646667 importantly only one study sought young peoples views about the impact of these specialist services across the 28 studies which examined this and this was a feasibility study with no comparator group67 the review also found that the type of cancer and whether or not paediatric oncology teams themselves engage in palliative care practices may affect access to specialist palliative care services thus studies reported fewer children with haematological malignancies receiving specialist palliative care and involvement more likely where the oncology team were proactively addressing palliative care needs eg evidence of advance care planning there was no indication from the studies included about why children with certain cancers are less likely to receive specialist palliative care and a recent review of barriers to access did not explore this31 evidence from adult cancer91 indicates that the remitting and relapsing trajectories of haematological malignancies a more aggressive approach to treatment and greater difficulties predicting prognosis may contribute to the observed inequity of specialist palliative care involvement92 evidence from our review regarding clinician uncertainty about when to involve specialist palliative care combined with the commonly reported practice of referring children with a poor prognosis27 suggests this might be the case clinicians views regarding the need for specialist palliative care input for their patients and their acceptability of specialist palliative care services were also consistently reported as affecting referral practices more specifically views on how these specialist services differ to palliative care provided by the oncology team perceived drawbacks associated with involving a new team readiness to accept a change in prognosis and the negative connotations associated with the term palliative care were identified as barriers to referral concerns among clinicians about how families might react to the offer of a referral was a common theme in several studies and although the study that explored young people and parents views runs counter to this wider work on this issue reports mixed opinions among young people9394 and parents7374 about palliative care and how this should be introduced9596 this review is the first to systematically synthesise the available evidence about specialist paediatric palliative care for children and young people with cancer strengths of the review include a published protocol robust search independent screening and data extraction by two reviewers and the use of appropriate mixed-methods techniques to synthesise the results there are however limitations in the conclusions which can be drawn from this review due to the heterogeneity of study populations and interventions this and the substantial risk of potential bias identified in some of the studies and inconsistency of measurement across studies meant it was inappropriate to aggregate the results statistically or to compare results between the different approaches to providing specialist palliative care in addition the descriptions of specialist services and the palliative care provided by oncology teams were typically very poor making interpretation of the differences between these challenging our finding that end-of-life care is different for those who receive specialist paediatric palliative care compared to those who do not broadly aligns with three recent reviews about children with all life-limiting conditions192829 two of these reviews1929 concluded that specialist intervention appears to offer benefit in terms of improved quality of life by focusing only on children and young people with cancer our review highlights the lack of robust evidence pertaining to both quality of life and symptom burden in this population although the broader literature implies that other differences we observed such as reduced hospital stays and more advance care planning are indicative of better care63 there is no evidence that these changes in the delivery of care reflect family preferences485157 or lead to reduced symptom burden which studies continue to show is significant for children with cancer59097 the integration of findings from evaluation studies and those which have explored factors affecting access tells us that while end-of-life care may be different for children who receive specialist palliative care children who receive this are also different to those who do not particularly in terms of their disease profile and care processes synthesis of the qualitative studies go some way to explaining these differences highlighting in particular the central role of clinicians emotions beliefs and attitudes in shaping referral practices and the ongoing uncertainty about when to initiate palliative care and whether this should be provided by a specialist service or the oncology team it also reveals that in practice decisions and discussions about no longer pursuing curative treatments and introducing specialist palliative care go hand in hand and that families who are comfortable discussing an uncertain future or families cared for by clinicians who have this confidence may be more likely to receive specialist palliative care757783 interventions that support clinicians to initiate palliative care with families and improve clinical acceptability of specialist palliative care services therefore offer the potential to address these key barriers to access8298 although there are various initiatives to support the delivery of palliative care within oncology services eg palliative care training99100 communication tools101102 early integration models266769 we know very little about whether these are being implemented in practice and how they might influence referral to specialist palliative care there is also little available evidence about whether families play an active role in the initiation of palliative care or whether clinicians concerns about how families will respond to a referral are warranted68 future research should therefore investigate the effectiveness delivery and acceptability of the different models of delivering palliative care for children and young people with cancer particularly outside of north america future research also needs to examine factors affecting uptake from families perspectives and to explore the role of socioeconomic factors this conclusion is supported by the recent priority setting partnership results for teenagers and young adults with cancer103 which includes how best to support young people who have incurable cancer and their families in order to undertake this research we must first determine what outcomes are the most important to measure and develop appropriate tools to measure them104107 development of a core outcome set would meet this requirement108 this too will need to include the views of children and young people and their families particularly if we are to address the methodological challenges that continue to affect the quality of research in this area and the lack of evidence about whether specialist paediatric palliative care improves quality of life for children and their families  social dimensions of covid-19 in south africa a neglected element of the treatment plan laurel baldwin-ragaven   in south africa with over 2000 total covid-19 cases and 25 deaths at the time of writing it is important to reflect on the intersections between the biomedicine of the novel coronavirus and its sociopolitical manifestations while sars-cov-2 is clearly a biological phenomenon that clinicians and researchers are learning more and more about each day we also observe that the disease plays out differently in different bodies and in different socialpolitical realities no two people and no two countries are living and dying from covid-19 in exactly the same way while there are common threads of pathophysiology and constraints of health-care systems the illness experiences of individuals families communities and countries are unique based on underlying contextual factors that are embedded in culture economics politics and philosophy as clinicians what can we learn from such observations how can south africa benefit from analysing what has happened in countries that are ahead of us in viral spread is it possible to avert a future imperfect in our context that is already fraught with social upheavals and inequity what will a post-covid-19 health-care workforce look like these questions and others probably keep many of us up at night with good reason as we struggle to plan for meaningful interventions what social considerations need to be kept in mind in the past month vast amounts have been written capturing the south african experience of the sars-cov-2 adenovirus that causes covid-19 disease from the social distancing necessary to reduce the speed of transmission and flatten the curve to buying essential goods for the duration of a communal lockdown to the suffering endured by not consuming alcohol and tobacco to reports about the personal and collective economic costs to the nightly release of case statistics by geographical region to the biographies of those who have died we have amassed a hefty repository of pandemic stories that are intended to reveal a shared humanity and promote common cause yet there is something that should niggle at us a discomfort as we begin to realise that apart from the similarities there are also major divergences in our narratives while transmission is the same for everyone droplet spread vs aerosolisation which only occurs during invasive medical procedures we are told that the expression of symptoms can range from completely sub-clinical to severe respiratory failure and death biomedically these differences are accounted for by age andor other comorbidities in his daily broadcasts minister of health dr zweli mkhize reassuringly informs the public that those who have died so far would have died anyway from their co-morbid conditions those with hypertension diabetes obesity chronic obstructive lung disease end-stage cancer underlying immunosuppression and the elderly with the exception of two people under age 501 by implying that covid-19 was simply an added insult to an already-compromised human he attempts to avoid panic by explaining that these people were already sick he acknowledges that while the loss to each family is significant the loss to the collective should be mitigated by this understanding how true is this however it is certainly a more palatable explanation for the mounting death toll weakened constitutions people battling to stay alive anyway a necessary culling of the herd individual bodies live in communities with histories these reveal the complex and less visible web of a persons or a communitys inherent sociopolitical vulnerabilities that emerge as risk factors for poorer health outcomes increasingly it appears that someones positionality on the uneven playing field of life will determine her prognosis in addition to biological factors for covid-1923 although there are well-established links between social positionality and the bodys ability to mount an effective immunological response the exact mechanism of these interactions remains elusive45 in the united states we observe relationships between zip code race and death from covid-19 such as in new york city where latinx people those with latin american cultural or ethnic identity in the united states make up 29 of the population but account for 34 of the death rate a difference also seen with black new yorkers 24 of the population and 28 of the deaths6 there is speculation that poorer access to the advanced technologies for heroic life-saving interventions was the reason however there is a growing body of evidence pointing to the intersectional stressors of living with inequality racism classism marginalisation or being othered that act at a cellular level even in the presence of adequate medical care2 this interplay between inherited and acquired vulnerability works its way into an embodied expression of disease at a granular level however there are ways to conceptualise some of the social and structural forces that increase risk such as power and privilege and simultaneously silence the expression and visibility of such suffering7 paul farmer points out structural violence is one way of describing social arrangements that put individuals and populations in harms way  the arrangements are structural because they are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world they are violent because they cause injury to people  neither culture nor pure individual will is at fault rather historically given and often economically driven processes and forces conspire to constrain individual agency8 unlike the direct police violence resulting in the marikana massacre or the brutal rape and murder of uct student uyinene mrwetyana structural violence is often invisible and has been likened to the unseen mass that lies beneath the tip of every iceberg exerting its influence by creating unequal life chances structural violence is viewed as simply the way the world works the natural order of things entrenched power has become so normalised that it is often difficult to fathom where and how the injury came about reflecting a recent episode of structural violence in our own health-care context the life esidimeni tragedy comes to mind as well intentioned as psychiatric deinstitutionalisation is in theory economic expediency and a callous disregard for human life trumped professional ethics and the right to dignity at least 144 people died from hunger starvation hypothermia and neglect following the ill-conceived transfer of long-term mental health patients to community-based non-governmental organisations that were not equipped to care for them what is striking about this disaster however is the role of those in the gauteng department of health who foresaw nothing unusual or turned a blind eye to possible pitfalls while executing the deinstitutionalisation plan when reading out the findings from evidence presented to the arbitration commission he chaired retired deputy chief justice dikgang moseneke commented about the sheer lack of official accountability for the life esidimeni tragedy senior provincial heath officials had lied played the victim abused their power and knowingly violated the rights of mentally ill patients and their families because the instruction had come from above9 given that those who were directly responsible for the plan have not yet faced criminal prosecution it remains whether this incident will be seen as a catastrophe of inordinate proportions or as a massive injustice perpetrated by particular individuals who benefitted the late political theorist and legal philosopher judith shklar in her book the faces of injustice posits how accountability is apportioned according to how an incident is framed if one interprets what has occurred as a misfortune or rather as an injustice there is an important distinction between whether and how accountability can be attributed although people suffer either way the depersonification of responsibility for that suffering in the case of a misfortune  a tsunami landslide tornado or other natural disaster  assumes that it is the invisible hand of fate at fault according to shklar however a calamity is rarely neutral scratch deeply enough and there will be an injustice where someone or something has behaved with culpability10 returning to our current crisis of covid-19 we actually have a choice in how our own responses will be judged by history like famine pandemics can either be mitigated or exacerbated by the political leadership and the decisions they make11 in fact as many have argued the root causes of mass starvation are wholly human-made12 although extreme weather events such as drought or flooding or a scourge of locusts or other blight may destroy food crops theorists of the politics of famine argue that it is human beings who first determine their degree of responsiveness to climate change that actually results in such natural disasters and after the nature and extent of food distribution that has been banked for emergencies often privileging one group over another as food becomes weaponised the national department of health in its covid-19 infection prevention and control guidelines for south africa states an obvious truth about combatting the spread of the virus in our particular situation south africa has a unique challenge of a large vulnerable immunocompromised population living in overcrowded conditions13 over the past 26 years prior to being hit by the sars-cov-2 virus this is a frank admission that we have been sluggish in our duty to address the needs of the masses despite constitutionally enshrined guarantees to housing sanitation nutrition education recreation gender equity and protection of those most vulnerable progress on these fronts has been achingly slow while pandemics are the ultimate litmus test of a nations health system the social determinants of health have never been more meaningful in our context the minister of health dr zweli mkhize made it clear at this point  this is collaborative work we did say that to defeat covid-19 its no longer an issue of a nurse and a doctor its actually about societyabout going into a combat zone to fight this infection14 attention to the social determinants of health those underlying predictors of life and death should give us pause to realise that no amount of ventilators and hospital beds can in fact stem the ravages of a virus that only knows a single pathway that of vulnerability we have ignored engaging with them at our peril stats sa data from 20142015 indicate that almost half of the adult population men and women over age 18 were living below the upper bound poverty line the cut-off point at which there is just enough money for basic nutrition and other essential non-food items such as soap clothing and sanitary pads15 in 2019 that amount was r1227 per person per month with women experiencing 6 higher rates of poverty 52 than men16 as regards changes in housing value over a 10 year period the statistics are also grim more than half of south african households headed by black africans lived in dwellings that were valued at less than r50 000  in contrast most households headed by indiansasians and whites lived in properties valued at r400 000 or more17 in terms of both the number of rooms in these dwellings  and by implication size  there has been a shift between 2002 and 2014 towards more rooms in formal dwellings and changes from multiple rooms in informal housing to one to two rooms italics added for emphasis17 in another report released by stats sa in february 2020 explaining income inequality there is the stark finding that the poorest 60 of south african households are now relying more on social grants than paid employment to attain overall household income this intervention prevents an even greater income inequality gap between the bottom and top deciles18 despite this attempt at economic stabilisation the divide between rich and poor is so wide that south africa carries the dubious honour of being the longest running most unequal country on the planet from 200619 now it seems we must pay the price as the virus threatens to run its course along the fault lines of poverty and inequity therefore adherence to world health organisation directives like social distancing is impossible for large swaths of south africans who through no fault of their own lack the necessary infrastructure for such adherence in an ironic twist a resident of a rural community in mpumalanga expressed his thanks to the coronavirus for water commenting on the installation of six boreholes with running taps and six 10000 litre water tanks in the space of a week after years of waiting for access to fresh water another resident pointed out that although they government had promised us water a long time ago  now that we have this virus we see fast delivery20 ongoing service delivery protests bear testament that in other parts of the country after decades of neglect improving access to water and sanitation has not been as successful similarly sheltering in place takes on new meaning across the inequality divide given the challenge highlighted by stat sa 2014 in that 14 of the countrys population live in informal dwellings corresponding to 8 million people21 physical distancing in such conditions becomes next to impossible there are substantive differences in self-isolating with a fridge and freezer full of food opportunities for recreation on ones own lawn or swimming pool or tennis court versus the informality and overcrowding that are daily realities for much of the population in the early days of the lockdown we recall the images of law enforcement officials acting with zealousness to confine people to their shacks as the bbc reported the police and army have at times acted with thuggish abandon in their attempts to enforce the  lockdown humiliating beating and even shooting civilians on the streets of the commercial capital johannesburg and elsewhere22 similar reports from front-line colleagues providing primary medical care in the townships expressed exasperation that the mall in ebony park remained open or that it was business as usual with informal traders and food vendors in daveyton23 despite application of the siracusa principles see table 1 during the declaration of a national disaster to ensure that any limitations of human rights are the least restrictive possible and affect all members of the population without discrimination is it really possible to apply these principles equally if we live in such an inequitable society these principles are not explicitly discriminatory against the poor yet the lockdown disproportionately affects low-wage workers in precarious employment during and after the 5-week lockdown the consequences of staying home are substantively different on the one hand for a person with no guarantee of sustainable income or paid sick leave and on the other for a person with job security or a stable business can we blame the population for wanting to leave their overcrowded homes and travel to the local clinics during the lockdown to consult on previously neglected health matters can we blame a parent who because of lockdown is not working at her usual three jobs and sees it as an opportunity to catch up on delayed immunisations for children to extract a tooth that has been bothersome for months or to pass by for a social visit with the staff or other patients the experiences of confinement and boredom are psychological for those of us with adequate housing in the townships and informal settlements these experiences are spatial and material davis and others have described such toxic urban environments as  a dumping ground for a surplus population working in unskilled unprotected and low-wage informal service industries and trade26 in such contexts does the restriction of rights to freedom of movement and employment carry the same meaning or intention the current national debates about whether to extend the lockdown and for how long reveal the tensions between competing agendas although few people are explicit about the trade-offs in terms of lives worth sacrificing as opposed to lives worth preserving experts speak as if we inherently share the same belief that some lives are more precious or at least worth saving than others further signalling the contingencies that will sway the balance between human life and the survival of the economy is the personification of corporations and businesses how long can the engines of industry remain moribund without suffering terminal complications the flip side of this however is that there have been some very brave public health-motivated decisions taken by president cyril ramaphosa and his cabinet to regulate industry and repurpose manufacturing to address the pandemic although the combat zone war metaphor may be problematic it invokes powers for the executive to act in ways that place health at the centre of a societal agenda something that we have not seen during peacetime it opens up certain possibilities that are at odds with getting back to normal such as the mining industry is keen to do27 embedded in this calculus is what number of human beings can be forfeited to get the stock exchange up and running again  so that the poor can get back to work and not starve because without employment and in the absence of a meaningful social safety net they will die anyway we are told that actuarial scientists are key to resolving these equations presumably relying on a common understanding of what utilitarianism means in our context while it is acknowledged that we will all take a hit certain among us must pay with our lives as well as our purse so what will be our levels of complicity with managing these surplus people those who in the best of times die from falling into a pit latrine or a delayed cancer diagnosis or at the hands of a violent partner or from a gang rape for being queer in conversations with gauteng colleagues regarding their role in the covid-19 pandemic they recall the trauma of working or training in apartheid-era segregated hospitals or wards with woefully inadequate resources and security police monitoring or the overwhelming helplessness in the pre-antiretroviral days when aids patients lay dying on stretchers everywhere other colleagues are more in tune with the fluidity of this crisis well we are rationing all the time which is probably a more honest appraisal of the resource constraints structural violence we have come to accept as a normal condition of practising in south africas public health sector in the 21st century whether we support national health insurance as the realisation of universal health coverage or not we are now confronted with a number of questions that will determine our post-pandemic future what is our appetite as clinicians to tackle these underlying sociopolitical issues recognising their inexorable links to the current best medical and scientific management of covid-19 it is not a one or another choice traditionally clinicians have been averse to engaging in such issues because they are not regarded as purely medical but rather political something that i have written extensively about in the past yet these are exceptional and truly ominous times in thinking about what instructs and informs physician advocacy we can turn to various guidelines first the world medical association statement on patient advocacy and confidentiality advises medical practitioners have an ethical duty and a professional responsibility to act in the best interests of their patients this duty includes advocating for patients both as a group such as advocating on public health issues and as individuals28 italics added for emphasis the canmeds health advocate role adopted by the health professions council of south africa states as health advocates physicians contribute their expertise and influence as they work with communities or patient populations to improve health they work with those they serve to determine and understand needs speak on behalf of others when required and support the mobilization of resources to effect change29 italics added for emphasis inherent in these professional statements is a divide between the doctor and the patient or community which recognises both the power differential and a need for therapeutic distancing that is purported to allow objectivity and reason to prevail this divide also confers an element of safety a recognition that doctor and patient are not in the same boat at least not in that exact moment covid-19 has changed that equation now it is not safe to be caring for patients with sars-cov-2 especially in an environment where access to appropriate personal protective equipment may be restricted st augustines hospital in durban is closed indefinitely due to an outbreak of covid-19 at the facility where 48 nurses and 16 patients who tested positive are being kept in quarantine30 the media coverage of both famous and ordinary doctors from around the world who have died in the line of duty caring for covid-19 patients makes us question our own mortality and realise that in this instance nothing separates us from our patients really except if fortunate a medical or n95 mask even the retreat to the sanctuary of our own homes is fraught with the risk of unwittingly bringing the virus trojan horse-like into our most sacred of spaces patients are us we are them yet not really the repercussions of the pandemic will exact a high toll on our collective psyche and on the publics trust in medicine nursing and the health-care system clinicians can choose to exhibit leadership in opening up difficult conversations that frame a set of questions about the value of life in principle and about the underlying and obvious value chains of who deserves human rights we can advise on how to get people to stay home by giving them the resources to make that possible or we can usher in a police state that will further violently punish poor people for existing while we do nothing to help stop the spread of the virus community engagement public education housing and financial support are required to help people practise physical distancing our treatment armamentarium for covid-19 needs to expand if we have a hope of coming through this alive  consider inequality another consequence of the coronavirus epidemic elisa maffioli m   this perspective piece describes how policymakers should consider inequalities as potential long-term consequences of the current coronavirus epidemic in addition to health and economic costs governments and the international community should consider the repercussions of their mitigation and suppression measures as they might deepen inequalities between the developing and developed world poor and rich within societies women and men and vulnerable populations this is a call to action for more coordinated efforts at the international level that does not turn a blind eye on this aspect of the pandemic the developed world is facing an unprecedented epidemic of a novel pathogen covid-19 worldwide more than 14 million confirmed cases and 83 000 deaths have been recorded as of april 8 2020 1 currently developed countries including the united states of america italy spain france and germany are the epicenter of this virus as an increasing number of african and south-east asian countries have started seeing their first cases the global south is preparing for the epidemic to hit governments around the world are acting to reduce the reproduction number r0 the average number of new infections caused by each infected person below one and flatten the curve of the contagion mitigation and suppression measures include closing borders closing schools case isolation of symptomatic individuals and their contacts social distancing and widescale lockdowns of populations 2 by observing how developed economies are struggling to contain this infectious disease governments in less developed countries are implementing similar measures rwanda was the first country in africa to impose a lockdown on march 21 2020 when 11 cases were recorded zimbabwe followed with a 21-day lockdown on march 23 2020 when it only had 2 cases india issued a 21-day lockdown for the countrys 13 billion people on march 24 2020 as more than 400 cases were recorded south africa lesotho and uganda imposed lockdowns on march 26 march 28 and april 1 2020 respectively sierra leone even announced a year-long state of emergency despite no confirmed coronavirus unfortunately despite early actions the coronavirus outbreak is expected to threaten disproportionately the economies of already impoverished countries both in terms of the disease burden and in terms of social and economic damages countries in the developing world have already experienced and survived other crises which deteriorated their economies among others west africa and the drc were hit by ebola in 2014-2016 and 2018-2020 respectively mozambique was affected by cyclone idai in 2019 and billions of desert locusts swarmed somalia ethiopia and kenya earlier this year conflicts such as the recent rohingya crisis in northern myanmar forced the displacement of millions of people however nothing seems to be on the scale of what is expected for covid-19 3 which is projected to have worse consequences in developing countries since poorer economies have limited financial resources and weaker health systems with insufficient health workforce and testing capacity leaders are acting quickly to try to save lives yet the economic consequences of these measures might devastate their economies even further take india for example where still 60 of the population lives below the world banks median poverty line the shutdown order sparked mass migration of workers who were forced to walk hundreds of miles to their home villages after public transport was suspended in kenya where president kenyatta ordered milder measures to slow the coronavirus outbreak informal laborers who account for more than 80 percent of the total workforce are left without jobs more generally in developing countries most of the communities do not have access to clean water let alone soap additionally as individuals mostly rely on their daily income to put food on the table they are facing the hard choice to either go to work with a chance of getting the virus or assured starvation if they stay at home there is a concrete risk that people will die of hunger before the curve will flatten 4 among the consequences of the coronavirus outbreak in developing economies something else to consider is how the epidemic could ramp up inequality first poorer countries are likely to be hit harder than rich countries due to poor infrastructure and lack of resources which will hamper public health efforts this will widen inequality between the developed and developing world second both in the developed and developing world inequality in the societies are expected to widen as well poorer workers relying on daily income will be the most affected as they are at a greater risk of losing their jobs another inequality that is expected to increase relates to gender as 70 of women are health workers and women do more than three-quarters of all unpaid care work 5 women will be the more affected by the crisis compared to men 6 finally some measures like social distancing as well as the availability of clean water remain impossible for people in conflict zones and refugee camps or migrants coronavirus could further widen inequality among these vulnerable populations 7 after the ebola outbreak in west africa one of biggest epidemics to occur in recent history the international community was criticized for its failure to warn the world in time and for the slow and inadequate response 8 the world bank set up a pandemic emergency financing facility pef  a financing mechanism designed to quickly release funds to the worlds poorest countries and agencies to mitigate the humanitarian and economic consequences of cross-border large-scale outbreaks the pef helped release funding for the 2018-2020 drc ebola outbreak but its design is currently highly criticized for the complex payout criteria which does not allow the release of funding in response to the coronavirus outbreak only two outbreaks since 2006 would have met the criteria to activate pefs insurance payments with pef remaining inflexible or too slow to meet its aim of preventing disease outbreaks from becoming pandemics 9 as a result international agencies are now considering acting for developing countries in other ways the world bank group just approved a us 19 billion fast-track package to strengthen the covid-19 response in the developing world and shorten the time to recovery 10 economists and global health experts have called on g20 leaders to provide financial support to poorer countries for their health systems and economies others believe that relieving poorest countries from debt will help them better manage health and economic impacts of the coronavirus as the developed countries are focused on getting stimulus packages approved for their economy some poorer countries are thinking of doing the same indias finance ministry just announced a us22 billion economic stimulus package that will include delivering grains and lentil rations for three months to 60 percent of the population still not all developing countries will have the resources to do that there is still an urgent need for action to help mitigating the impact of the coronavirus epidemic in less developed countries as those economies with few recorded cases are already feeling the consequences of the contagion this is a call to coordinated efforts at the international level the response should reach those most vulnerable not only to mitigate the health and economic costs of the virus but more importantly to limit the widening of inequality worldwide  the global impact of the coronavirus pandemic john hiscott magdalini alexandridi michela muscolini evelyne tassone enrico palermo maria soultsioti alessandra zevini   the world health organization who officially declared the sars-cov-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 and a global pandemic on march 11 2020 countries were urged by who to adopt strict social distancing and quarantine measures to avoid virus spread and to protect public health 1 despite fragmented international efforts to contain the spread sars-cov2 has spread to 213 countries resulting in more than 5

pestilence is in fact very common but we find it hard to believe in a pestilence when it descends upon us there have been as many plagues as wars in history yet always plagues and wars take people equally by surprise
 - albert camus the plague how quickly it hit us  this is one of the most common sentiments about the covid-19 pandemic we were all caught off guard in one way or another in an instant an obscure outbreak of pneumonia in an exotic foreign locale - in the next a viral outbreak jumping from china to the heart of italy then to all of europe on to america - finally a plague that stopped the world as the pandemic hit all countries of the globe it became indisputably clear that everyone was connected - united against a viral scourge 2 despite the shock there were plenty of warning signs since the beginning of the 21st century recurring outbreaks and epidemics presaged what was coming - there was the first sars outbreak in 2003 h1n1 influenza pandemic in 2009 mers coronavirus in 2011 ebola in 2014-16 mosquito-borne zika in 2016 a collage of news magazines

 international cooperation and a unified strategy of pandemic preparedness were not a priority in the end there was no united response - a global leadership void painfully revealed at a moment when it was most needed what resulted was an international cacophony of last moment efforts strategies and opinions to suppress the viral pandemic - after it was already upon the world 
i have no idea whats awaiting me or what will happen when this all ends for the moment i know this there are sick people and they need curing
 in order to tackle the covid-19 crisis an unparalleled international scientific response has been launched with the goal to understand viral genetics immunopathogenesis and therapeutic strategies public and private funders across the globe have launched an unprecedented number of initiatives to support multidisciplinary projects addressing the detection treatment and prevention of sars-cov2 infections most of the calls encourage collaboration between international scientists industry healthcare community and government policy makers to facilitate a well-integrated covid-19 response the dramatic effects of covid-19 outbreak taught us that similar pandemics cannot be managed solely at the national level for this reason alliances consortia and networks have emerged in almost every continent to connect experts in different research areas of fundamental science clinical trials social and behavioural sciences engineering and bioinformatics 3 in the same context it has been remarkable how research groups and companies from all over the world have been repurposing equipment facilities and product lines in a joint effort for a rapid response against the ongoing pandemic companies that were once producing perfume switched gears to production of much-needed hand sanitizers and disinfectants industrial companies switched into making face masks which were in short supply in many countries and automotive companies started evaluating the possibilities for production of medical devices such as ventilators scientists in non-virology research fields who were required to halt their research indefinitely due to the lockdowns turned their laboratories into diagnostic testing facilities for sars-cov-2 and organized into volunteer groups to help researchers on the front lines with their skills and expertise 4567 this pandemic has also brought to light the importance of open science data-sharing and new means of communication among members of the scientific community 78910 numerous data sets are available publicly alongside literature reviews and preprint articles in bioarxiv and medarxiv portals this openness has resulted in a massive amount of information spreading swiftly which is an important driving force moving covid-19 research forward in a short time of course such openness comes with a cost the surge of preprints available in bioarxiv and medarxiv has made it harder to keep up with the screening process of articles to be published in the preprint repositories this also applies to peer reviewing processes and there is an increasing concern that the quality of articles published in journals might suddenly be low and even the rapid peer-reviewing efforts will not solve the problem more than ever before information needs to be scrutinized before going public to avoid the danger of inaccuracies misinformation or even conspiracy theories of course such scrutiny can also result in bottlenecks that will slow down the spread of new datasets and results at a time when they are most needed such a situation is unprecedented as no other pandemic in human history has been tackled in this way many scientists all over the world welcome this new form of communication and data-sharing and believe that eventually there will be a balance between good-quality information spreading quicker versus perfect-quality information that is unavailable until much later 8 the eu joined forces to coordinate a common response against the coronavirus pandemic on 30th january 2020 when the pandemic was not declared yet european commission mobilized a budget of 10 million for research that was subsequently increased to 475 million 11 later on the innovative medicines initiative imi a partnership between the european commission and the pharmaceutical industry invested a total of 90  million for research proposals to combat the covid-19 emergency 12 during the coronavirus global response pledging event organized by the eu together with who may 4th 74 billion was raised from donors worldwide to be used for developing producing and deploying a vaccine for all the european commission president von der leyen said 13 in the uk government invested 20 million to fund new studies against coronavirus including studies to sequence the different virus isolates as a tool to understand virus behaviour mutation frequency virus spread and emergence of new strains 1415 other eu projects will collect data on hospitalized patients to investigate transmission of the disease and to test successful therapies part of these funds will be also used to allow the rapid large scale production of a vaccine with more than 100 research laboratories conducting vaccine development research and with eight vaccine candidates already moving to clinal trials the race to develop an effective prophylactic vaccine is on 1622 since the biotech firm moderna announced plans to launch vaccine trials in humans the us government has invested 483 million to scale up that companys vaccine production 17 meanwhile the national institutes of health nih together with other government organizations and biotech companies set up a partnership to coordinate efforts against the covid-19 pandemic giving priority to the development of an efficient vaccine and therapeutic drugs 18 days ago moderna announced the results of a small eight-person phase i trial of their spike mrna vaccine candidate and the preliminary results indicate that all subjects developed antibodies even at the lowest dose of inoculum 19 encouraging the company to proceed with a phase ii clinical trial that will involve 600 participants however scientists are cautious over the successes of such vaccine candidates since the levels of the immune response needed to grant protection against sars-cov-2 are not yet well understood 8 european biotech companies are also working to develop a potential covid-19 vaccine in germany biontech has designed four vaccine candidates that deliver mrna encoding four different viral antigens 20 reithera in rome leukocare in munich and univercells in brussels have announced the creation of a european consortium that will start the clinical trials of a covid-19 vaccine the two pharma giants sanofi and gsk have recently started a collaboration finalized to the development of an adjuvanted covid-19 vaccine 21
22 to contribute to the pandemic effort the covid-19 high performance computing hpc consortium demonstrates cooperation amongst global high tech giants google microsoft amazon and ibm the hpc consortium offers services resources and expertise to support molecular modelling projects as the simulation of sars-cov2 entering in a host cell the high throughput screening of drug candidates and the evaluation of patients genomic features with prognostic values 23 the public lacked in short standards of comparison it was only as time passed and the steady rise in the death-rate could not be ignored that public opinion became alive to the truth 
a europe as the pandemic spread throughout the world countries took drastic measures to protect their citizens these measures focused on achieving a fragile balance between limiting virus spread from person to person and maintaining economic activity it was an impossible balance although the timing of the implementation of these measures proved to be crucial both for public health and sars-cov2 spread as well as the economic impact on each country early lockdown and strict enforcement were the most effective strategies available to limit virus spread 2425 in an accompanying article in this issue olagnier  mogensen describe the implementation of lockdown procedures in denmark a country with a remarkably rapid and effective response the trilogy - social distance personal hygiene protective mask  became the mantra throughout europe and the world follow the spread of covid-19 in a worldwide cases timeline fig 2
 httpswwwworldometerinfocoronavirusworldwide-graphs working in close cooperation with the who and eu member states the european union took clear strict measures based on the best available scientific expertise some member countries faced a significantly limited availability of personal protective equipment ppe and the public health systems came close to collapse from the ever-increasing number of severe cases requiring emergency intensive care and ventilation 26 in some cases medical equipment destined for other countries was confiscated 27 on the 20th of march the eu announced a funding scheme of 13 billion euro for bulk purchase of ppe 28 unfortunately the uk missed the opportunity to join that funding scheme 29 in europe health systems adapted to the crisis by mobilizing staff increasing pharmaceutical spending on vaccine development and optimizing space with the aim to increase the number and availability of intensive care beds capacity the european average is currently 115 critical care beds per 100000 capita of population 30 in addition to the shortage of icu beds and ventilators the lack of health workers to staff the new units became critical countries such as france used army forces and camps to transport patients and optimize care bed capacity 31 germany with the highest proportion of icu beds per capita of population and one of the best european health systems campaigned to obtain the medical help of foreign doctors who were living in germany but did not yet have a license to practice medicine 32 in italy the netherlands france and the uk retired doctors nurses and medical students were recruited to help 33 rather than impose a lockdown of its population the uk initially followed a mitigation strategy to build population immunity but abandoned this plan after realizing it would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths as noted in a report from the imperial colleges covid-19 response team 34 the subsequent illness of the prime minister and his transfer to intensive care further contributed to the realization that strict lockdown measures were necessary despite ongoing restrictions in the uk the number of cases continues to rise the death rate is the highest in europe and the curve of infections has yet to plateau  a reflection of the lag time before the start of the lockdown the johns hopkins university jhu coronavirus resource center httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml provides an important live global update of the spread of sars-cov2 that includes world map us map and critical trends as of 20th may 2020 the total reported cases in europe were 1909592 and the total deaths are 167538 the uk currently has the highest number of cases  deaths 250138  35169 followed by italy 226 699  32169 spain 232037  27778 and france 180933  25025 sweden similarly followed a plan of voluntary social distancing with the country remaining open with a population of 10 million the country remains amongst the top 25 in the world in terms of total number of cases even though testing is reserved only for those with severe symptoms these measures have not proved to be effective and altogether the country has registered 5-10 times more deaths than neighboring scandinavian countries the above examples again demonstrate that fast response and strict lockdown saved lives jhu lists sweden with 30799 cases and 3743 deaths compared to denmark 11315  551 finland 6399  301 and norway 8267  233 moreover results from a recent antibody testing study across spain showed that only 5 of the total number of participants tested positive for exposure to the virus and developed some level of immunity 3536 a modeling study based on data obtained from french hospitals has shown that by the 11th of may only 44 of the french population had developed potential immunity against sars-cov-2 37 such numbers even if remotely accurate make it clear that letting the infection run its natural course will not result in protection levels high enough to satisfy the criteria of herd-immunity on the other hand if such data are interpreted as a low percentage of the population exposed to sars-cov-2 in two of the most affected countries in europe this showcases a massive positive impact of lockdown measures in containing the spread of the virus lockdowns were not the only measures taken to protect public health asian countries which had experience with other viral outbreaks rapidly implemented strict movement restrictions and suspended all unnecessary activities but in parallel ramped up testing for virus as well as tracking and isolating cases and contacts 38 at the same time china in response to the surge of cases built new specially equipped hospitals to increase the number of intensive care beds while in korea hotels were repurposed as care units exclusively for patients suffering from covid-19 these countries were also the first to ban flights to and from other countries borders were closed and open only for cargo trade 3940 jhu many months after the start of the outbreak in china the number of confirmed cases is more than 84063 and the deaths are 4638 the case fatality ratio is close to 55 as stated on numerous occasions it is not clear how accurate the chinese numbers are remarkably in south korea the number of cases is 11110 with only 263 deaths numbers that reflect the positive impact of in depth efforts in testing contact tracing and social distancing in the pandemic emergency the lack of ppe and supplies like disinfectants created fear among frontline medics and staff to draw attention to this aspect german medical practitioners posed naked on a twitter page this protest was inspired by the french doctor alain colombi who affirmed that doctors were being asked to go to the front without weapons and no defences 41 for the same reason protest marches involving doctors nurses and paramedics took place in many countries - in pakistan they evolved into violent clashes between police and doctors in italy silent flash-mobs protested the government response 4243 many continued hoping that the epidemic would soon die out and they and their families be spared thus they felt under no obligation to make any change in their habits as yet plague was an unwelcome visitant bound to take its leave one day as unexpectedly as it had come 
b america the first case of covid-19 was confirmed in america on january 21 st and a few days later the white house coronavirus task force was established but with government inaction about the pandemic weeks were lost when the government could have prepared its own response informed the public and identified necessary medical supplies new york city with its dense population and hundreds of flights a day from europe became the epicenter of the pandemic in america the first new york case was recognized on march 1 2020 although reports now indicate that by march 1 there may have been as many as 10000 cases in the state imported from italy and elsewhere mixed messages from city and state officials essentially claiming go on with your lives at the beginning of march further confused the response additional delays in announcing a lockdown and containment practices the new york pause was issued march 22 guaranteed the firm establishment of the virus in the city and state new york governor andrew cuomo became a daily fixture on the news providing daily updates on the number of cases the search for proper medical equipment and the courageous efforts of medical front line personnel however with more than 15000 deaths in new york city the critical need to recognize and respond swiftly to the virus was once again sadly reinforced by the staggering numbers in contrast california reacted more swiftly to the emergence of sars-cov2 and issued a stay-at-home order on march 19 an important decision when hours and days mattered jhu as of may 21st new york state listed 354370 cases with 28636 deaths while california registered 85997 cases and 3497 deaths for comparison the number of casesdeaths in new york city are 194550 and 15789 while in san francisco there are 2179 cases and 36 deaths by the end of march all 50 states of the usa reported cases of covid-19 a few weeks after the first covid-19 case the hospitals began reporting supply shortages - both for testing and personal protective equipment a severe safety issue for frontline medical staff that was never addressed nationally rather it was left to state governors to grapple with the purchase supplies on the international market 44 in mid-march the army started constructing new hospital facilities 45 as in europe large-scale gatherings were prohibited schools and other educational institutions were closed businesses shuttered and restrictions on movement were imposed jhu as of 20 may 2020 the total reported cases in usa is 1528661 the number of deaths is more than 91938 the truth is that everyone is bored and devotes himself to cultivating habits our citizens work hard but solely with the object of getting rich their chief interest is commerce and their chief aim in life is as they call it doing business

countries of the eurozone decreased by 38 for the first three months of 2020 in the shadow of the spread of coronavirus throughout europe analysts now say it is certain that the entire eurozone will experience the largest recession since its creation in the late 1990s germany france and italy the three largest economies in the monetary union have all entered into economic recession with eurostat recording an even bigger drop in gross national product gdp compared to what markets expected although countries have published data only for the first quarter of 2020 analysts predict an even greater recession for the second and third quarters of the year 464748 of the individual eurozone countries that published relevant data france reported that after a recession of 01 for the last quarter of 2019 its economy shrank by 58 for the first 3 months of 2020 the largest recession since the country began recording data in the late 1940s italy has also experienced recession for the first half of the year with the economy shrinking to 47 after falling 03 at the end of 2019 the effects of coronavirus pandemic on an already weak economy were enough to squash it spain one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic reported a 52 drop in the first quarter the year while gdp in belgium and austria fell 39 and 25 respectively 4647 germanys economy shrank by 22 in the first quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic pushed the eurozones strongest economy into recession the seasonally adjusted number of unemployed in germany jumped by 373000 to 264 million in april the jobless rate climbed to 58 from a low of 5 the previous month the government also increased the number of underemployed workers to 101 million during april these part-time employment measures helped to maintain the overall employment figures in germany 49 according to reuters experts from the world bank the world resources institute wri and other organizations warn that the coronavirus pandemic will leave behind about 100 million new poor living in cities around the world due to job losses and income 5051 in this scenario another sad truth must be faced coronavirus pandemic is widening the gap dividing rich and poor as for any epidemic in fact poverty and inequality can exacerbate rates of transmission and mortality the main factors that sentence poor people to illness are the lack of access to health care plus degraded and crowded living conditions moreover in the context of the current pandemic a key factor in infection risk is represented by the possibility of working remotely but again this is a luxury that a large segment of the workforce doesnt have for people who work outside home the choice is between lose job lose salary in most cases if they dont show up they dont get paid or keep going out to work amid the pandemic and because they very much need the income and their financial position is far more precarious than those who are working from home continuing going to work in most cases by public transportation is the only option even if they put themselves and their families at risk of being infected a primary consequence of this phenomenon is the racial disproportion in sickness and death percentages in the us black or african americans are contracting sars-cov2 and dying for it at higher rates compared to white americans and this has nothing to do with a biological or genetic predisposition toward coronavirus infection but is more likely due to a social predisposition 52 in the european union after a series of confrontations in a series of eurogroup meetings it was decided to provide financial assistance of 5 of its gdp and the ability of member states to adopt a more flexible program in terms of their fiscal targets 53 moreover the eu commission to support the member states had set up eu solidarity fund to respond to major natural disasters and express european solidarity to disaster-stricken regions within europe 54 the worst affected countries can use that funds to alleviate the burden of the immediate response measures including assistance to the population medical assistance and equipment support to vulnerable groups and measures to contain the spreading of the disease strengthening preparedness and communication among the various fiscal measures adopted to contain the economic fallout several governments have decided to defer certain payments including taxes loans or utility bills to improve the liquidity positions of individuals and companies facing difficulties but in many cases those measures are not sufficient in italy the eu country worst affected by coronavirus economy has been damaged in such a severe manner that people in some regions are running short of food and money many of these new poor have turned to charities for help and several cases of looting at supermarkets have been reported this critical situation encouraged italians to give a new twist to an old custom known as suspended coffee in this century-old neapolitan tradition bar customers pay in advance a coffee for someone who cant afford it the same concept is being applied to suspended grocery shopping customs buy food with long shelf-life for the needy - such as pasta and canned goods those who can put something in those who cant help yourself this is the slogan written on solidarity baskets that appeared in supermarkets local grocery shops and even on the streets throughout italy 55 beyond these acts of charity an important help will come from the government which has designated 400 m for food vouchers to those who can no longer afford groceries 56he knew quite well that it was plague and needless to say he also knew that were this to be officially admitted the authorities would be compelled to take very drastic steps this was of course the explanation of his colleagues reluctance to face the facts
 
b america the country with the greatest wealth and medical minds in the world failed to heed warnings from china and then italy refused to acknowledge the emergency of international concern from the world health organization on january 31 2020 and lacked a pandemic preparedness plan that would have mobilized the american health system to respond to the coming viral pandemic as early as february a failure of national leadership compounded by the political divisions and a fragmented state by state response guaranteed the numbers - more than 15 million cases and counting deaths approaching 100000 it is impossible to imagine that the united states will emerge from this pandemic with the same perspective on its historic economic inequality the coronavirus pandemic has already triggered the sharpest recession in the united states since the great depression for the first 2 12 months of 2020 the economy continued to grow at a steady if not spectacular pace but the plug was suddenly pulled in mid-march - when bars restaurants and retail shops were abruptly closed and tens of millions of americans were ordered to stay home in an effort to slow the spread of the deadly disease more than 35 million people suddenly out of work have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks the spread of the coronavirus has threatened the social and economic fabric of american communities and revealed in a striking way the inequities of the american system  a single event threw more that 35000000 people into joblessness and a step closer to poverty expanded unemployment benefits and a one-time stimulus package were forthcoming from the us house and senate but these are temporary solutions to a much larger structural inequality that the pandemic has exposed the covid-19 pandemic highlighted the flaws in the system but didnt create them it has however revealed two economic conditions that have been left unchecked poverty and economic insecurity an inclusive social safety net that includes a basic income and health coverage may be the only solution to ensure that its citizens have a strong foundation for preparedness for the next pandemic 
thus each of us had to be content to live only for the day alone under the vast indifference of the sky
 our simple displays of social connection - a handshake a kiss on the cheek a hug a touch - these are the human encounters that sars-cov2 anticipates and exploits not mention its favorite  an unintentional dry cough on a bus in restaurant in the office the measures taken to avoid the spread of the new coronavirus have left their mark on the psyche of citizens around the world at its peak an estimated 26 billion people  or a third of the worlds population  was living under some kind of lockdown or quarantine arguably the largest psychological experiment ever conducted 57 adapting to new unprecedented conditions brought a change in our daily routine and our habits given that human mental health is fragile if is confronted with the fear of the unknown it is certain that the pandemic imposed adverse effects on citizens at multiple levels fear of death and the end of humanity loneliness and isolation at home sadness and anxiety for the next day and the future of our loved ones are the grounds for psychological disorders increases in firearm and alcohol sales have been registered in the us over the last two months clear signs of the stress and anxiety generated by coronavirus pandemic among people 5859 since the onset of social distancing calls to domestic abuse helplines or suicide hotlines have intensified all over the world 6061 france offered free accommodation to victims of violence in the home and encouraged people to ask for help in pharmacies 62 australia announced a special phone line named coronavirus wellbeing support line 63 in late february 2020 before european countries mandated various forms of lockdown the lancet published a review documenting the psychological impact of quarantine the restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease in short and perhaps unsurprisingly people who are quarantined are likely to develop a wide range of symptoms of psychological stress and disorder including low mood insomnia stress anxiety anger irritability emotional exhaustion depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms 64 in china these expected mental health effects are already being reported in the first research papers about the lockdown 65 a study reporting on the long-term effects of sars quarantine among healthcare workers found a long-term risk for alcohol abuse self-medication and long-lasting avoidance behavior - where some hospital workers avoid being in close contact with patients by simply not showing up for work reasons for stress abound in lockdown risk of infection fear of becoming sick or of losing loved ones as well as the prospect of financial hardship scientists predict that if the pandemic continues psychological and social effects of covid-19 will worsen and create the perfect storm of conditions for suicide especially in the most vulnerable categories like the elderly poor and people suffering from previous mental problems 66 well personally ive seen enough of people who die for an idea i dont believe in heroism i know its easy and ive learned that it can be murderous what interests me is living and dying for what one loves widespread measures adopted by governments facing the pandemic crisis were social distancing country-wide lockdown and restriction of traffic numerous constitutionalists have argued that such measures violate human rights as freedom of movement is a fundamental right directly linked to human nature however international human rights law does recognize that during serious public health threats and public emergencies that threaten the life of a nation restrictions on some rights can be justified various measures have been taken by the majority of the countries to protect human rights in these difficult times countries like ireland austria and argentina have banned the evictions and have announced measures to protect housing recognizing its role in the crisis response portugal announced that people with pending residency and asylum applications will be treated as permanent residents giving them equal access to free health care 67 initially several incidents of racism and xenophobia were reported towards people of chinese and asian descent all over the world 68 some politicians started to use the term chinese virus to describe the sars-cov-2 pandemic and received criticism for their statements as the virus spread progressed in european countries and italy became an epicenter italians were also subjected to racism unfortunately such incidents are neither extraordinary nor isolated socioeconomic and anthropologicalarchaeological studies have shown that past pandemics like the 1918 spanish flu and the black death in the 14th century affected societies disproportionally as reviewed by l wade 69 people at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum were more likely to die from infectious diseases due to different treatment practices or lack thereof based on their societal status compared to the wealthier members of society african americans latinos and indigenous populations have also faced health care inequalities and discriminations during the course of past pandemics since the current pandemic does not yet belong to the past it is a pivotal moment in history to prevent such discriminations and racial inequalities from leaving their social stigma in the years to come 
there comes a time in history when the man who dares to say that two and two do make four is punished with death
 who has repeatedly stated the urgency of adhering to the measures and positions of the scientific community  social distance personal hygiene and the use of protective masks but such invasive measures also opened the floodgates of misinformation with social and mass media spreading a range of questionable information conspiracy theories misinformation or non-scientific views regarding the virus its origin and spread that endanger public health have acquired a criminal character in several countries one of the most difficult issues concerned reports that us officials were investigating the possibility the coronavirus was secretly manufactured andor escaped from a chinese lab in wuhan specifically the wuhan institute of virology there is no scientific evidence to support these theories the sequencing and analysis of coronavirus genomes have already dispelled these rumors and instead demonstrate that bats are the likeliest source suggesting that covid-19 was created by nature not humans at its molecular level the viral genome most closely resembles an isolate that already exists in horseshoe bats in hunan province supported by several studies bats have an unusually high capacity to harbor viruses and have been linked to past outbreaks including sars mers and ebola the virus may have spread from bats to an intermediary animal before infecting humans this remains unclear the fact that the earliest cases of covid-19 were linked to a live animal market in wuhan that sold exotic species only bolsters these observations in a recent study from nature medicine researchers concluded our analyses clearly show that sars-cov-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus 70 it is well known that the wuhan institute of virology and other institutes have been studying coronaviruses and bats ever since the sars outbreak of the early 2000s but there is no evidence that this research was malicious rather it was a response to the need to understand the pathogenesis and epidemiology of sars high containment research was essential given earlier outbreaks as well as warnings from former presidents and scientific leaders see above in 2003 the chinese government was legitimately criticized for their attempted cover-up of the original sars outbreak leading to skepticism amongst its critics about the openness of its response to the sars-cov2 outbreak of 2019 calls from over 100 nations for an investigation into the origins of sars-cov2 and the pandemic have been recognized by premier xi of china with his qualification that the review take place after the virus is under control there remains much to learn from the early days of the pandemic and the chinese response as well as the pandemic response of other countries from an epidemiologic perspective these were critical days understanding the nature and necessity of the immediate response will only prepare the global community for the next outbreak

 we have reached may 2020 and the lockdown efforts in most countries are winding down at the time of writing the population in italy has moved forward with re-opening the economy restaurants stores and businesses are active once again although the tourists have yet to return germany spain and france are moving forward with the re-opening their countries after reducing the number of cases and deaths through strict lockdown enforcement the united states pushes ahead with re-opening business travel beaches and bars despite the continued rise in cases and deaths and new regions of concern are emerging russia and brazil report massive daily increases in the number of cases and are now becoming the new epicenters with the second and third highest rates of infection in the world singapore and china are carefully evaluating spikes in new cases - using testing contact tracing and isolation to prevent a second wave of coronavirus cases research and vaccine development are moving at warp speed in the hopes of finding a treatment that will restore us to a new normal in the first four months of 2020 covid-19 has engulfed the world it remains to be seen if global efforts during the next four months will unwrap our planet

 the pandemic continues although it is not clear whether the virus will to continue to smolder and ignite in different global regions during the summer or perhaps retreat only to return to new peaks in the fall and winter most experts agree that covid-19 is not going away anytime soon and will probably be with us for the next two years 76 on may 21st the who reported 106000 new cases of covid-19 globally the highest one day total since the pandemic began as new knowledge about the virus accumulates new complications of the disease arise including the recent recognition of a serious kawasaki-like disorder in children termed multi-system inflammatory syndrome mis and new modelling research states that had the lockdown of america been imposed two weeks earlier - march 9 vs march 23 - over 80 of the cases and deaths could have been prevented this sobering estimate brings us to another unsettling fact throughout this crisis efforts have been made to mute the response of scientific leadership to the pandemic if covid-19 ushers in a new normal for citizens around the world we hope that new reality will include the recognition that the voice of science reason and experience must be heard  geriatric medicine in italy in the time of covid-19 matteo cesari m proietti   on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the sars-cov-2 outbreak a pandemic 1 to date the number of coronavirus cases has passed 400000 worldwide and more than 18000 persons have died after china italy is the country that has been most violently hit by the covid-19 tsunami with 69176 cases and 6820 deaths updated on march 24th 2020 the case fatality rate due to covid-19 in italy is one of the highest in the world about 98 well above what has been recorded in china 2 in particular the lombardy region with its cities of bergamo brescia lodi and milan is paying the heaviest toll to the coronavirus in terms of fatalities 3 the vast majority of deaths is occurring in older persons a fact that can only be partially explained by the older age of the italian population in fact although current data indicate that persons aged 70 years and older contribute to about the 85 of the death events in italy it cannot be overlooked the fact that japan has substantially smaller figures despite being the oldest country in the world it is likely that the strategies adopted for testing the population as well as the robustness of the healthcare system may play a much more relevant role than age in the explanation of the scenario unfortunately numbers can only provide a partial description of what is happening and probably underestimate the ongoing tragedy 3 right in these days the international media have broadcasted worldwide the dramatic column of military trucks leaving the city of bergamo laden with the coffins of many patients died of covid-19 people cannot even celebrate the funeral of their relatives who died isolated in covid-19 facilities schools universities activitiesall of them have been closed the entire country is locked down since march 21st the worldwide web is full of videos showing how healthcare professionals are today working around the clock often with limited resources the limitation of resources has indeed been a major issue especially during the very first days of the crisis when there still was a certain dose of unpreparedness and surprise in front of the magnitude of what was happening low number of ventilators saturation of beds in intensive care units shortage of personal protective equipment overcrowding emergency departments inability to adequately isolate suspected cases have been the most urgent and critical problems faced by clinicians especially at the beginning it is thus not surprising why about 10 of the persons infected by the sars-cov-2 is today constituted by physicians and nurses working in such an emergency to counteract the enormity of what was arriving unavoidably led to healthcare professionals falling sick and sometimes even die under the coronavirus the consequent reduction of the healthcare professionals due to covid-19 has been threatening the sustainability of the system to overcome this critical moment many healthcare professionals from everywhere in the world have answered to the call for help and converged to italy to put their expertise at disposal of our community to keep the healthcare machine running and support the colleagues overwhelmed in the management of covid patients there have been pediatricians working with older patients or surgeons taking care of internal medicine issues everyone is giving what heshe can how is the life of a geriatrician in such an apocalyptic scenario geriatricians are sadly used to the fact that our hedonistic society often finds no place for older people 4 in normal times geriatricians regularly battle for guaranteeing the proper care to persons who are otherwise excluded from interventions just because they are old geriatric medicine has produced substantial evidence showing that frail older persons require adaptations in the clinical approach and that the environment plays a critical role for the wellbeing of the aging individual 56 welleverything we know has simply been wiped away by this period of crisis we are living it can be understandable that the focus is today exclusively on the sars-cov-2 and the hospitals are primarily acting for defeating it nothing else seems important in front of the enormity of the crisis the differences across specialties have been cancelled because sars-cov-2 is everywhere probably more diffused than what is generally thought or objectively measured by tests the only priority in the clinical setting is to isolate covid patients or suspect cases as soon as possible and offer prompt respiratory support when symptoms appear and start to dramatically worsen the coronavirus has deleted everything that can be felt superfluous redundant andor unnecessary unfortunately geriatric medicine did not start the coronavirus crisis with solid roots it has traditionally been considered a poor specialty always struggling for recognition it was indeed not in the best position compared to other disciplines to protect the results it has been accomplishing over the past decades for the care of frail older persons furthermore it has never been a winning ticket for geriatrics to specifically serve those frail older persons often at the margin of the society under this scenario it has not taken a lot before everything related to geriatrics was forgotten in the name of the battle against the coronavirus ubi major minor cessat is this right is this the way things should go of course not the fact that the emergency has forced drastic and sometimes cynical decisions does not justify the loss of attention to the persons values listening a physician stating luckily in our hospital no one younger than 60 years has died provides a clear taste of the well-known ageism of our society this kind of attitude was before more or less hidden behind a faade of politically correct but is receiving now a sort of legitimation in front of the dramatic emergency when media have been underlining that older persons with comorbidities were the most likely to die a relief breath was made by many as they had no older relatives or as they will not be old as well one day nevertheless geriatricians are also to blame for the failure we experience today we have lost ourselves and wasted time running after futile controversies missing opportunities for contaminating other disciplines with the correct principles of geriatric medicine we probably remained closed inside our ivory towers and left others design their inadequate solutions for our patients 7 the costs of the coronavirus for older persons are and will likely remain underestimated we can count deaths events occurring in individuals resulting positive to the test however these figures do not consider that
tests have not been routinely available especially for older persons for example long term care facilities and primary care physicians cannot yet easily perform the test for the identification of sars-cov-2the test is limited by a relatively high number of false negative results clinicians are quite confident that many patients died of covid despite not officially being diagnosed for it although these patients could still be managed with all the precautions as they were covid they have still been excluded from the statistics there has been a patient in our hospital who resulted three times negative at the nasopharyngeal swab before finally being found positive at the broncho-alveolar lavagethe already fragile integration of care services completely collapsed under the coronavirus diffusion hospitals closed within themselves for limiting the diffusion of the virus while post-acutelong-term care facilities reduced admissions being afraid of a possible contamination arriving from outside primary care physicians have been paying a huge tool even with their lives finding themselves isolated in the community with no means and no support from the hospitals many older persons with their chronic conditions and care needs remained isolated after the sars-cov-2 outbreak the consequences of this are not part of the standard covid narrativein a situation of constant emergency it is almost impossible to apply many interventions against geriatric conditions across clinical settings physical therapists for mobilization of the older patient avoidance of stressors for prevention of delirium social contacts for re-orientation of the person teamwork for the design of person-tailored interventions all this does not exist anymore there is no time no personnel no resources for supporting the good practice of geriatric medicine the same human interaction between the patient and hisher physician is lost behind the burdening personal protective equipment in covid-19 facilities are we redundant we prefer to think that we have not yet been able to communicate how certain care standards solicited by geriatricians are necessary for practicing a modern medicine what will remain after the sars-cov-2 will be defeated we will count our deaths we will probably take some time for thinking at our acts and decisions we will surely see many errors but this will give us a unique opportunity for improvement after all albert einstein said the crisis is the greatest blessing for people and nations because the crisis brings progress hopefully we will learn from our mistakes and contribute for a better society a society able to give more value to persons independently of their age  beyond coronativism the need for agape annelies van uden henk van houtum   in the covid19 crisis also labelled as the corona crisis one of the most often used words by government around the world to motivate the exceptional intervention strategies such as lockdown policies and the incremental unlock or exit policies to deal with the crisis is the word together to minimise the number of casualties and in the meantime be able to win time for a vaccine to be developed the united nations and the world health organisation have plead for humankind all across the globe to work together to stand as one in order to protect the vulnerable un 2020 who 2020a 2020b and for this to work solidarity of all of us would be required in line with this globally we have seen the rise of national calls and even national legal enforcements of togetherness to maximally protect the elderly children and young people are less affected in contrast to especially elderly men and the vulnerable especially heart lung and diabetes patients who face the highest risk of becoming seriously ill and to spread the pressure on the health care in the best possible way such that every patient receives the care heshe needs radical measures were needed and also to make sure that health care employees are not confronted with the horrific choice who to let live and who to let die just because of capacity shortages in this paper we build on the burgeoning academic debate on the corona crisis by conceptually assessing the current societal challenges which the demanded policy of human togetherness is facing in particular we will build on and contribute to the literature related to the geopolitical bordering of solidarity and togetherness that is acting in opposition with andor marginalising certain others van houtum  van naerssen 2002 vollan  ostrom 2010 sennett 2012 jackson 2015 bauder  juffs 2020 to do this we will be using a radical humanistic approach burrell  morgan 1979 with which we theoretically assess the socially constructed nature as well as the value bound axiology of the current politically used notions of solidarity using this radical humanistic lens in our conceptual exploration we will critically discuss illustrated with recent examples the applied forms of togetherness in this crisis ranging from a track and trace model to a complete lockdown van houtum  van uden 2020 after this we will explore topical forms of counterproductive antagonisms that geographically demographically and socially border the required togetherness we will end with a short reflection on the autoimmune effects of this bordering of solidarity what we using a portmanteau typify as coronativism and argue that for a virus that travels beyond borders we also need a togetherness beyond socially constructed ingroups  what we call agape defined as love for mankind  if we wish to create a sustainable and just immunisation and exit strategy although it has not literally been framed as such one could recognise in the urgent global call for togetherness the classic philosophy of the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 ostrom 1990 the concept of the tragedy of the commons stems from the work done in human ecology initiated by hardin 1968 subsequently this concept has also been applied to various fields and issues in social and economic research see eg ostrom 1990 frischmann 2018 frischmann et al 2019 in general the tragedy of the commons refers to problems that come about when a commonpool resource which can be accessed by a large number of people free of charge is overused and this overuse destroys the resource itself examples relate to the harvesting of fish in public lakes and seas greenhouse emissions in the global atmosphere and the use of public health care each individual makes hisher own decision about how much to use of this resource that is how many fish to catch or when applied to this crisis how much medical supplies and health care capacity to use however if none of the individuals restrain their use of the resource the resources will soon collapse as it falls short on capacity if one limits oneself but fellow citizens do not the resource will also be depleted which creates in the short run an incentive to take your maximum share thus the idea is that if everyone pursues hisher own selfinterest the ultimate outcome will be worse for everyone as it will hollow out the commons and thereby harm the interests of the general public this mechanism is typified as the tragedy of the commons or emphasising the depletion of the commons the tragedy of the failure of the commons or the tragedy of the unregulated commons jensen 2007 the nobel prize winner in economics elinor ostrom 2003 2009 has famously suggested that key factors in order to avoid this tragedy of the commons are democratic and fair rules governing the commons use especially when there is such a perceptible threat of resource depletion without available substitutes as is the case with medical care and medication in the corona crisis hence she argues what is necessary is local contextual rules with builtin incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse in the defined commonality all members of the same local community that make use of the commons should strive to achieve the same goal namely to protect the commons of selfish overuse in order to attain this targeted local governance is needed in the form of tacit norms andor explicit rules institutions and laws that constitutes and enforces the solidarity that is called for typically the political appeal to solidarity in the locality will often be based then on a contingent mix of indigenous identity imagined community tacit rituals and skills or rational recognition of the reciprocity and mutuality needed to achieve the common goal sennett 2012 iorio 2013 jarvis 2019 bauder  juffs 2020 yet what is typical of this corona crisis  and different from the membership of a locally bordered commons that ostrom 1990 dominantly based her writings on  is that all human beings are perhaps unwillingly yet unavoidably member of the same global commonality if everyone would live hisher life as normal during this global outbreak including economic and social crossborder and interregional travel and interaction the common medical care capacity would fall short very quickly making the impact on society at large in terms of the number of ill patients and deaths in the end beyond control so communities may develop their own governance rules and procedures and that may be effective within that context and for the short run but in the case of the corona pandemic these local communities are unavoidably geographically and chronically embedded in a global interdependence when trying to keep control over the virus in this corona crisis to quote mazzucato 2020 you are only as healthy as your neighbour be it your local or national neighbours yet this vital togetherness plead for by the who and un is still rather far from reality un 2020 who 2020a despite the calls to stand and act together different nations have chosen different and largely centripetally oriented pathways to protect the commons of the public health care system anderson et al 2020 in the following we will discuss the dominant variations in the immunisation and exit strategies chosen and assess their effects on togetherness in most asian countries and later in also a country like israel the focus from the start was not so much on standing together as an anonymous united one but more on the targeting and public disclosure of infected individual citizens cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 instead of the whole society joining in a lockdown to protect the vulnerable individuals were tracked and traced and when sick isolated this resulted in a massive and public testing  for instance by constantly checking peoples temperature when entering a building or a public space and communicating this publicly  and the use of apps to trace the exact contacts and mobilities of people whenever someone would fail the temperature test then she would be locked up for several weeks in special corona camps combatwise the track and tracing seems very efficient and effective and society does not have to bear the burden of being locked up as a whole yet technically in many countries the model quickly proved to be insufficient the tracking and tracing could not keep up with the infection rate among the population as a result many of these countries eventually had to combine it with a lockdown after all cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 what is more it is an immunisation strategy that potentially also has severe autoimmune consequences referring to a situation in which the strategy to protect the society eventually forms a threat to that same society borradori 2003 van houtum  bueno lacy 2020 for one in order to let it function effectively it would require a farreaching almost panopticonlike invasion of privacy and freedom foucault 2009 2010 a government that follows and controls peoples private moves and publicly shares their temperature risks transforming society into an orwellian paranoid system this not only rewards indifference and egoism in society to a worrying extent but also leads to a distrust in the anonymous possibly affected fellow citizen and this could result in a grim and punishing dichotomy of the tobeavoidedsick versus the nonsick people which would thus directly harm the idea of togetherness the anonymous but solidary we in our home country the netherlands like in the uk the chosen immunisation strategy at first was to create a socalled herd immunity which entails that the fittest in society would gain immunity and thereby protect the vulnerable cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 but when it became clear to the general public that this immunisation strategy would lead to the autoimmune consequence of a massive amount of victims and would take many years and thus would not painlessly and quickly lead to a herd but literally to a hurt community the dutch as well the british government transitioned into a lockdown strategy for their citizens and the closing of the national borders for most foreigners cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 the lockdown was not complete in the sense that all citizens who did not feel ill could still go out for essential shopping and recreational purposes as long as they would keep a distance of less than 15 metres nl or 2 metres uk to others and would not go around in groups of more than 2 uk or 3 persons nl cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 in the netherlands this strategy was framed as an intelligent lockdown although it was not made clear what a stupid lockdown strategy would look like currently as an unlock strategy the netherlands has announced to introduce a track and trace model including perhaps a coronaapp with which people and their contacts can be tracked down while supposedly guaranteeing maximum privacy rijksoverheid 2020 it remains to be seen whether this is indeed feasible at all most other countries in europe like italy france spain portugal serbia and austria but also various other countries around the globe like australia and new zealand have immediately chosen for a farreaching lockdown cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 in many cases by declaring a state of emergency in which in line with the works of carl schmitt and agamben the normal rule of law is temporarily transcended by extralegal exceptional sovereign decisions aimed to mitigate the emergency all citizens were geographically bounded and borders were closed for inbound travel agamben 2005 2020 schmitt 2005 fitting with such a martial law to legitimise this complete confinement  in which citizens were prohibited to freely and independently move around other than via specific certificates and only for essential purposes  the presidents and primeministers of these countries publicly declared a state of emergency in special tv broadcasts to justify the exceptional state of affairs president macron for instance declared in his national tvspeech nous sommes en guerre we are at war cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 to shut down a society by a lockdown be it framed as intelligent or as a martial act is when it comes to immunisation perhaps less targeted because sick people will only be revealed when they report it themselves but from the perspective of solidarity and togetherness it seems a less discriminatory alternative after all with a public lockdown everyone participates for the greater good of the elderly and vulnerable what is more it quickly became clear that this strategy had a flywheel effect on togetherness itself the threat of a constantly looming dangerous viral infection that potentially could hit every body gave a powerful boost to new forms of local and global solidarity zizek 2020 all kinds of neighbourhooddeliveryservices were introduced to do some shopping for the people who had to stay in homequarantine music was being played for the elderly to cheer up their day private balconies and windows were used as public platforms to sing or make music together like in the case of italy and it resulted in applause for those who kept the commons going the people working in the socalled vital sectors of course as with every new normality not everyone obeyed the rules some people went on the streets in bigger groups than was allowed or even held secret parties something that governments condemned and framed as asocial the message was clear together should be really together no exceptions men or woman young or old sick or not sick stayathome and the ones who did not obey to these rules could expect substantial fines to begin with it has become clear that the plea for the new normal of solidarity cooperation and togetherness has run into direct confrontation with prevailing neoliberal calculative reasonings in this vein some utilitarian critics have argued reasoning with the premise that society should aim to create the largest utility for the largest number of people that the costs related to the standstill of the economy in the long run would be much higher than the benefits of collectively saving the elderly and the vulnerable in the short run luimstra 2020 and hence they argue it would economically be unwise to close down the entire society because the ones who potentially are facing the health and lethal consequences the most would also be the ones who in the long run would not yield the biggest profits to society at large some have therefore even provocatively argued much against the kantian and medical logic in which every human being is morally equal and worth saving regardless of hisher characteristics and behaviour that we do not have to go at such length saving these people because many of them would be fat and smokers and it was therefore their own fault that they ended up at the intensive care unit and hence they could perhaps best be isolated locked up luimstra 2020 so that the rest of us could continue with our normal lives but also between cities and regions in the same nation state we have seen manifestations of antagonistic neoliberal competition logics if we for instance take a closer look at our own home country the netherlands we have seen that hospitals located in the region that was hit first by corona the north of brabant could not necessarily rely on the solidarity of other regions many hospitals elsewhere in the country were accused of unwillingness to take up patients of the almost full intensive care units in the hospitals in the north of brabant de volkskrant 2020 to a large extent this unwillingness could be interpreted as the material consequence of continuous waves of neoliberal privatisation and deregulation for decades brown 2015 sparke 2016 garnham 2017 the upshot of this continuous privatisation of the public sector is that even commons like hospitals are nowadays part of a neoliberal competition it implies that collaboration between hospitals even if it is better or cheaper for the patient is not easily permitted because it would violate free competition and indeed for hospitals in the netherlands it became clear that collaboration between regional hospitals and even between different departments within the same hospital cooperation and solidarity had to be reinvented so that patients and information would not be locked up within the boundaries of one hospital or region and to ensure that hospitals would take over patients of other regions and information and supplies were readily shared how dire the outcome of this neoliberal market thinking in health care can be also became apparent in terms of the stock of pharmaceutical supplies emanuel et al 2020 harvey 2020 the corona crisis has brought to light how the economic logics in national health care have created a vulnerable lockedin dependency on forprofit billiondollar pharmaceutical companies harvey 2020 some of these pharmaceutical companies as well as traders in medical supplies persisted in prolonging their monopoly rents and some even tried to take extra profit by asking extortionate prices notwithstanding such a whopping lifethreatening crisis like this impacting people all over the world buranyi 2020 oxfam international 2020 for many critical scholars this comes as no surprise as the damaging and even deadly consequences of a harsh neoliberal application in health care had been shown and warned for extensively in critical health care debates for a long time already see eg lemke 2001 dardot  laval 2013 brown 2015 sparke 2016 so one could argue that a strict utilitarian take on the corona crisis as is argued for andor practised by some risks turning the required solidarity into a hobbesian kind of togetherness in which the calculative pursuit of ones personal interests of ones health hospital or medical company prevails kapeller  wolkenstein 2013 this potentially creates an atomised society in which competition rather than cooperation is seen as meritable which potentially constitutes an unsolidary dichotomy of the fit versus the nonfit the healthy young versus the vulnerable elderly fit women versus obese men or whatever category is hit harder by the virus in which the nonfit should be locked up in their nursery homes such that the fit and healthy can live their life as normal creating a neoliberal survival of the fittest and in fact literally so with the virus as a deadly invisible hand the second force that erodes the required togetherness that we discern here is the persistence of nationalism in this global corona crisis the socalled coronationalism colijn 2020 van hecke 2020 the virus itself is blind for national borders skin colour power positions descent or richness and as such is apolitical as it could affect everyone everywhere but the political fight against it has clearly made the national differences more manifest and has increased the geographical inequalities even further it has become painfully evident that even in an urgent and truly global crisis like this the alignment of national combat policies and global coordination in the distribution of medicins and supplies is seriously failing put differently to a large extent the societal lockdowns have led to nationalistic lockedins sometimes we have seen tendencies of solidarity beyond members that merely belong to the specific ingroup for instance when the chinese jack ma foundation and the alibaba foundation donated half a million mouth masks and other protective equipment to the netherlands ministry of wealth health care and sports 2020 or when the european union implemented a fund for research of which the results should be shared globally european commission 2020a but mostly and especially among nation states what we have seen is a global anarchistic fight sometimes coincided with wild west scenes in the battle for medical supplies like mouth masks and respiration devices in which even piracy was not shunned as shown by reports about deliveries that were stolen including orders that were stopped at the border and prices of supplies that increased by tenfold the guardian 2020 in addition countries like the united states have even further undermined the international order by threatening to terminate their support to the who kupferschmidt  cohen 2020 also in the eu the union that was actually founded with the aim to create solidarity and to protect the rule of law and human rights beyond borders the national oppositions have been magnified during the corona crisis bozorgmehr et al 2020 again an emergency situation resulted in an internal clash the eu has lately faced three major crises a financial crisis a socalled refugee crisis and now a corona crisis and all three crises have derailed into a crisis of solidarity among member states bozorgmehr et al 2020 and each time the eu commission members emphasised without much effect the importance of international collaboration and unity of policies also in this corona crisis vicepresident frans timmermans as well as other commissioners warned if we do not do this together we should not be surprised if the eu harms itself even to the extent that it could fall apart timmermans 2020 clearly there have been some examples of crossborder solidarity in the eu for instance germany  showing a similar kind hospitality and humanitarian aid as during the socalled refugee crisis  generously took over several patients of the netherlands in their hospitals close to the dutch border bosman 2020 but unfortunately what is standing out is again international distrust and lack of solidarity the same as in the case of the financial and refugee crises the northern more affluent member states were not really willing to help the southern member states like greece italy and spain bozorgmehr et al 2020 and with every new crisis the support for the eu in both northern member states they did it to themselves as well as the southern states again we are being left on our own seems to be decreasing further also the contrasts between east and west in europe have further inflamed because of the corona crisis in particular in hungary and poland this crisis like in the case of the call for a europeanwide redistribution of refugees has led to a further selfdistancing from the rest of the eu and has strengthened the autocratic seizure of the national rule of law kosmehl 2020 for agamben 2020 this latter misuse of the corona crisis by undemocratically seizing more power in a state of emergency is typically what could happen in a crisis and is something that he has recently warned for in no mistaken terms what is more he regards the emergency measures even to be worse than the risk of the disease itself in his words the measures would be frantic irrational and absolutely unwarranted agamben 2020 for him it is blatantly evident that these restrictions are disproportionate to the threat from what is according to the nrc a normal flu not much different from those that affect us every year  we might say that once terrorism was exhausted as a justification for exceptional measures the invention of an epidemic could offer the ideal pretext for broadening such measures beyond any limitation agamben 2020 so agamben sees in this what he labels as disproportionate response a growing tendency to use the state of exception as a normal governing paradigm for him and various critical scholars like him the autoimmune risk of a nationally declared state of emergency that is deemed necessary to protect the nation is that a democracy effectively becomes a technocracy run by nondemocratically accountable experts that decisions are opportunistically taken that are not directly related to the emergency at hand and lastly that the temporary situation is prolonged deliberately and unnecessarily which eventually could result into autocracy however in sharp opposition to agambens opinion it has widely been established by now that covid19 cannot and should not be equated with a regular flu as it much more contagious and deadly to call the response frantic and disproportionate can hence hardly be called an expression of solidarity but what we do indeed see happening and this would be in line with his expectations is that countries such as poland and hungary but also china have already pushed the boundaries of martial law to an autocratic level harari 2020 rachman 2020 similarly elsewhere elections have been postponed opportunistically like in bolivia and the campaigning of the opposition has been blocked like in guinea durbino 2020 in addition some governments have already suggested to enrich the border apparatus in terms of socalled immunity passports and the discrimination of travellers from certain states who 2020c this would only strengthen the nativist discrimination and global mobilityinequality that is already engrained in the visa border regime where people are judged on the basis of their place of birth in the attempt to acquire the permission to travel van houtum  bueno lacy 2020 furthermore rightwing populists like trump and orban have been playing a populistic blame game claiming that the spread of covid19 what trump illustratively discriminatively labelled the chinese virus realdonaldtrump 2020 at first would be the fault of the cosmopolitan elite foreigners and imaginatively open borders chung  li 2020 devakumar et al 2020 white 2020 and we will probably will be seeing more examples of what could be called pandemic populism around the globe in the time to come pfeifer 2020 when it comes to the eu one could state that the strategy to achieve togetherness paradoxically threatens to tear the eu further apart the eu commission  by way of vicecommissioner timmermans recently raised the question how many avoidable and selfprovoked internal crises the eu can actually survive for him the fear that the eu by way of its own internal divisiveness threatens to fatally harm itself what recently has been called eucide becomes more and more real van houtum  bueno lacy 2020 in short what we see happening is that the required global togetherness is fiercely impeded by the national bordering of solidarity a thinking in terms of our nation first as well as by all kinds of opportunistic misuses of the coronacrisis by populist leaders both of which have the potential to adversely exclude and marginalise people not belonging to the own imagined community anderson 1991 van houtum  van naerssen 2002 featherstone 2012 this brings us to the third divisive force to what degree the lack of geographical unity beyond local and national borders is amplifying the failure of the tragedy of the commons will only be known when the crisis is over what however is already becoming clear is that some parts of the world and some population groups are clearly more vulnerable than others to wit nations that are highly dependent on tourists are hit hard mckenzie 2020 especially for the new touristdestinations that have emerged around the globe and moved out of poverty just because of their touristindustry this means a serious setback gssling et al 2020 but perhaps even more poignant is that the adagium of stayathome that was dominant and to some extent still is a guiding principle at least until a cure is found is a luxury that many people cannot afford bryant 2020 meade 2020 yancy 2020 the poorest on this planet have in fact been confronted with choosing between two evils a lockdown without any opportunity to gain sufficient income and thus in the worst case scenario die of starvation or the threat of being infected by the virus due to a lack of protection when moving around in the city to earn some money an unbearable choice between life and livelihood also inhabitants of slums are proportionally more vulnerable when exposed to the virus simply because they do not have a proper shelter to stay at home running water to wash their hands or because there is no option to go into selfquarantine when sick bryant 2020 meade 2020 wurcel et al 2020 on top of that in a lot of the less affluent parts of the world but also in the richer countries like the us yancy 2020 access to health care and the extent to which the government can provide support is not up to par hopman et al 2020 deslatte 2020 reyes et al 2020 thebault et al 2020 thomas and anoruo 2020 yancy 2020 recent findings suggest that people with lower incomes who are more often suffering from chronic health conditions such as obesity diabetes or heart disease are likelier to catch the disease and are also likelier to die from it who 2019 fisher  bubola 2020 as a result it has already been established that the coronavirus is disproportionately affecting and killing african americans who 2019 fisher  bubola 2020 as they are more often living in poorer areas characterised by high housing density high crime rates and poor access to healthy foods havranek et al 2015 yancy 2020 and what to think of a possible corona outbreak in the refugee camps on the borders of the eu the inhumane camps are the heartbreaking consequence of a lack of solidarity in the distribution of the reception of refugees the previous crisis in the eu bozorgmehr et al 2020 kelly et al 2020 van houtum  bueno lacy 2020 the refugees are now yet again left to their own devices with potential devastating lethal consequences bozorgmehr et al 2020 brandenberger et al 2020 hopman et al 2020 this comes in sharp contrast to the rich and super rich whofled to their second or third homes to private islands private bunkers or decided to stay for months on their superyachts mckeever 2020 in other words we have seen the rise of incredibly affluent corona refugees that fled without all the deprivation loss of freedom and hardship that most ordinary refugees suffer from how the greatest utility for the greatest number of people in practice can come down to the greatest benefit for the smallest amount of people indeed the virus potentially hits us all but because of the selfexclusionary and discriminating practices clearly in a grossly unequal manner it is telling that in most speeches held by presidents and primeministers these international vulnerabilities are not or only very scarcely given attention it is not unlikely therefore that when a vaccine or medicine will become available we will be seeing only a prolonging of the othering of the already vulnerable van houtum  van naerssen 2002 mazzucato  torreele 2020 with adverse effects on global inclusiveness it is for the marginalised the poor the refugees the homeless and the ethnically discriminated or excluded that the call for international solidarity and the idea of togetherness in this corona crisis is tested the most bozorgmehr et al 2020 while the call of togetherness by governments is loud and widespread it has become clear that its practical implementation is still obstructed by policies geared towards expanding merely an ingroup belonging shared identity and reciprocity hunt  benford 2004 routledge et al 2007 iorio 2013 rahbari 2019 bauder  juffs 2020 such a solidarity although internally potentially effective runs the risk of creating or enlarging a bordered togetherness and exclusive reciprocity and hence a medical care only attainable for the ones that are part of that particular ingroup the result of this prevailing identityoriented notion of togetherness is that it reduces and borders membership to those who belong to the own imagined community and exclude others who do not van houtum  van naerssen 2002 featherstone 2012 yet what the virusoutbreak in a paradoxical way has shown is the interdependence of humanity beyond socially constructed divides and this interdependence is both a threat as well as a necessary remedy because of our intrinsically globally connected world and our living closely together in dense countries and cities we are vulnerable to the rapid spread of viruses across the globe a togetherness based on geographical economic or ethnic divides will therefore not help to solve the crisis and could even have autoimmune effects in terms of democracy rule of law and inequality at the same time it is also this very interdependent togetherness beyond nativistic divides beyond what we term coronativism that should be seen as the most powerful and vital source we currently have to combat a virus like corona reacting to agambens 2020 warning for the disproportionate response possibly leading to more autocratic control slavoj zizek 2020 recently argued that the measures necessitated by an epidemic should not be automatically reduced to the usual paradigm of surveillance and control indeed he argues quarantines and similar measures of course limit our freedom and new assanges are needed here to bring out their possible misuses but such a social interpretation doesnt make the reality of the threat disappear for him to only criticise the curtailing of ones own freedom risks missing the paradox not to shake hands and to go into isolation when needed is todays form of solidarity and so what we need he argues is an approach that should reach well beyond the machinery of single governments it should encompass the local mobilisation of people outside state control as well as strong and efficient international coordination and collaboration we very much agree with this plea for a togetherness that goes beyond ingroup divides or local communities the commons that the world is trying to protect from being affected by a globally spread virus namely human life itself cannot be exclusively related to any specific ingroup but is unavoidably a vital concern of us all it calls for a togetherness in which people realise that their lives and actions affect one another in a web of institutions interactions and unintended consequences and acknowledge that they are together in a space of mutual effect young 2000 p110 put differently a virus that is by its very nature politically blind calls for a combat strategy that should be equally blind for political divides in ancient greece they had a beautiful term for such a nondividing togetherness agape it refers to one of the seven forms of love that were defined next to for instance philia friendship and eros romantic love and stands for an overarching form of love love for humankind not merely based on reciprocity group belonging or any other personal characteristic but an allencompassing love iorio 2013 pope 2013 hummels et al 2019 based on concrete benevolent actions and equal regard jackson 2015 a radical form of love and as radical etymologically stems from radix roots we need to deroot denavitisticate the togetherness and the geographical ingroup solidarity because it is exactly this radical nondividing form of togetherness which is needed to deal with the crisis that potentially affects us all everyone and everywhere a common threat asks for a common response and a common responsibility to protect equality and human rights now and after the crisis independent of age ethnicity and on where you are born or located thus such an agapeic radical togetherness is necessary for two principal reasons first as a virological remedy because everyone depends on the efforts of others no matter who or where to let the policies succeed and second togetherness is needed because it signifies what could be called a social remedy to let society at large survive and to halt processes of egoism and atomisation which jeopardise creating or magnifying the tragedy of the failure of the global commons in a world that has gained social and economic prosperity due to international interdependencies and exchange and in which globally spread viruses can and will occur working together across socially constructed divides to fight these global viruses is not a romantic wishful thinking but an absolute necessity to further shape the international alignment the persistence of a rivalling health care antagonistic nationalism and global inequality will only prolong the rates of transmission and mortality for everyone fisher  bubola 2020 for the demanded togetherness we thus might need to refine and enrich the current concept of solidarity as this is we ascertain still predominated by a thinking in terms of solidarity for an imagined community an us notwithstanding them a populist our country first kind of thinking we would argue that the concept of agape the love of humanity could be seen as a solidarity beyond borders and actionoriented complementation of the equal moral worth of individuals on which the un as well as the eu declaration of human rights is founded as such it could be the normative foundation for global regulations of togetherness and consequently an open and fair access to medical care and vaccines benkler 2006 a radical inclusive togetherness that moves beyond ingroup based solidarity and incidental charity would be a hopeful and vital message for a world that finds itself in such a devastating crisis and it would be instrumental as a moral guidance in the new normality of tomorrow yet to let such an agapeic togetherness flourish a lot of work needs to be done still because what is continuously imminent is the notion to fight the virus first nationally as well as internationally and in a largely incompatible manner we would consider these bordering and othering tactics some of which we described above as counterproductive for the world of tomorrow harari 2020 rachman 2020 they represent a stubborn and clinging on at all cost to the ideas of a past that never existed in the same vein neoliberal thinking in the commons of health care which has been has been producing calculative agents reproducing inequalities and a hollowingout of the health care sector lemke 2001 dardot  laval 2013 brown 2015 sparke 2016 will not be conducive for an agapeic togetherness the interdependence that is becoming even more apparent during this corona crisis is perhaps thus also a chance for a reimagination of the global interconnectedness of humanity calling for systemic changes in the governance of our global world order and perhaps it can learn from and contribute to the interesting discussions about alternatives such as degrowth solidarity economics and social innovations to name a few that are already taking place see for instance dalisa et al 2015 van der have  rubalcaba 2016 jarvis 2019 and hopefully the recent agapeic expressions of support  like china and cuba who sent medical supplies and doctors to italy and south africa respectively bbc 2020 world economic forum 2020 the imf that implemented an emergency fund for the less affluent countries to support their health care imf 2020 academics across the world collaborating on covid19 vaccine and medicine research and the european union who after a lot of pain and struggle installed a sort of support package for the eu as well as a global fund to combat the virus european commission 2020b will have an illuminating and contagious impact for this to develop and grow further as long as we regard human life as something we need to care for together and not pass on the burden to the individual  the sick versus the nonsick the young versus the old and the protected versus the vulnerable or to lessaffluent regions or nations  we will be able to retain and preserve the necessary sustainable togetherness that is needed to overcome this crisis if not the powerful idea that only together we will get control over corona might derail in an atomised and vulnerable world of together alone  the myriad ways in which covid-19 revealed character g seijts k milani y  page 2 of 23 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 2 executive summary leaders need to be prepared for todays unpredictable transformative world and possess the ability to make sound decisions and take effective subsequent action often amid volatile conditions to do so scholars have emphasized the importance of character the covid-19 outbreak presented leaders of public private and not-for-profit organizations as well as every day citizens with enormous challenges worldwide individuals character was tested the purpose of this paper is to illustrate how character was revealed -in both positive and negative ways -in the actions that leaders and citizens alike displayed during the fight to overcome this pandemic  4 making and empathy it is not a stretch to say that challenges such as the covid-19 pandemic are a test of judgment and character we do not suggest that the performance of leaders in crisis situations is solely a function of character performance is always determined by competencies character and commitment to the leadership role crucial competencies in crisis situations include planning and execution personal and organizational crisis readiness communication performance assessment and reflection on possible actions required to make the necessary adjustments we clearly witnessed the importance of commitment aspiration engagement sacrifice that so many healthcare professionals displayed in responding to the covid-19 outbreak however in this paper we focus on why fighting covid-19 required character the word character is often used in cavalier ways we adopted the framework developed by ivey business school professors mary crossan gerard seijts and jeffrey gandz to frame our observations character is a critical and indispensable component of good leadership because of its relevance to effective decision-making and subsequent action character shapes a number of things including but not limited to what we notice within the context we are operating how we interact with the world around us who we engage in conversation and how we conduct those conversations what we value how we interpret feedback what we choose to act upon how we deal with conflict disappointment and setbacks the goals we set for the organizations we lead how we communicate and so forth any crisis exposes both the good and bad in people who find themselves in leadership roles how leaders respond affects the relationships they have with their followers including citizens however a unique aspect of leader character is that it is linked to an individuals j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 5 disposition rather than ones position within an organization as such covid-19 revealed things about the citizens of affected nations as well as their leaders citizens singing from open windows balconies and rooftops for example served as a powerful reminder that we as individuals could find creative ways to remain connected as medical experts urged us to remain at least six feet apart interconnectedness -to sense and value deep connections with others at all levels within organizations communities and society -is an important part of the character dimension of collaboration while drawing upon optimism and appreciating the beauty of art eg music painting or poetry are part of transcendence as research by martin seligman from the university of pennsylvania has shown both transcendence and interconnectedness are related to our subjective well-being and happiness the purpose of this paper is to illustrate how character was revealed -in both positive and negative ways -in the actions that leaders and citizens alike displayed during the covid-19 pandemic we believe it is of paramount importance to raise awareness of the construct of character and its dimensions-not just to ensure it is brought to the forefront of leadership development in the public private and not-for-profit sectors but so it can be used by citizens to enrich not only their own lives but those of others in the following sections we explain the critical role of judgment in human agency and how the unique dimensions of leader character-independently and interactively-influence decision-making and subsequent action we then share several stories to illustrate character and its dimensions in action and showcase their profound impact on individuals organizations communities and societies we end this paper by issuing a challenge for all of us to find ways to develop strength of character in order to make a difference in our organizations communities and society-at-large the critical role of judgment or practical wisdom the world needs leaders with good judgment or practical wisdom to address pressing issues that present themselves in highly volatile uncertain complex and ambiguous contexts in their book practical wisdom the right way to do the right thing swarthmore college professors barry schwartz and kenneth sharpe defined practical wisdom as the right way to do the right thing in a particular circumstance with a particular person at a particular time as crossan and her colleagues explained in their book developing leadership character judgment has its own set of behaviors that underpin it but judgment relies also on the ten dimensions that support it thus we need leaders who are able to activate each of the eleven dimensions of character at the right time and in the right amount to guide their decision-making and call forth the right behaviors it is easy to envision how each character dimension matters when leaders are presented with unprecedented challenges for example imagine how citizens might feel if a leader fails to exhibit humanity while sharing critical hard-hitting information with the public if individuals perceive there to be a lack of compassion for and understanding of their personal hardships they wont feel a sense of connection to and trust in their leader nor confidence in the measures announced in such situations peoples anxiety is likely to increase while their resiliency may suffer doug ford the premier of ontario canada received praise from all political parties for the way he ran the provinces daily press conferences during the present pandemic observers noted the deep empathy he conveyed for the public he serves especially when he delivered the grim message that between 3000 and 15000 ontarians might die as a result of the pandemic over the next 18 to 24 months he brought transparency and candor to his briefings believing that sometimes knowledge is safer to possess than fear ford also combined his messages with 7 humanity thereby hoping to keep trust in government agencies alive -which was a very tall order given the trust deficit that existed in many jurisdictions according to the 2020 edelman trust barometer as crossan and her colleagues articulated in their research and outreach truly great leaders demonstrate strength in each of the character dimensions and coupled with excellent judgment are able to call upon and deploy the character dimensions to suit any particular situation 1 transcendence to visualize the needed end state and to remain optimistic while journeying the often long and difficult road to get there 2 integrity to recognize what needs to be done and to report candidly on the progress to those directly and indirectly impacted by the measures 3 drive to deliver results despite obstacles setbacks and criticism 4 courage to make tough and often unpopular decisions 5 humanity to do what needs to be done all the while caring about and taking steps to assist the many people affected 6 justice to recognize and issue the support needed by individuals andor organizations to help mitigate the negative consequences born of a situation outside of their control 7 humility to learn and actively seek the best practices to lead teams organizations communities cities and nations through the crisis 8 temperance to show calm and restraint even under the most dire of situations especially as emotions like a virus tend to be contagious 9 accountability to the various stakeholders and bearing responsibility for decisions and the subsequent consequences 10 collaboration with a very large and diverse group of parties to achieve the desired outcome and finally 11 judgment to bring all these dimensions together into an effective efficient and principled process to work through the crisis judgment obviously is a complicated dimension for one it means leaders have to be situationally aware and demonstrate a heightened appreciation for circumstances that require page 8 of 23 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 8 unique approaches furthermore it requires the skillful analysis of a complex and complicated situation to grasp the essence of the challenges they are facing and the employment of logical reasoning to determine the requisite action for example austrian chancellor sebastian kurz provided a compelling illustration of this in march 2020 when he discussed european efforts to head off a paralysis of public health systems he specifically noted the associated economic damage you have to consider carefully when to adopt these measures because a national economy cannot handle this over too long a period the challenge that many people observed was that the coronavirus was dominantly a medical attack on the elderly and an economic assault on the younger generations therefore leaders often deal with what academics and design theorists horst rittel and melvin webber coined wicked problems -ones that often present themselves in crises -that require both deep insight into the heart of challenging issues and critical thinking about them the covid-19 pandemic was a crisis without modern precedent where typical or even atypical rules did not apply the situation rapidly evolved continent by continent country by country city by city and hour by hour amid the uncertainty and insecurity the fundamental role of any government was to keep its citizens safe and hence dramatic measures were takensome previously unseen even during times of war countriesbanned the entry of non-residents and even the canada -us land border was closed to all non-essential travel in order to stem the spread of the virus citizens were encouraged to avoid social gatherings and fined if they ignored the directive and while religious institutions were closed imams rabbis and pastors began live-streaming worship services women who were due to give birth during the pandemic explored alternative delivery options including home births an increasing number of employees began to work remotely it is a truism that in new and unprecedented situations conversations are often short on facts and hard science while long on hunches and opinions the heated discussions surrounding the efficacy of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in treating the coronavirus is a case in point the contrasting views on the effectiveness of wearing face masks in public places was also hotly debated by public health experts governments and the public two things became abundantly clear during the early days of the pandemic first as an international community we had much to learn about the new strain of coronavirus that altered our lives so quickly second as an interconnected world this deadly viral intruder exposed the limitations and inefficacy of traditional borders and thus demanded new and adaptive measures in response renowned leadership expert former president of the university of cincinnati and former professor at the university of southern california warren bennis was fond of stressing that leadership and learning go hand in hand highly effective leaders and teams are eager to learn from their own and others experiences -both failures as well as successes -to reduce problems mitigate harm in a search for creative solutions research by professor bradley owens at brigham young university reveals that it is critically important that leaders embrace humility they must be reflective and respectful of other peoples experiences and ideas and most importantly must adopt a mindset committed to continuous learning this is particularly important for an extended crisis like the covid-19 pandemic that will be with us for months perhaps more than a year not days or weeks but for learning to truly occur leaders need to be willing to step up and take ownership of challenging issues including setbacks mistakes and a lack of progress this can be 10 extraordinarily difficult for those leaders who are quick to become defensive because they believe that taking accountability for mistakes can be detrimental to perceptions of their leadership a compelling example of a leader who resisted taking accountability was us president donald trump during one of the many white house press conferences a journalist asked him about the slow rate of testing for the coronavirus instead of sending a the-buckstops-here message trump denied taking the missteps that some health experts say aggravated the crisis he attempted to project an air of competence by insisting his administration -which disbanded the pandemic response team in 2018 -was doing a great job dealing with problems left behind by previous administrations i dont take responsibility at all trump said we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules regulations and specifications from a different time this response didnt sit well with many people as the pandemic was certainly not an unforeseen problem that came out of nowhere we believe any leader in the public private or not-for-profit sector should remember a key lesson embedded in dealing with an angry public the highly popular public relations book written by lawrence susskind and patrick field they observed that an angry public contributes to an erosion of confidence in our basic institutions many of us dont like conflict especially with people higher up in the organizational hierarchy sadly an example of a negative outcome borne by a professional who demonstrated both integrity and courage is li wenliang the first doctor in china to recognize the pandemic threat his effort to warn fellow doctors led chinese authorities to accuse him of making false comments that disturbed the social order tragically because government officials did not heed his early warning hundreds of chinese citizens died including li himself months after his death he was officially exonerated the report stated that li had not disrupted public order and that he was a professional who had fought bravely and made sacrifices this tragic episode reinforces an important leadership lesson namely to protect the voices from below when the quality of decisions matters it is critical for any leader to create a culture where individuals feel they can speak up without fear of reprisals research conducted by harvard business school professor amy edmondson has shown that companies with a trusting workplace perform better than firms where there is low psychological safety countries communities governments organizations and individuals around the world were forced to rapidly adjust and adapt to the ramifications of the covid-19 pandemic as the virus spread and unleashed its damage on the health and well-being of individuals and the global economy it became evident that there would be no easy way out for individuals and societies in large part this is because we live in an increasingly interdependent world in which networks of people and organizations form the basis of economic scientific security and political activity in his address on the 38th anniversary of the tibetan national uprising the dalai lama captured the importance of interconnectedness dialogue and collaboration with the following sage advice the reality today he stated while issuing a call for universal responsibility to ensure the future of humankind is that we are all interdependent and have to co-exist on this small planet therefore the only sensible and intelligent way of resolving differences and clashes of interests whether between individuals or nations is through dialogue dialogue of course can be challenging especially when parties are more interested in determining who can be blamed while using loaded terms like the wuhan coronavirus or the chinese virus the trump administration attacked chinas handling of the outbreak in an attempt -many believed -to draw attention away from its initial downplaying of this crisis the the implication seems straightforward -we need more givers than takers for sustainable longterm success the behaviors associated with collaboration are important in and of themselves to facilitate good outcomes however the inclination to collaborate creates a conduit of connections to others that support humanity demonstrating collegiality and open-mindedness both aspects of collaboration can facilitate candor and transparency which are part of integrity and being cooperative and demonstrating a sense of interconnectedness tends to support justice which is especially important when particular groups are negatively affected by a crisis at higher rates it is reasonable to expect that interconnectedness facilitates fairness and social responsibility while positively influencing the degree to which leaders or citizens take into consideration a wide variety of interests in any situation on april 3 2020 the trump administration asked 3m to stop exporting medical-grade face masks to canada and latin america officials at 3m were unhappy with this directive and felit it raised significant humanitarian implications that could backfire by causing other countries to retaliate against the us this white house directive was considered by many as a blatant act of unilateralism and a highly unfortunate example of turning on rather than towards each other to deal with a common threat this devastating pandemic former british prime minister gordon brown observed in the guardian that we now live in a divided leaderless world because the rise of populist nationalism has given way to an aggressive us-versus-them unilateralism this puts us all at risk by limiting international cooperation at a time when covid-19 shows no respect for national borders it used to be said of the bourbons that they would never learn by their mistakes brown wrote centuries on national leaders still seem unable to apply or even absorb the hard-earned lesson that crises teach us from the sars epidemic and ebola epidemic to the financial meltdown that global problems need global not just local and national responses unilateralism is the antithesis of interconnectedness and collaboration as brown went on to say if were truly going to make progress in defeating the coronavirus we need ed political leaders in every continent with the courage not just to lead but to work together queen elizabeth understood this when she stressed the importance of remaining united and resolute to overcome the crisis in a rare speech to the public she said that this time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal we will succeed -and that success will belong to every one of us but for this to happen we would need another of the resulting emanations of interconnectedness and collaboration trust as canadas globe and mail columnist andrew coyne recently wrote of all the ties that connect us the most valuable and most fragile one is trust that willingness indeed to let down our guard to work with rather than against one another as we look to our elected officials medical professionals and business leaders to forge a path through this global crisis trust will play a critical role in the outcome but that trust fostered through a sense of interconnectedness humanity and justice will need to be placed not only in our leaders but also our fellow citizens as coyne further stated a reservoir of trust -respect for leaders belief in experts faith in each other -can mobilize individual citizens to meet collective challenges in canada the media observed that unity of purpose brought former political foes at the provincial and federal levels together in ways that canada had not always seen in past crises moreover perrin beatty president and ceo of the canadian chamber of commerce explained that collaboration and partnerships between government at all levels federal provincial and municipal and business is necessary to protect both the physical and economic health of the country what began as a calamity in wuhan china quickly became a worldwide challenge and for most people morphed from a vicarious experience into a deeply personal one the initial response of many citizens world-wide was panic this led to a frenzied and excessive purchasing of food and other essential items with many stores in many countries being completely cleaned out however as resignation slowly set in people became more conscious of the needs of others when they shopped by electing to self-isolate or at least to carefully assess the need to leave their house in addition to many national leaders doing their best to remain calm and goal focused that is to show temperance business leaders also stepped up to the plate while many local stores gyms restaurants and other small businesses voluntarily closed for the protection of their staff and patrons large corporations adapted their production lines provided philanthropic support through their foundations created programs that supported healthcare workers andor changed pay structures to provide assistance and relief to employees who experienced negative economic impacts for example both gm and honda contributed to the production of ventilators and other respiratory products fanatics mlb ralph lauren under armour and jockey produced gowns and masks for hospitals the jack ma foundation donated 15 million test kits and 8 million masks to countries in africa and latin america airbnb provided housing for 100000 covid-19 responders around the world while hertz provided free rental cars tonew york city healthcare workers and the nba mlb and other sports organizations created programs to financially assist facility workers who were laid off due to stadium closures and the suspension of sports seasons through their corporate communications not only did many of these ceos detail the measures they felt required urgent action they often conveyed a sense of transcendence future-orientation optimism purpose they acknowledged that the measures needed to slow the pace of covid-19s transmission would have a negative economic impact on their businesses at least in the short term but made it clear that weathering the storm was the priority in other words they focused on the end game the eradication of the virus coupled with the recovery of individuals systems and societies the character dimension of transcendence helps us to maintain a future-orientation because it draws upon optimism creativity and a sense of purpose scholars from fields such as psychology health and management agree that optimism is especially important in challenging times optimistic people believe that not only is change possible but -more importantly -they are capable of creating it within this covid-19 pandemic that certainly applied to politicians business leaders and scientists who were faced with dire challenges but it also applied to ordinary citizens as they sought to be individual change agents by doing their part to contribute to the whole as we endured the sometimes mundane monotony of voluntary isolation it is with the optimism that we know there will be a tomorrow we must appreciate that even the most dire situations present opportunities however it is essential to reflect on the actions taken as well as to reflect on additional or alternative possiblities while we work through myriad issues -health social economic scientific political technological and so forth -to truly seize those opportunities reflection is a necessity for learning and progress years ago television personality fred rogers said im very concerned that our society is much more interested in information than wonder in noise rather than silence how do we encourage reflection oh my this is a noisy world we therefore end our paper with expressing the hope that individuals reflect on at least two issues first at a general level to consider which behaviors are best left behind in order to progress in todays deeply interconnected world to put it bluntly if one community cannot prevent or manage the outbreak of a highly contagious disease then everyone is at risk we need a coordinated approach to defeat a common threat second to reflect on the importance of character and most importantly consider how each of us can raise the bar in our respective personal and professional lives by working to develop strength of character striving to make a difference and contributing to the flourishing of teams organizations communities and societies the quote from sebastian kurz is taken from the article coronavirus more countries will adopt italys measures says austrian leader which appeared in the guardian 2020 march 8

httpswwwdalailamacommessagestibet10thmarch-archive1997  a tribute to frontline corona warriorsdoctors who sacrificed their life while saving patients during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic suresh pandey k vidushi sharma   needless to say doctors nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease in response to the global pandemic the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges the list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors nurses medical cleaners pathologists paramedics ambulance drivers and health-care administrators in the fight against coronavirus the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers stethoscopes and ventilators as their weapons not to forget medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds hoping to find the antidote to the disease since the coronavirus outbreak health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way on top of that many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty every day the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones the sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end most importantly we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over moreover the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this that being said wed now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some courageous and inspiring doctors from across the globe who lost their lives while saving the lives of covid-19 patients the death that broke several hearts in the initial days of coronavirus spread was of dr li wenliang a chinese ophthalmologist who tried to warn fellow practitioners about the potential outbreak of a virus fig 1 unfortunately he was accused of making false claims and misleading the public dr lis warning did not depend on sophisticated laboratory testing or expensive imaging studies but on his own understanding of biological plausibilitythe kind of analysis that clinicians of all specialties could make2 the new york times reported that on january 10 2020 dr li developed a cough after having treated a woman for glaucoma who had unknowingly been infected with the coronavirus probably by her daughter no report suggests that he observed any ophthalmologic complications of the coronavirus infection in his patient the 34-year-old eye specialist in his weibo story revealed how he had come down with cough and fever after a month of his warning going unnoticed the doctor had contracted the virus while treating a glaucoma case suffering from corona virus in wuhan dr li passed away on february 7 2020 leaving the people in china and worldwide grieving and angry another doctor who died of the disease in wuhan was just 29 years old as per the reports he had postponed his lunar new year marriage to serve humanity and treat patients who had been hit by the virus unfortunately he ended up contracting the virus from one of his patients and died a hero the covid-19 wrath is taking no stop in italy and the situation seems to be getting out of hands in the new epicenter of the disease more than 66 doctors who were tested positive for coronavirus in italy have reportedly died according to the head of an italian research institute a total of 8358 health workers have caught the disease dr roberto stella aged 67 was an italian general practitioner who died on march 10 at the como hospital as confirmed by the towns mayor mario landriscina fig 2 he died of respiratory failure due to coronavirus like other heroes dr stella had contracted the virus while actively taking care of patients and guiding them on proper care another case that shattered millions of hearts across the world was of a nurse who has reportedly taken her own life after being tested positive out of the fear of spreading the disease to others a 67-year-old physician in italy who despite running out of his protective gear continued to treat the patients ended up sacrificing his life furthermore a 34-year-old doctor daniela trezzi who had been working on the front line at a hospital in lombardy died after catching the disease her death was confirmed by the national federation of nurses of italy jean-jacques razafindranazy fig 3 was the first french doctor who died while treating coronavirus patients the 68-year-old accident and emergency department doctor was retired but the passion that he had for serving humanity was undying thus he volunteered to help his colleagues save the lives of people as the number of incoming patients continued to increase the retired doctor was working in an emergency ward at the lille university hospital where he caught the disease his death was announced through a social media post titled my father a hero written by his family dr usama riaz fig 4 a young 26-year-old became the first pakistani doctor to die of coronavirus he remained on the forefront screening people returning from abroad from the pakistaniran border at a hospital in gilgit-baltistan he was busy fighting the deadly virus with utmost bravery and confidence when he contracted the virus upon showing symptoms he was rushed to the hospital and was put on a ventilator but he could not make it he proved to be a real hero by sacrificing his life while saving the lives of many sixty-three-year-old dr adil el tayar fig 5 became the first frontline health-care worker to die of coronavirus in the uk on march 25 the organ transplant consultant was performing his duty at st marys and st georges hospitals in london when he contracted the virus he started showing symptoms in mid-march due to which he immediately self-isolated himself in a matter of 12 days he went from a perfectly fit doctor treating patients to a covid-19 victim lying in a hospital morgue the iranian doctor shirin rouhani fig 6 also lost her life while treating coronavirus patients her determination and will power was such that she continued to treat patients till her last breath even when she herself was on iv she knew she could not rest because of the shortage of doctors and medical workers to cater to the needs of patients the philippine heart center announced the death of the first doctor dr israel bactol fig 7 who was a senior adult cardiology fellow-in-training the medical professionals in the country are devastated and so are the citizens while grieving the death they have strengthened their resolve to make it the first and last death as of april 11 2020 a total of 20043 people died due to the covid-19 pandemic outbreak in america while approximately 521084 cases have been registered in the national healthcare system doctors face the contagious disease daily as they work around the clock to keep the situation under control however with the rising cases it was inevitable for someone within the medical field to contract the viral infection the american college of emergency recently reported two emergency room doctors have come down with the virus in the past week out of which a senior emergency physician doctor frank gabin passed away a few days back the good doctors contracted the disease after wearing the same surgical mask for a week the inadequate supply of personal protection equipment ppe for healthcare workers is the primary reason for this tragedy the other physician is a 40-year-old washington-based practitioner both doctors are under observation as their colleagues try to prevent their condition from escalating the coronavirus crisis in india is also steadily engulfing the nation so far there have been 8339 cases of the coronavirus reported in india and 249 deaths the current statistics include 774 recovered cases as of 11th april 2020 moreover over 50 healthcare professionals have been tested positive for corona virus in india the first three doctors that were tested had no prior travel history or symptoms it is believed that all the doctors contracted the disease through their patients an andheri-based doctor is currently under quarantine with his family as all members have tested positive for the disease furthermore the first medical practitioner to die was dr shatrughan panjwani a private practitioner from indore the 60-year-old physician passed away on 9th april 2020 leaving behind many mourners while the deadly virus has brought attention to the inadequacies in the health-care systems across the globe doctors and health-care workers have been risking their lives to save all of us they are also risking the lives of their family members which indeed is a huge sacrifice on top of that the shortage of face masks shields and protective gear is not helping and this makes the efforts of the medical workers even more extraordinary on occasion of the doctors day march 30 2020 usa and australia the stories of the medical heroes putting themselves on the forefront to fight the virus are inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time they deserve all the appreciation and support the sacrifice of doctors and healthcare workers across the globe will not go to waste humanity will always be grateful to them for what they are doing during these unprecedented times the respect for healthcare professionals has grown manifolds in the hearts of people it is good to see that the government of india along with the governments worldwide have decided to allocate more budget for healthcare in their respective countries the world is taking the health healthcare professionals and hospitals more seriously as it appears more work is expected to be done for hospitals and intensive care units icus to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in india as well as in countries across the world  dynamic causal modelling of covid-19 contents karl friston j thomas parr peter zeidman adeel razi guillaume flandin jean daunizeau oliver hulme j alexander billig j vladimir litvak rosalyn moran j cathy price j christian lambert  this technical report describes a dynamic causal model of the spread of coronavirus through a population the model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes like new cases and deaths over time the purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes by assuming suitable conditional dependencies one can model the effects of interventions eg social distancing and differences among populations eg herd immunity to predict what might happen in different circumstances technically this model leverages state-of-the-art variational bayesian model inversion and comparison procedures originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations here this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations-to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data although the purpose of this paper is to describe a modelling protocol the results illustrate some interesting perspectives on the current pandemic for example the nonlinear effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process  the purpose of this paper is to show how dynamic causal modelling can be used to make predictions-and test hypotheses-about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic wu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020  it should be read as a technical report 1  written for people who want to understand what this kind of modelling has to offer or just build an intuition about modelling pandemics it contains a sufficient level of technical detail to implement the model using matlab or its open source version octave while explaining things heuristically for non-technical readers the examples in this report are used to showcase the procedures and subsequent inferences that can be drawn having said this there are some quantitative results that will be of general interest these results are entirely conditional upon the model used dynamic causal modelling dcm refers to the characterisation of coupled dynamical systems in terms of how observable data are generated by unobserved ie latent or hidden causes friston et al 2003 moran et al 2013  dynamic causal modelling subsumes state estimation and system identification under one bayesian procedure to provide probability densities over unknown latent states ie state estimation and model parameters ie system identification respectively its focus is on estimating the uncertainty about these estimates to quantify the evidence for competing models and the confidence in various predictions in this sense dcm combines data assimilation and uncertainty quantification within the same optimisation process specifically the posterior densities ie bayesian beliefs over states and parameters-and the precision of random fluctuations-are optimised by maximising a variational bound on the models marginal likelihood also known as model evidence this bound is known as variational free energy or the evidence lower bound elbo in machine learning friston et al 2007 hinton and zemel 1993 mackay 1995 winn and bishop 2005  intuitively this means one is trying to optimise probabilistic beliefs-about the unknown quantities generating some data-such that the marginal likelihood of those data is as large as possible the marginal likelihood 2 or model evidence can always be expressed as accuracy minus complexity this means that the best models provide an accurate account of some data as simply as possible therefore the model with the highest evidence is not necessarily a description of the process generating data rather it is the simplest description that provides an accurate account of those data in short it is as if the data were generated by this kind of model importantly models with the highest evidence will generalise to new data and preclude overfitting or overconfident predictions about outcomes that have yet to be measured in light of this it is imperative to select the parameters or models that maximise model evidence or variational free energy as opposed to goodness of fit or accuracy however this requires the estimation of the uncertainty about model parameters and states which is necessary to evaluate the marginal likelihood of the data at hand this is why estimating uncertainty is crucial being able to score a model-in terms of its evidence-means that one can compare different models of the same data this is known as bayesian model comparison and plays an important role when testing different models or hypotheses about how the data are caused we will see examples of this later this aspect of dynamic causal modelling means that one does not have to commit to a particular form ie parameterisation of a model rather one can explore a repertoire of plausible models and let the data decide which is the most apt dynamic causal models are generative models that generate consequences ie data from causes ie hidden states and parameters the form of these models can vary depending upon the kind of system at hand here we use a ubiquitous form of model namely a mean field approximation to loosely coupled ensembles or populations in the neurosciences this kind of model is applied to populations of neurons that respond to experimental stimulation marreiros et al 2009 moran et al 2013  here we use the same mathematical approach to model a population of individuals and their response to an epidemic the key idea behind these mean field models is that the constituents of the ensemble are exchangeable in the sense that sampling people from the population at random will give the same average as following one person over a long period of time under this assumption 3  one can then work out analytically how the probability distribution over various states of people evolve over time eg whether someone was infected or not this involves parameterising the probability that people will transition from one state to another by assuming the population is large one can work out the likelihood of observing a certain number of people who were infected given the probabilistic state of the population at that point in time in turn one can work out the probability of a sequence or timeseries of new cases this is the kind of generative model used here where the latent states were chosen to generate the data that are-or could be-used to track a pandemic figure  1 provides an overview of this model in terms of epidemiological models this can be regarded as an extended seir susceptible exposed infected and recovered compartmental model kermack et al 1997  please see for an application of this kind of model to there are number of advantages to using a model of this sort first it means that one can include every variable that matters such that one is not just modelling the spread of an infection but an ensemble response in terms of behaviour eg social distancing this means that one can test hypotheses about the contribution of various responses that are installed in the model-or what would happen under a different kind of response a second advantage of having a generative model is that one can evaluate its evidence in relation to alternative models and therefore optimise the structure of the model itself for example does social distancing behaviour depend upon the number of people who are infected or does it depend on how many people have tested positive for covid-19 this question is addressed below a third advantage is more practical in terms of data analysis because we are dealing with ensemble dynamics there is no need to create multiple realisations or random samples to estimate uncertainty this is because the latent states are not the states of an individual but the sufficient statistics of a probability distribution over individual states in other words we replace random fluctuations in hidden states with hidden states that parameterise random fluctuations the practical consequence of this is that one can fit these models quickly and efficiently-and perform model comparisons over thousands of models a fourth advantage is that given a set of transition probabilities the ensemble dynamics are specified completely this has the simple but important consequence that the only unknowns in the model are the parameters of these transition probabilities crucially in this model these do not change with time this means that we can convert what would have been a very complicated nonlinear state space model for data assimilation into a nonlinear mapping from some unknown probability transition parameters to a sequence of observations we can therefore make precise predictions about the long-term future under particular circumstances this follows because the only uncertainty about outcomes inherits from the uncertainty about the parameters which do not change with time these points may sound subtle however the worked examples below have been chosen to illustrate these properties this technical report comprises four sections the first details the generative model with a focus on the conditional dependencies that underwrite the ensemble dynamics generating outcomes the outcomes in question here pertain to a regional outbreak this can be regarded as a generative model for the first wave of an epidemic in a large city or metropolis this section considers variational model inversion and comparison under hierarchical models in other words it considers the distinction between first level models of an outbreak in one country and second level models of differences among countries in terms of model parameters the second section briefly surveys the results of second level between-country modelling looking at those aspects of the model that are conserved over countries ie random effects and those which are not ie fixed effects the third section then moves on to the dynamics and predictions for a single country here the united kingdom it considers the likely outcomes over the next few weeks and how confident one can be about these outcomes given data from all countries to date this section drills down on the parameters that matter in terms of affecting death rates it presents a sensitivity analysis that establishes the contribution of parameters or causes in the model to eventual outcomes it concludes by looking at the effects of social distancing and herd immunity the final section concludes with a consideration of predictive validity by comparing predicted and actual outcomes figure 1 generative model this figure is a schematic description of the generative model used in subsequent analyses in brief this compartmental model generates timeseries data based on a mean field approximation to ensemble or population dynamics the implicit probability distributions are over four latent factors each with four levels or states these factors are sufficient to generate measurable outcomes for example the number of new cases or the proportion of people infected the first factor is the location of an individual who can be at home at work in a critical care unit ccu or in the morgue the second factor is infection status namely susceptible to infection infected infectious or immune this model assumes that there is a progression from a state of susceptibility to immunity through a period of pre-contagious infection to an infectious contagious status the third factor is clinical status namely asymptomatic symptomatic acute respiratory distress syndrome ards or deceased again there is an assumed progression from asymptomatic to ards where people with ards can either recover to an asymptomatic state or not finally the fourth factor represents diagnostic or testing status an individual can be untested or waiting for the results of a test that can either be positive or negative with this setup one can be in one of four places with any infectious status expressing symptoms or not and having test results or not note that-in this construction-it is possible to be infected and yet be asymptomatic however the marginal distributions are not independent by virtue of the dynamics that describe the transition among states within each factor crucially the transitions within any factor depend upon the marginal distribution of other factors for example the probability of becoming infected given that one is susceptible to infection depends upon whether one is at home or at work similarly the probability of developing symptoms depends upon whether one is infected or not the probability of testing negative depends upon whether one is susceptible or immune to infection and so on finally to complete the circular dependency the probability of leaving home to go to work depends upon the number of infected people in the population mediated by social distancing the curvilinear arrows denote a conditioning of transition probabilities on the marginal distributions over other factors these conditional dependencies constitute the mean field approximation and enable the dynamics to be solved or integrated over time at any point in time the probability of being in any combination of the four states determines what would be observed at the population level for example the occupancy of the deceased level of the clinical factor determines the current number of people who have recorded deaths similarly the occupancy of the positive level of the testing factor determines the expected number of positive cases reported from these expectations the expected number of new cases per day can be generated a more detailed description of the generative model-in terms of transition probabilities-can be found in in the main text this section describes the generative model summarised schematically in figure 1  while the data used to invert or fit this model are summarised in figure 2  these data comprise global worldwide timeseries from countries and regions from the initial reports of positive cases in china to the current day 5  figure 2 timeseries data this figure provides a brief overview of the timeseries used for subsequent modelling with a focus on the early trajectories of mortality the upper left panel shows the distribution over countries of the number of days after the onset of an outbreak-defined as 8 days before more than one case was reported at the time of writing 4 th april 2020 a substantial number of countries witnessed an outbreak lasting for more than 60 days the upper right panel plots the total number of deaths against the durations in the left panel those countries whose outbreak started earlier have greater cumulative deaths the middle left panel plots the new deaths reported per day over a 48-day period following the onset of an outbreak the colours of the lines denote different countries these countries are listed in the lower left panel which plots the cumulative death rate china is clearly the first country to be severely affected with remaining countries evincing an accumulation of deaths some 30 days after china the middle right panel is a logarithmic plot of the total deaths against population size in the initial 48-day period interestingly there is little correlation between the total number of deaths and population size however there is a stronger correlation between the total number of cases reported within the first 48 days and the cumulative deaths as shown in lower right panel in this period germany has the greatest ratio of total cases to deaths countries were included if their outbreak had lasted for more than 48 days and more than 16 deaths had been reported the timeseries were smoothed with a gaussian kernel full width half maximum of two days to account for erratic reporting eg recording deaths over the weekend the generative model is a mean field model of ensemble dynamics in other words it is a state space model where the states correspond to the sufficient statistics ie parameters of a probability distribution over the states of an ensemble or population-here a population of people who are in mutual contact at some point in their daily lives this kind of model is used routinely to model populations of neurons where the ensemble dynamics are cast as density dynamics under gaussian assumptions about the probability densities eg marreiros et al 2009  in other words a model of how the mean and covariance of a population affects itself and the means and covariances of other populations here we will focus on a single population and crucially use a discrete state space model this means that we will be dealing with the sufficient statistics ie expectations of the probability of being in a particular state at any one time this renders the model a compartmental model kermack et al 1997  where each state corresponds to a compartment these latent states evolve according to transition probabilities that embody the causal influences and conditional dependencies that lend an epidemic its characteristic form our objective is to identify the right conditional dependencies-and form posterior beliefs about the model parameters that mediate these dependencies having done this we can then simulate an entire trajectory into the distant future even if we are only given data about the beginning of an outbreak 6  the model considers four different sorts of states ie factors that provide a description of any individualsampled at random-that is sufficient to generate the data at hand in brief these factors were chosen to be as conditionally independent as possible to ensure an efficient estimation of the model parameters 7  the four factors were an individuals location infection status clinical status and diagnostic status in other words we considered that any member of the population can be characterised in terms of where they were whether they were infected infectious or immune whether they were showing mild and severe or fatal symptoms and whether they had been tested with an ensuing positive or negative result each of these factors had four levels for example the location factor was divided into home work critical care unit and the morgue these states should not be taken too literally for example home stands in for anywhere that has a limited risk of exposure to or contact with an infected person eg in the domestic home in a non-critical hospital bed in a care home etc work stands in for anywhere that has a larger risk of exposure to-or contact with-an infected person and therefore covers non-work activities such as going to the supermarket or participating in team sports similarly designating someone as severely ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is meant to cover any life-threatening conditions that would invite admission to intensive care having established the state space we can now turn to the causal aspect of the dynamic causal model the causal structure of these models depends upon the dynamics or transitions from one state or another it is at this point that a mean field approximation can be used mean field approximations are used widely in physics to approximate a full joint probability density with the product of a series of marginal densities bressloff and newby 2013 marreiros et al 2009 schumacher et al 2015 zhang et al 2018  in this case the factorisation is fairly subtle we will factorise the transition probabilities such that the probability of moving among states-within each factor-depends upon the marginal distribution of other factors with one exception for example the probability of developing symptoms when asymptomatic depends on and only on the probability that i am infected in what follows we will step through the conditional probabilities for each factor to show how the model is put together and could be changed the first factor has four levels home work ccu and the morgue people can leave home but will always return with unit probability over a day the probability of leaving home has a prior baseline rate of one third but is nuanced by any social distancing imperatives these imperatives are predicated on the proportion of the population that is currently infected such that the social distancing parameter an exponent determines the probability of leaving home 8  for example social distancing is modelled as the propensity to leave home and expose oneself to interpersonal contacts this can be modelled with the following transition probability this means that the probability of leaving home given i have no symptoms is the probability i would have gone out normally multiplied by a decreasing function of the proportion of people in the population who are infected formally this proportion is the marginal probability of being infected where the marginal probability of a factor is an average over the remaining factors the marginal probability p of the location factor is as follows where the final four equalities define each factor or state in the model the parameters in this social 8 we will license this assumption using bayesian model comparison later distancing model are the probability of leaving home every day  out  and the social distancing exponent the only other two places one can be are in a ccu or the morgue the probability of moving to critical care depends upon bed ie hospital availability which is modelled as a sigmoid function of the occupancy of this state ie the probability that a ccu bed is occupied and a bed capacity parameter a threshold if one has severe symptoms then one stays in the ccu finally the probability of moving to the morgue depends on and only on being deceased note that all these dependencies are different states of the clinical factor see below this means we can write the transition probabilities among the location factor for each level of the clinical factor as follows with a slight abuse of notation 1  is a decreasing sigmoid function in brief these transition probabilities mean that i will go out when asymptomatic unless social distancing is in play however when i have symptoms i will stay at home unless i am hospitalised with acute respiratory distress i remain in critical care unless i recover and go home or die and move to the morgue where i stay technically the morgue is an absorbing state in a similar way we can express the probability of moving between different states of infection ie susceptible infected infectious and immune as follows these transition probabilities mean that when susceptible the probability of becoming infected depends upon the number of social contacts-which depends upon the proportion of time spent at home this dependency is parameterised in terms of a transition probability per contact trn and the expected number of contacts at home rin and work rou 9  once infected one remains in this state for a period of time that is parameterised by a transition rate inf this parameterisation illustrates a generic property of transition probabilities namely an interpretation in terms of rate constants and implicitly time constants the rate parameter  is related to the rate constant  and time constant  according to in other words the probability of staying in any one state is determined by the characteristic length of time that state is occupied this means that the rate parameter above can be specified a priori in terms of the can be interpreted as a probability of eluding infection with each interpersonal contact such that the probability of remaining uninfected after r  contacts is given by r p   note that there is no distinction between people at home and at work both are equally likely to be infectious number of days we expect people to be infected before becoming infectious similarly we can parameterise the transition from being infectious to being immune in terms of a typical period of being contagious assuming that immunity is enduring and precludes reinfection 10  note that in the model everybody in the morgue is treated as having has acquired immunity the transitions among clinical states depend upon both the infection status and location as follows  the transitions among clinical states ie asymptomatic symptomatic ards and deceased are relatively straightforward if i am not infected ie susceptible or immune i will move to the asymptomatic state unless i am dead however if i am infected ie infected or infectious i will develop symptoms with a particular probability dev once i have developed symptoms i will remain symptomatic and either recover to an asymptomatic state or develop acute respiratory distress with a particular probability sev the parameterisation of these transitions depends upon the typical length of time that i remain symptomatic sym similarly when in acute respiratory distress rds however i may die following ards with a probability that depends upon whether i am in a ccu or elsewhere this is the exception mentioned above to the conditional dependencies on marginal densities here the probability of dying fat depends on being infected and my location i am more likely to die of ards if i am not in ccu where sur is the probability of surviving at home the implication here is that the transition probabilities depend upon two marginal densities as opposed to one for all the other factors see the first equality in 16 please refer to table 1 for details of the model parameters finally we turn to diagnostic testing status ie untested waiting or positive versus negative the transition probabilities here are parameterised in terms of test availability tft sen and the probability that i would have been tested anyway which is relatively smaller if i am asymptomatic tes test availability is a decreasing sigmoid function of the number of people who are waiting with a delay del for their results i can only move from being untested to waiting after this i can only go into positive or negative test states depending upon whether i have the virus ie infected or infectious or not 11  we can now assemble these transition probabilities into a probability transition matrix and iterate from the first day to some time horizon to generate a sequence of probability distributions over the joint space of all factors notice that this is a completely deterministic state space model because all the randomness is contained in the probabilities notice also that the transition probability matrix t is both state and time dependent because the transition probabilities above depend on marginal probabilities technically 18 is known as a master equation seifert 2012 vespignani and zapperi 1998 wang 2009  and forms the basis of the dynamic part of the dynamic causal model this model of transmission supports an effective reproduction number or rate r which summarises how many people i am likely to infect if i am infected this depends upon the probability that any contact will cause an infection the probability that the contact is susceptible to infection and number of people i contact 11 notice that this model is configured for new cases that are reported based on buccal swabs ie am i currently infected not tests for antibody or immunological status a different model would be required for forthcoming tests of immunity ie have i been infected furthermore one might consider the sensitivity and specificity of any test by including sensitivity and specificity in 17 for example 1 in 3 tests may be false negatives especially when avoiding bronchoalveolar lavage to minimise risk to clinicians wang w xu y gao r lu r han k wu g tan w 2020b detection of sars-cov-2 in different types of clinical specimens jama in this approximation the number of contacts i make is a weighted average of the number of people i could infect at home and the number of people i meet outside per day times the number of days i am contagious the effective reproduction rate is not a biological rate constant however it is a useful epidemiological summary statistic that indicates how quickly the disease spreads through a population when less than one the infection will decay to an endemic equilibrium we will use this measure later to understand the role of herd immunity this completes the specification of the generative model of latent states a list of the parameters and their prior means and variances is provided in table 1  notice that all of the parameters are scale parameters ie they are rates or probabilities that cannot be negative to enforce these positivity constraints one applies a log transform to the parameters during model inversion or fitting this has the advantage of being able to simplify the numerics using gaussian assumptions about the prior density via a lognormal assumption in other words although the scale parameters are implemented as probabilities or rates they are estimated as log parameters denoted by ln    note that prior variances are specified for log parameters for example a variance of 164 corresponds to a prior confidence interval of 25 and can be considered weakly informative sources mizumoto and chowell 2020 russell et al 2020 verity et al 2020 wang et al 2020a and

httpwwwimperialacukmrc-global-infectious-disease-analysiscovid-19 these prior expectations should be read as the effective rates and time constants as they manifest in a real-world setting for example a three-day period of contagion is shorter than the period that someone might be infectious wlfel et al 2020 12  on the prior assumption that they will self-isolate when they realise they could be contagious further parameters are required to generate data such as the size of the population and the number of people who are initially infected    nn  13  which parameterise the initial state of the population where  denotes 12 shedding of covid-19 viral rna from sputum can outlast the end of symptoms seroconversion occurs after 6-12 days but is not necessarily followed by a rapid decline of viral load 13 table 1 also includes a parameter for the proportion of people who are initially immune which we will call on later a kronecker tensor product 110 these parameters are unknown quantities that have to be estimated from the data however we still have to specify their prior densities this begs the question what kind of population are we trying to model there are several choices here ranging from detailed grid models of the sort used in weather forecasting palmer and laure 2013 and epidemiologic models ferguson et al 2006  one could use models based upon partial differential equations ie markov random field models deco et al 2008  in this technical report we will choose a simpler option that treats a pandemic as a set of linked point processes that can be modelled as rare events in other words we will focus on modelling a single outbreak in a region or city and treat the response of the next city as a discrete process post hoc this simplifies the generative model in the sense we only have to worry about the ensemble dynamics of the population that comprises one city  a complimentary perspective on this choice is that we are trying to model the first wave of an epidemic as it plays out in the first city to be affected any second wave can then be treated as the first wave of another city or region under this choice the population size can be set a priori to 1000000 noting that a small city comprises by definition a hundred thousand people while a large city can exceed 10 million note that this is a prior expectation the effective population size is estimated from the data the assumption that the effective population size reflects the total population of a country is a hypothesis that we will test later the likelihood or observation model the outcomes considered in figure 2 are new cases of positive tests and deaths per day these can be generated by multiplying the appropriate probability by the effective population size the appropriate probabilities here are just the expected occupancy of positive test and deceased states respectively because we are dealing with large populations the likelihood of any observed daily count has a binomial distribution that can be approximated by a gaussian density 14  here outcomes are counts of rare events with a small probability 1  of occurring in a large population of size 1 n  for example the likelihood of observing a timeseries of daily deaths can be expressed as a function of the model parameters as follows the advantage of this limiting large population case is that a variance stabilising square root transform of the data counts renders their variance unity with the priors and likelihood model in place we now have a full joint probability over causes parameters and consequences outcomes this is the generative model one can now use standard variational techniques friston et al 2007 to estimate the posterior over model parameters and evaluate a variational bound on the model evidence or marginal likelihood mathematically this is expressed as follows these expressions show that maximising the variational free energy f with respect to an approximate posterior  q  renders the kullback-leibler kl divergence between the true and approximate posterior as small as possible at the same time the free energy becomes a lower bound on the log evidence the free energy can then be used to compare different models where any differences correspond to a log bayes factor or odds ratio kass and raftery 1995 winn and bishop 2005  one may be asking why we have chosen this particular state space and this parameterisation are there alternative model structures or parameterisations that would be more fit for purpose the answer is that there will always be a better model where better is a model that has more evidence this means that the model has to be optimised in relation to empirical data this process is known as bayesian model comparison based upon model evidence winn and bishop 2005  for example in the above model we assumed that social distancing increases as a function of the proportion of the population who are infected 11 this stands in for a multifactorial influence on social behaviour that may be mediated in many ways for example government advice personal choices availability of transport media reports of panic buying and so on so what licenses us to model the causes of social distancing in terms of a probability that any member of the population is infected the answer rests upon bayesian model comparison when inverting the model using data from countries with more than 16 deaths see figure 2  we obtained a log evidence ie variational free energy of -15701 natural units nats when replacing the cause of social distancing with the probability of encountering someone with symptoms-or the number of people testing positivethe model evidence fell substantially to -15969 and -15909 nats respectively in other words there was overwhelming evidence in favour of infection rates as a primary drive for social distancing over and above alternative models we will return to the use of bayesian model comparison later when asking what factors determine differences between each countrys response to the pandemic table 1 lists all the model parameters henceforth dcm parameters in total there are 21 dcm parameters this may seem like a large number to estimate from the limited amount of data available see figure 2  the degree to which a parameter is informed by the data depends upon how changes in the parameter are expressed in data space for example increasing the effective population size will uniformly elevate the expected cases per day conversely decreasing the number of initially infected people will delay the curve by shifting it in time in short a parameter can be identified if it has a relatively unique expression in the data this speaks to an important point the information in the data is not just in the total count-it is in the shape or form of the transient 15  on this view there are many degrees of freedom in a timeseries that can be leveraged to identify a highly parameterised model the issue of whether the model is over parameterised or under parameterised is exactly the issue resolved by bayesian model comparison namely the removal of redundant parameters to suppress model complexity and ensure generalisation see 113 16  one therefore requires the best measures 15 a transient here refers to a transient perturbation to a system characterising a response that evolves over time 16 intuitively this can be likened to a bat inverting its generative model of the world using the transients created by echo location the shape of the transient contains an enormous amount of information provided the bat has a good model of how echoes are generated exactly the same principle applies here if one can find the right model one can go beyond the immediate information in the data to make some precise inferences-based upon prior beliefs that constitute the generative model this kind of abductive inference speaks to the importance of having a good forward or generative model-and the ability to select the best model based upon model evidence of model evidence this is the primary motivation for using variational bayes here variational laplace friston et al 2007  the variational free energy in most circumstances provides a better approximation than alternatives such as the widely used akaike information criteria and the widely used bayesian information criteria penny 2012 one special aspect of the model above is that it has absorbing states for example whenever one enters the morgue becomes immune dies or has a definitive test result one stays in that state see figure 1  this is important because it means the long-term behaviour of the model has a fixed point in other words we know what the final outcomes will be these outcomes are known as endemic equilibria this means that the only uncertainty is about the trajectory from the present point in time to the distant future we will see later that-when quantified in terms of bayesian credible intervals-this uncertainty starts to decrease as we go into the distant future this should be contrasted with alternative models that do not parameterise the influences that generate outcomes and therefore call upon exogenous inputs eg statutory changes in policy or changes in peoples behaviour if these interventions are unknown they will accumulate uncertainty over time by design we elude this problem by including everything that matters within the model and parameterising strategic responses like social distancing as an integral part of the transition probabilities we have made the simplifying assumption that every country reporting new cases is effectively reporting the first wave of an affected region or city clearly some countries could suffer simultaneous outbreaks in multiple cities this is accommodated by an effective population size that could be greater than the prior expectation of 1 million this is an example of finding a simple model that best predicts outcomes-that may not be a veridical reflection of how those outcomes were actually generated in other words we will assume that each country behaves as if it has a single large city of at-risk denizens in the next section we look at the parameter estimates that obtain by pooling information from all countries with a focus on between country differences before turning to the epidemiology of a single country the united kingdom hitherto we have focused on a generative model for a single city however in a pandemic many cities will be affected this calls for a hierarchical generative model that considers the response of each city at the first level and a global response at the second this is an important consideration because it means from a bayesian perspective knowing what happens elsewhere places constraints ie bayesian shrinkage priors on estimates of what is happening in a particular city clearly this rests upon the extent to which certain model parameters are conserved from one city to another-and which are idiosyncratic or unique this is a problem of hierarchical bayesian modelling or parametric empirical bayes friston et al 2016 kass and steffey 1989  in the illustrative examples below we will adopt a second level model in which key log parameters are sampled from a gaussian distribution with a global worldwide mean and variance from the perspective of the generative model this means that to generate a pandemic one first samples city-specific parameters from a global distribution adds a random effect and uses the ensuing parameters to generate a timeseries for each city this section considers the modelling of country-specific parameters under a simple general linear model of between-country effects this second level model requires us to specify which parameters are shared in a meaningful way between countries and which are unique to each country technically this can be cast as the difference between random and fixed effects designating a particular parameter as a random effect means that this parameter was generated by sampling from a countrywide distribution while a fixed effect is unique to each country under a general linear model the distribution for random effects is gaussian in other words to generate the parameter for a particular country we take the global expectation and add a random gaussian variate whose variance has to be estimated under suitable hyperpriors furthermore one has to specify systematic differences between countries in terms of independent variables for example does the latitude of a country have any systematic effect on the size of the at-risk population the general linear model used here comprises a constant ie the expectation or mean of each parameter over countries the logarithms of total population size and a series of independent variables based upon a discrete sine transform of latitude and longitude the latter variables stand in for any systematic and geopolitical differences among countries that vary smoothly with their location notice that the total population size may or may not provide useful constraints on the effective size of the population at the first level under this hierarchical model a bigger country may have a transport and communication infrastructure that could reduce the effective at risk population size a hint that this may be the case is implicit in figure 2  where there is no apparent relationship between the early incidence of deaths and total population size in the examples below we treated the number of initial cases and the parameters pertaining to testing as fixed effects and all remaining parameters as random effects the number of initial infected people determines the time at which a particular country evinces its outbreak although this clearly depends upon geography and other factors there is no a priori reason to assume a random variation about an average onset time similarly we assume that each countrys capacity for testing was a fixed effect thereby accommodating non-systematic testing or reporting strategies 17  note that in this kind of modelling outcomes such as new cases can only be interpreted in relation to the probability of being tested and the availability of tests 18  with this model in place we can now use standard procedures for parametric empirical bayesian modelling friston et al 2016 kass and steffey 1989 to estimate the second level parameters that couple betweencountry independent variables to country-specific parameters of the dcm however there are a large number of these parameters-that may or may not contribute to model evidence in other words we need some way of removing redundant parameters based upon bayesian model comparison this calls upon another standard procedure called bayesian model reduction friston et al 2018 friston et al 2016  in brief bayesian model reduction allows one to evaluate the evidence for a model that one would have obtained if the model had been reduced by removing one or more parameters the key aspect of bayesian model reduction is that this evidence can be evaluated using the posteriors and priors of a parent model that includes all possible parameters there are clearly an enormous number of combinations of parameters that one could consider fortunately these can be scored quickly and efficiently using bayesian model reduction by making use of savage-dickey density ratios friston and penny 2011 savage 1954  because bayesian model reduction scores the effect of changing the precision of priors-on model evidence-it can be regarded as an automatic bayesian sensitivity analysis also known as robust bayesian analysis berger 2011  figure 3 shows the results of this analysis the upper panels show the posterior probability of 256 models that had the greatest evidence shown as a log posterior in the upper left panel each of these models corresponds to a particular combination of parameters that have been switched off by shrinking their prior variance to zero by averaging the posterior estimates in proportion to the evidence for each model -known as bayesian model averaging hoeting et al 1999 -we can eliminate redundant parameters and thereby provide a simpler explanation for differences among countries this is illustrated in the lower panels which show the posterior densities before left and after right bayesian model reduction these estimates are shown in terms of their expectation or maximum a posteriori map value as blue bars with 90 bayesian credible intervals as pink bars the first 21 parameters are the global expectations of the dcm parameters the remaining parameters are the coefficients that link various independent variables at the second level to the parameters of the transition probabilities at the first note that a substantial number of second level parameters have been removed however many are retained this suggests that there are systematic variations over countries in certain random effects at the country level figure 4 provides an example based upon the largest effect mediated by the independent variables in this analysis latitude ie distance from the south pole appears to reduce the effective size of an at-risk population in other words countries in the northern hemisphere have a smaller effective population size relative to countries in the southern hemisphere clearly there may be many reasons for this for example systematic differences in temperature or demographics figure 3 bayesian model reduction this figure reports the results of bayesian model reduction in this instance the models compared are at the second or between-country level in other words the models compared contained all combinations of second level parameters a parameter is removed by setting its prior variance to zero if the model evidence increases-in virtue of reducing model complexity-then this parameter is redundant the upper panels show the relative evidence of the most likely 256 models in terms of log evidence left panel and the corresponding posterior probability right panel redundant parameters are illustrated in the lower panels by comparing the posterior expectations before and after the bayesian model reduction the blue bars correspond to posterior expectations while the pink bars denote 90 bayesian credible intervals the key thing to take from this analysis is that a large number of second level parameters have been eliminated these second level parameters encode the effects of population size and geographical location on each of the parameters of the generative model the next figure illustrates the nonredundant effects that can be inferred with almost 100 posterior confidence figure 4 between country effects this figure shows the relationship between parameters of the generative model and the explanatory variables in a general linear model of between country effects the left panel shows a regression of country-specific dcm parameters on the independent variable that had the greatest absolute value namely the contribution of an explanatory variable to a model parameter here the effective size of the population appears to depend upon the latitude of a country the right panel shows the absolute values of the glm parameters in matrix form showing that the effective size of the population was most predictable the largest values are in white though not necessarily predictable by total population size the red circle highlights the parameter mediating the relationship illustrated in the left panel figure 5 shows the bayesian parameter averages litvak et al 2015 of the dcm parameters over countries the posterior density blue bars and pink lines are supplemented with the prior expectations red bars for comparison the upper panel shows the map estimates of log parameters while the lower panel shows the same results in terms of scale parameters the key thing to take from this analysis is the tight credible intervals on the parameters when averaging in this way according to this analysis the number of effective contacts at home is about three people while this increases by an order of magnitude to about 30 people when leaving home the symptomatic and acute respiratory distress periods have been estimated here at about five and 13 days respectively with a delay in testing of about two days these are the values that provide the simplest explanation for the global data at hand-and are in line with empirical estimates 19  figure 5 bayesian parameter averages this figure reports the bayesian parameter averages over countries following a hierarchical or parametric empirical bayesian analysis that tests for-and applies shrinkage priors toposterior parameter estimates for each country the upper panel shows the parameters as estimated in log space while the lower panel shows the same results for the corresponding scale nonnegative parameters the blue bars report posterior expectations while the thinner red bars in the upper panel are prior expectations the pink bars denote 90 bayesian credible intervals one can interpret these parameters as the average value for any given parameter of the generative model to which a random country-specific effect is added to generate the ensemble dynamics for each country in turn these ensemble distributions determine the likelihood of various outcome measures under large number ie gaussian assumptions figure 6 shows the country-specific parameter estimates for 12 of the 21 dcm parameters these posterior densities were evaluated under the empirical priors from the parametric empirical bayesian analysis above as one might expect-in virtue of the second level effects that survived bayesian model reduction-there are some substantial differences between countries in certain parameters for example the effective population size in the united states of america is substantially greater than elsewhere at about 25 million the population in new york state is about 194 million the effective population size in the uk dominated by cases in london is estimated to be about 25 million london has a population of about 75 million 20  social distancing seems to be effective and sensitive to infection rates in france but much less so in canada the efficacy of social distancing in terms of the difference between the number of contacts at home and work is notably attenuated in the united kingdom-that has the greatest number of home contacts and the least number of work contacts other notable differences are the increased probability of fatality in critical care evident in china this is despite the effective population size being only about 25 million again these assertions are not about actual states of affairs these are the best explanations for the data under the simplest model of how those data were caused figure 6 differences among countries this figure reports the differences among countries in terms of selected parameters of the generative model ranging from the effective population size through to the probability of testing its denizens the blue bars represent the posterior expectations while the pink bars are 90 bayesian credible intervals notice that these intervals are not symmetrical about the mean because we are reporting scale parametersas opposed to log parameters for each parameter the countries showing the smallest and largest values are labelled the red asterisk denotes the country considered in the next section the united kingdom the next figure illustrates the projections in terms of new deaths and cases based upon these parameter estimates the order of the countries is listed in figure 2  this level of modelling is important because it enables the data or information from one country to inform estimates of the first level dcm parameters that underwrite the epidemic in another country 21  this is another expression of the importance of having a hierarchical generative model for making sense of the data here the generative model has latent causes that span different countries thereby enabling the fusion of multimodal data from multiple countries eg new test or death rates two natural questions now arise are there any systematic differences between countries in the parameters that shape epidemiological dynamics-and what do these dynamics or trajectories look like this concludes our brief treatment of between country effects in which we have considered the potentially important role of bayesian model reduction in identifying systematic variations in the evolution of an epidemic from country to country the next section turns to the use of hierarchically informed estimates of dcm parameters to characterise an outbreak in a single country this section drills down on the likely course of the epidemic in the uk based upon the posterior density over dcm parameters afforded by the hierarchical parametric empirical bayesian analysis of the previous section listed in table 2  figure 7 shows the expected trajectory of death rates new cases and occupancy of ccu beds over a six-month 180 day period these posterior predictive densities are shown in terms of an expected trajectory and 90 credible intervals blue line and shaded areas respectively the black dots represent empirical data available at the time of writing notice that the generative model can produce outcomes that may or may not be measured here the estimates are based upon the new cases and deaths in figure 2  the panels on the left show that our confidence about the causes of new cases is relatively high during the period for which we have data and then becomes uncertain in the future this reflects the fact that the data are informing those parameters that shaped the initial transient whereas other parameters responsible for the late peak and subsequent trajectory are less informed notice that the uncertainty about cumulative deaths itself accumulates on this analysis we can be 90 confident that in five weeks between 13000 and 22000 people may have died relative to the total population the proportion of people dying is very small however the cumulative death rates in absolute numbers are substantial in relation to seasonal influenza indicated with broken red lines although cumulative death rates are small they are concentrated within a short period of time with near-identical ccu needs-with the risk of over-whelming available capacity not to mention downstream effects from blocking other hospital admissions to prioritise the pandemic figure 7 projected outcomes this figure reports predicted 22 new deaths and cases and ccu occupancy for an exemplar country here the united kingdom the panels on the left show the predicted outcomes as a function of 22 we will use predictions-as opposed to projections-when appropriate to emphasise the point that the generative model is not a timeseries model in the sense that the unknown quantities dcm parameters do not change with time this means the there is uncertainty about predictions in the future and the past given uncertainty about the parameters see figure 7  this should be contrasted with the notion of forecasting or projection however predictions in the future in this setting can be construed as projections weeks the blue lines correspond to the expected trajectory while the shaded areas are 90 bayesian credible intervals the black dots represent empirical data upon which the parameter estimates are based the lower right panel shows the parameter estimates for the country in question as in previous figures the prior expectations are shown as pink bars over the posterior expectations and credible intervals the upper right panel illustrates the equivalent expectations in terms of cumulative deaths the dotted red lines indicate the number of people who died from seasonal influenza in recent years 23  the key point to take from this figure is the quantification of uncertainty inherent in the credible intervals in other words uncertainty about the parameters propagates through to uncertainty in predicted outcomes this uncertainty changes over time because of the nonlinear relationship between model parameters and ensemble dynamics by model design one can be certain about the final states however uncertainty about cumulative death rates itself accumulates the mapping from parameters through ensemble dynamics to outcomes is mediated by latent or hidden states the trajectory of these states is illustrated in the next figure the underlying latent causes of these trajectories are shown in figure 8  the upper panels reproduce the expected trajectories of the previous figure while the lower panels show the underlying latent states in terms of expected rates or probabilities for example the social distancing measures are expressed in terms of an increasing probability of being at home given the accumulation of infected cases in the population during the peak expression of death rates the proportion of people who are immune herd immunity increases to about 30 and then asymptotes at about 90 this period is associated with a marked increase in the probability of developing symptoms peaking at about 11 weeks after the first reported cases interestingly under these projections the number of people expected to be in critical care should not exceed capacity at its peak the upper bound of the 90 credible interval for ccu occupancy is approximately 4200 this is within the current ccu capacity of london corresponding to the projected capacity of the temporary nightingale hospital 24 in london uk figure 8 latent causes of observed consequences the upper panels reproduce the expected trajectories of the previous figure for an example country here the united kingdom the expected death rate is shown in blue new cases in red predicted recovery rate in orange and ccu occupancy in yellow the black dots correspond to empirical data the lower four panels show the evolution of latent ensemble dynamics in terms of the expected probability of being in various states the first location panel shows that after about 5 to 6 weeks there is sufficient evidence for the onset of an episode to induce social distancing such that the probability of being found at work falls over a couple of weeks to negligible levels at this time the number of infected people increases to about 32 with a concomitant probability of being infectious a few days later during this time the probability of becoming immune increases monotonically and saturates at about 20 weeks clinically the probability of becoming symptomatic rises to about 30 with a small probability of developing acute respiratory distress and possibly death these probabilities are very small and cannot be seen in this graph in terms of testing there is a progressive increase in the number of people tested with a concomitant decrease in those untested or waiting for their results interestingly initially the number of negative tests increases monotonically while the proportion of positive tests starts to catch up during the peak of the episode under these parameters the entire episode lasts for about 10 weeks or less than three months the broken red line in the upper left panel shows the typical number of ccu beds available to a well-resourced city prior to the outbreak it is natural to ask which dcm parameters contributed the most to the trajectories in figure 8  this is addressed using a sensitivity analysis intuitively this involves changing a particular parameter and seeing how much it affects the outcomes of interest figure 9 reports a sensitivity analysis of the parameters in terms of their direct contribution to cumulative deaths upper panel and how they interact lower panel these are effectively the gradient and hessian matrix respectively of predicted cumulative deaths the bars in the upper panel pointing to the left indicate parameters that decrease total deaths these include social distancing and bed availability which are-to some extent-under our control other factors that improve fatality rates include the symptomatic and acute respiratory distress periods and the probability of surviving outside critical care these at the present time are not so amenable to intervention note that initial immunity has no effect in this analysis because we clamped the initial values to zero with very precise priors we will relax this later first we look at the effect of social distancing by simulating the ensemble dynamics under increasing levels of the social distancing exponent ie the sensitivity of our social distancing and self-isolation behaviour to the prevalence of the virus in the community as one might expect increasing social distancing bed availability and the probability of survival outside critical care tend to decrease death rate interestingly increasing both the period of symptoms and ards decreases overall death rate because in this compartmental model keeping someone alive for longer in a ccu reduces fatality rates as long as capacity is not exceeded the lower panel shows the second order derivatives these reflect the effect of one parameter on the effect of another parameter on total deaths for example the effects of bed availability and fatality in ccu are positive meaning that the beneficial negative effects of increasing bed availability-on total deaths-decrease with fatality rates it may be surprising to see that social distancing has such a small effect on total deaths see upper panel in figure 9  however the contribution of social distancing is in the context of how the epidemic elicits other responses for example increases in critical care capacity quantitatively speaking increasing social distancing only delays the expression of morbidity in the population it does not in and of itself decrease the cumulative cost although it buys time to develop capacity treatments and primary interventions this is especially the case if there is no effective limit on critical care capacity because everybody who needs a bed can be accommodated this speaks to the interaction between different causes or parameters in generating outcomes in the particular case of the uk the results in figure 4 suggest that although social distancing is in play self-isolation appears limited this is because the number of contacts at home is relatively high at over five thereby attenuating the effect of social distancing in other words slowing the spread of the virus depends upon reducing the number of contacts by social distancing however this will only work if there is a notable difference between the number of contacts at home and work one can illustrate this by simulating the effects of social distancing when it makes a difference figure 10 reproduces the results in figure 8 but for 16 different levels of the social distancing parameter while using the posterior expectation for contacts at home of about four from the bayesian parameter average social distancing is expressed in terms of the probability of being found at home or work see the panel labelled location as we increase social distancing the probability and duration of being at home during the outbreak increases this flattens the curve of death rates per day from about 600 to a peak of about 400 this is the basis of the mitigation curve flattening strategies that have been adopted worldwide the effect of this strategy is to reduce cumulative deaths and prevent finite resources being overwhelmed in this example from about 17000 to 14000 potentially saving about 3000 people this is roughly four times the number of people who die in the equivalent period due to road traffic accidents interestingly these posterior predictive projections suggest that social distancing can lead to an endgame in which not everybody has to be immune see the middle panel labelled infection we now look at herd immunity using the same analysis figure 10 the effects of social distancing this figure uses the same format as figure 9  however here trajectories are reproduced under different levels of social distancing from zero through to four in 16 steps this parameter is the exponent applied to the probability of not being infected in other words it scores the sensitivity of social distancing to the prevalence of the virus in the population in this example based upon posterior expectations for the united kingdom and bayesian parameter averages over countries death rates per day decrease progressively with social distancing the cumulative death rate is shown as a function of social distancing in the upper right panel the vertical line corresponds to the posterior expectation of the social distancing exponent for this country these results suggest that social distancing relieves pressure on critical care capacities and ameliorates cumulative deaths by about 3000 people note that these projections are based upon an effective social distancing policy at home with about four contacts in the next figure we repeat this analysis but looking at the effect of herd immunity figure 11 reproduces the results in figure 10 using the united kingdom posterior estimatesbut varying the initial herd immunity over 16 levels from effectively 0 to 100 the effects of herd immunity are marked with cumulative deaths ranging from about 18000 with no immunity to very small numbers with a herd immunity of about 70 the broken red lines in the upper right panel are the number of people dying from seasonal influenza as in figure 7  these projections suggest that there is a critical level of herd immunity that will effectively avert an epidemic in virtue of reducing infection rates such that the spread of the virus decays exponentially if we now return to figure 8  it can be seen that the critical level of herd immunity will on the basis of these projections be reached 2 to 3 weeks after the peak in death rates at this point-according to the model-social distancing starts to decline as revealed by an increase in the probability of being at work we will put some dates on this trajectory by expressing it as a narrative in the conclusion from a modelling perspective the influence of initial herd immunity is important because it could form the basis of modelling the spread of the virus from city to another-and back again in other words more sophisticated generative models can be envisaged in which an infected person from one city is transported to another city with a small probability or rate reciprocal exchange between cities and ensuing second waves will then depend sensitively on the respective herd immunities in different regions anecdotally other major pandemics without social isolation strategies have almost invariably been followed by a second peak that is as high eg the 2009 h1n1 pandemic or higher than the first under the current model this would be handled in terms of a second region being infected by the first city and so on like a chain of dominos or the spread of a bushfire rhodes and anderson 1998 zhang and tang 2016  crucially the effect of the second city ie wave on the first will be sensitive to the herd immunity established by the first wave in this sense it is interesting to know how initial levels of immunity shape a regional outbreak under idealised assumptions figure 12 illustrates the interaction between immunity and viral spread as characterised by the effective reproduction rate r aka number or ratio see 19 this figure plots the predicted death rates for the united kingdom and the accompanying fluctuations in r and herd immunity where both are treated as outcomes of the generative model the key thing to observe is that with low levels of immunity r is fairly high at around 25 current estimates of the basic reproduction ratio 25 r0 in the literature range from 14 to 39 as soon as social distancing comes into play r falls dramatically to almost 0 however when social distancing is relaxed some weeks later r remains low due to the partial acquisition of herd immunity during peak of the epidemic note that herd immunity in this setting pertains to and only to the effective or at-risk population 80 herd immunity a few months from onset would otherwise be overly optimistic compared to other de novo pandemics eg donaldson et al 2009  on the other hand an occult herd immunity ie not accompanied by symptoms is consistent with undocumented infection and rapid dissemination  note that this way of characterising the spread of a virus depends upon many variables in this model two factors and three parameters and can vary from country to country repeating the above analysis for china gives a much higher an initial or basic reproduction rate which is consistent with empirical reports steven et al 2020  this concludes our characterisation of projections for what is likely to happen and what could happen under different scenarios for a particular country in the final section we revisit the confidence with which these posterior predictive projections can be made variational approaches-of the sort described in this technical report-use all the data at hand to furnish statistically efficient estimates of model parameters and evidence this contrasts with alternative approaches based on cross-validation in the cross-validation schemes model evidence is approximated by cross-validation accuracy in other words the evidence for a model is scored by the log likelihood that some withheld or test data can be explained by the model although model comparison based upon a variational evidence bound renders cross-validation unnecessary one can apply the same procedures to demonstrate predictive validity figure 13 illustrates this by fitting partial timeseries from one country italy using the empirical priors afforded by the parametric empirical bayesian analysis these partial data comprise the early phase of new cases if the model has predictive validity the ensuing posterior predictive density should contain the data that was withheld during estimation figure 13 presents an example of forward prediction over a 10-day period that contains the peak death rate in this example the withheld data are largely within the 90 credible intervals speaking to the predictive validity of the generative model there are two caveats here first similar analyses using very early timeseries from italy failed to predict the peak because of insufficient initial constraints in the data second the credible intervals probably suffer from the well-known overconfidence problem in variational bayes and the implicit mean field approximation mackay 2003 26  figure 13 predictive validity this figure uses the same format as figure 7  however here the posterior estimates are based upon partial data from early in the timeseries for an exemplar country italy these estimates were obtained under parametric empirical bayesian priors the red dots show outcomes that were not used to estimate the expected trajectories and credible intervals this example illustrates the predictive validity of the estimates for a 10-day period following the last datapoint which capture the rise to the peak of new cases 26 note further that the credible intervals can include negative values this is an artefact of the way in which the intervals are computed here we used a first-order taylor expansion to propagate uncertainty about the parameters through to uncertainty about the outcomes however because this generative model is non-linear in the parameters high-order terms are necessarily neglected we have rehearsed variational procedures for the inversion of a generative model of a viral epidemic-and have extended this model using hierarchical bayesian inference parametric empirical bayes to deal with the differential responses of each country in the context of a worldwide pandemic clearly this narrative is entirely conditioned on the generative model used to make these predictions eg the assumption of lasting immunity which may or may not be true the narrative is offered in a deliberately definitive fashion to illustrate the effect of resolving uncertainty about what will happen it has been argued that many deleterious effects of the pandemic are mediated by uncertainty this is probably true at both a psychological level-in terms of stress and anxiety davidson 1999 mcewen 2000 peters et al 2017 and at an economic level in terms of loss of confidence and uncertainty about markets put simply the harmful effects of the coronavirus pandemic are not just what will happen but the effects of the uncertainty about what will happen this is a key motivation behind procedures that quantify uncertainty above and beyond being able to evaluate the evidence for different hypotheses about what will happen one aspect of this is reflected in rhetoric such as there is no clear exit strategy it is reassuring to note that if one subscribes to the above model there is a clear exit strategy inherent in the self-organised mitigation 27 afforded by herd immunity for example within a week of the peak death rate there should be sufficient herd immunity to preclude any resurgence of infections in say london the term self-organised is used carefully here this is because we are part of this process through the effect of social distancing on our location contact with infected people and subsequent dissemination of covid-19 in other words this formulation does not preclude strategic eg nonpharmacological interventions rather it embraces them as part of the self-organising ensemble dynamics there are several outstanding issues that present themselves the generative model-at both the first and second level-needs to be explored more thoroughly at the first level this may entail the addition of other factors for example splitting the population into age groups or different classes of clinical vulnerability procedurally this should be fairly simple by specifying the dcm parameters for each age group or cohort separately and precluding transitions between age groups or cohorts one could also consider the fine graining of states within each factor for example making a more careful distinction between being in and not in critical care eg being in self-isolation being in a hospital community care home rural or urban location and so on at the between city or country level the parameters of the general linear model could be easily extended to include a host of demographic and geographic independent variables finally it would be fairly straightforward to use increasingly finegrained outcomes using regional timeseries as opposed to country timeseries these data are currently available from httpsgithubcomcssegisanddatacovid-19 another plausible extension to the hierarchical model is to include previous outbreaks of mers and sars middle east and severe acute respiratory syndrome respectively in the model this would entail supplementing the timeseries with historical ie legacy data and replicating the general linear model for each type of virus in effect this would place empirical priors or constraints on any parameter that shares characteristics with mers-cov and sars-cov in terms of the model parameters-as opposed to model structure-more precise knowledge about the underlying causes of an epidemic will afford more precise posteriors in other words more information about the dcm parameters can be installed through adjusting the prior expectations and variances the utility of these adjustments would then be assessed in terms of model evidence this may be particularly relevant as reliable data about bed occupancy proportion of people recovered etc becomes available a key aspect of the generative model used in this technical report is that it precludes any exogenous interventions of a strategic sort in other words the things that matter are built into the model and estimated as latent causes however prior knowledge about fluctuating factors such as closing schools or limiting international air flights could be entered by conditioning the dcm parameters on exogenous inputs this would explicitly install intervention policies into the model again these conditions would only be licensed by an increase in model evidence ie through comparing the evidence for models with and without some structured intervention this may be especially important when it comes to modelling future interventions for example a sawtooth social distancing protocol a simple example of this kind of extension would be including a time dependent increase in the capacity for testing at present constraints on testing rates are assumed to be constant a complementary approach would be to explore models in which social distancing depends upon variables that can be measured or inferred reliably eg the rate of increase of people testing positive and optimise the parameters of the ensuing model to minimise cumulative deaths in principle this should provide an operational equation that could be regarded as an adaptive social distancing policy which accommodates as much as can be inferred about the epidemiology as possible a key outstanding issue is the modelling of how one region or city affects another-and how the outbreak spreads from region to region this may be an important aspect of these kinds of models especially when it comes to modelling second waves as echoes of infection which are reflected back to the original epicentre as noted above the ability of these echoes to engender a second wave may be sensitively dependent on the herd immunity established during the first episode herd immunity is therefore an important currently latent or unobserved state this speaks to the importance of antibody testing in furnishing empirical constraints on herd immunity in turn this motivates antibody testing even if the specificity and sensitivity of available tests are low sensitivity and specificity are not only part of generative models they can be estimated along with the other model parameters in this setting the role of antibody testing would be to provide data for population modelling and strategic advice-not to establish whether any particular person is immune or not eg to allow them to go back to work finally it would be useful to assess the construct validity of the variational scheme adopted in dynamic causal modelling in relation to schemes that do not make mean field approximations these schemes usually rely upon some form of sampling eg markov chain monte carlo sampling and cross-validation cross-validation accuracy can be regarded as a useful but computationally expensive proxy for model evidence and is the usual way that modellers perform automatic bayesian computation given the prevalence of these sampling based non-variational schemes it would be encouraging if both approaches converged on roughly the same predictions the aim of this technical report is to place variational schemes on the table so that construct validation becomes a

michele carbone joshua green b enrico bucci m john lednicky j m  d   in this issue of jto tian et al 1  provide the first description of early pathology of coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 as of today feb 26 2020 there have been over 78000 confirmed cases and over 2500 deaths in china based on the official figure by the national health commission of china infections are rapidly spreading in the us europe south korea iran and other countries coronavirus disease-2019 has already caused havoc to travel and global markets and has the potential to become a devastating disease in china and globally it is important to realize however that since we are in the early stages of this outbreak many data are incomplete and some are unreliable in this early stage of the outbreak the rate of positivity outside china is influenced mainly by two factors 1 whether the city or country has a large chinese community or is visited by large number of chinese tourists and 2 by the number of tests conducted for example among european countries italy has performed a high number of tests for sars-cov-2 which is the virus that causes covid-19 as of february 26 of 9587 individuals tested 400 were positive for sars-cov-2 and are currently being retested to verify the results not surprisingly italy has a much higher number of positive cases than france which tested less than 50018 positive germany which tested a few hundred19 positive etc even within italy there are major discrepancies the press reported that infections are almost exclusively occurring in the regions of lombardia and veneto a review of the data revealed that as of feb 26 2020 lombardia had tested 3208 individuals mostly with flu-like and upper respiratory symptoms and 258 were positive veneto had tested 4900 and 71 were positive in contrast the centersouth of italy regions of abruzzo basilicata calabria campania molise and sardinia together had tested a total of 27 people none was positive in other words the more tests are performed the more individuals are found positive for sars cov-2 and obviously unless people are tested sars cov-2 infections cannot be identified  figure 1  it is clear from these numbers that it makes little sense to restrict travel to those from lombardia and veneto -who now are prohibited from entering several foreign countries-while allowing italians from other regions where only few or no tests were performed to travel the same argument applies to other european countries where testing has been minimal and applies also to the us where as of february 25 th only 426 patients had been tested 2 for example hawaii a state with a large chinese community and large numbers of tourists from china is presumed to be free of sars-cov-2 infections the problem is that nobody has been tested as of february 26 in hawaii we can predict that in the coming weeks we will have to rethink much of what we heard about the spread of this disease another problem is that the diagnosis for sars cov-2 infection is currently largely based on rt-pcr and unfortunately it is unreliable because of a high rate of false negative and some false positive results especially in places that perform this test in large numbers as for example during the hubei crisis in that context the sensitivity of the pcr assay has been found largely inferior to that of a chest ct 3 the main reason for false negative results has been traced to faulty science in the design of some pcr kits connected to their production and standardization under pressure from the burgeoning epidemics faulty pcr tests have been connected to severe under-detection rates in china 4 and were identified also in the us 5 another reason for false negatives is that the swab used to collect the sample needs to reach the deeper pharynx which is a delicate procedure when many patients are in line for a test and there is pressure to hurry up it is easy to miss pcr-negative patients are sent home and they infect more people false positives are also common in these circumstances because tests are performed in hospitals with a fairly large number of patients thus in environments with high viral load pcr being a sensitive test it can easily produce false positive results  however if the test is performed with a correct set of primers and in ideal conditions which means not in a hurry not in an environment where there are many carriers then it is probably reliable 6 elisa assays which since last week became available in china and elsewhere are much more reliable and sensitive 7 and should hopefully soon replace rt-pcr testing fortunately about 80 of infected patients require no specific treatment the disease for them is mild like a common flu treatment is at the moment symptomatic there is no scientific evidence that any specific antiviral drug works better than others -albeit several clinical trials show some promising results for a few compounds by far most people who develop a serious disease are over 70 years old among them cancer patients are at particularly high risk because they are immune-depressed cancer patients are also more likely to develop a more aggressive disease and die of it 8 why do patients die prior to this report there had not been any data describing the early anatomic pathology lesions of this disease this dearth of pathology description made it difficult to understand the pathogenesis of covid-19 therefore for prevention infection control and treatment we rely on current knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which is caused by sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov justification for these practices stems from the genetic similarity of sars cov to sars cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 and to similarities in the clinical presentations of the illnesses caused by these viruses when did covid-19 emerge the emergence of a coronavirus not previously detected in humans was first reported in december 2019 in wuhan hubei province in china by the time the chinese government decided to forbid residents to travel about 5 million of the 14 million residents had already left wuhan because of the chinese new year holidays and because of a last minute wave of exodus which occurred as citizens fled wuhan just before the lockdown of the city became effective at 10 am 23 january 2020 according to official reports from the chinese government and to peer-reviewed manuscript published in the past few days 9 the disease first manifested in early december when a small number of cases started to occur the disease was characterized by fever dry cough and dyspnea tests for all known respiratory tract pathogens were negative since then we have learned that this disease causes death in a significant number of patients particularly the elderly and in cancer patients 8 in china the case fatality rate cfr ratio of deaths for the total number of people diagnosed with this disease has been between 2-3 although it has been as high as 46 in wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak the cause of death among infected patients is respiratory failure patients show greatly impaired respiratory function and they supposedly suffer alveolar damage as even assisted oxygenation and intubation does not save their lives however until the publication of this report 1 in jto we did not know the underlying pathological changes responsible for the respiratory failure in these patients anatomic pathology studies of lung biopsy material have not been performed because they are not necessary to make the diagnosis autopsies were prohibited in china for fear that those performing the autopsy could become infected only recently the chinese government allowed autopsies to be performed in p3-biosafety level facilities -p3-suites for autopsy are not available in wuhan the first report of a postmortem biopsy in a single patient who died of covid-19 was published a few days ago 10  after the paper by tian et al 1  had been submitted to jto these two papers allow us to see how the diseases develops and progresses the paper by tian et al 1 was a result of an international collaboration between the senior author dr xiao a professor at the university of chicago us who also works several months of the year at wuhan university where he chairs the department of pathology and his colleagues in wuhan dr xiao was in wuhan when the city found itself at the center of an epidemic and the hospitals were suddenly hit with an overwhelming number of patients many of them severely ill healthcare authorities and workers scrambled to offer as much care as possible to those who needed it several of them got infected and died of covid-19 to overcome the problem that it was prohibited to conduct autopsies biopsies were not taken and therefore nothing was known about the anatomical pathology changes that occurred during this diseases dr xiao and collaborators hypothesized that the infectious rate was so high that some of the patients who were hospitalized for other diseases likely had a superimposed sars cov-2 infection by reviewing the clinical records of patients hospitalized there during the months of december 2019 and january 2020 the authors identified two patients who had undergone lobectomies to remove early stage lung cancers with ground-glass opacities in their lungs a characteristic radiological finding in covid-19 infected patients in addition rt-pcr tests were performed for these patients which verified the infection the pathologic lesions identified in these patients and described in their report 1  represent the early pathological changes as they were detected before the patients developed any clinical symptoms related to covid-19 both patients eventually became severely ill and one of them died of respiratory failure to a certain degree observing early phase pathologic changes is more relevant than findings from autopsies because the latter only offer a glimpse of the picture in the very end of the disease process therefore this report showing the pathology in the lungs of two presymptomatic patients allows us for the first time to see the pathology of this disease at its earliest stages and understand the pathophysiology of sars cov-2 infection in these pre-symptomatic sars cov-2-infected lungs xiao and colleagues observed edema with proteinaceous exudates 1 the high quality figures show patchy changes of fibrin plugs mixed with macrophages and other inflammatory cells in one of the two cases abundant intraalveolar pulmonary macrophages are present the alveolar walls or septa are expanded by proliferating fibroblasts with parallel type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia there is no significant neutrophilic exudation or infiltration in keeping with a viral infection there are no hyaline membrane formations at this early stage -which were instead found at autopsy 10  however fibroblastic plugs have formed albeit focally even in this early phase of the disease these findings indicate that there is progressive consolidation of the lung which is ultimately the cause of respiratory failure and death lung consolidation is not caused by the accumulation of granulocytes and fibrin but rather by intra-alveolar organization and fibrosis therefore since the respiratory surface of the lung is obliterated these patients can no longer respond to intubation and oxygen therapy this is why they die from this important report 1  we learn that the virus can establish infection in the lungs where it produces tissue injury well before producing symptoms including dry cough and fever that occur later on at this early stage the only clue of sars cov-2 infection is imaging showing ground glass opacities in the periphery of the lung these imaging findings are of particular relevance to identify infected individuals in light of the evidence for viral spreading by asymptomatic patients including by individuals which may test pcr-negative for sars cov-2 in the upper respiratory tract 11  therefore presently any patient with round glass opacities in the lungs should undergo sars cov-2 testing the lesions usually start in the peripheral lung zones close to the pleura as single or multifocal ground glass opacities only when the lesions become more intense or expand do patients develop symptoms often the first symptom is a dry cough most patients recover however some experience disease progression and their lungs contain large areas of consolidations at which point there is severe loss of function leading to respiratory failure this important work helps us understand the pathogenesis of covid-19 and to be better prepared to identify potentially infected patients this work is the result of an international collaboration among a highly trained us pathologist dr xiao who had studied hantavirus infections west nile virus disease for many years and who is presently a senior diagnostic pathologist at the university of chicago dr xiaos experience allowed him to coordinate a team of pathologists and clinicians to circumvent the problem that autopsies were not allowed biopsies were not necessary and yet the world needed to know more about the pathology of this disease to be prepared to face this epidemic in the end the outcome of the study will benefit medicine and patients throughout the world underscoring the value of team-work and international collaborations in medical research as of february 26 the number of cases detected in different italian regions is proportional to the number of pcr tests performed by sampling people in direct contact with infected individuals 1 in 12 tested positive the veneto region is an outlier possibly due to testing on a larger population not restricted to direct contacts of infected individuals as the number of tests will increase so will the slope of the represented line due to the expected decrease of the percentage of positive tests note that presently due to the relatively limited data the curves fit is strongly dependent on the position of a few points  sars-cov-2 covid-19 vaccine development and production an ethical way forward kenneth iserson v   the world expects a sars-cov-2 vaccine against the covid-19 disease to appear so that life can return to a near-normal condition all social economic and healthcare system plans have built in such a discovery vaccine safety and efficacy requires meticulous testing and oversight under the current development testing and production schedules however vaccines may prove to be ethically dubious medically dangerous and socially volatile the purpose of this paper is to better inform the public to be able to assess vaccine promises about the novel vaccines being produced and to tolerate delays and uncertainty most experts agree that having a safe effective affordable and widely available vaccine will be the only way to end the pandemic both medically and socially the pandemics medical end will come when about 70 of the worlds populationroughly 56 billion peopleis immune through either natural immunity or vaccination to end the pandemics social effects people will need confidence that they can again participate in their work and recreational activities without fear of contracting the disease however repeated promises of a rapidly produced vaccine ethically and scientifically dubious routes being taken to develop a vaccine and planned distribution systems favoring rich countries may strengthen the antivaccination movement ultimately lengthening rather than shortening the pandemic we can overcome these deficiencies by making the entire process transparent to the public and the healthcare community this entails providing consistent honest assessments of vaccine development progress disseminating sophisticated pro-vaccination education and developing an equitable distribution program candidate vaccines developed in the laboratory normally must demonstrate that they can safely provide long-term immunity first in laboratory animals and then in progressively larger groups of human volunteers many current sars-cov-2 vaccine developers are skipping abbreviating or dangerously modifying these steps the us warp speed project has said that it is doing animal testing of its eight candidate vaccines in parallel with human testing
3 other groups are using methods that have never produced a successful vaccine such as messenger rna encoding the coronavirus surface protein or using an adenovirus to deliver the same proteins gene
4 such ethically and medically dubious shortcuts will eventually engender fear and mistrust in potential vaccine recipients especially because few people are aware of how these procedural changes may affect the vaccines safety and efficacy when they ultimately find out this may dissuade many people from being immunized an initial and vital step in designing vaccine studies is to define the safety efficacy and other criteria called a target product profile tpp that must be met for the test vaccine to progress to the next stage most new medications fail to meet their targets during testing table 1 a major tpp is assuring the compatibility and stability of the vaccines adjuvant used to improve the immune response and antigen this is normally done through in vivo tests in animals and can take months if not years to complete if the results demonstrate that the vaccine is dangerous it does not move on to human testing for example animal testing of some non-covid-a9 coronavirus vaccines has shown an increased risk of the animals getting the disease rather than preventing it

6 other animal tests reveal that vaccines are ineffective that is they do not trigger antibody production in fact medications often fail to demonstrate that they can successfully modify the disease or health concern they are designed to address only about 12 of pharmaceutical candidates that go through this rigorous evaluation including vaccines make the transition from the laboratory to clinical trials

 the basic moral concern is the potential danger to the health of human test subjects and eventually the large number of vaccine recipients in truth the riskbenefit ratio is acceptable for fully informed volunteer test subjects even when they are knowingly receiving a potentially lethal virus without transparency to the public however it is ethically dubious to expose the public to the possible risk of harm from unsuspected side effects or ineffectiveness this may outweigh any potential benefits of abbreviated vaccine production any such results will feed the inherent distrust of vaccination among the antivaccination community diminishing the chance to ultimately immunize at least 70 of the world to achieve herd immunity to ameliorate this issue we ought at the least to publicly describe the risks human-challenge study hcs subjects are taking make the criteria for vaccine approval transparent to the public and healthcare community and admit what still is not known about any vaccine before it is released including the chance of recipients having complications or not being immune to sars-cov-2 even if all testing and manufacturing steps work well producing a safe and effective sars-cov-2 vaccine will probably be a long process because trust is essential to maintain viable leadership truth telling is a key element in the fight against covid-19 while dishonesty and hyperbole will undermine all other efforts this includes full disclosure about uncertainty around vaccine availability which will greatly disappoint for those unfamiliar with medical science for politicians it will be ego challenging pharmaceutical company stockholders will fear for the enormous investments being made on balance the public will tolerate the truth much better than repeated unfulfilled promises thus we ought to clearly and consistently state that no one knows when a safe effective sars-cov-2 vaccine will be available although we are using all available resources to make that happen it is unclear whether in their haste to produce a viable vaccine most researchers will follow the who criteria for ethical hcs trials although even these standards may not be adequate to protect research subjects following these protocols may reduce negative public reaction but if significant numbers of people were to die as a result of taking part in vaccine studies following hcs protocols then a widespread public reaction should be anticipated as hope and mcmillan wrote the idea of giving a healthy person a disease is so alien to the publics expectations of medicine and medical research that it is vital to conduct such studies within a well-considered and transparent set of guidelines and regulatory processes
25 doing hcs may raise additional ethical and legal questions these include whether vaccine trial participants can volunteer for a potentially lethal experiment whether physicians can violate their duty to do no harm whether social and political pressure and general misinformation allows for true informed consent and if this type of study conforms to the norm of minimal risk or minimal harm generally undefined described by most research guidelines
26 yet if actual volunteers not military members as has been suggested receive enough information to give meaningful informed consent and the risks and benefits are publicized in advance instead of after complications or deaths using this testing method will pass ethical muster with most people in philosophy the method is similar to the classic trolley dilemma where one person may be sacrificed to save a group in the sars-cov-2 vaccine trials the rewardrisk ratio is significantly higher
27 not only will hcs provide a faster and less-expensive answer to whether the vaccine works but it will also require many fewer individuals to be subjected to the risks from an experimental and possibly ineffective vaccine the small number of participating volunteers will provide numerous benefits to the world including saving tens or even hundreds of thousands of lives and hastening a return to normal social functioning with its economic and public health benefits
28 nations survive because in times of need generosity and supporting others is the norm in nearly every culture the privilege of wealth or the good fortune to produce a vaccine engenders the responsibility to equitably share rather than hoard resources pragmatically as members of the worlds population we have a moral duty to eliminate lethal diseases when possible including among the least-advantaged populations any vaccine allocation decision made behind john rawls veil of ignorance would result in equitable distribution
38 since diseases do not recognize national borders it is in everyones interest to widely distribute the vaccine to address this issue the worlds governments vaccine producers and funders and healthcare agencies should immediately devise a plan to equitably share all vaccines that are proven to be safe and effective while no one can predict how long it will take to produce a viable vaccine even using these abbreviated testing methods many of the potential ethical social and political problems raised in this paper can be mitigated by transparency some vaccine developers such as the coalition led by the us nih have publicly detailed many aspects of their process at least in a format available to and understandable by biological scientists and healthcare professionals what we now need is for all vaccine developers to do likewise all private and government leaders involved in the process should use the news and social media in as sophisticated persistent and entertaining a manner as the antivaxxers are doing to clearly explain in lay terms what they are doing how long it may take and the chances of any one developer producing an ultimately successful vaccine only when potential recipients understand the processs complexities as well as their personal risks will they be able to tolerate the uncertainties in our near future  disease detectives using mathematics to forecast the spread of infectious diseases heather brooks z unchitta kanjanasaratool yacoub kureh h mason porter a  the covid-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in how people are currently living their lives to determine how to best reduce the effects of the pandemic and start reopening societies governments have drawn insights from mathematical models of the spread of infectious diseases we give an introduction to a family of mathematical models called compartmental models and discuss how the results of analyzing these models influence government policies and human behavior such as encouraging physical distancing to help slow the spread of the disease section 1 modeling infectious diseases at the end of 2019 doctors and scientists learned about a new virus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 that was spreading in china the virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1411 and has now spread throughout the world as a global pandemic see 12 to develop some intuition about pandemics and 18 for an accessible introduction to the covid-19 pandemic what makes this virus so dangerous is how it spreads from person to person and the effects that it has on people who catch it basic reproduction number r 0  the number of cases of infection on average that are generated by a single infected person in a population of susceptible people a category in a compartmental model of epidemics for example in an susceptible-infected-recovered sir model there are compartments for susceptible people who can become infected infected people and recovered people compartmental model of an epidemic an epidemic model is a set of rules typically in mathematical form that describe how the properties of an epidemic change in time a common type of epidemic model is a compartmental model in which each type of compartment is a category of individuals in such a model there are rules that determine how people change categories an example of a compartmental model is a susceptible-infected-recovered sir model which includes equations to describe how the numbers of susceptible infected and recovered people change over time a connection between two individuals there are both direct contacts such as shaking hands and indirect contacts such as touching the same surface in a contact network each connection between individuals in a network represents some type of contact a particularly fast type of growth in which the rate of growth of something at any particular time is proportional to the current amount of that thing for example if the number of infected people triples every 2 days then if there is 1 infected person on the first day there will be 3 infected people on the third day 9 infected people on the fifth day 27 infected people on seventh day 81 infected people on ninth day and so on if the disease keeps spreading this fast there would be 19683 infected people on the nineteenth day a form of prediction in which one indicates a range of possibilities rather than an exact number of future events such as a 42 chance of rain in los angeles tomorrow or a range of the number of people in los angeles who will become infected with covid-19 during august 2020 mathematical epidemiology the study of the mathematics of infectious diseases such as through the mathematical modeling of such diseases pandemic an epidemic that has spread across a large region such as worldwide or across several continents see 12 to develop some intuition about pandemics and 9 for a discussion of modeling disease spread in a pandemic see 8 for an accessible introduction to the covid-19 pandemic  scientists play many roles in helping people recover from a virus through the design of medicine and medical equipment they also research other ways -including with mathematics and computation -to keep people safe by studying the effects of actions such as physical distancing and wearing masks governments can then use such information to develop health guidelines and policies in this article we introduce the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases 3 9 10  scientists who do this are sometimes called mathematical epidemiologists  to better understand how a disease spreads scientists use a combination of mathematics and data so-called mathematical modeling the most common procedure is to use what is called a compartmental model 3 7  an approach for studying disease spread that was invented almost 100 years ago and has been used successfully for forecasting in many epidemics compartmental models provide a way to formulate simple rules that approximate how a virus like sars-cov-2 spreads the models can behave in complicated ways even when the rules are simple when creating and studying such models our goal is to improve the accuracy of forecasting disease spread and to provide a way to test the effects of possible responses for example if everyone stays at home for reducing the spread these results can inform people about helpful guidelines policy and actions 3  in a compartmental model of an epidemic see figure 1  one separates a population into categories called compartments and examines how people change categories a frequently studied type of compartmental model is an sir model  where sir is short for susceptible-infected-recovered the s compartment consists of people who are susceptible to infection this means that they can get the disease and the i compartment consists of people who are infected and who can infect others the r compartment is for people who have recovered from the infection although r can also stand for removed to account for people who die from an infection in developing an epidemic model it is important to focus on the most important factors of a disease and the particular scientific questions of interest so that the model can be as simple and informative as possible these factors are different for different diseases for example one consideration in an epidemic model is social interactions such as shaking hands seeing a movie together or eating dinner together between people 7 9  as such social contact gives an opportunity for a virus to spread some types of disease require very close contact to spread but others can spread even through indirect contact such as from touching the same surface section 2 how quickly does a disease spread lets illustrate the modeling of the spread of an infectious disease with an sir model 3 7  before we can use the model to forecast the effects of a disease on a population we have to know or estimate a few important factors 1 the amount of time that a person is infectious this tells us how long they can infect other people 2 the rate of contact in a population 3 the chance that a contact leads to an infection in combination these three factors allow one to estimate a quantity called the basic reproduction number  the basic reproduction number denoted by r 0 pronounced r naught is the number of people on average to whom a single infected person spreads a disease if they are placed in a population of susceptible people a quantity that is closely related to r 0 is the effective reproduction number which is equal to r 0 multiplied by the fraction of a population who are susceptible the effective reproduction number is important because some individuals in a population may be immune to a disease as perhaps they were vaccinated or developed immunity from a past infection suppose that we start with some population such as people in a city like los angeles before a disease begins to spread everyone in the population is in the susceptible compartment now suppose that someone who has the disease flies into los angeles and starts to spread it to other people in the city see figure 1  if r 0 is 2 and the time that a person is infectious is 1 day then on average that person will spread the disease to 2 other people before recovering and those 2 people in turn will spread it to 2 more people each before recovering and so on in this simplified setting one can estimate how many people will become infected based on transmission and recovery rates when r 0 is larger than 1 the number of infected people grows exponentially  to see how this works lets use our above example with r 0  2 and infectiousness time of 1 day lets also suppose that were looking at how many new infections occur on each day take a look at the scenario in figure 1  suppose that 1 person is infected on the first day and spreads the disease to 2 other people on the second day remember that the first person is no longer infectious on the second day on the third day those 2 infected people can each infect 2 more susceptible people in 3 days that implies that we expect to have about 1 x 2 x 2  4 infected people if this pattern continues and there are still many susceptible people can you see how many new infections we get on the 4th day we multiply by 2 again so we expect to have about 8 newly infected people on the next day after we do this calculation we have to remind ourselves that these infections come from just 1 infected person if we instead start with 100 infected people we can see how the situation can become very bad very quickly the number of infected people continues to increase until the rate at which infected people recover exceeds the rate at which they infect susceptible people if each infected person infects fewer than 1 other person on average we expect fewer infections each day and that a disease will die out how long this takes and whether it occurs in the first place depends on the size of a population and the social contacts of the people in it try the interactive sir model in 5  you can also take a look at the discussions in 912 and the discussions and interactive simulations in 8 in figure 2  we compare what happens to susceptible infectious and recovered people in a population when r 0  1 versus r 0  1 the vertical axes in the plots indicate the number of people who are infected and the horizontal axis indicates the number of days since the first person got the disease the values on the vertical axis include all of the people in the susceptible infected or recovered classes on that day not just the infections or recoveries that are new that day in the top row for which r 0  1 almost everybody eventually becomes infected in this simplistic scenario so the number of susceptible people the green curve becomes very small how quickly a disease takes hold in a population depends on the value of r 0  when r 0  1 the number of people who are infected at the same time can be very large the orange curve and hospitals may not have the capacity to treat everybody who becomes infected in the bottom row for which r 0  1 the disease does not spread to many people in the population so the curve of infected people again in orange over time is much flatter this scenario is desirable and if a disease is spreading quickly we want to slow infections and flatten the curve see figure 3  we discuss flattening the curve along with behavior and policies that can help do this in section 3 additionally now that we have discussed r 0 some more take another look at what happens when you change quantities like infection rates and recovery rates in the interactive simulation in 5  section 3 flattening the curve policy and behavior in section 2 we explored how the basic reproduction number r 0 influences how a disease spreads networks of social contacts are important for estimating the value of r 0 2 7 8 9  you and the friends whom you see in person are connected to each other in a contact network and so are your parents and their friends therefore if one of your friends gets a disease it is pretty likely to spread to you and then to your parents and then to their friends because of how easily people can become infected and perhaps very sick from covid-19 many governments responded by closing schools canceling sporting events and other large gatherings of people quarantining infected people and telling people to stay at home and practice physical distancing often called social distancing the goals of these kinds of policies and behaviors during a pandemic 8 9 12 is to try to limit both direct and indirect contacts and thereby flatten the curve of the number of infected people see figures 2 and 3  with measures like these along with wearing masks and washing ones hands often the orange curve of infected people in figure  2 spreads out more over time and has a lower peak indicating that the maximum number of infected people on any one day is smaller than it would otherwise be this is important for hospitals to have enough capacity to treat as many people as possible as indicated by the heights of the peak above the dashed horizontal lines in figure 3  with a flattened curve although a disease continues to spread there is more space in hospitals to treat infected people who need help this reduces the number of deaths from a disease flattening the curve also decreases the total number of people who become infected over time these are the colored regions of figure 3  mathematical models and computation have played a major role in influencing the responses of governments to the covid-19 pandemic these models -such as the one in 2 which influenced policy in spain and the one in 6  which influenced policy in the united kingdom -are much more detailed than the sir model that we discussed above for example some models include compartments for hospitalization and for people without symptoms who can infect others other important data to include are contact-network structure as we discussed above and ages and other demographic factors which may influence recovery and death rates the current covid-19 pandemic illustrates the importance of the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases mathematical and computational approaches allow people to make progress when laboratory experiments are impractical or impossible and they also allow one to get at the core of a difficult problem and develop ideas for how to solve it  public policy

enacted across the globe understanding how to maximize the effectiveness of these policies while mitigating economic damage is essential we develop a mathematical model to assess the impact of quarantine measures on deaths hospitalizations and economic output we expand the seir model to simulate the spread of covid-19 we incorporate the effects of quarantine policies and segment the population based on health risk and economic vulnerability using our model we simulate a baseline scenario that leaves the current quarantine restrictions in place we then simulate a rapid relaxation of the quarantine restrictions for non-seniors shortly after the outbreak is contained finally we gradually relax the quarantine restrictions for the young individuals while maintaining extremely strict restrictions for seniors in the baseline scenario we find that over 76 weeks in a population of 330 million there are 32131 deaths among those under 60 and 175775 deaths among those over 60 there is a peak of 189136 hospitalizations and the economy shrinks by 056 in the scenario where quarantine is quickly lifted a second outbreak takes place overall there are 242869 deaths among those under 60 545946 deaths among those over 60 a peak of 4363654 hospitalizations and the economy expands by 52 in the scenario where quarantine policies are progressively relaxed for the young individuals there are 33750 deaths among those under 60 187993 deaths among those over 60 a peak of 189136 hospitalizations and the economy expands by 4 interpretation strict restrictions on seniors combined with very gradual lifting of quarantine for the general population results in a limited number of deaths and lesser economic damage we recommend this strategy and lowering contagiousness to control the pandemic while making quarantine economically viable funding no funding to declare as of april 10th 2020 the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 worldwide stands at over 1690000 and at least 102500 individuals have died from this disease since the first reports of a pneumonia of unknown etiology in december 2019 1 2 3 as covid-19 expands to new territories after a latent phase with few new reported infections daily the virus spreads rapidly and local outbreaks begin the viruss containment is complicated by its high transmissibility relatively low case fatality rate and lengthy asymptomatic infectious period 4 currently the most successful measure to prevent the rapid expansion of covid-19 has been to restrain travels and physical interactions between individuals a policy referred to as social distancing 5 6 extreme social distancing has devastating consequences for the global economy quarantine policies may be an effective short-term measure but indefinite quarantine until a vaccine becomes available would prevent billions of individuals worldwide from receiving an income and could particularly devastate countries with weaker economies this economic harm could increase mortality given the correlation between mortality and income 7 especially for children 8 computational models that simulate the expansion of the disease can guide public policy makers in mitigating the detrimental outcomes of the outbreak 9  existing epidemiological models estimate the number of unknown infected individuals forecast the number of patients requiring intensive care treatment predict the death toll and evaluate the outcomes of different policies in compartmental modeling different disease stages are modeled as compartments and transitions between compartments are modeled by a system of differential equations 10 compartmental models provide useful insight into the mechanisms governing the spread of the disease and help evaluate public policies 11 12 13 some papers focus on how quarantine restrictions affect disease spread 6 13 14 15 16 time series approaches use available data to statistically forecast the evolution of the disease 17 18 19 while times series models have precise results they do not illuminate the dynamics of the disease spread to accurately predict the spread of disease and evaluate consequences beyond the infectious disease itself models must take into account how mitigation measures might impact the economy 20 21 22 existing epidemiological models usually do not integrate the economic aspects of public policy aimed at controlling the spread of the disease to the best of our knowledge no models incorporating public policy responses take into account both the distinctions in risk types within the population and the differential economic impacts of quarantine policies we propose an ad hoc compartmental model for the spread of covid-19 and 3 the economic effects of quarantine restrictions our model includes among other compartments a large group of asymptomatic infected individuals and compartments that represent quarantined individuals we separate the population into four groups in our simulations according to age and the economic impact of remaining in quarantine for an extended period of time upon infection senior individuals present much larger co-morbidity and mortality rates than younger individuals also generalized country-wide lockdowns completely suppress the productivity of some workers while having minimal implications for others by modeling our population as having different risk groups economic risks from quarantine and productivity levels we can make more specific predictions and are able to provide more targeted policy recommendations than existing methods evidence before this study we searched pubmed medrxiv biorxiv arxiv ssrn research square virological and wellcome open research for peer-reviewed articles preprints and research reports on models of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 using the search terms coronavirus 2019-ncov targeted quarantine and similar terms up to april 5 2020 other studies using a variety of data sources and statistical techniques produce estimates of the hospitalized ratio the case fatality rate the length of the pre-symptomatic period the proportion of hospitalized individuals the length of hospitalization and other important parameters we use the available literature for our own estimates of these parameters our primary contribution lies in modeling public policy as taking into account differential age-adjusted health risk and economic risk given that the state of the economy has important health effects and that public policy needs to incorporate economic effects and how citizens perceive lockdown restrictions we model public policies that balance the number of deaths and damage to economic productivity in addition we model improvements in medical knowledge about a recently discovered disease as decreasing the case fatality rate over time the results of this study provide policymakers with three primary policy suggestions 1 maintaining a non-strictly enforced quarantine policy and releasing the population after disease levels begin diminishing would lead to a second outbreak 2 an extremely strict quarantine policy for the senior population combined with a gradual removal of mandatory quarantine for younger citizens after the outbreak is largely controlled can lessen economic damage without catastrophic increases in the number of hospitalized and dead individuals however if the quarantine policy for the senior population is not strictly enforced there can be disastrous consequences no quarantine restriction approach resolves the pandemic and lockdown policies can only be used as a bridge to a global vaccination program 3 strict isolation policies and a strong reduction of contagiousness from the asymptomatic infected individuals can reduce the total number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths as compared to loosely enforced measures therefore stark measures must be enforced to prevent a prolonged pandemic to model the spread of covid-19 we design a compartmental model with ten interconnected compartments each compartment is subdivided into two parts one containing the senior population and the other containing the rest of the population a description of each compartment appears in table 1  the connectivity of the compartments is illustrated in fig 1  susceptible individuals get exposed to covid-19 at a rate proportional to the number of asymptomatic and hospitalized infected individuals exposed individuals then become infected and asymptomatic these individuals can either recover from their current state or develop serious symptoms and become hospitalized the fraction of infected asymptomatic individuals that become hospitalized follows a bernoulli distribution with a low probability for the general population and a higher probability for the senior population the hospitalized individuals either die or recover at appropriate rates which depend on whether the hospitalized population is above certain saturation points the case fatality rate decreases over time to account for better knowledge by the healthcare system individuals who are not hospitalized enter or leave quarantine compartments according to public policy expressed by  and   v where v is a vector containing the number of reported infections deaths and the current state of the economy and  is a weight vector that reflects the relative importance the public policy gives to the economy and the number of cases the greek letters represent the transition delays between the compartments and were derived from published data about the progression rate of covid-19 in our model there are occupations more affected by lockdown and occupations less affected by lockdown in our simulation we have two types of workers those whose productivity is highly damaged by a quarantine and those whose 5  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

each group minus the costs of treating the infected for the long-term economic output beyond the pandemic period deaths impose a penalty on future economic output dependent on the discount rate r the productivity of each labor group is the sum of the productivity of all the individuals in that labor group the cost of treating the infected is the number of individuals of each risk type times the cost of treating each risk type different workers of the same labor type might be under different lockdown restrictions based on their age or risk type in our simulation there are four levels of productivity for four types of workers older workers whose jobs are highly damaged by a lockdown y hrh  older workers whose jobs are less damaged by a lockdown y hrl  younger workers whose jobs are highly damaged by a lockdown y lrh  and younger workers whose jobs are less damaged by a lockdown y lrl  the workers whose jobs are highly damaged by a lockdown lose a higher percentage of their

million we simulate the evolution of public policy given the preferences of the policymakers over 76 weeks in each scenario to imitate current strict lockdown policies we start with 856  of non-seniors and 956  of seniors in quarantine public policy and media information shifts the population in and out of quarantine we keep the non-quarantined population above zero because some jobs that could potentially spread disease continue to operate because they are deemed essential in a pandemic economy for this reason there is not much room for further strengthening the quarantine for non-seniors baseline scenario in the baseline scenario we keep the current quarantine status   0   0 leaving the quarantine in place results in 207906 total deaths the peak number of hospitalized is 189136 which strains hospital capacity but does not saturate it as shown in fig 2a and fig 2c  deaths first accelerate as more non-quarantined people get infected but then level off there are 32131 deaths among non-seniors and 175775 among seniors as shown in fig 2b and fig 2d  respectively since both young people and seniors have strict quarantine restrictions imposed on them most of the deaths occur in the senior population which is more vulnerable to the disease the economy in the baseline scenario shown in fig 3  shrinks slightly from its initial restricted levels as some people are hospitalized and die this is costly for the economy and there is no increase in productivity from others as they are all still in quarantine given that the initial restrictions on economic output are high the economic productivity in this scenario is quite low for a prolonged period of time  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

with a sudden release the peak number of hospitalized is 4363654 which exceeds hospital capacity enough to increase the fatality rate there are 788815 total deaths as shown in fig 4b  with 242869 deaths among non-seniors and 545946 among seniors necessitating a re-imposition of restrictions fig 4a shows a decreasing number of infections before the second outbreak during this period the very low number of newly infected and deaths may suggest that covid-19 has been successfully mitigated and the pressure to resume normal activities may grow the economy is strongly boosted shortly after strict restrictions are removed however due to the large initial fraction of asymptomatic infected individuals a sudden relaxation of quarantine restrictions after the disease is largely controlled leads to a second outbreak with increased deaths and infections the economic dynamics of this scenario are shown in fig  4c  after a short-term economic boost the second outbreak damages economic productivity again although the productivity boost for quarantined recovered individuals leads to a smaller jump  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has

restrictions various studies have shown that the case fatality rate for the senior population is larger than that of the younger population23 24 the marked difference in mortality according to age suggests that enforcing an extremely strict isolation policy for the senior population while allowing the general population to slowly resume normal activities could potentially balance disease spread and economic damage as in the sudden release scenario policymakers loosen quarantine restrictions in week 40 releasing the non-senior isolated population at a rate of 01  daily this gradual relaxation does not lead to a second outbreak as can be seen from the number of infected individuals in fig 5a  and fig 5c  in this state the peak number of hospitalized is 189136 which does not saturate the health care system there are 33750 non-senior deaths and 187993 senior deaths as shown in fig 5b and fig 5d  respectively in this scenario there are 13837 more deaths than in the baseline scenario and a 40  increase in economic productivity that is continuing to grow at 76 weeks we see in fig 6 that relaxing restrictions on seniors as well does not improve economic productivity and results in substantially more deaths additionally if 10  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  the rate at which the general population abandons isolation measures increases rapidly a second outbreak could take place strict enforcement of quarantine restrictions for seniors is vital as without strict enforcement for senior individuals the number of deaths is almost one million economic output is higher in the gradual quarantine relaxation scenario with strict enforcement of quarantine for seniors however since in this scenario covid-19 becomes endemic and does not disappear relaxing isolation policies for the senior population at any time leads to an extremely large number of hospitalized and dead individuals therefore although this scenario can lead to an acceptable economic situation with a controlled number of hospitalizations and deaths it is not a viable long-term solution any quarantine policy that does not eliminate the disease can serve only as bridge to a global vaccination campaign

during the pandemic deaths from the low and high risk populations and net change in productivity from current situation to a year and a half from the time of submission in the baseline scenario the restrictions do not change in the sudden release scenario after the disease is mostly brought under control restrictions for non-seniors are suddenly relaxed in the gradual release scenario after the disease is mostly brought under control restrictions for non-seniors are gradually relaxed first from fig 7a -c we observe that the total number of hospitalizations and deaths decrease with the strictness of isolation of hospitalized patients   while economic productivity grows slightly we see a much larger decrease in hospitalizations and deaths and a larger increase in economic productivity as disease spread of asymptomatic patients  is reduced this observation suggests the importance of enforcing quarantine measures for example by tracking diagnosed patients who are not hospitalized and by strengthening specialized delivery systems secondly from fig 7d -f we observe that as the strictness of isolation measures increase the number of deaths and hospitalizations decrease while economic output is first flat and then at certain level of quarantine measures begins to sharply decrease meanwhile at higher levels of quarantine restrictions the change in hospitalizations accelerates but the change in deaths decelerates finally we see in fig 7g -i that as policymakers put more emphasis on economic productivity at lower levels of emphasis there are increases in hospitalizations deaths and economic productivity but as the policymaker prioritizes the economy more hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase while economic output shrinks we see that if policymakers value short-term economic productivity highly relative to disease spread there is a danger of quarantine policies leading to larger death tolls   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

httpsdoiorg101101202004 1320062802 doi medrxiv preprint we present a model of covid-19 in a population with different risk groups and different levels of economic vulnerability to public policy aimed at preventing disease spread we focus our model on a situation where disease is ongoing and quarantine measures are already in place by modeling our population with different risk groups and economic groups we are able to produce specific policy suggestions that allow for a finer targeting of the spread of covid-19 the individuals most vulnerable to covid-19 are primarily those who can be protected from the disease without crippling the economy we suggest stringent lockdowns for higher-risk groups our simulations show that in order to protect the most vulnerable any lockdown relaxation must be gradual even for the less vulnerable beyond the short-term lockdown policy does not need to be as severe for lowerrisk groups quarantine restrictions can lessen over time for lower-risk people while still minimizing deaths lessening quarantine restrictions allows the economy to recover to 30  of pre-restriction productivity as opposed to 34  when quarantine restrictions are left in place it is important that policy relaxation be gradual as this limits the spread of disease and can allow for less restrictive measures in the future in real-world terms the gradual relaxation suggested by our model can correspond to the lifting of restrictions on in-person work operations several industries at a time or to gradually increasing the number of low-risk people allowed to gather in one place these results also suggest that optimal policies may differ in various countries independent of the level of disease spread and healthcare capacity for instance in countries with more vulnerable economies that have a younger population the consequences from disease may be less than in other countries while consequences from lockdown policies may be higher than in other countries we also see that contagiousness of asymptomatic infected individuals  has an important effect on disease spread and mortality and this suggests that strictly enforcing quarantines is especially important for policymakers to prioritize if policymakers prioritize short-term economic productivity more their quarantine policies may lead to many times more deaths and hospitalizations with minimal short-term economic gain our results demonstrate that keeping a stringent quarantine on at least a substantial portion of the population is necessary to avert large numbers of deaths more investigation is required as to how to keep such a quarantine sustainable over time both through targeted relaxation as we suggest but also through safe provision of services to the quarantined and increased infrastructure for at-home economic productivity 25 more workers may be required for maintaining a quarantined population over time additionally continued compliance with quarantine may require a variety of measures including enforcement education from public health officials and infrastructure for alternatives to traditional social and entertainment options furthermore policymakers should use other tools to supplement quarantine policy including contact tracing and other containment measures successful quarantine policy can more quickly bring disease levels down to a level where more targeted tools can control future outbreaks our simulations suggest that quarantine policy alone cannot end a pandemic without a level of enforcement that may not be realistic and one that necessitates extreme economic costs thus policymakers should quickly incentivize vaccines and other medical treatments our study has several limitations since there is no recent data on longterm health quarantines it is unknown how individuals will react to lengthy restrictions related to infectious disease once more information on individuals responses becomes available their behavior should be incorporated into later models we also do not model any individual-level differences in behavior or disease spread this model could also be modified to incorporate the effects of testing and to have probability of infection depend on job type our model does not allow for any differences in disease spread between new and repeated contacts 26 27 28 additionally due to the newness of covid-19 the exact disease parameters and the effects of seasonality are not precisely known 29 30 because of the uncertainty surrounding disease parameters which change as the covid-19 situation progresses our numbers should not be taken as literal predictions but rather as illustrating the consequences of different policy approaches during a fatal infectious disease outbreak of lengthy duration making policy decisions with longer term consequences in mind is essential our model provides a framework for making such decisions that takes into account differences within the population and disease changes that may occur over time we provide evidence about what quarantine policies may allow for minimal deaths while maximizing economic productivity we find that once infection levels are somewhat controlled very gradual relaxation of the restrictions on younger groups can minimize health consequences and economic damage the manuscript ug and ds contributed equally to this work we declare no

78-year-old alice lost her only sibling charles age 69 to covid-19 alice and charles lived in different towns but were very close speaking daily on the phone for hours they were practicing christians and had similar interests he often drove to visit her they enjoyed spending time with each other and doing things together despite having coronary artery disease and hypertension charles was independent and happy alice was shocked to learn he had been hospitalized for covid-19 pneumonia and that he was intubated and on a ventilator a bereavement coordinator reached out to her which she very much appreciated however alice declined an offer to visit charles frightened of contracting the disease herself she understood that she too was at high risk for dying of covid-19 because of her age although she tried to reach out to him via skype charles died with only the bereavement coordinator and hospital staff at his side alice completed the funeral arrangements via skype charles was cremated without her being present and his ashes were delivered to her several weeks after his passing alice was plagued by remorse for abandoning her dying brother she yearned to be with charles and could not believe he was gone she fluctuated between numbness overwhelming sadness and intense guilt she could not stop thinking that she failed her brother during his last days she was having trouble sleeping and was beginning to lose weight but did not meet criteria for major depression she liked to reminisce about fond memories of charles and knew he was with god she had confidence in the religious belief that she would see him again one day she also knew that she wanted to live and that she would carry charles in her heart for the rest of her days she continued to talk with the hospital bereavement coordinator weekly an important source of solace they often discussed the details of her plan to hold a memorial service in celebration of charles life after pandemic restrictions are lifted
 bereavement is the experience of losing a loved one and grief is the natural response to this loss typically acute grief is intensely painful and disruptive and often feels overwhelming and unmanageable still most people adapt to the death of a loved one along with the accompanying changes in life circumstances we accept a changed relationship to the person who died and find ways to honor them and keep them in our hearts we restore our sense of purpose and meaning and possibilities for happiness grief quiets as we do so finding a place in our life however the process of adaptation takes time grief is complex multi-faceted and time varying it progresses erratically the tremendous upheaval created by losing a loved one typically produces a raft of mixed feelings and confusing thoughts alice is experiencing an especially intense period of acute grief because of the sudden onset and rapid course of her brothers illness as well as deeply troubling thoughts because she was unable to be at his side when he passed
 bereaved people usually pass certain milestones as they adapt to their loss they learn to understand and accept their grief and manage painful emotions they begin to restore a sense of purpose and meaning and see possibilities for a promising future they strengthen their ongoing relationships and restore a sense of mattering ie the feeling that ones life is important and makes a significant difference and belonging ie the feeling that one fits in in a world without their loved one present they can tell the story of their loved ones death to themselves and share it with others they gradually return to a world of reminders and realize they have an ongoing meaningful connection to the deceased that is internalized and permanent bereaved persons can use the acronym healing as a simple way to remember these milestones see httpscomplicatedgriefcolumbiaeduwp-contentuploads202006healing-milestones-what-grievers-can-expect-with-covid-19-addendumpdf most people adapt to a loss naturally not easily but often without deliberate effort however this process can be derailed this usually happens because there is something about the meaning or experience of the loss that is troubling in a way that the bereaved person is unable to resolve this might be related to characteristics of the bereaved person the specialness of the relationship with the person who died circumstances of the death or the context in which the death occurred certain thoughts feelings and behaviors that occur naturally during acute grief can derail the adaptive process the acronym derailers summarizes the more common impediments to adaption see httpscomplicatedgriefcolumbiaeduwp-contentuploads202006healing-milestones-what-grievers-can-expect-with-covid-19-addendumpdf when adaptation is stalled or halted the result is prolonged grief disorder pgd1

2 recently included as a new diagnosis in the world health organization international classification of diseases 11th edition icd-113 and now also proposed as a formal diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder 5th edition dsm-5 diagnosis recently posted for public comment4 this syndrome is characterized by persistent and pervasive yearning longing or preoccupying thoughts and memories of the deceased accompanied by other evidence of grief-related emotional pain causing significant distress or impairment in functioning and lasting at least 6 months and exceeding the timeframe expected by social cultural or religious norms the circumstances context and consequences of deaths during the covid-19 pandemic comprise risk factors that will likely elevate rates of pgd table 1
 to understand why the pandemic holds risk factors for pgd and how they might be mitigated we can take a closer look at the process of adapting to loss and the common ways it can be derailed the dramatic upheaval caused by the death of a loved one often triggers troubling feelings and thoughts in addition to yearning and sadness most people feel anxiety guilt or anger bereaved people are inclined to protest the death and have a natural tendency to imagine alternative scenarios in which their loved one did not die most feel survivor guilt although there is little research on the topic of survivor guilt we believe that it is a universal human feeling while it is widely acknowledged as a natural human response much of the discussion about this issue is theoretical or philosophical5 this guilt can be understood as a sense of uneasiness or discomfort about having been spared from some adversity  the discomfort is about feeling it was not fair or the person did not deserve to be spared almost all bereaved people seek to avoid situations that trigger intense emotional pain although such thoughts feelings and behaviors are natural if they take control they can derail the healing process risk factors are characteristics of a bereavement experience that increase the likelihood of developing pgd1

6 or another mental health problem risk factors make derailers more difficult to resolve or set aside examples of risk factors include those related to the bereaved person such as previous depression or anxiety history of insecure attachment and previous trauma or loss risk factors related to the relationship to the deceased include an especially close identity-defining relationship such as a romantic partner or being a parent to the deceased other risk factors are related to circumstances context or consequences of death examples include sudden violent death stressful life circumstances other concurrent losses or important secondary losses table 1 lists probable pgd risk factors related to the covid-19 pandemic not only are the circumstances of deaths occurring during this pandemic likely to increase the risk for pgd but the measures taken to mitigate pandemic spread may also enhance the risk death from covid-19 is often sudden and unexpected restrictions in place because of the pandemic have changed the experience of dying healthcare systems have implemented stringent limits on visiting ill patients in acute adult inpatient settings permission to visit in person may be granted to a loved one only briefly or not at all as a result it is healthcare professionals support staff or chaplains and not family members who are by the sides of dying persons often too these healthcare personnel are wearing personal protective equipment which limits their ability to connect with their patients these difficult circumstances increase the burden for family members dealing with the loss of a loved one during this pandemic comprehending the reality of a loss is difficult under any circumstances but even more so when the death is sudden and a loved one is left to die alone 
in addition to becoming a focus of intense preoccupation and guilt after he died alices inability to visit charles left her with a strange feeling of uncertainty about his death she had trouble understanding how her brotherher best friendcould really be gone in her mind he was young and healthy  the way he had been when she last saw him she would have struggled with this had she been at his side but not having seen him made the feeling of disbelief even stronger his death did not compute for her
 adding to the burden of not being with a dying loved one is the unprecedented disruption of cultural and religious rituals that provide many mourners with a supportive social context funeral homes are overwhelmed and sometimes unable to pick up bodies in a timely manner in-person funeral arrangements and services are sharply curtailed during the pandemic with additional constraints for those whose loved ones died from covid-19 only a limited number of family members can convene to make funeral arrangements and such preparations must often be completed virtually faith- and culture-based practices such as embalming washing of the body kissing of the deceased and open casket viewing are not permitted private viewing is often not possible and when allowed is offered only to immediate family members close friends as well as bereaved family members who are ill in isolation or at-risk must stay home mourners must refrain from hugging or touching one another as any physical contact before during and after funeral services is strongly discouraged due to covid-19 travel restrictions create further obstacles to usual practices mourners and their supportive community must find new ways to observe these rituals the bereaved must postpone conventional memorial services to an uncertain later date decisions are made to postpone memorials as alice did or to conduct them by live stream 
alice and charles were religious christians and it troubled her that she was unable to give him the send-off she dearly wished she could she felt awkward to make arrangements for his remains by skype and was sad and guilty because she could not be present for the cremation all of this weighed heavily on her mind she did however gain some solace from planning a memorial for charles when restrictions are lifted it heartened her to discuss these plans with a bereavement counselor though she understood the need to forego this she longed to have her friends and family around her as she mourned charles she wanted to hug them and just sit with them she yearned for the others who loved charles to mourn together and share stories grieving alone felt almost like a physical deprivation
 the context in which bereavement is occurring also is challenging virtually all social gathering places have been shuttered due to physical distancing schools and workplaces are closed congregations are not permitted in places of worship and informal gatherings of large groups are disallowed deaths happening with stay-at-home orders in place can intensify the sense of social isolation and loneliness that is a part of the natural experience of many grieving individuals 
for alice the inability to spend time at church has been very painful she regularly prays at home and she on one occasion was able to talk with the minister but it was not the same as being in church alice believes she would be able to feel charles presence more strongly in the church building and she feels she needs god now more than ever covid-19 mitigation policies are associated with other forms of loss that are also stressful there are high rates of unemployment furloughs salary reductions and an increase in homelessness many are experiencing disruptions in living arrangements and painful physical separation from close friends and family there is widespread fear of contamination possibly increased by frequent reminders of death rates and exposure to distressing stories and other emotionally activating media coverage such challenges can make it more difficult to resolve thoughts and feelings that can derail adaptation in the absence of mitigating efforts a rise in pgd cases is a likely sequel to this pandemic 
in the back of her mind alice had a constant fear of getting sick she tried to ignore it but was sometimes unable to do so she felt an urge to talk this over with charles and this reminded her that she and charles will never talk on the phone again  that they will never take their favorite walks or have lunch in their favorite restaurant she tried her best to ignore these thoughts because they evoked pain so strong that her whole body hurt the many stresses and the need for social distancing made it more difficult for alice to accept the reality that charles was gone
 there is a pressing need to implement measures that might lessen the adverse consequences of covid-19-era bereavement we might do this by educating the lay public about grief and healing milestones and ways the pandemic might affect bereavement and grief we can promote awareness of derailers  the thoughts feelings and behaviors that can stall or halt the grieving process these include a view of the future as empty and meaningless a strong focus on imagining alternative scenarios andor rewriting our role in the story of the death excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss social isolation survivor guilt or a persistent strong aversion to experiencing positive emotions2 disruptions in eating sleeping or exercise can also make it difficult to restore a sense of wellbeing just as the risk of covid-19 is greater for older people and especially those with chronic physical illness so too the risk for pgd is likely higher in those who are older and who have a psychiatric history family members might be encouraged to closely monitor these vulnerable groups clinicians in both primary care and mental health settings are now practicing telemedicine there are clear advantages to in-person visits and many older patients currently have difficulty navigating and becoming accustomed to the digital world however telemedicine services can be especially convenient for some older adults and over time patients may become more comfortable using this modality this could increase access to care for those for whom travel is difficult or impossible clinicians can learn about the natural grieving process the healing milestones and the unique challenges faced by the bereaved during the pandemic they can learn how to promote adaptation and how to recognize and address derailers clinicians can help by active empathic listening during virtual discussions that are warm inviting and open-ended healthcare providers can help bereaved individuals understand and accept their grief they can assist grieving individuals to modulate their emotional pain by naming emotions observing and reflecting on them considering how they are affected by thoughts mindfulness exercises or any other emotion regulation strategies they have in their toolbox clinicians can invite bereaved people to talk about the story of the death and to voice and discuss any concerns they have about their loved ones illness or treatment sleep disturbance can be managed by providing advice on healthy sleep practices and other nonpharmacological techniques sedative-hypnotic medications should be avoided or used judiciously for short periods pgd is a new diagnosis recognizing this condition is important because it is associated with impaired physical health cognitive decrements mental disorders including substance use disorders and increased suicide risk reduced quality of life and premature mortality7 8 9 10 11 bereavement might also trigger depression anxiety and trauma-related disorders without pgd identification of a treatable disorder and appropriate management andor referral to mental health services is therefore important bereaved individuals also may benefit from referral to virtual grief counseling or psychotherapy services additionally online group and self-help interventions may provide meaningful support for the bereaved when pgd is diagnosed psychotherapeutic interventions are the first-line treatment complicated grief psychotherapy cgt is the best studied of these12 13 14 and other similar approaches are also available15 16 17 18 19 among these are internet-based cognitive behavioral-based therapies that use strategies to increase involvement in enjoyable activities and reduce avoidance of reminders of the deceased1 cgt is a short-term approach developed and tested by researchers across the country cgt addresses derailers and fosters progression through healing milestones participants in three randomized controlled trials funded by the national institute of mental health had a substantially better response to cgt than interpersonal psychotherapy antidepressant citalopram treatment or a pill placebo12 13 14 in other words depression-specific treatments are relatively ineffective in relieving pgd symptoms but grief-specific interventions like cgt are effective this observation underscores the importance of diagnosing pgd being careful not to misconstrue grief symptoms as depression cgt is an accessible method of grief therapy that can be learned by any licensed mental health professional by utilizing a range of training methods such as online workshops and other methods currently offered by the center for complicated grief clinicians can learn to administer this treatment effectively as with any grief therapy attention to therapist self-observation self-compassion and self-care is important cgt is currently being provided by trained therapists around the world using telehealth learning about the healing milestones and derailers can also be helpful for friends and family who want to support bereaved people in summary the public health emergency defined by covid-19 has brought elevated rates of bereavement as well as unique challenges that can increase the risk of the development of pgd a new diagnosis for which proven efficacious treatments are already available such treatments promise to provide relief for multitudes of people worldwide who have long suffered from unending grief continued research in this area holds the promise of identifying protective and risk factors for pgd especially in the context of the covid-19 pandemic studies testing hypothesized mechanisms for the development of pgd and other psychiatric conditions in the wake of bereavement also are needed putative mechanisms of action and efficacy of in-person and remotely delivered interventions should be examined additionally preventative interventions should be developed and their mechanisms of action and effectiveness tested for use during acute grief to mitigate the mental health consequences of bereavement especially for older people covid-19 has opened up new opportunities to deliver interventions that can alleviate the suffering of grieving individuals the federal government has issued emergency orders to relax regulations to increase telehealth services access across the country the american psychiatric20 and psychological21 associations have created resources for mental health professionals to learn about developments in telehealth delivery alice might take advantage of this if her grief continues unabated over the next six months she could contact the center for complicated grief httpscomplicatedgriefcolumbiaedu to find a teletherapist trained to provide efficacious treatment for pgd since covid-19 will leave a lasting impact on our community we call for immediate action to educate practitioners in recognition and treatment of pgd and to make telehealth policies permanent beyond the pandemic this would ensure continued access to much-needed care for bereaved individuals especially those like many older adults who may be isolated with limited capacity to travel andor inhibited by stigma in seeking mental healthcare jsg wrote the initial draft of the manuscript and case history mks and jsg revised the manuscript including all content and provided final approval mks provided the table the authors report no conflicts with any product mentioned or concept discussed in this article  a control approach to the covid-19 disease using a seihrd dynamical model fernando pazos flavia felicioni e  the recent worldwide epidemic of covid-19 disease for which there is no vaccine or medications to prevent or cure it led to the adoption of public health measures by governments and populations in most of the affected countries to avoid the contagion and its spread these measures are known as nonpharmaceutical interventions npis and their implementation clearly produces social unrest as well as greatly affects the economy frequently npis are implemented with an intensity quantified in an ad hoc manner control theory offers a worthwhile tool for determining the optimal intensity of the npis in order to avoid the collapse of the healthcare system while keeping them as low as possible yielding in a policymakers concrete guidance we propose here the use of a simple proportional controller that is robust to large parametric uncertainties in the model used  the novel sars-cov-2 coronavirus which produces the disease known as covid-19 was first reported on december 2019 in wuhan province of hubei china with amazing speed it spread to the majority of the countries in the world the outbreak has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization who on jan 30 2020 and as a pandemic on march 11 at the moment there is no vaccine against this virus or effective medicines to cure the disease health systems only try to mitigate its consequences to avoid complications and fatal outcomes this disease showed a great capacity of contagion and high fatality rates see updated reports in wm2  patients affected by this disease experience a number of symptoms not all clearly identified at the moment but which are mainly cough breathing difficulties fever loss of taste and smell and extreme tiredness frequently patients develop a form of viral pneumonia that requires hospitalization and artificial mechanical ventilation in intensive care units the large number of patients affected by this disease threatens to collapse public health systems increasing the fatality rates by lack of available health assistance in this context is very important to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan effective strategies to avoid its spread and to determine its impact as the contagion is produced very easily by simple contact between people several measures were adopted by the governments public health systems and populations in order to reduce the transmission by reducing contact rates examples of these measures the so called nonpharmaceutical interventions npis adopted during this period include the closing of schools churches bars factories quarantine or physical-distancing policies confinement of people in their homes lockdown among other social impositions that produce discomfort and clearly harm the economy this goal sparked many articles and studies recently published on the epidemic behavior a number of them are addressed towards determining a mathematical model that represents the dynamics of different agents involved in a population affected by the disease the dynamic described by the model aims to make possible to answer crucial issues such as the maximum number of individuals that will be affected by the disease and when that maximum will occur and makes key predictions concerning the outbreak and eventual recovery from the epidemic this information allows to devise public policies and strategies to mitigate the social impact and reduce the fatality rate the seminal work flng  20 exemplifies and analyses different strategies to control the transmission of the virus most of the models adopted to represent the dynamical behavior of the covid-19 are based on the sir model see abd20 and references therein the sir model is a basic representation widely used which describes key epidemiological phenomena it assumes that the epidemic affects a constant population of n individuals the model neglects demography ie births and deaths by other causes unrelated to the disease 1  the population is broken into three non-overlapping groups corresponding to stages of the disease  susceptible s the population susceptible to acquire the disease  infected i the population that has acquired the virus and can infect others  recovered r the population that has recovered from infection and presumed to be no longer susceptible to the disease 2  a brief description of these compartments is given below susceptible people are those who have no immunity and they are not infected an individual in group s can move to group i by infection produced through contact with an infected individual group i are people who can spread the disease to susceptible people finally an infected individual recovered from the disease is moved from the group i to the group r some references see for example lzg  20 ssb20 considers the group r as removed population or closed cases which includes those who are no longer infectious from recovery and the ones who died from the disease the summation of these three compartments in the sir model remains constant and equals the initial number of population n  in order to describe better the spread of epidemics many works see for example kan20 gv20 shd20 nes20 adopted the seir model in the seir model a fourth group denoted as exposed e is added between the group s and the group i  exposed e the population that has been infected with the virus but not yet in an infective stage capable of transmitting the virus to others this compartment is dedicated to those people who are infectious but they do not infect others for a period of time namely incubation or latent period other works see abd20 for example consider an additional compartment at the end of the sir or of the seir model to distinguish between recovered and death cases  dead d the population dead due to the disease 1 in argentina the daily death rate is 2055 10 5  2 at the moment in the covid-19 disease is an open question if a recovered person can get re-infected even though some cases were recently reported the reinfection rate value appears to be statistically negligible based on early evidence thus these models become the sird or the seird models respectively other works as tbt  20lzg  20ssb20 consider the existence of other groups seeking to match the models proposed with the numbers obtained from the actual covid-19 disease the work presented in gbb  20 deserves to be mentioned this work studies the evolution of the covid-19 in italy and proposes a model denoted as sidarthe where the letters correspond to eight groups denoted as susceptible infected diagnosed ailing recognized threatened healed and extinct respectively all of them are subgroups of those presented in the seir model this model discriminates between detected and undetected cases of infection either asymptomatic or symptomatic and also between different severity of illness having a group for moderate or mild cases and another one for critical cases that require hospitalization in intensity care units the authors affirm that the distinction between diagnosed and nondiagnosed is important because nondiagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones since the later are typically isolated and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and the seriousness of the epidemic phenomena the fact of considering more groups in the sidarthe model than in the seir model allows better discrimination between the different agents involved in the epidemic evolution as well as a better differentiation of the role played by each one however the fact of considering more groups implies the knowledge of more rates probabilities and constants that determine the dynamics between the groups many of these values are difficult to know in practice as well as to estimate the population of some groups such as ailing symptomatic infected undetected the authors choose these constants and quantities to match the model to the actual data of course in order to achieve the goal of better determining public policies we believe that the existence of some of these groups in the model used is not necessary in order to better guide the determination of public policies to mitigate the spread of the virus we propose the use of the control theory control theory has been successfully implemented in several areas other than physical systems control for which it was initially designed for example in economics ecological and biological systems many works demonstrate the success of its implementation of course regardless of the area focused a good control strategy depends on the adequate modeling of the dynamical system to be controlled the proposal to use control in this epidemic is not new it has been first presented in shd20  in this work the authors use the seir model to show that a simple feedback law can manage the

examples the benefits of using feedback control but they do not present the mathematical control laws as well as they do not prove the convergence of the trajectories in the closed loop system examples are implemented by mean of several computational experiments which illustrate the different strategies proposed we propose here the use of a simple proportional controller a standard tool in control theory to calculate the control action this variable guides how to determine npis in order to avoid the collapse of the health system while reducing the damage to the society and the economy that npis inevitably produce this section is addressed to model adequately the disease a suitable model should avoid making unnecessary classifications in order to obtain key data on the behavior of the epidemic these data include number of deaths maximum number of infected people time at which the maximum infection rate will occur among other information useful to prevent and reduce the damage produced by the outbreak the seir model assumes that exposed people have been infected but are not able to transmit the virus before a latency period we will consider that those people continue to be in the susceptible group s whereas we consider the group e as people who have been infected but have no symptoms yet and are capable of transmitting the virus of course part of this group will present symptoms after an incubation time moving to the group i and another part will remain asymptomatic asymptomatic people who have been diagnosed as positive also will be considered in the group i so this group includes all known positive cases symptomatic or not in addition a critical issue is the number of infected people who need hospitalization because the public policies must try to keep this number lower than the capacity of the health care system in order to avoid its collapse thus we define an extra group  hospitalized h the infected population who need hospitalization in the group h we do not differentiate between people hospitalized in mild condition and those in intensive care units icus despite the fact that the number of people in the last subgroup is a critical problem due to an even more limited capacity in icus figure 1 rate processes that describes the progress between the groups in the seihrd model we also consider the population number n as a constant as the seir model does the progression of this epidemic can be modeled by the rate processes described in fig 1  the proposed seihrd model for the spread of the covid-19 disease in an uniform population is given by the following deterministic equations which are presented normalized with respect to the total population n  the groups s e i r h and d are the state variables of the dynamical system 1 they are always nonnegative the time derivatives and are also nonnegative because recovered people and death cannot decrease whereas is always nonpositive because we consider that recovered people cannot be reinfected this fact is represented in fig 1 because the states r and d only have input arrows and the state s only has an output arrow the model 1 is a nonlinear system normalized with respect the population n  considered as a constant hence s  e  i  h  r  d  1 and 6 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has

transmission rates of the virus between the susceptible and the exposed population respectively infected population  and  are the probability of disease transmission in a single contact with exposed infected people times the average daily number of contacts per person and have units of 1day typically  is grater than  assuming that people tend to avoid contact with subjects showing symptoms or diagnosed as positive contacts between susceptible people and hospitalized people are neglected excepting for healthcare workers the probability of contagion from dead people is also neglected despite the fact that some cases were recently reported of course recovered people are no longer able to transmit the virus  u  0 1 is the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical public health interventions npis u  0 means no intervention and the epidemic grows completely free whereas u  1 implies total elimination of the disease spread   is the vaccination rate at which susceptible people became unable to be infected unfortunately in the covid-19 case   0 yet  p 1 is the probability that exposed people develop symptoms  1 is the average period to develop symptoms and  1 is the average time to overcome the disease staying asymptomatic  p 2 is the probability that infected people with symptoms require hospitalization  1 is the average time between infection and the need for hospitalization and  1 is the average time in that infected people recover without hospitalization  p 3 is the probability of hospitalized people die 1 is the average time between the hospitalization and the death and  1 is the average time to recover after hospitalization the parameters used in 1 are not very precisely determined and even differ greatly in the literature consulted see flng  20 lgwsr20 kan20 lzg  20 gbb  20

are related with the basic reproduction number r 0  defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single typical infection in a completely susceptible population jon19  r 0 is not a

understand the spread of an epidemic if r 0  1 the epidemic growths and the number of infected people increases if r 0  1 the epidemic decreases and after a certain time disappears when a large enough

because the contact rates between people decrease note that npis always occur even in countries where no government action has been taken because people spontaneously tend to stay at home and to avoid contact with others this fact explains the disparity of this number in different countries and reported in the references see lgwsr20  here we consider r 0 as a constant reproduction number in the absence of any external action ie as if the disease could spread completely free which of course is an unrealistic scenario specifically the relation between the rates  and  and r 0  can be calculated in model 1 as in jon19gbb  20 resulting in section 3 we propose a pair of values for parameters  and  to evaluate different epidemic scenarios the effectiveness of the npis is considered in the variable u which determines the rate at which susceptible people become exposed several works lzg  20tbt  20gv20ssb20 consider these parameters as time dependent because incorporate in these parameters the impact of governmental actions among other npis the incubation period is estimated as  1  51 days kan20 flng  20 twl  20 the probability of developing symptoms p 1 will be roughly estimated as 8 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 30 2020  the period to overcome the disease without presenting symptoms is  1  147 days deduced from gbb  20 the infectious period with no need of hospitalization is widely accepted as 14 days so   114 the probability to need hospitalization after the infection is p 2  19 low20lzg  20ssb20 and the time from symptom onset to hospitalization is  1  55 days slx  20 the probability to die after hospitalization is p 3  15 according to wm2 flng  20  and the average time to die is 1  112 days slx  20 the average time to recovery after hospitalization is  1  16 days flng  20 finally as it was noted above there is no vaccine against this disease so   0 remark 21 of course most of these parameters are subject to large inaccuracies and they differ greatly in the literature consulted however as we will show below the proposed control method is robust for such uncertainties as well as for measurements errors characterized as unreported or undiagnosed cases and inaccuracies in the group quantities we propose the use of control theory to determine public nonpharmaceuticals interventions npis in order to control the evolution of the epidemic avoiding the collapse of health care systems while minimizing harmful effects on the population and on the economy as noted in shd20  a properly designed feedback-based policy that takes into account both dynamics and uncertainty can deliver a stable result while keeping the hospitalization rate within a desired approximate range furthermore keeping the rate within such a range for a prolonged period allows a society to slowly and safely increase the percentage of people who have some sort of antibodies to the disease because they have either suffered it or they have been vaccinated preferably the latter the action law is given by the control variable u in 1 no intervention from the public health agencies means u  0 and the disease evolves naturally without control at the other hand u  1 means the total impossibility of transmitting the virus which of course is an unrealistic scenario there are several possible choices of the reference signal or set point of the control system one of them may be a small enough number of hospitalized people to not affect the capacity of the intensive care units icus available in the health care system this reference signal maybe nonconstant it can can go up because of an increase in available beds due to capacity additions in the health care system by creation of provisory field hospitals among other similar measures by other hand we must bear in mind that the quantities of each group described in 1 are subject to large inaccuracies due to unreported or undiagnosed cases except for the number of people diagnosed as positive i which is quite well known the number of hospitalized people h and of course the number of deaths d for that reason the output variable to be fed back only can be the infected population i or the hospitalized population h hence the goal of the control action is to keep the number of hospitalized people lower than the set point minimizing the external intervention which produces social discomfort and clearly harm the economy therefore the control action should aim to solve the following constrained optimization problem where t is a considered period and sp is the reference signal or set point in the case it is considered as a constant as a reference the world health organization recommends a number of 80 hospital beds per 10000 population which means an index of 0008 or 08 this number will be used as the sp of the closed loop control system however we must bear in mind that npis impact on physical contacts between susceptible and infected or exposed people if an individual is already infected hospitalization will be required after at most  1  55 days or after  1   1  106 days on average if the infection was recent hence there exists a delay between the adoption of npis and their consequences on hospitalization of people if the control action if calculated based only on the number of hospitalized people the following 106 days too many people may require hospitalization exceeding the capacity for medical care in control jargoon it means that there are almost two weeks with the system operating in an open loop therefore the control action needs to be calculated as a function of the number of infected people i the number of exposed people e is quite unknown in order to avoid future hospitalization requirements in the next 106 days at most this strategy is known as predictive control fig 2 shows the closed loop control system the variable process is the infected population i and the control signal is the effectiveness of the npi 10 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint

paper next we show the results of different strategies of npis applied on the seihrd model in this first series of experiments we apply a constant control action u that is the system shown in fig 2 is an open loop control one we consider as initial conditions i  e  0001 h  r  d  0 so s  0998 that is 01 of the population is diagnosed as positive the first day and 01 of the population is asymptomatic infected during the first days of the epidemic it was logical to consider that both exposed and infected people could spread the virus at the same ratio because the contagion between humans was not known then this disease could spread in a completely free scenario in which no action is taken this scenario has been called naif  by several authors ssb20 lzg  20 using the expression 2 with r 0 28 as in ssb20lzg  20 and assuming that no actions are taken during the epidemic then 01786 the evolution of exposed infected hospitalized and dead people in this case is shown in the fig 3  in this naif  scenario and using as initial condition 1 infected and 1 exposed person for different population values n  1 000  the maximum are always 1775 for the exposed and 1575 for the infected and the times when these maximums are reached depend on the population value n as is shown in the fig 4  the delay between both maximums is a constant value 11 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

deaths group with no npi naif scenario of 9 days additionally the number of dead people forecasted by this model is about 517 of the total population clearly this naif  scenario seemed to be unrealistic since people tend to avoid contact with subjects showing symptoms or diagnosed as positive due to the severity of the covid-19 disease in consequence as we stated before in a more realistic scenario  is greater than  in the rest of this paper we consider   2 to take into account this assumption fig 5 shows the areas of every group along the time in the case with no npi actions

final number of deaths as well as the maximum number of hospitalized people which is a crucial issue in order not to collapse the health system the maximum value of h reaches the sp  moreover a late application of this strategy after 4 weeks since the first case arose also significantly reduces these numbers in this section we simulate the behavior of the trajectories described by the normalized system 1 subject to a proportional control action the objective of the control action is that the number of hospitalized people does not exceed the number of available beds of course this number is highly variable in different countries and can be increased during the duration of the epidemic with the construction of field hospitals among other resources on the other hand as noted in sec 3 to adopt as feedback variable the number of hospitalized people may lead to an overload of the health system in the following 106 days for which a predictive control must be used that consider the number of infected people i not all infected people need hospitalization most of the symptomatic cases are mild and remain mild in severity low20 slx  20 1  p 2  81 so we consider that p 2  19 of infected people will need hospitalization in the following  1  55 days this number plus the number of people already hospitalized h must remain below the set point of course we neglect the number of beds occupied by patients hospitalized for other diseases hence the proportional control variable is chosen as where k p is the proportional scalar gain with values between 0 1 note that if i  0 u  0 and there is no need of a public intervention because no one is going to require hospitalization on the following 55 days and with k p  1 if a percentage of 19 of the infected people is equal to the number of available beds sp  h u  1 which means that the public intervention must completely avoid the transmission of the virus because all these people will require hospitalization after  1  55 days on average another point of view is to consider that this is a tracking trajectory problem with a time dependent reference signal equal to rt  sp  ht we consider the same initial condition than in the former series of experiments i  e  0001 ie 01 of the population infected and presenting symptoms at the first day and we suppose that 01 of the population is infected and asymptomatic fig 7 shows the trajectories of the variables vs time with a gain k p  1 note that the number of people hospitalized is always smaller than the set point fig 8 shows the control signal vs time the control signal presents a maximum value of 08227 and the area under the curve of the control signal vs time is 988829 of course the smaller this action the less the damage to the population and to the economy the constant control signal equal to 04 presents an area under the curve equal to 100 and equal to 888 when it is applied after 4 weeks see table 1  we must bear in mind that npis are determined by governmental or popular decisions and hardly can change every day as the control signal calculated by the proportional controller does thus we consider the application of npis with effectiveness shown in fig 9  the amplitudes and times of this control signal were obtained from that shown in fig 8  the detail of the trajectories of the states presented in fig 10 shows that there are no significant changes in the results presented the maximum number of hospitalized people is 00057 the final number of deaths is 00132 and the area under the curve u vs time is 8738 15 all rights reserved no reuse

application of npis calculated using a proportional controller with different values of the scalar gain k p  in this section we consider the more realistic situation in which the parameters are partially unknown as mentioned in sec 2 there are large uncertainties in the parameters they diverge a lot according to the researched references and they are very different according to the country studied in this series of experiments the parameter  is randomly chosen is also randomly chosen between 015 and 06 the parameter  between 0008 and 004 the incubation time  1 between 2 and 6 daysthe probability to present symptoms p 1 between 40 and 80 the time of recovering between 14 and 16 days for both symptomatic or asymptomatic people the probability to be hospitalized p 2 is considered as a gaussian distribution function of mean 019 and standard deviation of 01 the time to be hospitalized  1 is chosen between 3 and 7 days the probability to die p 3 between 10 and 16 the time to die 1 between 3 and 12 days finally the time of recovering from hospitalization  1 is randomly chosen between 10 and 20 days in addition we also consider that there exists some noncompliance of the nonpharmaceutical interventions hence we apply to the system 1 a control signal with gaussian distribution of mean 80 of that calculated in 3 with standard deviation of 10 that is we assume that there is 20 on average of noncompliance with the public measures adopted the initial conditions are also i  e  0001 and the gain is k p  1 fig  11 shows the trajectories of the states of the model 1 during

control signal over time using a proportional controller and considering 20 of noncompliance of the npis policies on average the blue curve is that calculated in 3 the red curve is the control signal considering the randomic noncompliance public measures the control signal calculated by this method aims to guide the adoption of npis in order of minimizing the social impact and the economical damages as an example recently the argentine government relaxed some restrictions adopted in the quarantine period allowing more economic and recreational activities in some cities the only criterion used to adopt this measure was the number of days in which the number of infected people doubled the so-called doubling time even thought this decision also can be considered as a closed loop control action the criterion adopted is a little improvised an open question is how to translate the rate of effectiveness of the npi calculated by the controller into concrete actions adopted by governments or public health authorities moreover we must bear in mind that these measures cannot be continuously varied along the time as the control signal does but they are decisions that will remain valid for at least few days however although this issue is out of the scope of this paper some decision can be changed every day for example the number of individuals with permission to leave their homes or the number of people allowed to get into a store among other little decisions that can change every day according to the control variable suggests 20 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

modern cities have been built on terrain that was previously vegetated and part of biologically diverse ecosystems this was often on productive farmland that was not protected from encroachment as municipalities expanded and opened pristine areas to development the encroachment continues as rural citizens and their families are attracted to urban centers for the way of life they seemed to offer this starts with employment possibilities education for workers children and family health services as manufacturingindustrial operations and large and small businesses that serviced them spurs economic development agricultural projects are located mainly away from population centers be they major metropolises or smaller cities they provide food security for urban citizens through brought into markets in-ground crops bush crops and tree crops they cultivate and through animal husbandry eg beef and dairy cattle poultry hogs sheep the last chapter described how manufacturingindustrial endeavors can present potential harm to the health of urban and rural citizens and to natural resource rich ecosystems that help sustain them and how to find solutions to the problems this chapter will discuss the problems that food production methods present the threats they pose to urban populations that are generally distant from them and possible solutions to such problems it should be noted that animal husbandry range stock will cause little environmental harm if herds and flocks are properly tended however commercial high production operations can create massive waste-related problems eg manure urine  pathogens eg salmonella e coli listeria coronavirus foot and mouth disease added to this are the wastes of blood innards bones heads feet skin feathers from the slaughter and dressing of ruminants and poultry in addition there are the problems from the overuse of antibiotics and growth hormones anabolic steroids delivered to food animals via feed or patches the overuse of antibiotics for animal husbandry may stimulate the mutation of target bacteria to antimicrobial strains that can resist antibiotics treatment of human bacterial infections and result in patient death the risk to human health is a worry to the medical community 1 world wide it was estimated that in 2014 there were 700000 deaths attributed to microbial resistant infections 2 3 this problem can begin to be alleviated by using antibiotics only for sick animals and not an entire herd or flock and research that focuses on medicines to kill the existing antibiotic strains this should be coupled with the elimination of the use of growth hormones in commercial operations where food animals or food-giving animals are raised residues of these antibiotics and growth hormones have been found in the meats from food animals and over time can build up in consumers billions in cities and be dangerous to their long term health we will discuss what governments are doing to minimize the use of chemicals in animal husbandry operations many in the global population  especially babies young children and the aged in africa and the middle east suffered with chronic malnutrition and starvation from famine in 2017 this is the result of drought people being displaced from their homes by warring factions and decisions not to allow humanitarian food supplies to reach starving populations thus exacerbating the famine problem if there is agricultural land that adds to the food security and it is nearby expanding cities this land should be preserved and neither encroached upon by growing populations nor be subject to seizure by eminent domain laws for economic development here we have a moral question should cities limit population growth
from
and immigration
to prevent encroachment the flow of people to cities can be arrested if urban attractions are not driving forces this means improving the services available in rural areas by subsidizing farming increasing employment opportunities and upgrading and increasing educational offerings there should also be improvement in rural health care facilities with professional and support staff and well stocked with basic medications and with ready access to diagnostic medical equipment this solution is easily prescribed but difficult to bring to fruition mainly for economic reasons but also by the reluctance of some trained personnel to move to rural areas such as those needed to provide professional health services nonetheless a start in bringing this prescription to reality may slow urban population influx from in-migration and lessen the possible encroachment on productive land as indicated above it is good practice to preserve farmland near an urban center not only from population encroachment but also from processes that can degrade good agricultural soil and affect the quality and yield of food crops grown and hence food security the former action requires a municipal decree that will prevent squatting and establishment of shantytowns on protected land the latter requires that consultants assess erosion potential of farm acreage and provide solutions to prevent erosion by wind eg change plow and seed method to slice and seed plant vegetation wind breaks at peripheries of croplands or by flowing water after heavy rains eg by diversion channels to safe discharge locations if this could be a problem when protected land is to be used for agriculture experts have to determine what water requirements will be for crops that are planned and consider how this might change if crops are rotated alternated and thus affect urban water security will crops be irrigated or rain fed or be sustained by a combination of both if irrigation is necessary will the irrigation technique to be used preserve water supplies eg drip irrigation that needs initial investment and subsequent maintenance or will it lose precious water to evaporation during arm irrigation will the irrigation water come from aquifers or surface waterways if from aquifers is the seasonal discharge balanced by recharge so as to sustain water supplies and prevent subsidence as may occur if subsidence were to take place there can be additional problems that affect a population that were discussed in a previous chapter eg greater susceptibility to flooding ruptured infrastructure in planning for the future there is the question of how will projected climate changes affect availability of the agricultural water supply over time and perhaps require changes in crops that should be grown
 genetic modifications can produce seeds that may protect farm crops from weeds and repel pests that harm crops or diminish yields thereby avoiding the application of chemicals to do the job this eliminates chemical residues on vegetables and fruits that if not thoroughly washed can enter the human food chain and potentially be harmful to consumers however ingestion of gmo grown products could be a risk to human health as suggested by controlled experiments in these rats developed lesions suffered organ damage and died after consuming gmo grown potatoes however a critical review of the literature suggested that the published research left an incomplete evaluation regarding the safety toxicity of gm crops eaten by humans and fed to animals this is because there was no unified experimental methods so that reports could not be properly reviewed and perhaps more important experiments could not be repeated a key to validation of experimental results 4 there have been failures in gm grown corn that contributes to mutated resistant insects that attack gm growing crops and pesticide protected crops for example the rootworm that infected corn developed a resistance to gmo corn treated with bacillus thuringiensis bt 5 6 in a sense this can be likened to the overuse of antibiotics in cattle feed consumed in feedlots that resulted in the mutation of bacteria to strains resistant to antibiotic therapy there is the fear that during pollination of gm crops the pollen will be carried to non-gmo fields and affect the purity of their crops in capulalpam mexico  scientists documented the discovery of transgenic genes in the mexican native corn in 2013 mexico banned the entry of gm corn it is because of uncertainty of their effects on human and animal health and food security that gm crops are not allowed in the european union several nations in africa and elsewhere in addition some researchers believe that there is the potential for an allergic reaction in humans from ingestion of gm based corn products organically grown foodstuffs obviate the chemicals or gms problems but do not produce the mass of crops needed to feed large and growing global and urban populations as was the case for the gmo green revolution that allowed many countries to improve their food security microbes associated with plants from biomes on all continents except antarctica have been studied in great detail and some identified as to the characteristic they give to plants that assist agricultural projects  these have been cultured batch produced and used to coat seeds the first product of this effort indigo cotton cotton seeds coated with a proprietary mix of microbes bacteria and fungi were sown in west texas in 2016 this resulted in an 11 improvement in yield by protecting the crop against drought stress 7 similarly treated seeds of soy rice wheat and corn coated with proprietary microbe mixtures have been produced with like results this adds to the food security of city and mega-city populations dependent on foods from outside the urban locations complementing advances in natural hybridization and gmo that impart seed properties that protect crop yield the company is working on microbial products that can reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizer and that offer protection against pests
 another major food security concern for growing urban and global populations are problems with animal husbandry during growth and after slaughter and distribution it is most threatening to ecosystems close to where thousands to millions of animals are bred in close quarters eg cattle feed lots and commercial chicken farms respectively and where they are taken for slaughter the problems are how to capture and control the wastes and how to safely use them or dispose of them so as not to contaminate soils and waterways or aquifers these are manure and urine from cattle plus pigs sheep and goats and fecal matter from chickens plus ducks turkeys added to this are slaughter house wastes fluids blood wash water and solids heads innards skins bones feathers plus pathogens eg salmonella e coli listeria coronavirus foot and mouth disease from dressing the food animals if these wastes are not collected and put to use by manufacturers or not disposed of securely to prevent interaction with the environment they can pollute and diminish food production and contaminate natural resources in terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems this may be by rainwater runoff of fecal matter rich in nutrient into food fish habitats eg oceans estuaries rivers the nutrient rich runoff fuels algal blooms that poison habitats with toxins or cause depletion of oxygen eutrophication as cited previously both toxins and eutrophication can result in great fish kills also leakage of pollutants in waters from animal husbandry locales into soils can contaminate crops this might be by unregulated disposal of solid matter that allows rainwater to interact with soils and as previously noted move dissolved contaminants into soils and by seepage through soils into aquifers thereby contaminating them as noted in an earlier paragraph free range stock will not cause such environmental harm when herds are properly tended eg prevent overgrazing but will have fewer but organically bred food animals to sell to appreciate the extent of the animal husbandry waste problem we can examine the issue with thousands and thousands of tons of manure generated at cattle feedlots each head of cattle in a feedlot can drop 1520 times the mass of manure as does one person a lactating dairy cow can excrete 44 times a persons output 8 thus a feedlot with 50000 cattle would excrete the same mass of manure daily of about 800000 people there are 32 such lots licensed in kansas usa state with well over 2000000 heads of cattle in feedlots the sheer mass and volume of manure that has to be disposed of and well cleansed of pathogens and residues of growth hormones anabolic steroids and antibiotics used in animal husbandry this can be accomplished in three ways done properly this can reduce the risk of contamination of water and soils that can negatively affect food delivered to urban centers as well as clean water security and limit the evolution of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria that threaten the healthcare community topics that will be treated in following paragraphs pigs and sheep raised in close quarters and that are infused with growth hormones and antibiotics generate masses of solid wastes that should be treated as described below for cattle an initial disposal method used was to spread raw manure over acreage with its contained pathogens and residues of growth hormones and antibiotics mobilization of these pollutants by rainwater melting snow or floodwater has contaminated nearby surface waters by inflow and via leakage into soils and seepage through soils into aquifers ingestion of these residues from soil grown and irrigated foodstuffs that are not thoroughly washed can be health threatening over time to consumers by bioaccumulation in body organs in the end the volume of manure generated daily overwhelmed the available acreage and required the use of other disposal methods that would not endanger people and ecosystems planning teams for building a new city have to determine possible health risks may originate from previous use of what appear to be good terrain for development but that may have been for animal husbandry if so the teams have to assess how and where wastes were disposed of and the efficiency of such disposal one disposal method uses heat generated by manure fermentation to kill pathogens at or close to the waste accumulation site masses of manure are stacked up and with time ferment and heat up from within to temperatures that eliminate pathogens growth hormones  and antibiotics 131 f but 160 f for 15 days higher temperatures will kill beneficial microbes  a problem with this method is that the high temperatures do not reach the outer edges of the stacks leaving a significant amount of the contaminants active 9 10 these would have to be retreated another fermentation method to cleanse cattle manure is to compost it in large rotatable drums that hold thousands of pounds of manure that are turned once a week for six weeks this mixes and aerates the manure thus distributing the built up heat 131 f but 160 f throughout the mass eliminating 90 of the health threatening components in this way the tonnage of manure changed to compost is reduced by 60 the sterilized nutrient rich manure product can be dried bagged and sold as fertilizer that also enhances moisture retention by soils the manure product can also be dried pressed into briquets and combusted to produce energy 9 10 this can be an economic benefit to feedlot owners chickens produce an average of 0054 pound of manure daily 8 a commercial operation with one million chickens would produce 27 lbs 12 14 kg of manure daily or 54 lbs 245 kg daily for two million chickens the manure is nutrient rich nitrogen and phosphorus but is a carrier of disease and internal parasites when this is spread on fields as a disposal method runoff during rainstorms can carry the waste to discharge into productive rivers estuaries and oceans that may be serving the interests of urban populations as discussed earlier the nutrient rich matter stimulates algal and toxic dinoflagellates growth when algae die they decompose using oxygen in the water to the point where there is no oxygen for fish and a resulting massive fish kill including oysters and clams  when toxic dinoflagellates die they release a neurotoxin into the water that manifests itself in the ocean as a red tide and millions of dead fish this causes a break in the aqueous food web and temporarily diminishes food fish security for coastal communities cities and towns villages as well as causing a temporary economic disruption for fisheries instead of spreading the chicken manure on fields and causing ecological and economic problems many commercial poultry producers are composting and aging the manure for 23 months and then recycling it as fertilizers the perdue chicken producer set up a large scale controlled composting operation that has profitably processed 650000 tons

 urine from feedlots that is not captured and properly treated before discharging it at the surface can seep through soil into groundwater and contaminate it with the chemical nitrate groundwater carries the nitrate slowly down flow commonly at 15 ft 30150 cm a day depending on the aquifer rock permeability if there is a population 5 mi 8 km down flow out of sight out of mind that uses the groundwater as its primary source a 5 ft a day flow rate would bring the nitrate contaminated water from a feedlot to unaware users in about 14 years if urine input were to stop it would take 14 years for the contaminated aquifer water to clear a municipal or individual well 5 mi away if the aquifer flow rate is less than the 5 ft 150 cm a day then the time to reach a user or for contaminated water to clean the well is longer this is a possible problem planners have to deal with untreated nitrate-laced water can be unknowingly used to prepare baby formula and the subsequent bioaccumulation of nitrate in a babys system has caused blue baby sickness a type of nitrogen narcosis it is important for a planning team that proposes to use aquifer water for a new city or more likely redevelopment of a city to accommodate its growing population to do four things first is to have analyses made of the water to check its potability or need for treatment second is to determine what projects are or were up flow and what contaminants were or could have been released as untreated effluents onto aquifer recharge areas remember that recharge areas are extensive so that surveys of what possible contaminant sources might be in the recharge zones or have been there in the recent past have to be broad and fairly far reaching third is to determine the flow rate of the aquifer water fourth if treatment is necessary planning on how to treat the water at a well site or at the tap and the cost of doing so determined this precludes an assessment of whether a collection treatment facility and clean water distribution network is feasible given the costs for its construction operation and maintenance a chemical element that has poisoned groundwater sickened many and put millions in india and bangladesh
at health risk before its presence was discovered is arsenic as the arsenic has nothing to do with animal husbandry but is worth mentioning here to emphasize the fact that ground water has to be analyzed at its source and along its flow path the arsenic originated from excessive seasonal extraction of groundwater for irrigation from 20000 tube wells during the green revolution the water was used as well for drinking cooking and personal hygiene excessive pumping lowered the water table during a crop growing season and exposed the arsenic bearing mineral pyrite in the aquifer rock to oxidation that released an arsenic toxin to groundwater when recharge took place after a harvest once the health problems were diagnosed and related to arsenic ingestion methods were designed to remove this toxic metal from the groundwater 12 as important as dealing with solid and liquid wastes generated in food supply businesses is dealing with the residues from growth hormones anabolic steroids implanted in cattle as they enter feedlots in the united states there are three natural and three synthetic steroids in use at slaughter houses these are found in measurable concentrations in beef muscle and fat and organ meats eg liver and kidneys these may be consumed by most urban citizens that do not opt to buy organic meat products most often because of higher cost in addition to beef cattle the steroids are also allowed for use in dairy cows and sheep but not for pigs or poultry the use of the recombinant bovine growth hormone rbgh was banned in meat production in the european union in 1988 and subsequently in canada australia new zealand and japan because the rbgh gives rise in milk to igf-1 a chemical that helps some types of cells to grow and may influence the risk of prostate breast or colorectal cancer 13 14 because the growth hormones cause unnatural cell growth a phase in the development of cancer it is incumbent on governments to further investigate banning their use in animal husbandry also their ingestion by humans and possible bioaccumulation in vital organs may alter fetal development and bring about early puberty early puberty in young girls and breast development could be a target for unnatural cell growth and a catalyst for breast cancer 15 there is a paucity of research reports on steroid sex hormone residues and meat consumption however a 2007 paper reported on meat consumption during pregnancy associated with sperm concentration and volume in sons of women in two groups  low meat consumption and high meat consumption the sperm concentrations and volumes were 243 higher for the low meat consumption group but for the sons of the high meat consumption group 18 had sperm concentrations below the who standards threshold for sub-fertility this was three times greater than the sons of the low meat consumption group 16 the probable health issues that arise from the secondary ingestion of growth hormones should drive the united states congress and regulators from other governments to increase financial support in this research field
 equally important to human health in cities and villages as regards animal husbandry as well as in food producing ecosystems is the use of antibiotics in feed for cattle and other food animals raised in feedlots or other close quarters eg pens cages and the sometimes poor hygienic condition there in 2009 in the united states 288 million lbs 131 million kg of drugs were sold for livestock use and 72 million lbs 33 million kg for human use 80 vs 20 respectively many of those antibiotics that are commonly used to treat human bacterial infections were sold and used for livestock 17 18 the drugs are employed to stimulate livestock growth and to protect the enclosed animals from sickness medical professionals fear that the sheer volume of the antibiotics being used abets the mutation of bacteria to antibiotic resistant strains before mutation antibiotics could control most pathogens that cause sickness in humans medical groups have suggested that antibiotic use should be limited to feedlot cattle that are sick and not to every head in the feedlot this would spectacularly reduce the volume of antibiotics used and slow the evolution of mutated strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria as of january 1 2017 farmers in the united states needed a prescription or veterinary food directive to use antibiotics that are important to humans drug resistant bacteria pose a public health threat that is not a major focus of pharmaceutical research into effective antibiotics against the resistant bacterial strains this is likely because pharmaceutical companies are tasked to deliver maximum dividends to their stockholders thus there is no heavy investment in antibiotic research that is not foreseen as yielding strong financial returns however to counter this government funding in the united states and other countries is being directed to government and university research laboratories to focus on the development of drugs to be effective against the resistant bacterial strains
 an example of a looped project in the eritrean coastal desert begins with a 5 km 3 mi long canal that brings red sea water into concrete lined shrimp tanks to prevent leakage into surface ecosystems or the underlying aquifer the shrimp species penaeus vannamel and indian prawn penaeus indicus tolerate changes in salinity temperature ph and oxygen the sea water from the tanks is then channeled into three salt lakes for aquaculture cultivation of tilapia and milk fish chanos chanos for food and to make products including shrimp feed from recycled fish heads waste from the lakes rich in organic nutrients is carried by water to fertilize salicornia farming salicornia is a succulent plant that can grow normally in fields irrigated with salt water its seeds are pressed to give oil and young shoots of salicornia are exported to europe where they are considered a gourmet vegetable the waste from salicornia is used to make particle board firebrick and animal fodder the seawater then seeps into the soil and flows back to the red sea although the looped process worked well the business was not economically profitable because of management problems and lack of enough production to meet demand development of sustainable aquaculture in coastal eritrea and other countries can contribute significantly to urban centers protein rich food supplies and is ongoing 21 net-penned fish aquaculture plus shellfish shrimp oysters algae in estuarine and nearshore ocean environments that allows free water exchange with the pens has a lesser ecosystem waste problem than the contained pseudo ecosystems however if the fish have been genetically modified to stimulate growth and prevent disease there is the problem of escape from a pen and interaction with wild species that may negatively alter the wild species genome aquaculture products should be checked periodically by certified consultants to detect any unhealthy contents of chemicals in their flesh in the same way ocean food fish eg tuna swordfish tilefish king mackerel shark are tested for mercury a neurotoxin results would then be subject to recommendations made by the medical community for rate of consumption as is the case for mercury in the species named above
  how do epidemiologists know how many people will get covid19 patrick ball   in the united states as of 9 april 2020 there is a severe shortage of tests for sarscov2 the virus that causes people to become sick with covid19 as a consequence even people in hospital with obvious and severe symptoms of covid19 are rarely tested for the virus furthermore it is by now becoming clearer that many perhaps most people infected with sarscov2 have mild or no symptoms the combination of these factors means that only a small fraction of sarscov2 cases are ever confirmed by a positive test in practice the confirmed case counts tell us more about the availability and distribution of tests than about the prevalence of infections consequently the true number of sarscov2positive individuals is necessarily much higher than the reported counts but how much higher 

 

 the total size of the infected population determines how many people will need critical care and how many will ultimately die it is therefore important for healthcare planning economic policy and public communication to estimate the population prevalence of sarscov2 infection the foundation of epidemiological modelling is the sir model this model enables us to estimate the progression day by day of the sizes of three subpopulations those who are susceptible s infectious i and removed r on each day some of those who are susceptible get infected and themselves become infectious to other people the number of people who become infected is a combination of how contagious the disease is as well as the effectiveness of social distancing handwashing and other practices that can limit transmission similarly on each day some of those who are infected will recover or die and these people are no longer at risk of transmitting the disease we call these people removed in the sense that they are no longer part of the infected population this model is dynamic which means that it changes over time to understand what is happening today each component of the model depends on what was happening yesterday with the other components we can observe the number of deaths on each day dt this is pretty much the only part of the pandemic we can measure without a lot of uncertainty there is still a little error because not all deaths due to covid19 are reported correctly and some deaths that are not due to covid19 might be reported in error 

 

 susceptible in this context means available to become infected the number of people in a population n who are susceptible on day t equals the number susceptible yesterday minus the people who are newly infected today vt st  s
t1  vt note that as long as people can only be infected once the number of susceptible people can only go down this is not usually defined as a separate term but it is worth noticing that the number of people who recover and are no longer sick each day is some fraction  of all the people infected up to and including yesterday minus all the people who died up to and including yesterday i
t1  d
t1 the  term is a proportion between 0 and 1 and it tells us how many people are recovering most sir models lump together the recovered and dead but i think it is useful to think about them as separate processes i will use this definition of recovered in the next two definitions the number of infected people on day t equals the number infected yesterday plus the people newly infected today minus the people who died yesterday minus the people who recovered yesterday note the recovered term at the end it  i
t1  vt  d
t1  i
t1  d
t1 this number can go up as new infections occur and down as people recover or die the number of people removed on day t equals the number removed yesterday plus the people who died yesterday plus the people who recovered yesterday note the recovered term at the end rt  r
t1  d
t1  i
t1  d
t1 note that as long as people can only be infected once the number of removed people can only go up the number of new infections each day is equal to the number of susceptible people yesterday times some fraction  of the infected proportion the infected proportion is simply the proportion of the population who were infected yesterday 

 the  term is a measure of infectiousness  is mathematically related to the epidemiological term r
0 which is the average number of people that each infected person newly infects i have shown it here as  rather than r
0 so that the role of infectiousness can be clear in the mathematics relating the susceptible and infected populations the fraction of the infected people who will eventually die equals the total deaths summing all the daily totals divided by the total people ever infected 

 this rate may change as health care is overloaded or as new treatments are discovered it is different for people of different ages and different comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension and smoking there is still considerable debate about the p number which is usually expressed as a percentage most sources report that p seems to be between 05 and 20 averaged across various studies various age groups and various comorbidities we can estimate the sir values by using the relationships among them and information from clinical studies the new york times has an interactive online tool nytims3cfqpnf which allows a user to see immediately the effect of changing any of these parameters covid19 can be understood as a generic epidemic which has its own values of these parameters of course policy and human behavior influence the parameters too by reducing transmission through social distancing reducing fatalities through better treatment and ultimately reducing susceptibility through a vaccine the processes over time can be seen in figure 1 page 13 the top graph shows the number of deaths each day which is the only measure we can really observe the middle graph shows the number of new infections each day note that it leads the deaths by a couple of weeks and the length of this lead is another variable in the model which can only be observed through limited clinical studies the bottom graph shows the sir values the susceptible population green line starts with everyone and declines over time the infected group orange line rises for a while then slowly declines the removed population blue line rises over time eventually including everyone  the dead and the survivors different modelling projects approach this framework differently which parts are assumed measured or modelled vary among different studies some models let the interactive user guess different values of r
0 and thereby  or p and thereby  while other models incorporate measures from small clinical studies some models include an intervening term exposure between the susceptible population and infection not all susceptible people are exposed and the unexposed people cannot become infected the mathematics that connects all the pieces is also different in different models in the long term we will learn which models were best however time is too short for more than a tiny number of these models to be subject to formal peer review in time to be relevant that means it is more important than ever that engaged laypeople especially journalists have at least a minimum sense of how to read these essential studies  kermack w and mckendrick a 1927 a contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics proceedings of the royal society of london series a mathematical and physical sciences 115 700721  anderson r m and may rm 1991 infectious diseases of humans oxford oxford university press i am interpreting these ideas from a paper by james johndrow kristian lum and me

propagation in a large popula- tion with specific reference to india ashish menon nithin rajendran k anish chandrachud girish setlur  deterministic mathematical models called compartmental models of disease propagation such as the sir model and its variants msir carrier state seir seis mseir mseirs models are used to study the propagation of covid19 in a large population with specific reference to india  the sir model is one of the simplest compartmental models employed to mathematically model infectious diseases this model comprises of three compartments susceptible s infectious i and recovered r the first two compartments -susceptible and infectious -have self-explanatory names recovered can however be looked at from a broader perspective more generally we can say that r consist of all the immune individuals an immune individual can either be recovered or deceased because neither of them can catch nor transmit the concerned disease each of these quantities is time-dependent owing to the progressive nature of the disease assuming a deterministic system we model the epidemic using ordinary differential equations by deterministic we mean the state of each compartment at any instant in time is completely determined by the initial conditions of the system along with the differential equations in simple models vital dynamics like the birth rate and death rate are omitted while in more general models they too are taken into account we will look into both types of models in this paper the odes used to model in a simple sir model without using vital dynamics are as follows the growth rate of the disease is defined as the product of number of susceptible and infectious individuals here  is the disease transmission rate and  is the recovery rate the nonlinear term in the above equations may be understood as follows the rate at which the number of infected people increases with time is related to the size of the event which corresponds to infected individuals and susceptible individuals coming into close proximity with one another the size of this event is clearly proportional to the product of the number of susceptible individuals s and the number of infected individuals i conversely the number of susceptible individuals falls at the same rate as they cease to be susceptible and become infected equation 2 01 suggests that the number of susceptible individuals decreases with the growth rate of the disease since growth rate is never negative it implies that the function st is a decreasing function equation 2 02 suggests that the rate of increase in infectious individuals increases with the growth rate obviously and decreases with more individuals getting infectious finally equation 203 suggests the recovery immunity rate is directly proportional to the number of infectious individuals this implies that rt is an increasing function since the total population must remain constant we have an additional equation st  it  rt  n constant our objective is to develop a model for any country irrespective of their total population count so it makes sense to divide the above equations by their total population this way s i and r are rendered fractional values to build up more on this idea we will introduce some terminologies  basic reproduction ratio r 0     this ratio helps determine the expected number of secondary infections given a primary set of initial conditions  resolution time t  1   this gives a measure of the average time taken to determine the fate of an individual after contracting the disease recovery or death a solution to the sir model over the course of two weeks is shown in figure 1  3  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

parameters mentioned it was observed that it took roughly 477 days for the epidemic to reach its peak value at this time 430 individuals were infected it was also observed that only a meagre 14 individuals were never infected throughout the entire epidemic until recently only numerical methods were used to solve the sir model but in 2014 harko and his coauthors derived an analytical solution let us differentiate eq 201 with respect to time t we get - now eq 202 transforms to now eliminating i from eq 203  eq301 4  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the

where s 0 is a positive integration constant now differentiating the above eq we get - now if we differentiate eq 301 and substitute the values of s we get - we make the following further substitutions set this yields we make the following final substitution this leads to a bernoulli type differential equation  whose general solution is from this we may infer the time dependencies of the sir model however this method is only of academic interest as modern computers obviate the need for such methods that are not easily generalizable practically it makes more sense to treat time as discrete since data is recorded not more frequently than once a day or more usually once every few days when this is done the following difference as opposed to differential equations are obtained a discrete version of eq 201 202 and 203 would be-  eq 302 now similarly we get analogous expressions for r and i these difference equations may then be easily iterated on a modern computer to yield the final results in 1999 jh he introduced a new method of solving coupled nonlinear odes called the variational iteration method vim the idea behind this method is as follows imagine we are called upon to solve a likely nonlinear ode the idea is to come up with a sequence of functions u n t such that lim n u n t  xt the sequence of these functions is postulated to be the idea is to adjust  s which is called a lagrange multiplier in such a way that lim assuming u n t is close to xt we want to see how to make sure that u n1 t is even closer to xt ignoring the higher powers of  u n t we get the way to make sure that u n1 t is even closer to xt is to ensure that  u n1 t  0 this is achieved by the following identifications this means  n st  exp  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

posted may 5 2020  with the lagrange multiplier fixed we may iterate eq 304 on a computer until the desired accuracy is achieved before the advent of fast computers analyticalsemi-analytical methods such as these were very useful but now we have many more options to choose from applying the variational iteration method in eq 201 202 and 203 we derive the correctional functional as follows where  1   2 and  3 are lagrange multipliers and x n  y n and z n are obtained as discussed above and the equations may be iterated to achieve the desired accuracy in this work however we prefer to use standard numerical solvers of commercial packages such as matlab and mathematica it was observed that some diseases including common cold did not grant any long-lasting immunity to model such infections the recovered r compartment had to be taken out from the sir model 7  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020  using the parameters given above it was observed that it took roughly 6 days for the epidemic to reach its peak value at this time 820 individuals were infected it was also observed that 180 individuals were never infected throughout the entire epidemic in many infections newborns were found to be disproportionately less affected measles is one such infection where the babies were found to be less susceptible this is due to a passive immunity they possess from maternal antibodies which are passed to them across the placenta so we require a new compartment called maternally-derived immunity m to the model now on loosing this passive immunity individuals in m compartment would transit to the s compartment gradually a non-negative number of these individuals would further move to the i compartment however not every new-born has this passive immunity only a part of them may have it depending on whether the mothers possessed the antibodies before their birth or not so we assume that only a fraction q of these newborns possess passive immunity and the rest do not implies that 1  q fraction of births is into the s compartment consequently the odes that are used in this model are as follows  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020  here  is the birth rate and  is the death rate since the very essence of this model is passive immunity observed in newborns modelling without making use of vital dynamics would not have made sense consequently the birth rate was added to equation 4 04 and a fraction  is subtracted from all the compartments to take care of the death rate a simulation of a compartmental model including vital dynamics would give an idea of how extinction of the population is real possibility an msir model is simulated in fig 3   in some diseases like tuberculosis some individuals may never fully recover and continue to carry the infection in due course of time they may either fall sick again or would infect other susceptible individuals or both to model this infection again a new compartment of carriers c that toggle with i is introduced note that all those cases in which the carriers both fall sick themselves and also infect other individuals is taken care of in two steps -c  i and s  i in many infectious diseases there is an exposed period after the transmission of infection to susceptible individuals when they can potentially transmit the infection this period comes before these people develop symptoms and transmit infection so a new compartment of exposed e individuals is set up if the average incubation period of the infection is taken to be an exponential distribution  to incorporate this exposed period the odes that have to be used are as follows 9  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the

once the immunity is lost 5 data mining pre-processing and modelling of covid-19 pandemic with specific reference to india the crucial prerequisite for this project is the availability of data of various states in ample amount the more the details the better most often we do not encounter clean data ie we usually are not able to avail data-sets in the format we desire to be able to work with this data it is crucial to pre-process them which in itself is a significantly time-consuming task the next step is to model the pandemic with simple ordinary differential equations odes using compartmental models like sir and sis various parameters will be involved in these equations prudent values have to be assigned to these parameters to solve the differential equations clues for deciding them can be obtained from the data we pre-processed once this is done the evolution of all compartments with time have to be plotted to understand the nature of the pandemic and to hunt methods to flatten the curve the classical approach to model epidemics involves creating a set of coupled linear differential equations with multiple variables these equations may be solved to obtain analytical solutions or can also be solved numerically using initial values and estimatesfor example using eulers method parallel computing involves solving lengthy problems by dividing them into smaller sub-problems which are solved simultaneously to obtain the complete answer to the larger problem it is very efficient in overcoming physical constraints that prevent frequency modulation

copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020  for simulations involving small populations of people an efficient method is to represent each individual in the population as a string or vector of characteristic data and simulate the epidemic using computational means this type of model is referred to as mbi models based on individuals it can be used to include a large number of characteristics for each individualsuch as age sex pre-existing health conditions external factors this method however is computation heavy and uses quite a lot of memory and processing time if the population being modelled is very large for mbi parallel processing has been used to significantly reduce computation time for models such as sir simulations can be run parallely on clusters of computers making use of data from previous outbreaks this was in fact used by rti and university of pennsylvania to model the spreading of epidemics they used matlab codes and the parallel computing toolbox to make models again this significantly reduced processing time there are various datasets available open source for researchers to study the covid-19 pandemic for this project we have chosen to work with some datasets which we feel are authentic and exhaustive the john hopskins csse  fixes data set the official figures given by the government of india and the open source database given in wwwcovid19org are some of the datasets used for collecting data on india for compiling this project often the datasets files are quite large and cannot be preprocessed manually so we have made use of technologies like matlab matrix laboratory to achieve this one important dataset which we have pre-processed is the daily increase of the total confirmed cases in all indian states since the first patient was detected the plot obtain is depicted in figure 4  11  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

outbreak in india using the following models  susceptible s it includes all those individuals who are not infected but are susceptible to contract the disease  exposed e it includes all those individuals who are exposed to infection but are not yet infectious with time some of them might fall ill some of them may not this compartment was included keeping in mind that the incubation period of the covid-19 pandemic was approximated to be a significant 5-6 days by who  symptomatic infected i s  it includes all the individuals who were symptomatic and infectious they have approached some health-care facility but have not yet been quarantined this compartment was brought into the picture considering concerning news from worst-affected counties like italy and the us of the hospitals and health-care centers getting filled up very fast during this pandemic a significant portion of the infected individuals may not be quarantined in case of the health-care system collapses  asymptomatic infected i as  it includes all those individuals who are affected but are asymptomatic before they either recover or die or get permanently disabled this compartment was formalised keeping after reports of various authentic studies claiming that around 30-40 percent of the infected individuals remain asymptomatic  quarantined q it includes all those individuals who are currently kept under quarantine in a health-care facility  icu q   it includes the quarantined patients who had to be moved to intensive care unit after their condition worsened  carrier c this compartment includes those individuals who have left quarantine after being tested negative but actually have not fully healed so they possess the ability to infect other susceptible individuals they eventually either fall sick again or recover from the disease this compartment was introduced after multiple cases of re-infection being reported from countries like south korea china and japan while we fully do not understand the reason for these reports yet it is safe to assume that one of the following happened 1 due to medical inefficiency inaccurate result 2 due to loss of immunity after recovery and subsequent re-infection to account for the first possibility we have introduced the carrier compartment to account for the second 12  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the

section we study how imposing lock downs will affect the plot in figure 5  denotes the number of interactions per-capita so a decrease in alpha would mean a lower rate of contact between infected and susceptible individuals as would be the case in a lock down so to simulate lock downs we have decreased the value of the parameter  to 014 for the overall period of lock down the simulations of no

will only delay the peak of the epidemic it seems like a periodic lock down is actually allowing the pandemic to infect individuals in installments fig 8  which is a simulation of when lock downs are imposed for both days 150-200 and days 500-550 may make this idea more clear the total cases remain the same  at least one individual remains infectious after the lock down is relaxed  no violations of lock down occur during the entire period of lock down  no migration from other citiessystems occurs to the system under consideration understanding how lock downs affect the epidemic the government can make use of this vulnerability in the spread of the pandemic by imposing lock downs at specific times to slow the spread of the disease subsequently effective policies should be enacted to get the situation under control and set up medical facilities to prepare for the surge in infections that is to follow the lifting of lock down the effect of setting up medical facilities is studied in a later subsection now these lock downs can be executed in various fashions one model is that of continuous lock down like the ones depicted above but as proved above they just delay the onset of the disease to completely eradicate the disease the economy nation would have to lock down theoretically for an impractically long time see later this is not possible due to the fragile nature of the

one strategy is the 75 strategy wherein lock down is imposed after a threshold time for 7 days at length once this duration is over it is reopened for 5 days before going to the next lock down for 7 days again and this process is repeated the simulation for the 75 strategy on our compartmental model after the first 150 days is depicted in fig9  fig 9  it seems that periodic lock down will in the long run eradicate the disease this is true only if the lock down is continued to eternity which again is impractical in real world scenarios the economy would have to be re-opened after some time fig 10 shows what happens when you relax the periodic lock down measures after 250 days as evident from the fig10  once the periodic lock down is relaxed the second wave of the epidemic returns thereby

the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020  another strategy that can be employed is to lock the economy down when the number of reported cases cross a certain threshold since in our model the only cases that the government can document is of those displaying symptoms or those currently admitted in a medical facility we have simulated scenarios in which light-switch lock down has been employed when the the net values of i s  q  q  cross a pre-determined threshold valuethe simulations for the active cases at different threshold levels are depicted in fig 11  from the plots given in fig 11  it is evident that light-switch lock down tends to stretch out the period of the epidemic lower the threshold longer the duration the number of cases in this model too is constant but unlike the periodic or continuous lock down models this gives an advantage to the system the longer duration of the epidemic implies that regions medical system receives sufficient time to recover from the extra load it had to face during the onset of the epidemic thereafter since the number of cases never increases beyond a certain value by controlling the threshold we can ensure that most patients get adequate health care  the entire system under consideration is locked down simultaneously at the point of enforcement and the lock down is relaxed at every region of the system simultaneously when done so  at least one individual remains infectious after the lock down is relaxed  no violations of lock down occur during the entire period the lock down is imposed  no migration from other citiessystems occurs to the system under consideration the manner in which the lock downs should be imposed by the government should be based on basic game theory rules locking down the economy would yield a decrease in the spread but keeping the economy shut for too long can lead to economic depressions and increased filings for bankruptcies and unemployment which has to be seriously considered before deciding the extent of the lock down so the fashion in which the lock down policies 18  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the

economy is optimized while not allowing the epidemic to go out of control as depicted in several of our previous simulations locking down can lead to a delay in the peak of the epidemic which can prove favourable for the government to set up crucial facilities needed for fighting the epidemic however a point we did not elaborate on is what if lock down is not followed religiously in a real sense it is very much probable for a section of individuals to violate lock down due to personal reasons to take this into account instead of defining  to a definite value at the time of lock down 014 in our previous simulations we may define it as a periodic function oscillating between a definitive maximum and minimum values with the period referring to the time scale with which lock down is violated periodically for the purposes of our simulation we have used  where v  2n n  z  governs the spread of the violation cycle higher the value more condensed the spread and  v gives the time scale of period of the cycle the coefficients 014 and 028 indicate that the oscillation of t is within 014 and 042 our original post-lock down and pre-lock down values as will be apparent soon it is the spread that is a major deciding factor in how the dynamics of the epidemic and even a minimal violation of lock down will cause the delay time caused by lock down to be reduced significantly fig

for a longer time the no violation case in fact corresponds to the limiting case when v tends to infinity  the entire system under consideration is locked down simultaneously at the point of

the guarantee of the lock down being lifted in the near future may decrease violations thus condensing the spread so that the delay time is not diminished significantly in our model the parameter  determines the rate with which symptomatic infected individuals who have approached a medical health-care facility requesting treatment are being quarantined as mentioned in section 31 this was introduced to account for the possibility of a collapse in medical infrastructure in case of an uncontrollable 21  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

is no discrepancy of accessing health-care facilities at two different locations in the system under consideration  no lock down is imposed  no migration from other citiessystems occurs to the system under consideration as observed in the above plots the spread of the infection is dramatically reduced as  m decreases so the government should take systematic and stringent measures to set up health-care and quarantine facilities around the country since this would decrease the number of cases of infection significantly in all of the simulations done by far it is only symptomatic individuals who are quarantined and thereby given the appropriate treatment in a medical facility asymptomatic individuals are never identified thus it seems that the bulk of the infections are spread by the i as compartment this issue can only be solved if strategic testing and quarantining is done on mass populations so as to identify such silent carriers and quarantine them to incorporate this feature in our model the equations for the two concerned compartments i as and q have to be slightly modified the modified equations are as follows is the identification rate of asymptomatic individuals now before applying this testing strategy it is important for the ruling body government to first set up sufficient medicalquarantining facilities and ensure that the symptomatic individuals who have approached the hospital are all accommodated in some health-care facility else enacting policies to test asymptomatic individuals before ensuring the treatment of the cases at hand does not make sense hence this idea has to be used along with the model described in the section 55 from now we set t  1  05e t m with  m  100 and where  q determines the time-scale with which the efficiency of detection of asymptomatic cases increases and h t is the heaviside step function this has been included to take care of the delay of implementation of this testing and quarantining

be easy since the number of reported cases itself may overwhelm the medical infrastructure so it is advised that as soon as the threat of the pandemic is detected immediate steps should be taken to set up more hospitals and quarantine facilities thereafter mass testing and quarantining of detected positive cases should be done substantially  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

we will look at the effect of immigration on the economy and try to visualize how the infection spreads to different regions over time for now we will only consider the migration due to compartments s

equations are as follows where 1  i j  n corresponds to the variables for the n locations being considered here i corresponds to the target location to where immigration happens and j corresponds to the source location from where emigration occurs for simplicity we assume that the rate-coefficients do not depend the geographical region index the migration coefficient should have the following properties 1 in the earlier days of the epidemic when reports of infections begin to float on media it is natural for people to panic thereby resulting in an initial surge in the number of migrations

can be displayed as f t   i j where f t corresponds to the functional form taking care of property 1 a good choice for f t is  l e t 2 where  1 determines the peak value of the migration rate and  2 and l determines the time scale with which the migration numbers reaches its maxima ad subsequently dies out l also determines the rate of the surge in migration now at any instant the total number of

hit location also it seems that the first location to become free of the pandemic is the one where patient zero was located city 1 note that in these simulations we have considered the population of each of the compartments to be equal more interesting behaviours will be observed if adding more details to this migration model  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is

simulations with the actual data of active cases of india obtained from authentic sources such as john hopskins csse  fixes data set and wwwcovid19org as observed in all of our previous plots just

timeline of india this anomaly may have occurred because of a number of reasons three major discrepancies we identified are as follows 1 in our model we have used the i s compartment to accommodate all those individuals who developed symptoms and subsequently visited a medical facility to acquire treatment but in doing so we have assumed that all the individuals who develop symptoms in the economy will seek treatment without haste but in real world this may not necessarily be true it is highly likely that some individuals opt to remain silent on the issue to avoid social distancing quarantine and other measures that may be against his personal interests 2 in our model we have defined the parameter  as the rate with which symptomatic individuals are quarantined in addition to assuming the simultaneity in contracting the infection and reporting it to the hospital for the individual in i s compartment we also assumed that the test results are hundred percent accurate however this is not necessarily true researchers from the uks university of bristol claim that as high as 30 percent of false negatives are generated in the current test of covid-19 so it is a real possibility that some symptomatic individuals are not able to avail quarantine because they were wrongly tested negative and hence are unwillingly infecting other susceptible individuals they come in contact with 3 in our previous simulations we assumed that the act of imposing a lock down would immediately be followed by a decrease in the value of the parameter  but this is not necessarily true on speculations of a lock down some days prior to it there will be a rush among the public to get back to their residences before the lock down begins this increases the interaction rate between people the hike will continue for a few days after the lock down is imposed and thereafter  will decrease and attain a minimal value cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a

symptomatic individuals are going to wilfully go to the hospitals when then condition worsens this is why the i  s compartment is not same as the i as compartment where the individuals would never go to quarantine q unless explicitly tested by the testing and quarantining strategy discussed in section 56 our modified compartmental model looks like the following all the equations stated in equations 501 -510 is unchanged except that for di s dt  also a new equation for di  s dt has to be introduced the modified differential equations for these compartments are as follows where s is a ratio which measures how much proportion of the individuals developing symptoms do not immediately visit the hospital ht is a time-dependent function which determines the time-delay the individuals in i  s compartment exhibits before visiting a health-care facility and thereby get quarantined intuitively d 2 ht dt 2 will be positive for some t   w  thereafter it will be negative the following choice for the functional form of ht can been made  w determines the initial value of ht it also gives a measure of the time delayed by individuals in i  s on an average before visiting the hospital d gives a measure of the distribution of ht this parameter is defined to take into account the asynchronism of time delay between different individuals in i  s  as mentioned in point 2 in the list of discrepancies the parameter  needs to be taken care of to accommodate for false negatives to solve this issue we have changed the definition of some of our parameters and compartments a bit initially in section 55 we had attributed  to the simply the rate with which more medical facilities are build across the nation but  should also account for the medical efficiency accuracy of the tests now taking into account the early stringent lock down measures that the government of india has taken the accuracy factor seems to be a far more dominant factor of the two so we redefine t as the rate which which the accuracy in covid-19 test is increased thereby giving lesser false negatives with time subsequently we redefine  m used in section 55 to the measure of the time-scale with which this is achieved  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this

good estimate of the initial testing accuracy 05 and the testing accuracy which we wish to achieve after a long time 10 since we have changed the definition of t now there would be some symptomatic individuals who approached the medical facility and were tested negative but they are still able to infect others now numerous possibilities arise for such individuals  1 they fall sick at a later time approach the hospital are tested positive and are thereby quarantined 2 they fall sick later approach the hospital but are again negative negative wrongly and are again left this process can be repeated many times unless the individual is either quarantined or the loop is terminated the individual never visits a hospital after certain iterations 3 they never approach a hospital again our initial model cannot explain such transitions so we have decided to change the definition of our i as and i s compartments we define the compartment i  as all those individuals who are infected but gets quarantined unless explicitly made to if caught by the testing and quarantining strategy before either recovering or dying or recovering with permanent disability the individuals in this compartment may be symptomatic but tested negative or asymptomatic we define another compartment i as all those individuals who would are infected and would necessarily eventually get quarantined wilfully not by being found positive in the testing and quarantining strategy now i as in our previous model will be replaced with i  and i s will be replaced with i note that the difference between i  and i  s the new compartment that was added to take care of individuals who are delaying to report their symptoms to the hospital is that individuals in i would report their symptoms immediately while those in i  s would not both these compartments contain individuals who will necessarily be quarantined eventually by their own will our modified compartmental model looks like the following another change which we mentioned was necessary was the nature of the variation in the parameter  just before and immediately after lock down is imposed it will substantially increase some days prior to lock down and will begin to decrease some days after lock down keeping this nature in mind the following functional form has been set for  where  l is the time after which lock down is imposed t r is the measure of the time before lock down when the individuals in the system begin to rush back to their residence  r is the time scale with which t dies down after 31  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

function since april 2 2020 the government started strategic testing and quarantining of asymptomatic individuals hence to get an effective simulation we would have to use the results obtained in

-there can be multiple reasons for this even though lock down has been imposed it is not strictly followed there are several places where proper care is not being taken violation of lock down means that temporary curbing of the pandemic does not occur so the number of cases will continue to rise also testing and quarantining of the infected remains very poor in india a -the most effective

simpler models do not include in the model we also distinguish between asymptomaticsymptomatic infections these newly derived models have been solved and results displayed further developments will involve using machine learning and other tools to find a scientific way of pinning down adjustable constants in the models a more thorough study of the effects of inter-state migration on the epidemic

form of pneumonia was diagnosed in china a disease that would later be referred to as covid-19 by the world health organization who one month later in january 2020 the causative agent of the covid-19 disease the sars-cov-2 virus was deciphered and identified and its genome was published rapidly 1 by mid-april 2020 the extent of impact of covid-19 on the global population was becoming evident the most adversely affected region per capita was western europe the most seriously affected population being the elderly especially those with extensive co-morbidities and weakened immune systems the causes for regional differences in covid-19 will require months of analysis if not years to ascertain more focused approaches to reduce the impacts of covid-19 in the near-term especially on the most vulnerable populations need to be pursued in parallel with longer-term approaches to lessen the impact of covid-19 or other coronavirus-driven diseases across all demographics as of mid-april the very short-term measures that have been implemented to reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 are the same as those that were taken to reduce the transmission of sars-cov during the 2002-2003 sars pandemic good hygiene and quarantine with the latter being far more severe and extensive than the quarantine implemented in 2002-2003 other short-term measures that have been implemented on a very sporadic basis are what can be termed tactical treatments these tactical treatments do not strengthen the immune system but rather have the goal of containing the adverse impacts of the viral attack some examples of tactical treatments that have been tested are eidd-2801 remdesivir favipiravir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine combination of lopinavir and ritonavir tocilizumab losartan to name a few tests so far have yielded very mixed results a second avenue being pursued to amelioratereduce the effects of covid-19 is development of vaccines to induce viral immunity the bulk of the present review addresses the status and prospects of this vaccine approach the third leg of this triad of approaches to ameliorate the ravaging effects especially for the most vulnerable of covid-19 is what can be called the strategic treatment approach 2 this approach has the goal of strengthening the immune system to allow its adaptive component to neutralize the incoming coronavirus without the need for external support strategic treatments eliminate tangible factors that contribute to weaken the immune system some examples of such factors based on existing studies include titanium dioxide air pollution chlorpyrifos aluminum sulfate prenatal alcohol exposure zno oil fly ash and many others 3-9 also the real life exposure scenario in which we are exposed continuously to combination of stressors influences in the long term the immune system and the response of the organism to the viral stressors 10-14 tsatsakis et al 15 have shown how pollutants can influence the immune system particularly by modulating ahr pathway and how these effects can be prevented by more strict regulations while some positive impact may result in the short-term from strategic treatments their main impact will probably be for the long-term except for those whose immune systems have suffered irreversible damage or those who have an overwhelming genetic predisposition to immune dysfunction because strategic treatments appropriate to any specific individual are difficult to identify and difficult to eliminate because of ingrained habits some emphasis needs to be placed on those types of treatments that do not require severe lifestyle alterations this work aims to analyze the strategies and challenges regarding the development of effective vaccines against sars-cov-2 the discovery of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus is an important component of the three-pronged approach described initially given that the pandemic cannot seem to be entirely stopped by social distancing and good hygiene practices the tactical therapies identified so far have not been entirely effective especially for the most vulnerable individuals being unable to prevent severe disability and ultimately death while healthcare systems are still struggling not to crumble under pressure from coronavirus patients research laboratories around the world are competing to produce an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 as soon as possible in order to be able to stop the spread of the new coronavirus global immune deficiency is a risk factor for anti-covid-19 vaccine efficacy particularly in elderly who have been exposed to a myriad of factors that contribute to weakening of the immune system as described previously these factors also result in diseases such as obesityobesity-related eg type ii diabetes metabolic syndrome and immune-mediated cancers mechanistic reasons for these diseases include weakness of antigen recognition decreased immune cell quantity and functionality increased levellength and timing of humoral immune alterations of components reduced initiation of cellular responses and memory cell disorders other associations with immunodeficiency include age-dependent humoral and immune cell alterations immunosenescence malnutrition 19 protein-energy-micronutrient deficit and telomere shortening 20 in addition past or current treatments affect the scalable ineffectiveness of vaccines in both older adults 21 and children 22 especially in immunocompromised 23 exposure to immunosuppressive drugs 24 or residence in developing countries 25 with a low socioeconomic status is associated with a higher viral mortality compared to residence in developed countries 26 current global obesity prevalence in adult and children is also a risk factor for anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine inefficacy due to higher levels of il-6 27 and decreased igg concentrations parasitic infections respiratory tract infections such as complicated pneumonia 28 can also affect subsequent immune response to anti-sars-cov-2 vaccination 29 adjuvant purity and safety knowledge gaps of the relative contribution of the innate and adaptive responses to protection against individual pathogens and the precise mode of action of individual adjuvants 30 are existing negative factors in vaccine efficacy anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be available by vaccine market players according to current orphan drug 31 and vaccine legislation 3233 due to the fight against sars-cov-2 pandemic this means that design defect failure to warn and negligence in testing may also affect vaccine efficacy under those conditions long-term safety testing of vaccines in humans will be non-existent there is no data on whether anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be first licensed in developed countries 34 or if all vaccine production facilities will be adequate to assure a reliable supply of new anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines 35 in a timely manner and are compatible with specifications and improved adult vaccine design strategy by who or immunobiography 36 and heterogeneity of immune responses in the elderly subpopulations 36 the safety of the vaccine is initially assessed in laboratory studies with mice or rabbits if the animals do not show signs of disease after receiving the vaccine then the tests begin in humans and the number of subjects gradually increases 37 duration of the clinical trial on average for a classical vaccine after preclinical stage - in vitro and in vivo tests is as follows 3839 in phase i also called the first human test the vaccine is given to a small group of healthy volunteers 10 to 100 the purpose is not to test whether the vaccine protects against the disease but whether it is safe or whether it causes severe side effects in phase ii the candidate vaccine is administered to a larger group of subjects 100-1000 and in phase iii to an even larger group 1000-100000 separate studies may be required in adults children and the elderly it sometimes happens that vaccines that seem safe when given to a small number of people show side effects when given to a larger number of people this is explained by the fact that any rare complication is less likely to occur when the group of subjects is small continuous monitoring is important in case of complications that occur with delayed effect 40 during a pandemic these sequential studies may be shortened and partially overlapped but it is important that thousands of vaccinated people are followed for several months before the general purpose vaccine is approved if there are more severe signs of inflammation or if the vaccine causes the immune system to malfunction in other ways the candidate vaccine may not be suitable for widespread use when such adverse effects are identified delays in the production process inevitably occur 41 at present only two potential vaccines against the sars-cov-2 virus are in the first phase and this by a derogation from the rule - skipped animal studies fig 1 the first vaccine that does not follow all research steps is called mrna-1273 and will be tested in the first phase in seattle there is an explanation for the speed of approval which is related to the fact that the coronavirus is not used in the vaccine development it is an experimental vaccine made by a new method based on rna basically the rna molecule in the vaccine teaches the cells to produce the disease-specific antigen and trains the body for the real enemy but there is also a small problem to date no vaccine based mrna technology has been approved for any disease although a few have reached the second phase of testing 42 the second vaccine is ad5-ncov the vaccine is created by genetic engineering and tries to teach the body to recognize the coronavirus protein s which is delivered via a type-5 adenovirus adenoviruses are a family of about one hundred double-stranded dna viruses that cause various diseases in humans and animals and type-5 is often used for genetic recombination although clinical trials have begun for these two candidates and are likely to begin soon for other potential vaccines it is unlikely to move to phase ii earlier than a few months vaccines stimulate immunity to the virus but can also stimulate inflammation in the body this can manifest itself either as pain or inflammation at the site where the subject was injected or as general symptoms such as fever or fatigue symptoms similar to covid-19 disease for most vaccines these reactions are mild and affect only a small proportion of subjects when a vaccine causes the production of antibodies in mice or in humans this does not necessarily mean that the vaccine will protect against the disease ideally before moving on to human studies researchers should be able to demonstrate that the vaccine will protect laboratory animals from the disease when they are experimentally infected with the virus in the case of diseases caused by previous coronaviruses sars and mers it was difficult to find an animal species that would be affected by the disease in the same way as humans are affected however previous research may help scientists speed up the animal testing process for covid-19 the protective effect of a human vaccine is assessed using a series of studies similar to the series of safety studies if the vaccine elicits an immune system response for example if antibodies can be detected in the phase i study then larger phase ii and phase iii studies can be performed to see if the vaccine protects against infection or disease although covid-19 is a new disease research on sars and mers has helped us understand how the human body responds to coronaviruses and how the response of the immune system generates protection against disease 43 restricted human studies can also be used to calculate the correct dose and schedule for the vaccine some vaccines generate a strong immune response after a single dose but others require a booster dose after a month or longer this strategy also increases the duration of studies to assess whether a vaccine prevents covid-19 among those exposed to the infection it should be tested in phase iii studies in a setting where the infection is actively occurring in response to the west african ebola outbreak in 201415 the rvsv ebola vaccine went through all three phases of clinical development in just 12 months through the centralized coordination of who mdecins sans frontires and manufacturer during this period there were still cases of ebola in guinea and the protection of the vaccine was demonstrated by vaccinating the contacts of the residual cases as they appeared in the community 44 in the case of pandemic vaccines tens or hundreds of millions of doses are needed this production process takes at least six months if the production lines already exist any new vaccine involves a new production process which involves several quality control steps the manufacturer must ensure that each vaccine produced is of consistent quality and requires repeated testing moreover because vaccine manufacturing is a biological process inevitably some batches of vaccines will fail for reasons that are not always clear which can further delay production there are quite a few manufacturers in the world that can produce vaccines on a large enough scale to meet the needs of a pandemic before initiating each stage of the human testing process the developer must provide evidence that the vaccine has early indications of protection and is safe among those who have been tested research ethics committees review clinical trial plans and authorities such as the european medicines agency ema and food and drug administration fda oversee the entire vaccine development process before approving it for general use these assessments usually take several weeks or months 45 although such approvals could be shortened in the event of a pandemic many potential covid-19 vaccines use new technologies so regulators will not be able to rely on the experience of similar vaccines to speed up the process developers of the covid-19 vaccine were given a target to produce a vaccine in 12-18 months while historically vaccines took 15-20 years to develop there are diseases against which vaccines do not yet exist despite decades of work for example more than 100000 children die each year from respiratory diseases caused by another rna virus rsv respiratory syncytial virus which causes pneumonia despite 50 years of research and 18 products developed there is currently no rsv vaccine available 46 numerous scientific research groups are working on the development of a covid-19 vaccine using a number of different approaches having many groups in the race is important as most vaccines entering clinical trials will fail for safety or efficacy reasons sars-cov-2 is part of the coronavirus family as is sars-cov-1 which generated the 2003 sars epidemic and mers-cov which generated the mers epidemic in 2013 47 the new sars-cov-2 coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes a respiratory infection called covid-19 coronavirus infectious disease - 2019 with an average incubation period of 5 days between 2 and 14 days 48 the disease is characterized by predominant respiratory symptoms cough difficulty breathing fever of moderate intensity in about 80 of cases but may have severe manifestations bilateral interstitial pneumonia with progression to respiratory failure acute respiratory distress ards the main cause of mortality there are also cases with gastrointestinal manifestations especially diarrhea and in some patients especially in the young ones hypoanosmia loss of sense of smell and hypodysgeusia alteration of the sense of taste have been reported as early symptoms 49 shortly after the publication of the genetic structure of sars-cov-2 the first two vaccines were developed sars-cov-2 virus structure is composed of an rna molecule surrounded by a series of structural and functional proteins 50 known structural proteins are protein s or spike - which leads to the characteristic appearance protein m membrane protein e envelopes protein n nucleocapsid of these protein s has the role of attaching to receptors in human cells and facilitating the fusion of viral content with the cell in the case of sars-cov-2 the receptor is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is found in large quantities in the respiratory tract and lung parenchyma 51-54 the initial infection of sars-cov-2 occurs in the ciliary epithelial cells of the bronchi 5556 the binding of protein s to ace2 is greatly favored by the existence of the polybase cleavage site - a protein fragment cleaved by the furin enzyme commonly found in the human body allowing protein s fragments s1 s2 and s3 to perform their function in addition to fusing the viral envelope with the cell membrane the virus also infects the human cell through endocytosis the cell membrane around the portion that binds to the virus forms a vesicle inside the cell detaches from the membrane and introduces the virus into the cell via that vesicle through the process of entering the cell the virus loses its envelope which fuses with the cell membrane and the viral rna is free in the cytoplasm carrying out two processes replication and transcription first the cellular components responsible for rna transcription produce viral proteins and the rna is copied subsequently these proteins and copies of the initial rna are packed into new virions released from the cell to spread the infection 57 humoral immunity consists of the production of specific antibodies against these antigens these are i antibodies that appear rapidly during infection and disappear rapidly igm and ii antibodies that appear slower and persist in the body for a long time even after the infection is cured igg 58 cellular immunity requires training certain immune cells to recognize and destroy the virus it has been observed in sars-cov-2 infection that the number of cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes is low in the peripheral blood because they are destroyed in the process of elimination of the virus but has high concentrations of activation markers 59 regarding the sars-cov virus memory cells capable of recognizing it have been identified in the blood of healed patients several years after the infection the persistence of memory cells is an important element to consider in the development of the anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine 60 cases have been described where the sars-cov-2 infection recurs after being considered cured 61 on the other hand there is evidence that coronaviruses are equipped with mechanisms by which they can sometimes evade immune attack first after infection of the cell the vesicles in which the virus is located are lacking in the receptors that could recognize the virus as an invader of the body second interferon synthesis with antiviral function is inhibited by coronaviruses and the presentation of viral antigens by pca is low in infected patients 62 current pandemic of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 is a global epidemiological problem the solution of which will require establishment of large-scale production of the vaccine given the experience of previous coronavirus outbreaks showing a high variability of the virus it is required to develop a vaccine production platform providing the scalability technological flexibility and versatility these vaccines must provide high efficacy safety and tolerability this is due to the time required to prove that the proposed vaccine is safe and effective as well as the time required to produce millions of doses many candidate vaccines which initially look promising are likely to fail during the testing process the process of developing a new vaccine begins with a so-called candidate vaccine which a team of scientists believes to have potential this is the fastest part of the process and takes up to a few weeks thus some candidate vaccines are being developed in russia against covid-19 the shemyakin and ovchinnikov institute of bioorganic chemistry is developing liposome-encapsulated dna-protein vaccine based on the covid-19 spike antigens and its dna coding sequence and vlp vaccine based on hsb antigen fused with covid-19 spike antigens the vaccine candidates against covid-19 based on live attenuated recombinant influenza vector platform are developed by fsbsi chumakov federal scientific center for research and development of immune- and biological products of russian academy of sciences and smorodintsev research institute of influenza who national influenza centre the fsbsi chumakov federal scientific center for research and development of immune- and biological products of russian academy of sciences is developing two vaccines based on an attenuated and an inactivated strain of the covid-19 virus isolated in centre chumakov personal communication of professor egorov for efficient application of sars-cov-2 vaccines not only the production procedure needs to be developed but also requires a large-scale production followed by vaccination program targeting muti-million population of different regions only such a complex approach will allow combatting of the coronavirus disease pandemic new technologies do not require the work with live virus making their production much easier but still needing further scientific and technological evidence fig 2 the mrna encoding ribonucleic acid vaccine encodes a stable prefused form the form before being fused to the cell membrane of the host cell of spike protein s 63 protein complex s is required for membrane fusion and host cell infection and has been the target of vaccines against mers and sars membrane fusion viral and cellular is an essential step when encapsulated viruses enter cells fusion of the double lipid layer requires catalysis to overcome a high kinetic barrier and viral fusion proteins are agents that perform this catalytic function 64 although coronavirus uses many different proteins to replicate and invade cells protein s is the main surface protein that it uses to bind to a receptor - this becomes a bridge to the human cell after protein s binds to the human cell receptor the viral membrane fuses with the human cell membrane allowing the viral genome to enter the human cells and initiate infection 49 the mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 is based on a relatively new genetic method that does not require growing the virus in the laboratory the technique transforms the human body into a living laboratory because the whole process is no longer carried out in the laboratory but directly in the body that received the vaccine 65 the technique is actually based on messenger ribonucleic acid mrna fragments the genetic material that is copied from dna and encodes proteins moderna company loads its vaccine with viral mrna which encodes the proteins of the new coronavirus and then injects it into the body immune cells from the lymph nodes process the mrna and synthesize specific viral protein antigens so that other immune cells recognize them 66 mrna is like a software molecule in the body which then produces viral proteins that can generate an immune response 67 how the body processes the viral protein is often very different from the way it processes the same protein of the vaccine thus one of the theoretical benefits of introducing mrna into a vaccine is that the body causes the viral protein to behave in exactly the same way that the virus would have directed the host to do 63 table i dna vaccines represent the latest direction of development in the manufacture of vaccines vaccines obtained by recombinant dna technology are produced by genetic modification the dna encoding the target molecule is introduced via a plasmid or viral vector in a suitable microorganism or cell line in which dna is expressed and translated into protein the product is subsequently recovered by extraction and purification the injected dna is a plasmid plus a promoter that provides immunogenic protein synthesis 69 an advantage of this type of vaccine is that it stimulates both humoral and cellular immunity also this type of vaccine is stable and does not require maintenance under controlled conditions refrigeration as is the case for conventional vaccines in contrast to live attenuated vaccines the risks arising from a potential inadequate attenuation of vaccine strains are not present in dna vaccines 70 other advantages of this new technology are the fact that the plasmids used are easy to manufacture in large quantities and the immunity conferred is long-term the disadvantages identified so far with regard to dna vaccines are due to the fact that this type of vaccine is limited to protein immunogens 71 a clinical trial for a new dna vaccine against coronavirus has begun this is called chadox1 ncov-19 and it was initially developed to prevent mers 72 this vaccine is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and on sars-cov-2 spike protein 73 it has been modified so that it cannot be reproduced in the human body and the genetic code that transmits instructions for the production of coronavirus spike protein has been added allowing the adenovirus to produce this protein after vaccination the result is the formation of antibodies against the spike protein known to be on the surface of sars-cov-2 74 the ino-4800 vaccine is another new dna vaccine to prevent sars-cov-2 infection it is entering human phase i testing 75 the phase i study will enroll up to 40 healthy adult volunteers each participant will receive two doses of ino-4800 every four weeks and initial immune responses and safety data from the study are expected by the end of the summer preclinical data have shown promising results in immune response in several animal models also the preclinical results for the inovio sars-cov-2 vaccine were consistent with the results of the phase i study for the middle east respiratory syndrome mers vaccine caused by another type of coronavirus here the inovio dna vaccine was well tolerated and induced high levels of antibody response in 95 of subjects generating t cell-mediated responses in nearly 90 of study participants long-term antibody response was maintained for up to 60 weeks in the case of the anti-mers vaccine 75 table ii subunit vaccines contain only certain antigenic determinants of pathogenic microorganisms and are obtained either starting from conventional cultivation processes or by recombinant dna technology 76 antigen determinants included in the vaccine increase the efficiency of the immune response and the presence of a small number of pathogens reduces the risk of side effects subunit vaccines mainly contain surface fragments of pathogens because these types of structures are weak immunogens to obtain vaccines with suitable efficacy the antigens are conjugated with protein molecules 77 antigen purifiers sometimes lead to loss of immunogenicity requiring coupling with a protein carrier or with an aluminum salt however adjuvants are associated with the onset of local reactions to the vaccination site also the duration the immunity conferred by vaccination is lower except for live vaccines 78 table iii along with traditional virus vaccines viral vectors are widely used in which genome of one virus is used to deliver the antigen of another virus thus allowing development of a platform technology of virus production these technologies are available for large-scale production of vaccines drawbacks of such vaccines include a large variation of purification methods need for a reliable confirmation of purity and activity of the virus 79 tables iv and v vaccine development based on the recombinant proteins and virus-like particles vlps is a more innovative approach antiviral vaccines are usually developed on the basis of surface proteins that form vlps production of vlps in the cells with further reconstruction into the stable and immunogenic forms is a multi-stage process substantial issues appear for the vlp production for non-enveloped viruses nucleic acid based vaccines are very interesting from the platform technology viewpoint allowing the same process to be used for the production of different antigens they elicit both humoral and cell immune responses 80 production of these vaccines may be based on e coli cell fermentation and corresponding technologies of extraction and purification of plasmids ensuring their structural integrity 81 table vi another category of vaccines is vaccines containing whole microorganisms but inactivated by chemical or physical methods this type of vaccine has the advantage of higher stability however effectiveness is lower and requires reminders of immune system vaccines with inactivated live virus require stabilization of the structure in the dry form separate supply of the solvent and cold-chain transportation these factors complicate the production process and lead to increase of their cost 82 table vii live attenuated vaccines were the first vaccines utilized these types of vaccines are obtained through cultivation of microorganisms under suboptimal conditions or through successive passage in cultures techniques that determine attenuation of virulence while maintaining the capacity to induce the immune response 83 although characterized as very effective live attenuated vaccines have the disadvantages of risks related to the possible occurrence of mutations leading to the virulence reversal as well as contra-indication in the case of immunocompromised persons table viii the lv-smenp-dc vaccine lentiviral minigene vaccine shenzhen geno-immune medical institute entered phase i clinical trial in march 2020 it is a vaccine based on dendritic cells modified with a lentiviral vector expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domains and is administered with antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes 84 pathogen-specific aapc vaccine shenzhen geno-immune medical institute phase 1 clinical trial 85 is based on lentiviral vector modified artificial antigen presenting cells aapcs expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domains the development and manufacture of a covid-19 vaccine is an urgent issue but it is likely to take many months to resolve although many companies have announced that the covid-19 vaccine will be ready soon this will be quite difficult to do in reality 72 the main reason is that before being put on the market the vaccine should be safe both in the short-term and in the long-term this is very important because in the history of vaccine production there have been situations of contamination with other viruses fortunately without major consequences 16 for example one third of the polio vaccines administered in the us between 1955 and 1963 also contained simian virus 40 sv40 and more recently rotavirus vaccines have been discovered to also have swine circoviruses 86-88 in order to avoid such situations everything to be tested on humans should first be checked for purity and then sterile production lines provided this takes time in rare cases certain antibodies generated by immunization may promote an aggravated form of the disease a situation called ade antibody dependent enhancement 89 when these antibodies re-establish contact with the virus they will actually help it enter the cells and cause infection ade has been described in many viral infections influenza dengue zika etc but also in coronaviruses the mechanism of ade has not been confirmed for coronavirus in humans 90 several animal studies have shown that some types of anti-sars and anti-mers vaccines although effective in generating antibodies can lead to more severe forms of disease when the virus is subsequently inoculated 91 the second reason is that the vaccine must not only be safe but also effective it must be able to determine the synthesis of antibodies of a certain type at a certain concentration titer and to provide protection for a reasonable time however vaccines never generate immunity to all vaccinated people 92 the causes are complex and vary from genetic and immunological factors to the quality of the vaccines themselves and how they are administered age is an important aspect and some influenza studies have shown that aging of the immune system dramatically decreases the effectiveness of vaccination 93 therefore for any future anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine all these aspects should be evaluated and the primary immunization failures minimized by adjusting the doses or number of administrations assuming that the vaccine will generate an effective immune response to a sufficient number of individuals among those vaccinated the time frame of vaccine protection is questionable 94 for example after measles vaccination a small percentage of those who initially respond well lose their protective antibody status within a few years a phenomenon called secondary immunization failure 95 this is why it takes time to check the post-vaccination persistence of anti-covid antibodies last but not least both safety and efficacy are significantly dependent on the type of vaccine ie the technology or platform used some technologies are very new and therefore require more careful testing others are old but need to be adapted for covid-19 another aspect is not only the ability of a company to develop the technology but also its large-scale production capacity so that it is quickly accessible globally because there is no commercially available anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine precedent for the proposed platforms completely new production lines capable of generating billions of doses in a few months must be considered and this must be done without stopping the production of current vaccines already included in the official protocols and guidelines at present this capacity will be reached with difficulty and will represent an unprecedented effort dna and rna vaccines are based on the principle of insertion of these nucleic acids in some cells of the vaccinated ones forcing them to make immunogenic viral proteins 96 although some recent data seem encouraging these concepts have questionable efficiency in humans non-replicative vectors are actually common viruses eg adenovirus genetically modified to display sars-cov proteins on the outer surface 97 but they are so common that many of us have already met with them throughout our lives and as a result we already have immunity and neutralize them before they do their job the attenuated viruses would be variants of sars-cov-2 made less or not at all pathogenic by genetic engineering they are by far the most immunogenic but there is a risk that they will become pathogenic after mutations 98 inactivated viruses viral fragments and synthetic peptides are all relatively weakly immunogenic the analysis of these variables is normally done over 10 years in the form of a trial the stages of a trial are inflexible standardized intensely regulated for the purpose of maximum safety and efficacy of the final vaccine the first stage is the preclinical research in which the technology that will be included in the vaccine is selected and then the efficacy and safety profile of human cells in vitro and animal models in vivo is tested if the expected anti-infectious effect is seen in vitro and cells do not die excessively then in vivo animal studies are conducted mice are usually the perfect candidate for in vivo studies because they are about 85 genetically similar to humans relatively inexpensive and do not raise major ethical issues 99 however one of the notable differences between the human and the mouse is fixed in the case of the ace2 receptor gene to which sars viruses bind during infection mice simply do not make the respiratory syndromes they eliminate the virus relatively quickly from the body this is why it is necessary for either the genetically modified mouse to have a human ace2 receptor or to use ferrets and monkeys and this makes everything much more expensive and more difficult to access the preclinical stage lasts between 1 and 2 years and is by far the most selective it is estimated that less than 20 of the vaccines tested are able to progress to human tests some fail because the product does not work others because they can no longer find financing 1100 after obtaining the vaccine the first people vaccinated will be the highest risk categories for everyone else the term is sometime in 2022 possibly long after we have naturally acquired immunity there are still many unknowns related to coronavirus immunity and that is why obtaining a vaccine is difficult future mutations in sars-cov-2 could occur at any time which automatically means a high risk of any vaccine becoming useless no vaccine has been obtained for any other coronavirus so far and no one can guarantee its success yet it is possible that we will have the anti-covid vaccine in a very short time without having the benefits from long-term testing results the vaccine will probably not be available to all of us for 18 months scientists began working on coronavirus vaccines during sars and mers outbreaks but their efforts did not materialize because of a myriad of difficulties since this extremely severe current coronavirus pandemic covid-19 the spread of the outbreak appears much broader than was the case for sars there is also the possibility of the disease becoming endemic and seasonal in its appearance according to some investigators this explains why many research groups and companies are undertaking efforts to develop an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 all over the world also speeding up all the usual phases needed to develop and test a vaccine in the human an important feature in the landscape of vaccine research and development for sars-cov-2 is represented by the varied range of evaluated technological platforms including nucleic acids dna and rna virus-like particles peptides viral vector replicative and non-replicative recombinant proteins live attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses many of these platforms are not currently the basis of vaccines already authorized but experience in areas such as oncology encourages developers to exploit new opportunities for increased development and manufacturing speeds there is not an effective therapy for severe covid-19 and social distancing is extremely costly from a social and economic perspective therefore the development of an effective vaccine along with efforts to implement immune-enhancing strategic treatments and shorter-term efforts to identify tactical repurposed treatments should be considered major public health priorities we hope to get this key tool for disease prevention and to do this quite soon it is unknown whether there ever will be a successful sars-cov-2 vaccine but the efforts of the scientific community in attempting to develop such a vaccine is without precedent thus covid-19 vaccines are a never ending story
