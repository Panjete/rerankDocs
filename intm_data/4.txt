letter to editorwith the limited options available countries like india completely rely upon the world health organization who guidelines and supportive management in treating the sarscov2 infectioncovid-19 1 the premier research institute of india the indian council for medical research icmr has rolled out its protocol or the standard operating procedure sop for the collection and testing of the samples of suspected cases of sars-cov2 2 in a recent notification the icmr has confirmed the isolation of 11 isolates from the patients of sars-cov2 3 they have commented that it will take another one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine against the novel coronavirus which will require the mandatory field trialsin a recent scientific report the scientists from china the epicenter of covid-19 have tried their hands on the age-old antimalarial drug chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 4 recently the doctors from one of the best medical college hospitals in rajasthan india have treated a covid-19 patient a tourist from italy with 3 groups of drugs the anti-hiv drugs ritonavir and lopinavir the anti-influenza drug oseltamivir and the anti-malarial drug the chloroquine 5 according to the doctors the patient has been tested negative after the treatment with their protocol the patients husband who also tested positive for coronavirus is under non-invasive ventilatory support is also being treated with the same regimen and he is stable according to the treating physicians the delay in the recovery of this patient was suspected to be due to the already existing lung pathologythe government of india is taking all the efforts in keeping the situation under control by spreading awareness on covid-19 through mass communication to the public the government is also keen on finding out an effective treatment modality to treat the covid-19 patients hence the option of using the already available drugs like lopinavir ritonavir oseltamivir and chloroquine would be the best choice on 13th march 2020 the icmr has released a protocol for public health emergency which includes lopinavir and ritonavir 6 they have given a set of inclusion criteria to whom this regimen can be used the inclusion criteria include high-risk patients such as patients who are 60 years of age patients with hypertension diabetes mellitus renal failure chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons these high-risk patients have been included in the inclusion criteria as these are the patients who may succumb to the covid-19 due to their co-morbid conditions we also know the fact that this regimen cannot be generalized to treat all the patients of covid-19 without proper scientific evidence the antiviral properties of ritonavir lopinavir oseltamivir and chloroquine are already known with scientific evidences the antiviral properties are proved in vitro from many studies starting long back from 1969 to till recent times 7 8 9 10 11chloroquine the age-old anti-malarial drug possesses anti-viral properties many in-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown various mechanisms by which chloroquine exerts antiviral activity on various viruses like the zika virus avian leucosis virus the hiv-1 h5n1 virus by changing the endosomal ph inhibiting the viral gene expression changing the glycosylation pattern of hiv-1 hiv-1 gp120 envelope and inhibit the replication of the hiv virus in cd 4  t cells inhibiting the autophagy and reducing the alveolar epithelial damage in the lungs of avian influenza h5n1 mice inhibiting the zika virus-induced autophagy animal experiments have shown that the vertical transmission of zika virus from the mother to the fetus can be cut off by chloroquine in a study conducted by keyaerts et al in 2004 7 it was observed that chloroquine inhibits the replication of sars-cov in vero e6 cells in a recent study by xu et al in january 2020 12 it was observed that the sars-cov2 and the sars-cov shared an identical structural identity and similar van der waals and electrostatic propertiesvincent mj et al 200513 stresses that chloroquine can even be considered as prophylaxis for people traveling to the affected area due to the easy availability and cost-effectiveness of chloroquine and may be considered to treat and prevent coronavirus infection in addition to the anti-viral activity chloroquine also possesses an anti-inflammatory property which can be used to reduce the virus-induced inflammation 14 more than 10 clinical trials are registered and are underway in china and other parts of world to prove the efficacy of chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 15 a recent study in china that included more than 100 patients demonstrated that chloroquine was superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving the lung imaging findings promoting a virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course 16chloroquine has certain advantages to itself being an age-old drug first and foremost is that it is almost available everywhere in the world making it easy to acquire secondly it is very cost-effective thirdly the adverse drug reaction profile of the drug is well known so that the drug-drug interactions or drug-disease other co-morbid conditions interactions may be avoidedanother drug hydroxychloroquine a 4 aminoquinoline has also given promising results in the treatment of covid-19 the us-fda has issued an emergency use authorisation eua on march 28 2020 according to the eua chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are to be donated to the strategic national stockpile sns to be distributed to hospitals where they can be used to treat certain covid19 patients 17 in a non-randomized study conducted by gautret p et al a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has caused a significant reduction or disappearance of the viral load in covid 19 patients 18 another prospective study from china with 30 patients randomly allocated to hydroxychloroquine with 400 mg daily for 5 days in addition to other supportive care injection interferon beta and available antivirals vs standard care alone even though there was no statistical difference in virologic clearance a trend was seen in hydroxychloroquine with support with 867 vs 933 viral clearance 19 more than 50 clinical trials are registered and are underway in china and other parts of world to prove the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 and its complication 20 the icmr has rolled out a protocol for using hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis in the health care workers hcw and the close contacts of the suspected or covid 19 positive patients 21to conclude with the daily increase in the number of newly detected covid 19 cases and the number of deaths increasing at a faster pace waiting for the newer drug with questionable efficacy in different races seems to be unethical drugs with known efficacy and toxicity profile will be a good strategy in developing countries so a combination of antiviral antimalarial and anti-flu drugs will be a good strategy until the newer drugs are developed todays off label maybe tomorrows alternate drug of choice thes drugs the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not without their own adverse effects hence vigilance should be mandatory in using this drug for treatment purposes of confirmed cases of covid-19 misuse as a prophylactic drug will create massive failure of these drugs for their respective indication they have been introduced especially for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquinenotions of psychological frailty  weaknesses of reason or weaknesses of morality  have been evident in many of the comments on public responses to the covid19 crisis some of these have informed policy for example part of the reason for delay in introducing stricter distancing measures in the united kingdom was the authorities assumption that the public would soon fatigue and stop observing them1
httpsmindhackscom20200320dowesufferbehaviouralfatigueforpandemicpreventionmeasures
 as ever though such frailty is said to be magnified by the collective thus back in the early days of covid19 many commentators argued that collective panic would potentially be more disastrous than the pandemic itself through its effects on markets availability of goods2

 panic  meaning selfish thoughtless behaviour and overreaction  was said to be as contagious as the virus itself5
httpsblogsbmjcombmj20200221robertpeckhamcovid19outbreakneedstrategiesmanagepanicepidemics
 such collective psychology would therefore turn an emergency into a disasterbut is this really the case exactly the same claim about the role of public panic has historically been made in relation to many other kinds of emergencies including fires terrorist attacks sinking ships and crowd crushes was it really selfishness overreaction and general bad behaviour that caused so many deaths in these cases or was it something elsetake the sinking of the mv estonia in 1994 for example over 800 people died prima facie the greater survival rates of men over women and crew over passengers might suggest that the strongest individuals selfishly neglected others in order to save themselves but analysis of the survivorship records and eyewitness testimonies illustrates the danger of psychologizing physical constraints cornwell et al 2001 the extreme listing of the ship was very sudden there were attempts among passengers to help each other but most did not have the strength to get to the exits themselves let alone assist othersexamining the evidence in emergencies suggests three main reasons why there are avoidable fatalities 1 underreaction to threat 2 systemic factors and 3 mismanagement here we briefly describe these alternative explanations for deaths in disasters we then examine how far they help us understand what has happened in the case of covid19 in the uk context before discussing the real collective psychology of emergenciesrather than overreaction the first factor that turns an emergency into a disaster is underreaction people often underestimate risk and disregard possible signals of danger tierney lindell  perry 2001 during 911 people inside the world trade center who saw objects falling from the sky outside did not initially recognize these as pieces of the plane that had struck their building slowness to comprehend the threat means delay in attempts to escape some people even took time to close down their computers before they sought to leave the buildingthe second reason for deaths in emergencies is systemic disasters do not affect everyone in the same way those already disadvantaged suffer disproportionately6

 in the grenfell tower fire  the worst fire in the united kingdom since the second world war  neglect and costsaving by the authorities and manufacturers were behind the fatal decision to clad the block in flammable material poorer sections of society also have fewer resources to help them cope when disaster strikes and less power to demand adequate aftercarea third reason why emergencies often end so badly is mismanagement the cocoanut grove nightclub fire of 1942 in which 492 people died has been presented in psychology textbooks as an embodiment of the received wisdom that most deaths in nightclub fires are due to crowd panic chertkoff and kushigians 1999 detailed reanalysis of events suggests instead failure of management of two types first there was mismanagement of space the emergency exit door was locked the windows were also nailed shut to prevent people leaving without paying their tab second there were failures of communication there were no exit signs or training in emergency evacuation so when staff tried to help lead survivors out they could not find the fire exit in the official investigation the major causes of the loss of life were said to be the locked doors the unfamiliarity and inaccessibility of normal exits and the jamming of the revolving door there was no implication that crowd behaviour caused the deaths the management was subsequently prosecuted for manslaughter and neglect of building lawsa similar story of mismanagement of space can be found in the literature on fatal crowd crushes sometimes  usually erroneously  called stampedes panic explanations once dominated but a recent systematic review cites as the most common causes of fatalities not collective psychology but overcrowding closure of exits congestion at bottlenecks deficiencies in safety barriers and lack of coordination with local authorities de almeida  von schreeb 2019 notoriously the fatal crush at hillsborough in 1989 was initially explained by some in terms of the disorderly behaviour of fans but it was later demonstrated that disproportionate concern among authorities with preventing football hooliganism led to neglect of crowd safety  including the disastrous decision to let fans into an already overcrowded terrace7

 in short hillsborough like cocoanut grove did not happen because of failings at the level of collective psychologyin relation to failures of communication changes to information and communication practices have often improved safety and saved lives when the world trade center was subject to a terrorist attack in 1993 the evacuation was relatively slow aguirre wenger  vigo 1998 subsequently regular drills were introduced so that people became familiar with the locations of emergency exits this measure helped make the 911 evacuation so successful8

 in the case of mass casualty decontamination following a chemical incident failure of responders to communicate effectively has led to reduced public compliance with the procedure increasing risk of fatalities carter et al 2015 the solution has been to train responders with the skills to communicate to the public both why decontamination is needed and how to carry it out drury et al 2019unlike fires earthquakes floods and bombings which tend to be shortterm events which occur in one place the effects of the current pandemic are dispersed in time and space yet like these other emergencies there is a mortal threat which creates collective fear and when we examine some of the major problems in response and outcomes9

 in the covid19 crisis prima facie our threefold classification above fits better than explanations in terms of public selfishness thoughtlessness and overreactionfirst underreaction while some members of the public have not taken the pandemic seriously the uk data show that the vast majority adhered to the social distancing and stay at home regulations10
httpsnewsskycomstorycoronavirustripstotheshopsfallby85sinceoutbreakaccordingtogoogledata11968171
 yet there is evidence of highly consequential political underreaction in the united kingdom a criticism has been that that the government did not prepare or respond in time11
httpsarchiveis20200418182037httpswwwthetimescoukeditionnewscoronavirus38dayswhenbritainsleepwalkedintodisasterhq3b9tlgh
 importantly the official advice on social distancing was only given on 16 march 2020 and the instruction to stay at home only on the 23rd the result of this underreaction is a death rate proportionately higher than most other countries  with over 30000 hospital and community deaths recorded by 12 may 2020 scally jacobson  abbasi 2020some of this failure to prepare in time may be straightforward mismanagement but some of it may also be due to underestimating risk by those in authority the world health organization warned about the risk of humantohuman transmission of covid19 as early as 10 january 2020 and urged precautions the first department of health and social care press release on covid19 on 22 january stated that the risk to the uk population was low12
httpswwwgovukgovernmentnewsdhscandphestatementoncoronavirus
 two days later the lancet published the first article showing evidence that covid19 was transmittable to humans the authors recommended careful surveillance rigorous testing respirators and greater use of personal protective equipment13
httpswwwthelancetcomjournalslancetarticlepiis0140673620301835fulltext
 but on the same day the uk chief medical officer still maintained that the risk to the uk public was low the first documented transmission within the united kingdom as opposed to from travellers from abroad appeared on 28 february yet the uk risk level was not raised to high till 12 marchin relation to our second factor one example where systemic factors were evident but a discourse of public bad behaviour was mobilized was in the case of socalled panic buying14the use of the term panic in this case illustrates why it is seen as an unhelpful concept by disaster researchers chertkoff  kushigian 1999 the judgement about whether a behaviour is an overreaction is either subjective since criteria are unclear how much shopping does one really need or post hoc and therefore not explanatory the rapid emptying of supermarket shelves was an effect of the vulnerability of justintime supply chains to just a small uptick in consumer spending and purchasing evidence suggests that in fact only a small proportion of the population was stockpiling in response to the expectations of lockdown and shortages15
httpswwwwarccomnewsandopinionopinionwhystockpilingisnotthecrazyselfishbehaviourthatitseems3483
 nevertheless government ministers chided some of the public for their selfishness psychologizing the problem this representation of the public as selfish is highly consequential where others in the community are seen as competitors this can create the very individualism that is being condemned undermining the sense of collectivity needed in these times van bavel et al 2020systemic factors have been crucial in another sense poorer and less powerful sections of society had fewer choices about how to behave during the first phase of lockdown despite media campaigns to vilify some people as selfish and thoughtless covidiots the evidence on reasons for nonadherence shows that much of it was practical rather than psychological many people had to cram into tube trains to go to work because they needed money to survive and government support schemes were insufficient people were told they could go out to exercise but those in urban areas had limited public space and some employers failed to provide the support for social distancing and hygiene16

 those with less income and wealth also live in more crowded homes17
httpswwwcitylabcomequity202004coronavirusspreadmapcityurbandensitysuburbsruraldata609394

the outcomes of these systematic inequalities are predictable poorer people have repeatedly been shown to be more vulnerable to infection and more likely to die18
httpswwwhealthorguknewsandcommentnewsdeathsfromcovid19inthemostdeprivedareas
 these inequalities have persisted into the second phase of lockdown from may 2020 with lower income people being less able to work from home and more likely to be in jobs that bring them into contact with othersfinally there is evidence of a specific mismanagement in the form of failure of communication in the uk response one thing we observed to have changed and which might therefore indicate recognition of an earlier error was the way the public were addressed in the official messaging initial government communications stressed the risk to oneself as an individual for exampleas per the current advice the most important thing individuals can do to protect themselves remains washing their hands more often for at least 20 seconds with soap and water19
httpswwwgovukgovernmentnewscovid19governmentannouncesmovingoutofcontainphaseandintodelay
 emphasis added
the message some people therefore picked up from this was about the risk to themselves personally such individualfocused messaging can lead people to discount the risk especially if they consider themselves young and healthy20
httpsthepsychologistbpsorgukdontpersonalisecollectivise
 later there was a shift to the rationale being to protect the nhs protect others and a change from you the potential victim to you the spreader eg act like youve got it which seems to have been more persuasive21the uk governments new slogan  stay alert  unveiled in early may 2020 abandoned the collectivization implicit in the previous successful messaging with the consequence that only three in ten brits think that they know what the new slogan  is asking them to do httpsyougovcouktopicshealtharticlesreports20200511britssplitchangescoronaviruslockdownmeasures

this last example makes the point that indeed psychology is heavily involved in the public response to covid19 however it is not a psychology of fixed behavioural tendencies since the self and hence selfinterest the motivations for and boundaries of concern varies with contextual factors in this case political leadership which failed initially to communicate in collectivist terms so of course psychology matters in what happens in emergencies but for reasons other than inevitable collective selfishness thoughtlessness and overreactionlets consider first the conditions under which behaviour is competitive vs cooperative in emergencies there have been many reports of mutual social support by members of the public during the covid19 crisis22
httpswwwtheguardiancomworld2020may03nhscoronaviruscrisisvolunteersfrustratedatlackoftaskscmpshareiosappother
 reviews suggest that cooperation among survivors is very common in emergencies and that members of the public save more lives than professional responders drury et al 2019 but in some emergencies people compete push and even trample each other what are the conditions for this to occur chertkoff and kushigians 1999 comparison of different evacuations found that there was more competition when exits were narrow and unfamiliar we also know that people compete more and coordinate less in evacuations when they are positioned psychologically as individuals rather than as group members as mintz 1951 shows when an evacuating crowd blocks the exit this can be explained in terms of the prevalence of individual competition in a collective setting rather than in terms of excessive emotion in these cases then the emergency ends badly due to the absence of collective psychology ie lack of coordination and cooperationcooperating and giving support can also carry risks which need to be acknowledged in mass evacuations the larger the group the slower the egress because speed is reduced through people interacting with each other aguirre et al 1998 and the motivation to give support to other survivors can lead some to take risks with their personal safety so what is good for the collective in emergency is not always good for particular individuals drury cocking  reicher 200923this is one of the main reasons why debates around rationality and irrationality in behaviour in emergencies are dead ends in the case of covid19 the risk to the individual from supporting the group is clear where that supportive behaviour involves physical proximity whether delivering food or giving emotional support facetofacewhat about public underreaction  why does this occur underestimation of risk has sometimes been characterized as an optimistic bias kinsey gwynne kuligowski  kinateder 2019 but in a context where emergency events are rare ie most of the time it is reasonable to assume that it wont happen to us this assumption can reverse when emergency events become more common  for example in 2017 after a spate of terrorist attacks in london hundreds of people in oxford street fled from a noise that turned out to be harmless in general then the extent to which information concerning a threat is seen as plausible is a function of the broad social context of dangers expectations of danger are raised and the readiness to flee or take other action is greater in a context of recent incidents relevant to our social grouphow do perceptions of risk become collective people respond not only to direct signals of risk but to other peoples responses to that signal bruder fischer  manstead 2014 we suggest that the extent to which the response of others to the possible threat is seen as conveying information is dependent on the selfrelevance of these others in a particular context which in turn is often a function of shared identity based on what we know about social influence processes in other contexts bruder et al 2014 in the case of covid19 it is plausible to suppose that the sight of others in our community routinely observing or ignoring social distancing regulations for example is likely to send a strong signal to us around the safety of doing the same  particularly where we identify with the community or see these exemplars as prototypespsychological factors can interact with management failures to help explain why some emergency events end so badly fearing public panic leads the authorities to withhold information about the emergency drury et al 2019 but lack of information in an emergency increases public anxiety and when the public perceives that information is being withheld from them this damages their relationship with the authority carter et al 2015 consequently when the authorities do release correct information the public may mistrust and fail to act upon it in the case of covid19 the need to treat the public with respect in order to build trust has been part of the advice given by behavioural scientists to the uk government24

we do not deny that in emergencies some people behave selfishly and thoughtlessly or that some may overreact indeed as explained research suggests some of the conditions for competition to prevail over cooperation what we are questioning here is the notion that such public reactions are a default or are a major cause of problems in the covid19 crisis the existing literature on disasters does not support this view and prima facie major problems in the covid19 response and outcomes can be better understood otherwise  in terms of political underreaction systemic issues and mismanagementcollective panic is referred to as a disaster myth in the literature on disasters drury et al 2019 rather than a neutral description of how people actually behave it is best understood as part of a particular discourse or cultural representation one which psychologizes  and indeed pathologizes  public responses in emergencies and disasters given what is known about underreaction systemic factors and mismanagement in emergencies to emphasize instead the role of collective bad behaviour has clear ideological functions in naturalizing fatalities it distracts from the real causes and thus from who might be held responsible for mismanagement instead blaming the victims the irony of course is that far from being the problem collective psychology in emergencies  the solidarity and cooperation so commonly witnessed among community members and strangers  is usually the solution collective psychology therefore can and should be harnessed more effectively in policy and practice in the covid19 response elcheroth  drury 2020  through framing both the threat and the solution in collective terms and through emphasizing shared norms around collective wellbeing and safety drury et al 2019 why do people die in emergencies it is probably not because of collective psychologyall authors declare no conflict of interestjohn drury conceptualization writing  original draft writing  review  editing stephen reicher conceptualization writing  review  editing clifford stott conceptualization writing  review  editingthe history of the genus homo and the dozen human species we know of today through archaeological excavation was determined by the fight against infectious diseases it is likely that the species that are no longer around today are largely extinct due to the spread of infectious diseases 1 we should be happy that we no longer live in the times of great epidemics and pandemics that once decimated our species a huge number of people died during their childhood or youth 1the most severe mediaeval infections killed up to every third person before the discovery of the microscope people could not even know why it was happening to them no one thought that tiny invisible living microbes could cause these diseases people assumed that some heavenly punishment for their sins had come upon them we should therefore be grateful that we are living in the age of this advancement of science and medicine 1since 1940 many bacterial diseases have begun to be controlled by antibiotics and since 1960 many viral and bacterial diseases have had vaccines developed for them 1 unfortunately we do not have a vaccine for all infectious diseases as we see in the example of this pandemic new viruses continue to transfer from other species to us because history has not ended with the advent of our generation instead it just continues but this pandemic certainly does not look like it will decimate usit could have because this is already the seventh coronavirus to try to make itself at home within the human population 2 it is trying to adapt to us and use us as its reservoir specifically we exist together with this virus on a small blue-brown planet in a vast dark universe we share it with tens of millions of other species they all strive to barely survive more than 99of all species that have ever existed on earth have failed to survive to this day 1 that is why viruses constantly transfer themselves to new species and thus expand their reservoirs they must choose the winning species because they cannot reproduce on their own their survival depends on the survival of the species that is their reservoir 3humans are currently an interesting potential viral reservoir we are expanding rapidly in population size  from about a billion-and-a-half individuals we have grown to about seven-and-a-half-billion in the last 130 years alone 1 in doing so we are conquering new territories clearing forests draining wetlands hunting for pleasure and reducing overall biodiversity 1 this is making it increasingly difficult for others to survive while there are more and more of us fortunately for us all the first four human-adapted coronaviruses were merely the cause of common colds 2 no-one considered the four of them a serious threat to public healthsars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle eastern acute respiratory syndrome were a real surprise for scientists and experts these were further respiratory viruses from the coronavirus family the fifth and sixth that managed to infect humans surprisingly instead of colds they were able to cause very severe fatal pneumonia 2 in addition the death rate among those infected with both diseases was truly frightening sars killed one-in-ten infected while mers killed one-in-three both could have caused a horrible amount of human deaths if they spread to the worlds entire population 2the coronavirus that caused sars had its reservoir in bats which hibernate in caves in winter this is the time of the year when hardly anyone hunts or consumes bats however sars managed to infect an animal from the cat family a civet from a civet it was then also contracted by a man a farmer in guangdong province in late 2002 sars then spread to more than twenty countries and infected more than 8000 people with every tenth infected person dying from the disease it was the fifth human coronavirus but it was the first to kill humans 2ten years later in 2012 the mers coronavirus appeared in saudi arabia it was passed on to humans from the camels in the desert it has also spread to more than twenty countries infecting about 2500 people and every third infected person died 2 so both sars and mers had a really scary case-fatality rate the advent of mers showed us that sars was not an isolated incident with a coronavirus that we could just forget about but that coronaviruses have become the most significant potential biological threat to our species if sars or mers had spread around the world and infected billions of people they would have caused a catastrophe unlike any other in the modern history of humansin those two cases we were actually very lucky essentially an entirely new virus that tries to transfer over to the human species can spread among humans in three basic ways each of these three ways informs our strategies for epidemic surveillance and dealing with the epidemic once the virus enters the human body it begins to multiply in the kind of specialised cells that it has the ability to bind to in the case of coronaviruses these are the cells of the respiratory system the virus multiplies in them by hacking their cellular genetic code and using their machinery to build its own proteins 2this multiplication of the virus eventually destroys the infected cells that is the reason for the eventual development of the symptoms that are characteristic of respiratory infections such as a sore throat and cough in the first mode of the spread the virus will jump from the infected person to unaffected people only after the onset of those symptomssuch an epidemic is the easiest to control and contain that is because the sick person is soon confined to bed and no longer leaves home therefore the virus can mainly spread to their household members this also makes it relatively easy to identify everyone who was in contact with the person after the onset of symptoms those people can then be placed in isolation quite easily we were fortunate that both sars and mers spread to other people only after the onset of the symptoms of the disease this is why we were able to suppress the epidemics by isolating those infected and all their contacts after the onset of the symptoms this is quite likely the most important reason why sars and mers did not manage to kill remarkably large number of people 2it is much more difficult to contain an epidemic if the virus spreads from infected to healthy people during the period of the so-called incubation this period lasts from the entry of the virus into the body until the onset of the first symptoms 3 in such case infected persons can transmit the virus by contact to a significantly larger number of people in the days before they get any symptoms that seems to be the situation with this new covid-19 pandemic but even then it is at least possible for every new patient to determine from whom they contracted the infection namely all newly diagnosed cases had to meet an existing and known case in the pastthis allows epidemiologists to follow the entire chain of movement of the virus from person to person due to this favourable circumstance intensive isolation measures of all those who were in contact with those already infected can significantly slow down the spread of the virus this was done in wuhan that is why test-trace-isolate as the first line of defence and quarantines as the ultimate response both represent a justified containment strategy when people are infectious for others during incubation period both approaches will slow down and contain the epidemic if applied properlya nightmare scenario for any epidemiologist however is a third possibility for the virus to spread in such a variant people become infected and transmit the virus but they themselves never show any symptoms scientists are currently looking for such possible spreads of contagion with this new covid-19 pandemic that is the reason why such possible persons are occasionally mentioned in the media in high-profile articlesnamely because of such infected people cases are beginning to emerge among the population that cannot be linked to any of the already infected people when people are circulating in the population without symptoms but passing the virus on to others it is very difficult for epidemiologists to do anything to prevent it from spreading among all humans such an epidemic has the potential to spread over time mainly due to such transmitters or carriers who show no symptomswhen something has happened six times within a system that is as complex as the earths ecosystem then it is no surprise that it would also happen for the seventh time another coronavirus is now trying to make itself at home in the human species in this case the primary reservoirs were probably bats again we know this because the genetic sequence of this new coronavirus coincides with that found in hibernating bats in about 96 percent 4 this time instead of a civet a smaller mammal or bird has probably served as coronavirus so-called transitional reservoirit is possible that it was a pangolin because in one of them a coronavirus that matched to the human form by as much as 99 of the sequence was found although this is not completely definite either 5 sequence matching is not the only important factor when it comes to viral jump from animals to humans what is also important is how many individuals in the species that serve as a transitional reservoir are infected and how often the species comes into contact with humans sometimes these factors are more important so they can bridge the gap of 2-3 of the difference in genome sequence because pangolins are a protected species and cannot be eatenthus in the chinese province of hubei in the city of wuhan which has a population of eleven million at around the end of 2019 the number of patients with an unusual and very dangerous type of pneumonia began to increase many of them had in common that they visited a particular fish market it was soon discovered that this infectious disease was spreading very quickly each infected person managed to further infect as many as two to three people such a degree of infectivity is quite high and leads to rapid growth of the epidemic we had the misfortune that the disease caused by the 7th coronavirus  covid-19  apparently manages to spread even during the incubation period possibly even by touchthis incubation period lasts about five days on average it would be very tricky if it lasted longer because the novel coronavirus would then have more time to spread from an already infected person to others however an incubation period of up to two weeks is not entirely unusual even rare cases who had incubation period of up to four weeks seem to be possible during some of this time the infected person can spread the virus before the onset of their first symptoms if there are infected people who do not develop symptoms it will be really difficult to contain this pandemic until we develop a vaccine in conclusion infectivity ie the ability to move from the infected to the uninfected seems to be significantly higher in covid-19 than it was with sars and mers as a trade-off we now know that the covid-19 case-fatality rate is significantly lower than that of sars and mersin order to answer this rather complicated question it must first be said that nowadays the registered number of infected persons and the number of deaths can be monitored online 6 when the number of deaths was divided by the confirmed and registered number of infected people at the beginning of the pandemic a figure of about 2 would be obtained 6 from this alone one could apparently conclude that  given that this is an entirely new coronavirus and nobody is immune to it  it will necessarily spread throughout the world and infect us all if it kills 2 percent of all people then it follows that out of a total of 75 billion people about 150 million will necessarily die it is difficult for anyone who is not a specialist in this field to understand how such an outcome can now be prevented because a vaccine against this virus does not yet exist nor do medicinesthe question of the case-fatality rate among those infected with covid-19 exposed a general lack of epidemiological knowledge among the general public and in the media from the very beginning of this pandemic there were people who claimed that the new coronavirus was a disease milder than even the flu but also those who believed it was significantly more dangerous in recent days this issue has finally caught the attention of all the worlds media as the world health organisation reported that about 34 of those infected with coronavirus have died 7 that sounded terrifying to the media and the publicbut then the president of the usa mr donald trump also made a public statement saying the number released by the who was wrong he said that hed talked to people who knew something about it and that his impression was that the number was certainly below 1 if not significantly less 8 in my guest appearance on sunday at 2 an influential croatian tv programme on march 1st i made an estimate of the case-fatality rate of 05-1 allowing for the possibility that it could even be smaller 9 namely at this point we do not properly distinguish infection-fatality rate from case-fatality rate so once that insights into seroprevalence become available they may even bring this estimate further downhowever both president trump and who are actually right each in their own way which shows best how difficult it is for many people to keep track of what is really going on because of their lack of knowledge of the epidemiologyin the beginning of every epidemic of a new virus the virus has to jump over from animals to humans and then from humans to humans that can be quite difficult therefore the virus will be more likely to successfully infect those with a weakened immune system who will find it more difficult to reject it because of this the first patients are often people who are either older or already have some underlying illnesses that make them more vulnerable they end up in a hospital where at that point no one suspects that pneumonia that they are experiencing may have an epidemic potentialthen they infect other hospital patients and some health care professionals the latter can then spread the disease to other patients in the hospital  mainly to those most susceptible such as those ailing or immunocompromised treated for serious illnesses or the elderly this is the reason why the case-fatality rate among all covid-19 patients was initially very high in wuhan and later in italy many people died of covid-19 infections in hospitals and they were mostly very old and sick people 10in the meantime the virus has started to spread among the general population  in the community and outside of hospitals it has infected many people who are otherwise healthy and had a much better immune response a large number of these people would have thought that they had a cold or the flu and perhaps even a more severe flu they were just resting at home and letting those respiratory infections run their course considering that it was flu season in wuhan at the time of the outbreak and the media reported that a strange epidemic was causing many deaths in wuhans hospitals it is quite likely that many wuhan residents who were infected with the coronavirus stayed home and treated themselvesfew people would choose to go to the hospital to test whether their flu-like symptoms were caused by the novel coronavirus when a deadly epidemic was spreading there only the few who have struggled with fevers and symptoms for more than eight or nine days sought help from wuhan hospitals in china there is typically no primary health care and family medicine as we know it but there are large hospitals in their huge cities where patients report directly that is the most likely explanation as to why the case-fatality rate among patients at wuhan hospitals at the beginning of the epidemic was so frighteningly highit is not the epidemic seemed even more dangerous at first as it created a great deal of pressure on hospital intensive care units which were unprepared for this infection as a result all severely ill patients could not receive intensive care this further increased the case-fatality rate at the beginning of the epidemic that is why the chinese have started building the two new hospitals they wanted to ensure a sufficient capacity to provide intensive care also they needed to move all those infected with covid-19 away from other seriously ill people who were sick from other diseases and at the highest risk of dying if they became infectedbased on this it should be understood that the total number of those infected with covid-19 in wuhan could have been much higher than what was confirmed by their health statistics specifically only those with coronaviruses who were eventually admitted to the hospital were confirmed to be infected and were tested for the new virus there they are by no means representative of all those infected with the new coronavirus in wuhantherefore the early estimates of case-fatality rates in wuhan cannot be extrapolated even to all those with confirmed coronavirus infection in wuhan let alone would they be representative of the entire population of wuhan for those reasons it is wrong to look at the number of deaths and the number of confirmed infected cases and divide those two numbers and draw any conclusions 11if all the reported deaths are divided by the total number of people with confirmed infection then both the numerator and the denominator are wrong when it comes to calculating the actual case-fatality rate even deaths in the numerator would be wrong this is because we monitor the confirmed infected and those who have died in real time a great many infected people have not even had a chance to either recover or die so the number of deaths in the numerator is an underestimatesome of the people who are presently in intensive care are expected to die in several days weeks maybe even months this is why the number of deaths that corresponds to the number presently infected will inevitably increase over time therefore some future number of deaths as the numerator will increasingly correspond to the current number of registered infected persons as the denominator as a result the case-fatality rate of deaths among those with confirmed infection will then no longer be 2 or 3 percent but it may increase quite considerably over time  perhaps to 6-7 percent or even moretherefore to simply say that about 34 of those confirmed to have been infected so far have died is not really wrong in itself which is what the world health organisation did but it missed explaining that this case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is quite unrepresentative of the mortality rate among all those who were infected 11 the true rate should be much lower it would not surprise me as an epidemiologist if it is up to ten times smaller perhaps even more 11 depending on the actual true number of infected people which should be used as a denominator this could ultimately make covid-19 a less deadly disease even than the common flugiven that the virus is new and unknown this is a key question unfortunately the possibility that this virus is quite different from other known viruses must also be allowed it may be that the case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is only 3 to 5 times higher than the infection-fatality rate ie the number of deaths among all infected people so it may not be ten or thirty times higher as many epidemiologists would expect the only thing we can be reasonably sure of is that the number of confirmed infected people was not equal to the number of all infected people in wuhan the current global totals of confirmed infected and fatalities for covid-19 are still largely determined by what happened in wuhan at the beginning of the epidemic this is because about two-thirds of cases worldwide still originate in wuhan to this day 6that is why i have already explained on sunday at 2 tv programme that the case-fatality rate among those who were confirmed to be infected is not so important it is only a subset of the patients with the most severe symptoms we need to find out what is the case-fatality rate among all infected people however no one can know that at this time because a random sample of at least 100 000 wuhan residents would need to be tested for this then the presence of antibodies against coronaviruses should be detected this is how we measure seroprevalence 3this would allow us to estimate the number of people in wuhan who got over the infection with the novel coronavirus without ever seeing a doctor so far no one has conducted these studies because the health system was preoccupied with diagnosing and treating the epidemic of covid-19 in hospitals and struggled with it it is now understood that during some days of the wuhan outbreak there were not enough tests for all those who reported to hospitals with symptomshowever additional lines of evidence are beginning to emerge the first is the report of an international panel of experts who visited china 12 they looked at the cases across china that were reported after february the 1st at this point the identification of those infected was significantly improved also hospitals were better prepared for the epidemic case-fatality rate of all cases that came under health surveillance and were tested dropped to about 07 12for anyone who may remain skeptical of chinas data the first reports have recently been provided by south korean authorities that country has really led by example in proactively testing people seeking out all those infected and their contacts isolating them and treating them in their analyses to date case-fatality rate of all infected people has been slightly above 06 13 both of those estimates could still increase albeit not substantially if they also included those who will likely die over time and are currently counted as infected still at such a low case-fatality rate there should not be many additional deaths in fact it is more likely that many infected people remained undiagnosed and that the case-fatality rate is actually even lower 11another interesting recent new source is the study of more than 1000 hospitalized covid-19 patients who were followed up until the very end of the infection this sample has been collected from more than 500 chinese hospitals and the result was published recently in a leading medical journal 14 this analysis quoted their overall case-fatality rate to be about 14 however it did not include all those infected again but rather those who requested hospital treatment 14 therefore it should still be possible that the infection-fatality rate is at least two to three times smaller among all those who were infected with the novel coronavirusthus it appears that data from very different and increasingly reliable sources are starting to converge to the values which i predicted on sunday at 2 tv show on march 1st ie 05-1 because of all of the above president of the usa donald trump was most likely right to say that this number should be closer to 1 and that he believes that it could even be well below 1 8 everything we know about epidemiology and previous pandemics gives us hope that this should be the casethe virus will not succeed in infecting everyone for a number of reasons our first line of defence consists of anti-epidemic measures all those who are experiencing symptoms and may be infected are being tested all their contacts are also tested for the presence of the virus then covid-19 patients and all their contacts are being isolated 15these measures will significantly slow down the spread of the infectious disease and buy us time it is of utmost importance that the number of patients with covid-19 does not increase too quickly when the new cases emerge more slowly the staff of national health care systems will be able to provide quality care to all patients for the more severe cases they will also offer intensive care in the absence of these measures there would be an exponential increase in the number of infected people this number would soon outgrow the capacity of the health system many people within countries are also protected by their geographical dispersion ie many people live in smaller towns and settlements a large number of them will probably never be exposed to an infected personfurthermore as people become infected develop covid-19 and then get well they should become immune to the virus as a result there will be fewer people the virus can still infect at some point the number of susceptible persons that infected people can spread coronavirus to will decrease substantially at some point each infected person will on average pass the virus to less than one susceptible person in time this will eventually limit and stop the epidemic that is the reason we vaccinate even if the virus infects some unvaccinated people it will have very few options for further spread vaccinated people will already be immune to the virus and their bodies will react vigorously if the virus tries to enter 16 many processes in nature are self-limiting in a similar way  forest fires stock market crashes and epidemicsfurthermore the case-fatality rate should not be directly applicable to the entire population of a country to estimate the possible death toll the first reason is that the virus mainly endangers the elderly whose case-fatality rates are much higher young people and children rarely get unwell and their death rates are much much lower this is why age and sex structure of the population can diminish the potential of the virus to cause a very high number of covid-19 casualties if the population is reasonably young 11the situation should be taken seriously and people should be cautious but there is no reason to be overly afraid there is especially no reason to panic many people are afraid of this pandemic because they probably think that we are in a completely unfamiliar situation so anything could happen but it is unlikely that much could happen for which science could not find explanations and answers and the epidemiological services could not respond in a timely manner it is unwise for a serious scientist to try to predict the spread of a completely new and unknown virus to the entire human population in the world let alone to predict more specific outcomes still we have in recent weeks collected enough information about the new covid-19 virus for at least some predictionsif the new coronavirus spreads across any country over time and manages to circumvent the many prevention measures in place the application of anti-epidemic measures should still limit its casualties to make them at least roughly comparable to the deaths from flu or road accidents in the same period this means that some healthy caution is advisable this caution is reasonable as long as it is on the same level as the fear you may feel when sitting in a car and preparing for a longer trip or when you hear on the news that a more severe form of influenza has arrivedbut many are wondering why the novel coronavirus attracts such a level of media attention this is because flu has been a well-known disease for decades it comes back every year and we have experience with its manifestations among many millions of patients worldwide we know how to develop vaccines against flu in advance of its season 16 we have even started to produce the first somewhat effective drugs and offer them on the market 17 unlike the flu the new coronavirus is unknown to us we should remain cautious so that we do not get unpleasantly surprised at the same time the most vulnerable among us who are already seriously ill or very old are not vaccinated as is the case with the flu this is why the new disease covid-19 can kill more easilythis question has constantly been being raised since the beginning because many are looking at various figures without a deeper understanding of their background and are comparing the incomparablefirst of all the general public underestimates how serious and dangerous and serious the flu actually is  especially for the most vulnerable the elderly and those who are already ill globally influenza causes between 250 000 and 650 000 deaths annually depending on the strain of the circulating virus 18 different strains can cause milder or more severe symptoms and the virus mutates each year however we try to protect those most vulnerable before the flu season begins by vaccinating themtherefore the number of deaths from influenza is reduced by preventive health intervention ie vaccination this cannot be done with the spread of covid-19 this is the first reason why the flu seems less dangerous than covid-19 however it may not be much less dangerous inherently especially during seasons when flu is more severe it is just that we protect the most vulnerable in addition flu vaccinations make it more difficult for it to spread among the population because there are fewer options for it to transfer to the uninfected due to the slower spread new cases emerge more slowly and the health care system has time to deal with them properly especially if they require intensive careanother reason is that the number of deaths directly from the flu is several times lower than the number of deaths that are indirectly caused by the flu influenza is often not cited as a direct cause in statistics on the causes of death if it has merely led to the exacerbation of some of the long-present chronic underlying disease these chronic diseases are then cited as the primary cause of death rather than influenza therefore the actual role of influenza in annual mortality is often significantly underestimated it can be several times higher when the causes of death are reclassified at the end of each year based on the increase in deaths from chronic diseases during the flu seasonthe third reason for caution in comparing covid-19 and flu is that we have a much better idea of the total number of people truly infected with the flu than we do about the novel coronavirus this is because influenza is a disease that is typically managed within primary care after which patients are referred to home care only the most serious cases of flu are referred to hospitalthere is an obligation to report the total number of people infected with influenza in the population to the central registry as well as for sick leave this makes the denominator for case-fatality rate of influenza better known to us than we can estimate it for the novel coronavirus covid-19 has so far been diagnosed and treated exclusively in hospitals where severe cases clustered the early estimates of case-fatality rates for covid-19 included patients suffering from hospital outbreaks which affected the elderly the sick and the immunocompromised this is why those case-fatality rates are hardly comparable to a spread that would occur in the general populationfrom all of this it should be concluded that case-fatality rates from influenza as another very dangerous viral disease have been mathematically reduced compared to the current reports of case-fatality rates for coronaviruses for the three reasons i mentioned the first is because we vaccinate those most vulnerable to the flu the second is that health statistics do not assign the majority of flu deaths to influenza but rather to the exacerbations of pre-existing underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes malignant tumours and others the third is that the denominator we use to calculate case-fatality rates from influenza is much closer to the actual number of those infected while the denominator for coronavirus is not yet known with sufficient certainty from their experience with other respiratory viruses epidemiologists know that all events in hospitals will dramatically over-represent the most vulnerable this is why those case-fatality rates should by no means be applied to the general populationhowever lay members of the public cannot have a good sense of these nuances that is why it is best to avoid comparisons between case-fatality rates for the flu and for the novel coronavirus until we learn more on the seroprevalence of the latter the general public underestimates the risk of influenza for the three reasons mentioned above they are also likely to overestimate the risk of the new coronavirus due to its intense media focus if influenza infections and deaths were monitored in the same way each year the public would realise how dangerous the flu really is and how reasonable it is to be vaccinated against ittherefore it still does not seem possible to me at least at this stage of the pandemic to decisively state which of the two diseases is inherently more dangerous to human beings or which will eventually cause more human deaths in 2020 flu will cause fewer deaths because the most vulnerable will be vaccinated and health statistics will not properly attribute many indirect deaths to flu which really caused them covid-19 in turn will cause fewer deaths due to epidemiological surveillance the prevention of its spread and possible strict quarantine it may also have seasonal characteristics and simply disappear with the arrival of late springwhen we have no other means of defending ourselves against the new virus all we can really do is retreat indoors and prevent the virus from jumping from infected to healthy individuals too quickly people generally do not have an intuitive sense of exponential growth if each newly infected person infects just one more person each day the number of newly infected people will increase from 2 to 16 during the early phase which does not seem like a big increasea little later it will jump to 1024 infected people from 128 over the next three days and that does not sound so terrible either but there will also come four days in which the number of newly infected people will increase from 100 000 to 800 000when china realised that the covid-19 epidemic was out of control and that it already entered this explosive phase the authorities immediately cut off wuhan and then fifteen other cities from the rest of the country in addition the authorities ordered that the population within these cut-off areas stay in their apartments and not leave it was an unprecedented measure in human history  tens of millions of people were quarantined for weeks everything stopped 12however this measure produced excellent results and china could keep its death toll below 5000 although the epidemic caught them unprepared and the virus spread to all chinese provinces a recent report from the world health organisations commission made up of 25 international experts visiting china concluded the followingchinas bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic faced with an unknown virus china has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history 12this may be because on these large ships people are mostly older one should look very closely at the age and gender structure of passengers which would tell us more about the final outcome it is also quite possible that a mutated version of the virus which is somewhat more dangerous could have entered such a pocket such isolated groups can always emerge and the disease may actually run a more severe course there this is possible but not very likely also this case-fatality rate should not be extrapolated to the entire country for the same reasononce the virus begins to spread through the entire human species it will continue to mutate it will try to adapt to humans as quickly as possible according to previous epidemiological experiences many of those mutations should make it less dangerous for human health as this would lead to a better adaptation however some random mutations could make it more dangerous to us this is why we need to be on our guard until we get better acquainted with the virus and the pandemic is over it is unlikely that the novel coronavirus will mutate to become significantly more dangerous than it is now but we will only be able to assert that with certainty when the pandemic is overthese are very difficult questions to answer until we get more quality data from both countries in principle it is possible that the first entry of the virus into a new country may be through an infected person in whom the virus has mutated into a more severe form if all further cases arise from that mutant then the situation in those countries may initially seem more difficult than elsewhere in population genetics this development is known as the so-called founder effect 19 however patterns of spread and case-fatality rates in both countries may also have many different explanationsthe reason why the death toll among infected people in italy appears to be very high is because the disease is spreading in small-town hospitals and elderly care homes which were completely unprepared for the epidemic the elderly and infirm are at much greater risk of dying if they become infectedcase-fatality rates in hospital outbreaks where older sick and immunocompromised people are affected will be much higher than those in the community among younger and healthy people among the first several hundred deaths in italy almost all people were over 60 years of age and had underlying illnesses 20 that is why the case-fatality rate seems so high there but it is not representative of the entire population a harsh flu season would probably have done similar damage if people had not been vaccinated against it but it is also possible that there are many more cases in the population than previously thought because the virus has been spreading for a long time in iran however the situation is unclear so far the most likely explanation too is that there are already significantly more cases of infection among the population than it was thought initiallyif covid-19 proves to be significantly more dangerous than seasonal influenza then one million deaths worldwide could indeed be expected perhaps significantly more unfortunately such a scenario is still possible in principle with a virus that is new and unknown to us for a variety of reasons because of this all experts in the field including myself are constantly urging people to take caution but without the unnecessary panicin which scenarios could the situation become much more difficult first most epidemiologists based on their experience with previous epidemics and pandemics expect the covid-19 case-fatality rate to fall below 1 when the total death toll is divided by a better estimate of the total number of infected people however the virus is new so it is possible in principle for this specific virus that the number of infected individuals who are not confirmed through testing may not be as large as epidemiologists would expect this would come as a surprise to science and would indicate a different nature of this virusthe new coronavirus causing covid-19 is somewhat similar to that caused by sars the sars pathogen however had a much higher case-fatality rate if the total population infected by the novel coronavirus is found to be higher than the registered infected population by only two or three times and not by eg ten times or more then the case-fatality rate of those infected with covid-19 could be significantly higher than the flucombined with the lack of an available vaccine in such a case it would lead to a significantly higher number of deaths than the flu however such an occurrence should still be prevented by measures of isolation of the patients and their contacts as well as by quarantines which are not applied in the case of flu we also hope that with the winter ending and the new seasons arriving seasonality would slow down or completely hinder the further spread of the virusfurthermore the virus could spread to infected people in some of its more dangerous forms as well as in milder forms previous experiences with epidemics have shown that mutation into milder forms is more likely but mutation into more dangerous forms or those that are more easily spread is not impossible either 3 in some countries such a variant would increase the case-fatality rate locally compared to other countries or accelerate infectionthis would put their health systems in a really difficult situation as intensive care units would soon become overburdened with poorer care available case-fatality rate of all those infected would increase further with the likely collapse of part of the health system it is also a very tricky scenario in which many health care professionals would become infected over time in providing care to patients which would make the situation worsetherefore currently perhaps the most important citizens of any country are health care professionals who work in hospitals for infectious diseases especially in their intensive care units they should be protected not only from work overload but also from coronavirus infection by their patients with the increasing number of infected people with severe forms of disease the demand for quality intensive care respirators and ecmo devices for extracorporeal oxygen enrichment will become the bottleneck of the health care system the same is true for healthy and well rested doctors and nurses in these wards those parts of the health system should be amplified and further strengthened before they come under increased pressurethe worst-case scenario imaginable right now is the entry of some more dangerous mutated version of coronavirus into one of the very poor countries in the world with a dysfunctional health system such countries cannot implement satisfactory quality epidemiological surveillance measures then a more dangerous version of the virus would likely infect a larger percentage of the countrys population relatively quickly panic would ensue probably also a black market for the transport of migrants to other countries then a more severe variant of covid-19 would start to expand uncontrollably and in a whole new wayin the event of any of these unfavourable developments all of which are unfortunately possible though not likely an entirely new protection strategy would be required each country will have its own approach when the death toll in each of the affected countries begins to rise so much as to cause fear among the population people will become increasingly willing to undertake much stricter epidemiological measures in such a case an increasing number of countries will resort to a solution that has proven effective in wuhan  ie declaring large very strict quarantines it is essential to buy time in such quarantines so that health systems do not become overburdened we should then anticipate the end of winter and hope that there would be evidence of possible seasonality of this virus it may then begin to spread in a weakened manner or disappear altogether at least until next winterthere are at least several reasons for optimism first of all epidemiological surveillance and first lines of defence are currently in place throughout the european union if they work well in most countries it is possible that their outbreaks will be controlled and would not enter a phase of exponential growth in the number of infected cases in the most favourable scenario with this retention this novel coronavirus would show seasonality then it would gradually disappear from circulation among humans with changes in nature characteristic of late spring and summer 3 however this is the most favourable scenario in which the final death toll would be much lower than that already caused by the flu this yearhowever if the front line of defence and epidemiological surveillance is broken through by the virus then governments will resort to strict measures to ban assemblies and organise quarantines as the chinese did several models done in recent weeks indicate that strict quarantine should completely suppress the spread of this coronavirus within up to three months 21 this is exactly what we have already seen in china that is why it seems that one great positive lesson of this pandemic is that humanity today would be able to survive even more dangerous infectious diseases than covid-19 with strict quarantine in which people would remain until scientists developed vaccines in this unusual situation this answer has been revealed to us allfinally the tireless work of numerous scientists currently testing over a hundred drugs against this virus as well as at least eleven experimental vaccines should be noted 22 it is not impossible that some existing medicines may show some effect and be repurposed to treat covid-19 also vaccines should become available over time in this unusual situation emergence of an effective drug or a vaccine could make a sudden and important differencewe should try to find something good in all the bad things that seem to be happening many people may finally realise how dangerous flu is more of them may start getting vaccinated against it each year the flu kills between 250 000 and 650 000 people worldwide 18in china which is one-sixth of the worlds population the death toll from covid-19 could be stopped below 5000 by the wuhan quarantine if all other countries could implement anti-epidemic measures like china then the death toll from covid -19 could be at most six times higher ie up to 30 000 that would be ten times fewer deaths than the total number of deaths caused annually by seasonal influenza unfortunately many countries will not be able to follow chinas example closely and will have uncontrolled outbreaks if the warmer season does not stop the spread of the virusfurthermore if the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the leadership and public health systems of individual countries function it will be possible to produce performance charts for each country in controlling this new infectious disease given the population size and age structure these will be very important lessons to learn in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerousadditionally viruses generally spread by contact this means that it is good to be reminded that hands should be regularly and properly washed during epidemics and touching surfaces that many people touch should be avoided knobs handrails atms shaking hands should also be avoided and we should keep at least two steps away from people who have symptoms of respiratory infections it is also advisable to regularly ventilate all living quarters it is also helpful to strengthen personal immunity with sufficient sleep exercise and good nutritionwe all hope at this point march 7 2020 that there would be very few i explained why it is no surprise that after the previous six coronaviruses the seventh has now also managed to infect humans nor is its spread rate a surprise as there are both more and less infectious respiratory viruses 3 it would be somewhat surprising for epidemiologists if the total number of infected people in the population was not significantly higher than the number of registered infected people in such occurrence case-fatality rate would indeed become significantly higher than that of the flu we should continue to await the information of well-conducted studies on this key questionperhaps the biggest surprises so far have been related to the clinical course of covid-19 rather than its epidemiology for now clinicians in china have reported that registered infected people report to the hospital rather late on average after as many as 9-12 days of home care 23 this may reflect their fear of being admitted to the hospital during an epidemic but it may also be an interesting feature of an illness with slow development in comparison to other respiratory infections furthermore fever does not appear to always accompany other symptoms of the disease in the first few days making it difficult to identify possibly contagious cases by controlling peoples temperatures 23the media has also reported on the possible return of the virus after suffering from the infection in some cases 24 for now it is hard to know how common these cases are and how many exceptions there are it is often wise to rest well after many viral respiratory infections to allow the body to recover after the infection has ended it is unknown whether this infection can return if the immune system has not completely removed the virus from the body but with all new and unknown viruses such surprises are possible so one should be careful until the pandemic is overin all the answers provided in this editorial i endeavoured to convey the most likely scientific explanations for the abundant information that is published about covid-19 in the domestic and international media over time some of the likely scientific explanations may need to be modified in the light of new information one should not forget that this is a new and unknown virus therefore surprises and deviations from the expected scenarios are in principle possible that is why i emphasise that caution is needed but not panic the community of scientists and health experts will continue to closely monitor the further development of the pandemicobviously we need to prepare for a very serious flu-like illness against which no-one will be able to be vaccinated against for quite a while therefore elderly people and those with underlying illnesses should be extremely careful because the infection is the most dangerous for them having gained our first knowledge of covid-19 we now need to concentrate on preventing the spread of the virus and buying time until the arrival of warmer days then we might be lucky enough to see the virus slowly disappearing due to seasonality unfortunately we cannot know that right now from everything written here it should be understood that all measures of active searching and the isolation of affected patients and their contacts are justifiedthese also include bans on gathering together larger groups of people as well as possible quarantine if the epidemic starts to elude epidemiological control particularly older people should be looked after because the probability of a bad outcome increases significantly with age in addition those with heart disease diabetes or undergoing cancer treatment should take special carethe current coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is placing an enormous emotional stress on frontline healthcare workers1 2 3 4 psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are being called upon to address the mental health threats posed to several clinicians of different disciplines in numbers to which they are altogether unaccustomed never before has the mental health profession been faced with delivering such help on this scale at the same time the threat of contagion requires that such help be delivered from a distance via virtual means a challenging departure from traditional psychiatric intervention this calls for innovative service delivery data are sparse in this area because of the short time since this devastating pandemic started nevertheless there are suggestions for individual interventions and systems interventions3 4 5 6 7 to our knowledge group intervention in this area has not been described in detail in the literature so far though some systems in the usa including ours have begun offering them7 here we report the methods we have developed at the group and individual levels to help our peers and describe in a qualitative manner our preliminary experiencesince march 28 2020 our university hospital of brooklyn has been designated as a covid-19 only facility by new york state from late march 2020 our department of psychiatry began offering support group and individual video-conference sessions to help our frontline attending physicians resident physicians nurses and other healthcare professionals and students later we began support group conference calls by telephone for our nurses as they preferred this modality over video-conference participation in our groups is voluntarya support group is defined as a group of people with common experiences and concerns who provide emotional and moral support for one another 8 our groups for attending physicians are organized around their roles and specialties such as hospitalists emergency medicine physicians and pediatricians redeployed into adult covid units while in the beginning we thought it might be advantageous to have separate groups for attending physicians and residents later we relaxed that policy at the request of the attending physicians who desired their residents to be included this has not presented any problems probably because in this crisis they both face similar issues and have a sense of solidarity in a desperate fight against a common enemy  in fact attending physicians provided great solace and a calming effect to their junior colleagueswe have two facilitators per group drawn from psychiatry faculty and residents for the nursing group there is also a nursing leader serving as a co-facilitator the groups meet weekly for about 40 minutes in the meetings we emphasize that these are peer-support groups encourage spontaneous expression of thoughts and feelings and acknowledge that some may not feel ready to talk but they can still benefit by listening the supportive interventions that we employ are explained in the discussion sectionwe have also set up a system to provide individual counseling sessions to any employee or student in our medical center in a confidential manner all licensed faculty members in our department have made themselves available during certain periods for these sessions via telehealth our institutions employees or students can leave a voice or text message in a confidential manner at a dedicated telephone number or send an email to a dedicated email address senior psychiatry residents screen the messages and schedule an appointment for the caller with a faculty clinician based on availability and the knowledge of each clinicians areas of expertise the faculty clinician can initiate a video conference call from the scheduling software do a brief evaluation provide counseling and if necessary schedule additional sessions issue prescriptions for medications or make outside referralswe estimate that about 40 attending physicians 40 residents and 50 nurses all frontline healthcare professionals have participated in the group sessions and 57 people have used the individual sessions some times more than one person use the same computer or speaker-phone all our nurses participated by audioconference only six attending psychiatrists and 10 psychiatry residents facilitated the groups ten attending psychiatrists one psychologist and one psychoanalyst-social worker provided individual sessions the number of participants in various group sessions has varied from 5 to 14 the number of weekly sessions needed by many groups to terminate with a sense of adequate emotional healing and strength has generally been 4 to 7 the number of individual sessions for a person has generally been two both the group and individual sessions have been found to be helpful by the participants as told to us by them in the group and individual sessions and to their peers by them who in turn told us for example two residents disclosed in their individual sessions with one of the authors mm that they have found both individual and group meetings helpful a few nurses physicians and administrators not involved with the groups have told us that they have heard from the participants how helpful the groups were we did not collect formal measures of distress or outcome data as these were not patients or research subjects and the interventions were done during a dire period of life-threatening collective crisis the individual sessions tend to be used by people who do not want to participate in support groups because the problems they are experiencing are sensitive they want to preserve confidentiality or their issue is of a nature or severity that cannot be adequately dealt with in a peer support group they are also used by employees who are not frontline clinical workers the presenting symptoms have been mostly anxiety-related including some work deployment issues because of the private nature of these sessions we are not giving here details of the discussions in these sessionsin the physicians and nurses weekly groups the content of the discussions evolved over time at first they focused on anxiety related to contracting covid-19 and fear of spreading it to ones family and friends on the strain imposed by taking extraordinary precautions to prevent this including social distancing and isolation from ones own family wearing masks at home taking care ones clothing or the places one touches do not place the family at contagion risk and guilt over putting ones family at risk some individuals opted not to go home at all after work but instead stay in the hospital or a hotel or rental apartment in order to reduce contact risk to their families many disliked being bombarded by news and conversations about the coronavirus when they were off work people also complained of the difficulties and discomfort imposed by having to wear full personal protective equipment ppe all the time for long hours in their clinical work and the interference with their collegial relationship at work because of it there was also anger and dismay at the shortage of ppe people used the analogy of soldiers being sent into the battle without armor or armsin later sessions a prominent theme has been the threat to the intimacy of the doctor-patient or nurse-patient relationship physicians and nurses are concerned about dehumanized interactions with patients because they wear their ppe at all times which conceals their facial expressiveness and identifying features as a human being they spoke of how this deprives very ill or anxious patients of the personal comforting they need from their healthcare professionals and frightens the cognitively impaired some are also afraid that communicating traumatic news often in quick succession is making them become numb or robotic in such interactions and they fear an erosion of their humanity because of institutional policies aiming to reduce the risk of contagion they have been prevented from allowing family members to be with their loved ones in their dying moments this has been heart-wrenching for physicians and nurses to bear as they are used to the role of being a bridging and consoling presence between dying patients and their familiesphysicians and nurses also struggle with a feeling of lack of control and a sense of futility in that with many patients they can do little to halt the progress of this disease while attending physicians may have more experience with this clinical dilemma than trainees it has never been on such a massive scale exacerbating this sense of lack of control is the fact that there are very few data on prognostic factors in hospitalized covid-19 patients that they can rely on for their own guidance or to reassure patients and families many patients deteriorate unpredictably and quickly and die death of their own colleagues and family members of colleagues from covid resulted in intense bereavement-focused sessions the deaths of a critical care specialist physician and an emergency department nurse both of whom had worked in our medical center for decades and were widely beloved were especially hard to bear those who got covid and stayed at home for a period of time felt guilty that they were not at the frontline helping when their colleagues were overworked people also expressed guilt about getting free food from well-intentioned donors while they knew that many people in the community they serve were food-deprived people were appreciative of the enormous outpouring of community support and the support they received from their colleagues and the institutional leadershiphow do we as mental health professionals respond in a therapeutic manner to these themes we utilize reflective listening clarification reassessment of perceptions employing socratic dialogue and relabeling of emotions an example emergency physician the patient was dying i knew his wife was just outside the emergency room in the waiting area yet i could not bring her to the dying persons bedside it tore my heart facilitator so it was heart-wrenching for you that you could not do a basic humane thing and had to let your patient die without family at bedside reflective listening some other examples are given in table 1
 we have existential discussions on control meaning and purpose in life and use of spiritual coping in those who are so inclined and encourage focus on positive aspects of ones personal and professional life we teach affect regulation and mindfulness one of us rv ends each session with a 3-minute meditation utilizing slow deep breathing with instructions as follows abridged close your eyes pay attention to your breathing notice the rhythm of your breathing slow it down breathe in deeply and slowly breathe out gently prolonging your exhalation as you continue to breathe deeply and slowly focus on the movement of air through your nostrils if you would like you may also focus on a word or phrase sacred or meaningful to you as you are focusing on your breath after a minute of doing so while continuing to focus on your breath reflect on the things you are grateful for both in your personal life and in your professional lifewe encourage people to take minibreaks during their stressful work and use brief mental relaxation strategies during the course of their work such as the meditation outlined above we emphasize the importance of proactively looking after ones physical and mental health including physical exercise sleep healthy nutrition recreation and social connectedness we advocate limited or titrated exposure to covid-19 media breaking news programmingto counteract the relentless feeling of powerlessness expressed by some physician participants simply reminding them of the basic tenets of the doctor-patient relationship goes a long way we urge them never to underestimate how much they help their patients and their families by their presence commitment and acts of kindness we lauded one physician who in response to his patients plaintive query doctor am i going to die said we are going to do everything we can to treat this to help you although the patient did die within a few hours there was a collective sense in the group that his physicians words provided some solace without the physician being untruthful we have to keep in mind that our healthcare professionals have not faced before deaths of their patients on such a massive scale in such a rapid manner as of may 27 2020 kings county brooklyn new york where our hospital is located had recorded 5035 covid-19 related deaths the highest number among all the counties in the usa9 this happened in a period of two and a half months this is bound to have a demoralizing effectgroup interventions help reach a larger number of people with a limited number of mental health professionals and can offer some additional healing elements that individual approaches do not such therapeutic factors include sharing experiences in a peer setting consensual validation support and learning from peers and building a sense of solidarity and camaraderie with fellow group members10 examples are given in table 1 all our nurses prefer audio-only groups over audio-visual groups some nurses have told us that they and their colleagues would not want to show their faces when they are emotionally upset because it is not in their culture we do not know how much of this preference has to do with differences between nursing culture and physician culture in our institution accessibility to a private space in the work place where computer or smart phone use is feasible or cultural issues related to demographics even in the physicians videoconference groups about half the participants keep their video muted they are not seen even though their identity is visible and some selectively unmute their video so that they can be seen at times because of the crisis nature of these-support groups we did not do a deeper investigation of this issue whats most important is to honor and implement whatever format helpsas pointed out before some people and problems require individual sessions telehealth interventions minimize the risk of contagion to providers and participants which is important during the covid pandemic they also facilitate access people can participate without losing too much work time or rest time11 telehealth support groups for patients have been successfully deployed before11 they would be easier to set up to help health professionalssome of the pointers other institutions can take from our experience psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are not peripheral to this covid-19 crisis but can be at the front and center helping frontline health care professionals preserve their mental health while being effective in helping the patients and the community both group and individual sessions need to be offered groups work best if one member of the clinical service takes responsibility of organizing the weekly videoconference or teleconference and serves as the groups liaison with the group facilitators one has to be flexible with some traditional ways of running groups some people may participate by telephone or computer audio only and some listen without uttering a word but still seem to be benefiting by such participation the groups need to be offered at different periods of day and evening to accommodate different work schedules weekly groups at set times work well the employer needs to give time for the employees to participate in these groups recognizing that this wellness intervention ultimately helps patient care some people prefer participating while they are on site and some others while they are off work the sessions need to be shorter than the traditional 90-minute sessions because of the time constraints imposed by conducting them during work hours our groups typically run for about 40 minuteswe hope that peer group support and individual interventions like these will help protect the mental health of a number of clinicians who are doing such commendable and courageous work so that they can continue to effectively help the countless severely ill patients with covid-19 other institutions can adapt these methods to their own needs this is a significant way the field of behavioral health can assist in this moment of world crisisconflict of interest disclosure for all the authors relevant to this manuscript nonei am primarily a biology educator and when considering the adequacy of school science education in a time of covid-19 it is tempting to wring my hands and complain that when i started my school teaching career in the 1980s we did large amounts of teaching about disease we taught at secondary level about a whole range of human infectious diseases with detailed life cycles showing the roles of intermediate hosts and the importance of animal-human transmission we taught about how infectious diseases could be tackled by prevention eg nets for malaria as well as treatment and cure we taught about the role of nutrition and general good health in reducing the likelihood of developing certain diseases and enhancing the bodys ability to respond appropriately if a person did become infected we taught about the immune system and what happens when it fails to recognise a new pathogen or when it over-reacts we taught about immunisation and how different approaches to it were needed for different infectious organisms and i was at the very beginning of my teaching career when hivaids made an appearance and educators responded quite rapidly with materials and pedagogies to be used in schools eg harvey and reiss 1987but there is not much use in grumbling about historical changes in educational practices and school science education some 35 years ago did not inhabit a golden age what i want to do here is to respond to sibel erdurans call as editor of science  education for position papers about how hps can contribute to science education in the era of the covid-19 pandemic erduran 2020 p 234 the paper will also have resonance to the current stem education special issue of science  education some of the examples in the paper will illustrate that science is situated not only within history philosophy and sociology but also it often has implicit links to mathematics technology and engineeringmy focus is on school science education recognising that science education takes place in a myriad of other places from those that can respond very rapidly to changing events the news cycle on the internet radio and tv to those that respond more slowly permanent exhibits in museums my aim here is not to look at the specifics of how biology education might respond to covid-19 but rather to examine what history philosophy and sociology of science might contribute and the implications of this for school science to structure my argument i will begin by looking at these three disciplines one by one though it will soon be evident how much they intertwine and towards the end of this article i will argue for the benefits of a more interdisciplinary approach to school science educationin a project that is currently delayed in its pilot stage as a result of covid-19 catherine mccrory forthcoming1 writes about the place of history in science teaching she points out that history too often serves in science teaching as decoration and cites the historian of science hasok chang who in his 2015 wilkins-bernal-medawar lecture wrote of accounts of history in science textbooks or popular mediathey tend to be human interest stories appearing as mere garnishes to presentations of scientific content  stories of heroic scientists who overcame adversity tragic scientists hampered by human limitations and circumstances fortunate scientists who made great discoveries by exploiting chance happenings strange scientists who engaged in bizarre experiments or devised fantastical theories and so on chang 2017 p 92now i could erect a defence of garnishesthe surface application of detail so as to delight that quintessentially distinguishes postmodernism from modernism in architecturebut instead i will follow chang who goes on to ask whether the study of the past of science can help us improve present scientific knowledgea key question asked in the history philosophy and sociology of science hps and addressed enthusiastically as chang notes by harvards project physics 19621972 and successive school curriculum initiatives in answering his question chang argues that knowledge of the history of science can result in a better understanding of the scientific knowledge that is accepted at present in addition it can give us a better understanding of the methods that scientists use to which i will return in the section on the philosophy of sciencechangs argument from the history of science is one that has had support within the science education community allchin having undertaken an analysis of mendel and genetics kettlewell and the peppered moth fleming and penicillin semmelweis and handwashing and harvey and the circulation of blood critiqued popular histories of science that romanticize scientists inflate the drama of their discoveries and cast scientists and the process of science in monumental proportion allchin 2003 p 330 he concluded that we do not need more history in science education rather we need different types of history that convey the nature of science more effectively allchin 2003 p 329 in an illustration of the reality that in science education we often seem to reinvent rather than build on previous findings and arguments milne had earlier critiqued heroic science stories pointing out that science stories transmit both knowledge and values milne 1998 p 186chang only mentions motivation once in his articleand then rather negatively in his final paragraph where he writes i noted that history is often used in order to excite curiosity and give inspiration for science and that this motivation often encourages distortions and oversimplifications of history chang 2017 p 104 however as mccrory forthcoming points out student motivation matters when i used to teach secondary students i peppered a form of garnish my lessons with accounts of the lives and work of the scientists behind the science that the students were learning there were no doubt plenty of occasions when even a school history teacher let alone an academic historian of science might have cringed on hearing me but the function of such teaching was not so much for me to teach my students about the history of science it was to engage them to motivate them only occasionallythe role of mendel darwin and wallace in the theory of evolution is a notable examplewere the historical stories key to the sciencewhen we focus on covid-19 it seems clear that history has lessons that can help students both the better to understand the emerging science and to appreciate how science is undertaken some of the aims of this teaching will depend on the circumstances under which the teaching takes place i am writing this in early may 2020 where the widespread presumption in many countries is that we are over the worst of the pandemic and what is needed now is a roadmap to restoring countries to normality so that people can get back to work and to normal social interactions much school teaching in so far as it is taking place is occurring on-line or via other modes of distance learning the reality is that for a biology teacher this absence of face-to-face contact makes it more difficult to discern and take account of how students are feelingit may be for example that some students are scared others grieving others boredthe most obvious way that a biology educator might see the role of history of science in a time of covid-19 is by considering past pandemics few students will know that the infectious disease that has killed the most humans over the last two centuries records before that time are poor in quality is tuberculosis tb caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis paulson 2013 to this day over a million people a year die from it 15 million in 2018the latest year for which good-quality data have been published world health organization 2020a remarkably about a quarter of all people around the globe have latent tbbut they do not develop symptoms unless their immune system become severely compromised for instance through hiv infection or because of malnourishment resulting from something like homelessnesstb is spread primarily by the inhalation of tiny water droplets with the bacteria that are released when someone who has pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis coughs sneezes laughs shouts etc this transmission route is also one that covid-19 has however unlike covid-19 tb is not spread via contact with infected surfacestouching does not spread tb unless the bacterium is breathed in a closely related disease bovine tb is caused by mycobacterium bovis and spread from cattle to other mammals including humans as with most topics in science the history of tb is fascinating and a host of factorspasteurisation of cows milk improved living standards and general health the development and increasing use after the second world war of the bacillus calmettegurin bcg vaccinehas led to it being less of a problem in wealthy countries lienhardt et al 2012 the involvement of cattle in the spread of tb has similarities with the importance of animal-human transmission for covid-19 and there is on-going controversy as to the relevance of badgers in bovine tb tb in cattle and about how bovine tb might best be tackled mcculloch and reiss 2017personally i would garnish the tuberculosis story with a sprinkling of the terrifying roll call of those who have died from tb just from the world of literature there are anne and emily bront elizabeth barrett browning anton chekhov franz kafka john keats and george orwell who survived long enough to be treated in 1948 with the antibiotic streptomycin discovered in 1943 before dying in 1950the pandemic that is most often mentioned in the context of covid-19 is the 19181919 influenza pandemic see also the 19761977 swine flu epidemic in the usa neustadt and fineberg 1978 it has been estimated that about 500 million people became infected with the influenza virus one-third of the then worlds population and about 50 million people died a mortality rate of about 10 like covid-19 the disease was another example of a zoonosis a disease transmitted to humans from non-human animals being caused by an h1n1 virus with genes of avian origin jordan et al 2019 but unlike covid-19 mortality seems to have been highest in people younger than 5 years old 2040 years old and 65 years and older fig 1it is not known where the 19181919 influenza pandemic originatedthough it was probably in the usa europe or china taubenberger 2006 the disease is often referred to as spanish flu the reason for this is not that it originated there but that spain was one of the few european countries to be neutral in the first world war wartime censors in other countries suppressed the news of the influenza fearing its adverse effect on morale it is often the case that countries name diseases after other countries in an attempt to deflect blame from those in power and to stigmatise foreignerssyphilis had a variety of names usually people naming it after an enemy or a country they thought responsible for it the french called it the neapolitan disease the disease of naples or the spanish disease and later grande verole or grosse verole the great pox the english and italians called it the french disease the gallic disease the morbus gallicus or the french pox the germans called it the french evil the scottish called it the grandgore the russians called it the polish disease the polish and the persians called it the turkish disease the turkish called it the christian disease the tahitians called it the british disease in india it was called the portuguese disease in japan it was called the chinese pox and there are some references to it being called the persian fire frith 2012 p 50there are interesting parallels with covid-19 which donald trump of course has more than once referred to as the chinese virus less well known is the story behind the world health organization calling the virus the covid-19 virus viruses are named by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv who have named the causative agent for covid-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 however as the who explainsfrom a risk communications perspective using the name sars can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations especially in asia which was worst affected by the sars outbreak in 2003for that reason and others who has begun referring to the virus as the virus responsible for covid-19 or the covid-19 virus when communicating with the public world health organization 2020bfinally there are similarities between current attempts to tackle covid-19 and historical attempts to tackle the 19181919 influenza pandemic fig 2 masks were used public gatherings banned schools and businesses closed good hygiene practices recommended makeshift hospitals established and desperate unsuccessful attempts made to manufacture a vaccine in the end it was herd immunity that caused the disease to die out if it is herd immunity that causes covid-19 to die out we will have lost millions of peoplethere is much overlap between the history of science and the philosophy of science and there is of course an enormous literature on the nature of science nos in my own country england we have long favoured a simplified version of popperian science in our accounts for school students as to how scientific knowledge is built up as i have written previouslypoppers ideas easily give rise to a view of science in which scientific knowledge steadily accumulates over time as new theories are proposed and new data collected to discriminate between conflicting theories much school experimentation in science is popperian in essence we see a rainbow and hypothesise that white light is split up into light of different colours as it is refracted through a transparent medium water droplets we test this by attempting to refract white light through a glass prism we find the same colours of the rainbow are produced and our hypothesis is confirmed until some new evidence causes it to be falsified we accept it reiss 2007 63this is not the place to give a 101 account of the philosophy of science more profitable i think is to look at how some of the core issues to do with the philosophy of science might usefully be addressed when teaching at school level about covid-19 we can start with perhaps the most basic thing students are taught to do when beginning to study sciencenamely to measure carefully whether they are determining the length of an object its mass its temperature or whatever let us consider the measurement of mortality that results from covid-19we can start by noting that it is very likely that countries under-report deaths from covid-19 some of the reasons for this are overtly political but others are to do with more fundamental issues to do with scientific measurement for a start attributing cause of death is often a matter of judgement even if we possess perfect knowledge about the circumstances of a persons death consider someone who under the influence of alcohol falls and hits their head on a kerb and so dies was their death caused by the kerb the alcohol the breakup of their relationship that caused them to drink too much their parents poor marriage which failed to provide a model for a successful relationship or what one thinks of aristotles material formal efficient and final causes and of humes writing about the inherent difficulties of discerning causesfor school students they could think about why it is difficult to determine whether people have died as a result of covid-19 reasons in addition to the more general issues raised in the preceding paragraph include the fact that many people die without a clear-cut diagnosis of covid-19 in part due in the large majority of countries to a lack of capacity with testing a consideration which leads to the underestimation of mortality resulting from covid-19 students could also be helped to realise that just because i die and am shown by testing to have covid-19 does not necessarily mean that i died because of covid-19 infectionas per the above fact that about a quarter of those across the globe who die would test positive for tb but the vast majority of such individuals do not die because of ts infection a consideration which leads to the overestimation of mortality as a result of covid-19then there are what might be termed the indirect consequences of covid-19 on mortality to list just some of these fewer people go to hospital for treatments because they are afraid of becoming infected with covid-19 there leading to an increase in mortality rates greater anxiety and other mental health issues with outcomes that include suicide leading to an increase in mortality rates an increase in domestic violence leading to an increase in mortality rates lower levels of exercise and increased food consumption possibly leading to an increase in mortality rates lower levels of traffic leading to a decrease in mortality rates lower levels of air pollution leading to a decrease in mortality rates and so on the point of this litany is not for students to learn it off by heart but to think about the indirect effects that covid-19 might have on mortalityin schools students are all too often given the impression that measurement is a trivial issuesomething that with a bit of an effort and some care that they should be able to sort out straightforwardly measurement relies on mathematics knowledge and it can be considered a cross-cutting theme in stem related problems at best they are taught something about random and systematic errors and anomalous results in reality careful measurement lies at the heart of science and raises a number of philosophical issues tal 2017 for a lovely account of what the boiling point of water is as determined by measurements of it spoiler alertwater only boils at its official boiling point under very distinctive circumstances see chang 2008and the issue is often as much to do with what to measure as to how to measure itwith regard to what to measure while mortality is what makes headlines healthcare decisions are rarely made on mortality alone students might be introduced to at least two complicating factors the first is that it may not be that health systems attempt to minimise or should attempt to minimise mortality but to maximise what are called qalys quality-adjusted life years the second complicating factor to which i return below is to do with the economics of health care rationingqalys are an attempt to deal with the obvious truth that most people do not so much want to live longer per se as to have more years of good health qaly calculations therefore attempt to combine the additional years of life that are expected to be gained from a successful intervention with a measure of the effects for patients on the quality of their lives everyone accepts that actually measuring qalys is an inexact science but it is generally thought to be better than not trying to one qaly equals 1 year in perfect health so that an additional year of life has a maximum qaly of 1 and a minimum of 0 or even some maintain less than 0 if the quality of ones life is such that one would be better off dead measuring the additional years of life from a successful medical intervention can be estimated with some confidence measuring the quality of life after a medical intervention is much more difficult and there are various methods used of which the most common is the entirely subjective one of asking people to rate their quality of life on a scale from 0 i would be as well off if i were dead to 100 perfectthe relevance of qalys to covid-19 is that while we are still in the early phase of the pandemic it is clear that many of those who recover from covid-19 will have a reduced level of quality of lifefor example because they will require life-long renal dialysis or a kidney transplant state medical systems have when resources are finite to make decisions about how much to treat people and qalys are used to help facilitate such decisions if something like qalys are not used health systems can end up spending all their resources on keeping a relatively small number of people alive when many others could be treated or enabled never to become ill in the first place eg through public health initiatives for the same amount of financial investment and medical time also often a limiting resourcein the above i have focused on the measurement of mortality and issues to do with the quality of life but there are other important issues to do with covid-19 and measurement in particular the value of the basic reproduction number r0 ie the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a totally nave population and of the subsequent reproduction rate r ie the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person at any time are both difficult to determine estimates of r0 for covid-19 currently vary by a factor of more than two liu et al 2020 and there is inevitably a time lag between the human behaviours that affect r and subsequent measurements of it students can also be helped to appreciate that r is affected by a very large number of variables to do with both the person who is already infected and those whom they may go on to affect including age gender population density presence of underlying health conditions and a number of variables to do with behaviour such as extent of social interactions and personal hygiene students might also be helped to appreciate that tb while it has a similar value of r to that of covid-19 a recent review gave values that range from 024 to 43 ma et al 2018 is far less contagious in the sense that it is substantially less likely that a person with tb will spread it to someone else per unit of time that they spend in each others company tb unlike covid-19 influenza or colds usually only spreads between family members who live in the same housei have concentrated in this section on issues to do with measurement when measurement is considered in undergraduate physical science courses the emphasis is on issues to do with quantum theory as is well known heisenbergs uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical constants can be measured iconically momentum and position at the appropriate stage of their education students can be helped to enquire whether this is a constraint that results from the effect of observers or whether it is a constraint that is inherent within all wave-like systems however there are as indicated above many other issues to do with measurement that can help students appreciate how the rigorous thinking and conceptual clarity that should characterise philosophical thinking including thinking about the philosophy of science can help illuminate issues of central relevance to covid-19some of these issues are considered in school biology courses for example statistical issues to do with sampling resulting from limitations on access to data but others are less often considered with any degree of explicitness for example the importance of biological objects being historical products montvil 2019 of course measurement is only one issue with which the philosophy of science concerns itself but i hope that i have shown that there is plenty here to profitably occupy school students when learning about covid-19 issuesmoral philosophy can obviously be considered as sitting within philosophy but i have given the discipline its own section here in part because even at school level ethics is often given a certain prominence in biologyas is the case with debates about the place of history in science education there is a long-running debate about the place of ethics in science education reiss 1999 objections to the inclusion of ethics in science education include the claim that ethics simply does not fit there on epistemological grounds any more for example than aesthetics does and that science teachers lack the expertise to teach it those in favour of including ethics in school science can point to the fact that mathematics is epistemologically distinct from science but we include plenty of mathematics in science and that many students find that the inclusion of ethics in science makes the subject more engaging and relevant for them there is also the argument that including ethics can lead to a better understanding of science understood narrowly for example discussing ethical objections to in vitro fertilisation or cloning can lead to a deeper examination of questions about when human life begins and what we understand by individualitythere are a number of ethical issues raised by covid-19 that would make for good discussion in the classroom i will mention two here health care rationing and vaccinationhealth care rationing is not often discussed in school biology lessons where the focus is more often on the acceptability of new technologies such as genetic engineering or cloning environmental issues such as pollution and the loss of biodiversity as a result of human activities and sometimes beginning and end of life issues the reality though is that health care rationing nearly always exists even if it is often kept hidden and even though in countries with public health care systems people like to presume that it does not exist with covid-19 the initial threat in the spring of 2020 that health care systems around the world would be overwhelmed led to a more explicit acknowledgement of health care rationing as there were near panics about the availability of ventilators and other items of equipment not to mention the availability of doctors nurses and other health care professionals the ethical issues that flow from such shortages are principally to do with who gets privileged access for example should someone in the prime of life with young children be favoured over someone in poorer health in their 80s with no dependent relativesat the time of writing we do not know whether it will be possible to develop one or more vaccines against covid-19 unlike health care rationing vaccination is often covered in school biology though the coverage can focus simply on the science with vaccination being presented as an unproblematic success story reiss 2018 after an account of edward jenners classic 1796 experiment on 8-year-old edward phipps itself more than a little ethically problematic by todays standards graphs are presented showing dramatic decreases thanks to vaccination in the incidence of such diseases as smallpox and poliohowever objections to vaccination began almost as soon as the practice was introduced nineteenth century objections included arguments that they did not work and were unsafe ernst and jacobs 2012 or that their compulsory introduction eg the 1853 compulsory vaccination act in the uk violated personal liberties durbach 2000 to this day vaccination is rejected by some for much the same reasons such individuals are often castigated by health care experts and portrayed as selfish i have nothing against passionate teaching and learning but in a school setting there is the opportunity to examine more carefully the arguments for and against vaccination in a way that can be difficult in students homes such ethical examination goes hand-in-hand with mainstream science teachingfor example teaching that if herd immunity is to help prevent the spread of a disease through vaccination a certain percentage of the population the percentage varies inversely with r0 needs to have acquired immunitydone poorly ethics teaching can become no more than a list of arguments for and against certain practices to enhance the quality of students arguments students need to be introduced to some of the main ethical frameworksmost likely consequentialism duties and rights and virtue ethics my own view is that it is easier for science teachers to teach about ethics than it is for specialist ethics teachers to teach about science which is another reason for including ethics in the science classroom rather than hoping that the ethical implications of science get covered somewhere else in the school curriculumhowever if ethics is to be covered in school science students need to be assessed appropriately both formatively and summatively reiss 2009 when one looks at examples of the summative assessment of ethics in school philosophy and religious studies courses one finds that good candidates are expected to be able to write at some length and to craft a developing argument furthermore banding rather than the allocation of precise marking points is often employed in the mark schemes used by the organisations that set the official school examinations in philosophy and religious studies notable too is the expectation that candidates taking these examinations should be able to criticise major ethicists and be familiar with the contrasting views of a range of both classical eg kant sartre bentham and contemporary eg singer authors at present such features are rare to the point of non-existence when ethics is examined at the end of school science courseswithin hps the contribution of sociology is probably best known through the work of t s kuhn and the subsequent science wars more generally sociology is the discipline principally concerned with how people behave in society the specific field of medical sociology traditionally analysed such things as patient-doctor relationships but has grown to encompass any of the cultural as opposed to biological effects of medical practice in relation to covid-19 medical sociologists indeed sociologists more generally are therefore interested in such things as who gains access and who does not gain access to technologies for prevention and treatment classically much sociology looked at the importance of social class gender and ethnicity on matters like living conditions work patterns and wages it is already clear that all three of social class gender and ethnicity along with disability are of great relevance for the likelihood of someone becoming infected by covid-19 and dying as a result there is therefore a normative element to medical sociology which therefore overlaps in its interests with moral philosophythere is now the growing emergence of a body of specialised sociological analysis in relation to covid-19 sadati et al 2020 point out that one of the most important consequences of the covid-19 outbreak has been the worldwide creation of social anxiety they link this to ulrich becks pioneering book risk society beck 1992 in which beck as did other sociologists such as giddens argued that while societies have always been exposed to risks modern industrialised societies are particularly exposed to risks that are the result of modernisation itself indeed it is clear that contemporary practices in food production and travel have at the very least fuelled the covid-19 pandemic brown 2020 also hones in on issues to do with risk pointing out that they cannot be equated with probabilities and draws on mary douglas classic work on everyday rituals and their purpose and her assertion that it is essential for each culture to believe that the other cultures cherish wrong-headed concepts of justice douglas 2007 p 9it is not of course my contention that school students should be introduced in science lessons to the work of sociologists like beck and douglas rather students can be introduced in the context of covid-19 to sociological ways of thinking and ways of examining data and questioning human practices such activities can help students the better to appreciate for example the enormous differences between countries in terms of how they have reacted to the pandemicdenial lockdown social distancing use of masks use of technologies for contact tracing faith in a vaccine or treatments etci have already commented how sociology overlaps with moral philosophy it also overlaps with disciplines like politics in my final section before some conclusions i examine the contributions of disciplines other than history philosophy and sociology to science education as exemplified by covid-19 though i recognise that some sociologists would include much of economics and politics within their own disciplinein schools students are often given the impression that scientific knowledge comes first in terms of temporality and is then applied to technological problems the economics behind science the politics of the societies within which science is funded and enacted and issues to do with psychology are rarely considered yet these disciplines have great influence on the science that is undertaken and then used in society ziman 2000 describes the legend as being that account of science that is entirely realist and keeps it separate from such influencesfew school students are likely to need much persuading of the relevance of economics and politics to covid-19 in terms of politics covid-19 provides an opportunity for students to consider how democratic and non-democratic governments including those in monarchies theocracies and totalitarian regimes can differ in their response to events the importance of psychology is perhaps not quite as clearthough one could try asking students why covid-19 has caused far more draconian governmental action than other viruses that are either more dangerous eg ebola sars or regularly infect huge numbers of people eg the various influenzas or to diseases such as tuberculosis mentioned above that at the time of writing kill many more people every year than covid-19 has to date students can also reflect on the diversity of opinions within countries about attempt to contain the virus fig 3 and the psychological factors that might be behind thesethe mention of economics politics and psychology raises the more general issues of interdisciplinarity back in 2013 melissa leach and ian scoones published an article with the title the social and political lives of zoonotic disease models narratives science and policy the abstract of which is worth citing in its entiretyzoonotic diseases currently pose both major health threats and complex scientific and policy challenges to which modelling is increasingly called to respond in this article we argue that the challenges are best met by combining multiple models and modelling approaches that elucidate the various epidemiological ecological and social processes at work these models should not be understood as neutral science informing policy in a linear manner but as having social and political lives social cultural and political norms and values that shape their development and which they carry and project we develop and illustrate this argument in relation to the cases of h5n1 avian influenza and ebola exploring for each the range of modelling approaches deployed and the ways they have been co-constructed with a particular politics of policy addressing the complex uncertain dynamics of zoonotic disease requires such social and political lives to be made explicit in approaches that aim at triangulation rather than integration and plural and conditional rather than singular forms of policy advice leach and scoones 2013 p 10leach and scoones provide a powerful argument for the benefit of an interdisciplinary approach in tackling zoonoses like covid-19science curricula pedagogies and assessment should not be changed in a knee-jerk reaction whenever some new science-related issue arises nevertheless science curricula perhaps especially biology ones have a history of changing appropriately in response to important science-related issues that arise in society it seems likely that covid-19 constitutes such an instancethe question then arises for those convinced as i am of the value of hps for science education as to how hps can usefully play a role i have tried to sketch out some possibilities above of course not everyone is convinced of the worth of hps in school science in such circumstances and focusing on covid-19 though the point holds more generally those of us keen to see hps playing more of a role in science education might profitably argue that the history of science the philosophy of science and the sociology of science can all help promote scientific literacy and the public understanding of biology cf reiss et al 2020covid-19 can also be presented as a socio-scientific issue in a recent article hancock et al 2019 examine how science teachers collaboratively design ssi-based curricula they note that ssi curriculum design requires careful consideration of the focal ssi to ensure that it features both social and scientific components they found that issue selection by teachers was characterised by iterative discussion in the three dimensions of leveraging existing resources mobilising passions and exploring issue relevance at present covid-19 resources are beginning to be developed and it is certainly a topic that is relevant and likely to mobilise passionsrecently journalist amanda marcotte 2020 shared a disturbing story a train engineer named eduardo moreno apparently with great deliberation derailed the freight train he was manning in southern california nearly killing occupants of three nearby cars his target the usns mercy a navy medical ship thats been assisting nearby hospitals with covid-19 patients the rationale given by the train engineer is enough to cause even the most reserved introvert to spit fire marcotte elaborates apparently moreno believes in a conspiracy theory that the coronavirus crisis is a hoax being deployed to cover for a shadowy takeover of the government will sommer 2020 reported on an illinois woman inspired by pro-trump qanon conspiracy theory videos who traveled to new york city armed with more than a dozen knives and who intended to kill former vice president joe biden she tried to get near to the us navy hospital ship comfort the hospital ship that was sent to new york city to help with the coronavirus pandemic but mistook the comfort for the uss intrepid a retired aircraft carrier like many qanon believers she had become obsessed with the comfort convinced that its being used to rescue mole children from the clutches of liberal elites who enjoy sodomizing and then cannibalizing young children some of these same conspiracy theorists believe that children are being held hostage in secret tunnels beneath city streets by liberal democrats to be used in rituals designed to conjure satan a vigilant trump was apparently onto them in a thrice and is preparing to bring the evil doers to justicesommer and marcottes reporting identifies one type of conspiracy theory-fueled insanitythat which has infected the trumpster qanon followers and those who enable them including the previously anti-vaccination crusader president donald trump but there is another type of insanity the one that attempts to separate the rich and the poor and then pretends that such a separation does not exist trump and the conspiracy theorists belong in this camp too the whistle-a-happy-tune-happy-talk-keep talkin-happy-talk cover up that paints the gross economic inequalities

regime to co-opt that technology  some of which is already in use by google for example  is very frighteningand in this toxic mix of circumstanceswhere we are saddled with a president who has claimed that a final us coronavirus death toll of approximately 100000 to 200000 people would indicate that his administration has done a very good job rupar 2020the evangelical community is putting countless numbers of people at risk by refusing to stop holding large church gatherings and refusing to cease its decades long attack on science in the usa the evangelical community has found a second-tier messiah in the person of donald trump mclaren and jandri 2020a christian nationalism in the age of trump is a religious virus that gives no respite to its hostthe commonweal and its enduring search for spiritual and material prosperity but trump is no fool when it comes to pleasing his basehe had been cannily throwing them red meat long before his run for president and as president he is well on the way to defunding planned parenthood and in the mind of many evangelicals to bringing about the biblical apocalypseapproximately 40 of american adults are biblical apocalypticists and believe that jesus will or likely will return to earth by 2050 dias 2020 from the time that the coronavirus crisis first appeared on the shores of gods favorite piece of real estate it became clear that it is comorbid with christian nationalism or to put it another way christian nationalism seems to be a co-occurring condition relative to pandemics that reach the shores of america the beautiful mclaren and jandri 2020a some religious scholars in fact are in agreement that there is a two-way relationship between religion and nationalism a mutual reification and buttressing as grzymala-busse 2019 explainsin this relationship religiosity defines the nationand nationalism reinforces religiosity leading to unusually high rates of national identification with a given religion and high rates of religiosity itself this mutual reinforcement characterizes countries where religious participation and religious nationalism are both high such as the philippines poland ireland until the late 1990s or the united states grzymala-busse 2019and while this is certainly true we cannot blur the distinction between the sacred dimension of religion and profane sphere of the political nation which remain separate even when they contradict andor reinforce each otheri would not want to make the case that christianity is equivalent to the political state in whose wheelhouse trump sits in washington when he is not bedizened in golf attire swinging the clubs at mar-a-lago but it is increasingly clear that trump has identified himself with charismatic pentecostal and evangelical christianity largely for political reasonstheir practitioners perceive him as a divine instrument of god and are prevalent in key states important for trumps reelection chances i am largely against religious states in principle and have said so when speaking in israel or pakistan or the west bank palestine i have always supported freedom of religion within a secular state apparatus open to a wide range of religious faiths and i have always defended the separation of church and state thomas jeffersons phrase in articulating my understanding of the intent and function of the establishment clause and free exercise clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution which reads congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof see mclaren and jandri 2020b ignoring the constitution those who have helped to manufacture the virus of christian nationalism boast no need of critical sobriety and less need for metropolitan intellectuals with their incessant insistence on finding new ways to clamp down on what they see as the necessary separation of church and state christian nationalism is a sickness that poisons every ethico-political reservoir of hope and possibility with a fatal hubris for decades the messages of prosperity preachers have hollowed into my mind sometimes in the form of a revolving worm announced by a roll of thundering apocalyptic prose and on other occasions like a flaming corpse decamped from the grave of undiscovered history and in my most paranoid moments they take the shape of unclean spirits shooting like roman candles from some pungent weed-strewn sepulcher right out of buffy the vampire slayeron the surface christian nationalism may seem about as dangerous as the skeletons that spring from the crypt at spook-a-rama courtesy of denos wonder wheel amusement park on coney island but that would be a serious miscalculation what cannot be denied is that christian nationalism in the age of trump and his disaster capitalism cabinet stalks the halls of the white house and the nations airwaves like marx and engels hobgoblin rudely awakened from the depths of oblivion former evangelical frank schaeffer states were at a time now when the naked lickspittle enablement of donald trump by his evangelical followers is more horrifying than ever schaeffer in boggioni 2020a he goes on to say when we come to this time of covid-19 overtaking our country a literal life and death issue we see two things very clearly one is the utter moral bankruptcy of this leader who pits himself against governors trying to save their people and the second is the utter moral bankruptcy of evangelical the white evangelical voter schaeffer in boggioni 2020aafter being placed in charge of the coronavirus crisis the first action undertaken by mike pence was to form a prayer circle with evangelical supporters later the state of oklahoma held a statewide prayer day where megachurch pastors from all over the state appeared with gov kevin stitt r-ok to try and pray away the coronavirus and of course prayer circles popped up all over the country that would not be so bad if these titans of christian power were not part of a long tradition that was infamously anti-science rational- and religious-minded citizens as well as atheists and i count myself as among the former group have no immunity to this type of siege to this type of hobbesian war of all against all we have no maid of orlans armor of god that can protect us from the battlefield tactics of idolatrous trumplar knights from this inescapably salty theology creeping up our spine like a winter chill at a nova scotian fishing village and from this widespread winnowing of reason this twitterverse phrasemongering pitched from a mar-a-lago golf course caddy shack the trump cults that operate like impassioned yet enigmatic love functionaries for jesus and the 45th president regularly hand over our future to corporations which chomsky refers to as private tyrannies falcone 2015 a measure tantamount to having a spiritual death wish that will surely lead to self-destructive turmoil if not a fate more harrowing than even end times prophets can wrench from the moribund secrets hidden within ancient scrolls discovered on episodes of the naked archeologistthe trump cult places in counterpoint the endless sweep of falsehoods about the coronavirus and the turbid unyielding faith of those who propagate such falsehoods see peters et al 2020a b while we lack at present a set of evidentiary standards for establishing the empirical existence of religious nationalism that goes beyond the invocation of religious motifs and symbols in politics grzymala-busse 2019 it seems reasonable to assert that religious nationalism is alive and well among trumps evangelical christian baseand its not pretty according to anna grzymala-busse 2019 religious nationalism especially in the christian world has shaped the very definition of legitimate citizenship delineating the nation and privileging some political actors and visions in making public policy obtaining electoral support and building statesreligion as it relates to behavior belief and belonging is extremely ramped up among evangelicals in terms of attending religious services evangelizing and taking part in communal religious activities such as bible study or prayer according to grzymala-busse 2019belief is an internalized and personal adherence to the doctrine and to the sacred the personal level and kind of faith acceptance of doctrine and relationship to the deity the sacred and religious teachings belonging or affiliation is a much weaker connection it may simply consist of self-identification or a nominal belonging to a given religiongrzymala-busse 2019 elaborates that where nationalism seeks political recognition and sovereignty for the nation religious nationalism does so for a nation first and foremost defined by religion she also points out correctly that referents of religion are the sacred and the transcendental nations are fundamentally mundane and political and i fully agree with the observation that whether religion and nation replace reconcile with or reinforce each other they are conceptually and empirically distinctadditionally i would argue that intense activities such as bible study prayer proselytizing participating in religious pilgrimages and peregrinations contributing to religious publications and attending religious performances can create the contextually specific conditions of possibility for religious nationalism once the tribal conditions in american politics are met for the creation of a patriotic protestant temperament and once trump was elected reshuffled the government and began to communicate through twitter the tribal conditions were set in place twitter for trump is equivalent to the microphone at the lectionary of a church from here he can dictate the catechism for the days events the compatibility and mutual buttressing between the secular state and the evangelical community redound to the trump administration solidifying his christian base while accentuating the chasm between the illegitimate state and the true religious calling of the country to bring freedom to all nations of the world whether this includes imposing sanctions or bombing those countries back to the stone age the hebraic idea of people enjoying a special covenant with god has had an impact on northern irish afrikaner and israeli nationalismand also on us nationalism grzymala-busse 2019 the narratives of nations as divinely chosen people have merged religious and national identities in these countries and i would say that trumps moving of the us embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem certainly has secured the gratitude of many israelis and christians who believe that this action brings the world one step closer to armageddon and the coming of the messiahfor christians this would mean that jesus would establish the kingdom of god on earth and true christians who had repented their sins would receive heaven as their reward the pandemic for some is seen as a divine reset get ready the locusts having been swarming in east africa wildfires have ravaged australia and the golden trumpet was shaken free from angel moronis hand on top of the salt lake temple during a recent earthquake dias 2020 while it might be that those totemic entities known as sports have displaced religion as the chief factor in human group relationships in the usa religion is still going strong just witness how many americans today believe in angels some reports say 8 in 10 cbs news 2011alt-right ethno-nationalist movements are identifying with nordic symbology just look at the symbols on alt-right shields during their confrontations with antifa are they seeking historical continuity with the inhabitants of ragnarok are they seeking the twilight of the gods where odin and the fenrir wolf will fight each other to the death and where loki will go against the aesir and fight heimdall to the death will tyr and the watchdog garm that guards the gates of hel kill each other stay tuned for a new season of the coronavirus dating game where participants will compete to find couples who are still alive in new york city clearly as grzymala-busse 2019 puts it religious nationalism thus reinforces popular religiosityand that religiosity becomes a marker of who belongs to the nation and who is a true member of the national community this statement could not be more apposite than in the usa today given the anti-muslim policies of trump and the hostility toward migrants immigrants and those seeking refugee status as a result of experiencing persecution in their own countriesand of course there are other attitudes that accompany religious nationalism that are associated with cultural homogeneity and the preservation of national traditions these include natalism redistribution to members of the religious nation the preservation of national religious symbols and traditions grzymala-busse 2019 in contrast religious nationalism holds little affinity for increased diversity or change in national composition grzymala-busse 2019 religious nationalism thus correlates with high levels of hostility toward immigrants and other new groups that dilute the existing national identity grzymala-busse 2019 and of course there is an antipathy toward stem cell research abortion rights same-sex marriage divorce and other issues that are related to public policyconflicts between secular and religious authorities reinforce old borders as well as breed new borders and borders are prone to propagating violence give me a border and i will show you an enemy some evangelical christians who argue that christianity is under attack in the usa have motivated christian militias to prepare for a holy war against the deep state religion and nation god-talk and nation-talk all those contentious and toxic analogues tend over time to genuflect toward conflictif not outright violence that is the nature of this virus is it any wonder that the nrx movement refers to trump as the god-emperor who has the power and will to restore order to an immigrant-flooded nation under the thumb of a progressive media-academic complex  global jewry in neo-nazi-speak obrien 2020 obrien writes thatthe neoreactionary movement also known as nrx or dark enlightenment is a geeky subset of the racist misogynistic far-right that has festered in silicon valleys libertarian circles for over a decade especially within the cryptocurrency community its members revere peter thiel microdose lsd and gussy up totalitarian ideas with a pseudo-intellectualism that creates a moral pretext for them to undermine  engineer they might say  democracy obrien 2020and to say that christian nationalism i would link this to the prosperity gospel ideology which is deeply imbricated in the logic of capitalism that is the ruling ideas which marx argued are inextricably braided to the ideas of the ruling class is plague-infested would be an insult to the power of the plague if the prosperity preachers are wincing from criticisms by fellow evangelicals they certainly know how to hide it as they continue to double down on their convictions their embrace of trumpwho before his presidency rarely ventured into spiritually loaded territoryhas been widely documented and commentaries that have offloaded scathing criticism are not difficult to find the evangelical community continues to preen itself as the spokesperson for the correct trajectory of todays political christianity and in doing so has proclaimed donald trump as the new christian messiah mclaren and jandri 2020a weve all seen their performances on television or in personthe flair the fanfare the bargain basement pageantry and the carnivalesque world of sensations have you ever seen a video of paula white speaking in tongues just watch some old reruns of robert tiltons show success-n-life and you might see where she got some of her tongue-twisting blubbering personally i prefer tiltons haut

there bobby lee and howdy jimbo have you tried jim bakkers silver sol liquid that he says can diagnose or cure coronavirus illness you know covid-19 its been effective against sars and hiv wiped them right outyes this type of religiously tainted ideological muck is suffused all around us a chuck e cheese attempt at creating a rarified air of sanctity a pantheon of kitsch religious props and an obsessive overlighting of the preacher on center stage clog dancing to the delicate harmony of a cheyenne frontier days tie-down rodeo act the whacky outpourings of the preacher declaimed before a wildly effusive live audience are often compelling in their allusive religiosity and emotional spiritualitythank you jesus praise godyet devastating in their theological barrenness pushing scripture beyond its semantic and semiotic limits betty put down that textbook on evolution ive been telling you since you were in kindergarten that human beings co-existed with dinosaurs and maybe even tamed some of the smaller ones and kept them as pets didnt you watch the flintstones when you were growing up noyou were too busy watching that communist mr rogers a splashy aestheticism stands in for what we might hope to be the sepulchral depths of an impassioned religious celebration preaching while enthralled with the sensation of being enthralledit all boils down to thiswe might profitably entertain this preponderance of delusion by asking the following questions could this spectacle be traced to the hebraic idea of the covenant which is revealed in the narratives of nations as divinely chosen people could it be tied historically to the advent of confessionalization or the protestant reformation see grzymala-busse 2019 could this type of spectacle be a twentieth-century remnant of biblical literalism or the detritus of an arch monasticism so spiritually claustrophobic that it finally led to a mass exodus to the cities could religious hysteria have slowly trickled down through the ages only to be rekindled in big tent revivalism and the eventual appearance of the praise-be-to-god-amening-hallelujahing grahams falwells robertsons swaggarts whites tiltons bakkers and others of this grandstanding self-serving ilk could it be that god is having a kayleigh mcenany-type meltdown or can the spectacle be traced to something more recent a sloppy metaphysics spun from the lecture halls of liberty university perhaps an overweening estimation of the power of suggestion an increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex that can be correlated with inclinations toward social justice christian morality aristotelian ethics and liberation theology as opposed to those with increased gray matter volume in the amygdala which is part of the limbic system concerned with emotions that could be associated with alt-right adjacent evangelical christianity and political conservatism could it be the rise of radio shock jocks such as rush limbaugh whom president trump honored with the presidential medal of freedomindeed the pathological logic and demonic invective of rightwing broadcasters like rush limbaugh could be a contributing factor to the madness that surrounds us see mclaren and jandri 2020b dont you feel falwell must be one of limbaughs dittoheads cant you just picture jerry falwell jr in miami his scarf billowing in the night air as he drives his convertible into the parking lot of his favorite dance club listening to rush on the radio or simply put is the lock-step attachment of evangelicals to trump more of a case of just plain hypocrisy on the part of the contemporary evangelical leadership surely there is much more to the story and there is benjamin e park 2018 writes that during times of national or international crisis the power of religious rhetoric is a force that can always be counted on historically to focus on and reinvigorate the idea of american nationalism and in recent years its singular purpose has been to connect christianity with the republican party which can be seen in the moral majoritys ascension to the national stage in the 1980s and its connection to ronald reagan and the republican party park 2018but we can see explicit religiosity and conservatism reaching back even earlier to the framers of americas federal government though the framers of americas federal government sought a distinction between denominational influence and state powerso much so that evangelical observers critiqued the constitution as a godless documentpartisans quickly capitalized on the power of religious rhetoric in political debates park 2018 in the age of revolutions which included both the french revolution and the american revolution key figures turned to biblical figures for inspiration according to park 2018 french philosopher jean-jacques rousseau for instance looked to moses as the premier example for turning a national body into a political body that lived together with stability and peace in germany friedrich schlegel argued for a symbiotic relationship between religion and politics park 2018the french revolution caused american leaders to become concerned about the violence into which france descended promoting competing theologies of national belonging park 2018 and causing some politicians to rationalize french anarchy and violence as a result of a lack of religious devotion among its citizens the french revolution influenced americas concept of exceptionalism and placed christianity at the center of the idea of patriotism park 2018 there was fear that the french revolution was a threat to christianity globally and the influence of writers such as thomas paine became a concern of major significance since he was in favor of banishing religion from society and embracing secularism in its stead and embracing the enlightenment commitment to universal rationalism as a challenge to religious authority and authoritarianism consequently park 2018 writes that in a world of growing secularism the united states is presented as a last refuge for explicit christian devotion and in recent times burgeoning religious nationalism has even made possible one of the unlikeliest of alliances the loyalty between evangelical ministers and donald trumpthe ideological hieroglyphics directing trumps thinking are not hard decipher as bob cesca makes clear when he writesduring a presidency thats beyond satire no one really anticipated that trumps red hat militia would end up being a death cult but here we are the cults warped calculus is basically this trump will only be re-elected with a prospering economy but if covid-19 decimates the economy trump could lose so we have to save the economy literally at any cost even if it means we have to sacrifice older americans who typically vote republican cesca 2020trumps evangelical base seems to be adhering to their masters logic and besides kathaleen wall a member of the texas state republican executive committee and a candidate for texas 22nd congressional district is euphoric that the coronavirus has a silver lining its going to save more people than it kills this weekbecause abortion clinics in the state of texas have been closed chapman 2020a i am certain most of trumps salvation corps would agree the evangelical communitywho are less likely to be seen wearing a protective mask while shopping at the local piggly wiggly than their scientifically minded atheist brethrenhas received an upsurge of attention during the coronavirus crisisjournalist catherine stewart disagrees that christian nationalism is equivalent to a religion since she notes the positive things many evangelicals and other christians are doing with respect to the coronavirus crisis she prefers to view christian nationalism as a political ideology that cloaks itself in religious rhetoric and as a political movement that put trump in power cited in chapman 2020b she writes the movement promotes an anti-science culture  that has obviously contributed to our inability collectively to address this crisis in an evidence-based fashion misinformation is rife in those hyper-conservative and highly politicized religious communities that were all in for trump chapman 2020btrump has boasted about his effectiveness in mobilizing the country against the coronavirus crisis but amanda terkel has shown the extent to which trump downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus when it first showed up in the usa this timeline is worth quoting in fullon feb 10 he repeatedly predicted  at a meeting with governors at a campaign rally and in a fox business interview  that the coronavirus would no longer be a problem by april he then made this claim at least three more times a few days laternow the virus that were talking about having to do  you know a lot of people think that goes away in april with the heat  as the heat comes in typically that will go away in april were in great shape though we have 12 cases  11 cases and many of them are in good shape now feb 10looks like by april you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away feb 10i really believe they are going to have it under control fairly soon you know in april supposedly it dies with the hotter weather and thats a beautiful date to look forward to feb 10we think and we hope based on all signs that the problem goes away in april feb 13theres a theory that in april when it gets warm  historically that has been able to kill the virus so we dont know yet were not sure yet feb 14i think its going to work out fine i think when we get into april in the warmer weather that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus feb 14on feb 10 there were 12 confirmed cases of covid-19 the illness caused by the coronavirus in the united states according to johns hopkins university now there are nearly 200000 and on tuesday the death toll in the us surpassed 3000 making the virus more deadly than the 911 terrorist attacks that reshaped much of american life who knows how many people will have died as the result of the coronavirus by the time this article sees print terkel 2020trump has referred to the covid-19 as the corona flu minimizing its potential to wreak lethal havoc on the us population geriatric populations especially are at major risk mike davis 2020 reports that the death rate among those over 65 is 23 in italy and 18 in britain because of the shortage or unavailability of test kits containment in the usa is virtually impossible and without testing it is difficult to ascertain the size of the infected population davis 2020 reminds us that this virus is mutating as it courses through populations with different age compositions and acquired immunities davis 2020 also points out that even if the virus remains stable and little mutated its impact on under-65 age cohorts can differ radically in poor countries and amongst high poverty groups davis admonishes journalists and western governments for egregiously ignoring the threat of the coronavirus to the global poor he warns us that the only certainty is that rich countries and rich classes will focus on saving themselves to the exclusion of international solidarity and medical aid walls not vaccines could there be a more evil template for the futurethe usa was woefully unprepared for previous flu seasons and its hospitals were unable to cope with those who became stricken as a result of profit-driven cutbacks of in-patient capacity which resulted in a shortage of medical supplies and hospital bed availability davis notes 2020 that er conditions in such institutions are already unable to cope with seasonal infections so how will they cope with an imminent overload of critical cases already 380000 nursing home patients die every year from facilities neglect of basic infection control procedures nursing homes are very likely to become coronavirus hotspots davis 2020 underscores the unwillingness of big pharma to participate in the development of new antibiotics and antivirals remarking that of the 18 largest pharmaceutical companies 15 have totally abandoned the field they are more interested in producing profits by churning out tranquilizers pain killers and viagra davis warns that as the antibiotic revolution is rolled back old diseases will reappear alongside novel infections and hospitals will become charnel housesthe role of the big lie in germanys wwii persecution of the jews is often attributed to goebbels and the nazis and was used to push long-standing anti-semitism into the unholy precinct of torture medical mutilation and mass executions jennifer rubin cited in burris 2020a condemns fox news for spreading what amounts to the big lie with respect to appropriate ways of reacting to the coronavirus she writesin short fox news  its anchors its contributors its panelists and its guests eg republican elected officials  have spread provably wrong information to its viewers on arguably the most important story in our lifetimes said rubin a large percentage of americans who form the trump cult and absorb his misleading information its like the flu plenty of tests get their misinformation reinforced by an outlet that seeks as its main goal to support the president rubin in burris 2020aclearly trump is no 1950s commando cody-type hero when it comes to a national crisis commando cody defended us from the radar men from the moon trump cannot make enough test kits available for the american public in fact he has clearly exacerbated the crisis by dint of his initial cavalier attitude toward it and yet even the medical experts have waffled on exactly how to fight the virus at first they said that americans do not need to wear masks then they changed their minds kenen and roubein 2020 report the agency said the virus spread through droplets from coughs and sneezes  but then warned about catching it from people with no symptoms or even from surfaces like subway turnstiles or metal shopping carts it said young people are at low risk  but the hospital beds and morgues of new york called that into question and while confusion has reigned supreme among the trump administration including its medical teams what is very clear is that the country should be practicing social distancing and residents should remain in their homes unless they are part of essential services to the communitymany trump supporters however are flagrantly disregarding the advice of medical experts since they want to show their loyalty to trump by downplaying the crisis hey let us go to the beach today honey its a nice sunny day thanks to the slavish veneration that they afford their man-child master in his war against america trumps cult followers are more receptive to the idea that the coronavirus should be called the china virus hey let us make the virus the fault of china to deflect blame away from trumps ineptitude in handling the crisis the alt-right and ethno-nationalist movements are going to be inundated with new applications for membership as a result of trumps racist dog whistle and all of this is occurring when the number of deaths in the usa has exceeded the us death toll during its invasion of vietnam when us lawmakers are cashing in on millions of stock transactions when school districts across the country are preparing to lay off 300000 teachers and when gun-toting michigan protestors pack into the statehouse calling for the governor to be hanged because of her stay-at-home law and lets not forget the stream of vile comments made by politicians who think its a fair trade-off to let the elderly and infirm die in order to preserve the economy dont they realize that the coronavirus also kills children take for example comments made by the repugnant antioch planning commission chairman ken turnage ii who felt compelled to compare the corona virus to a forest fire that burnsold trees fallen brush and scrub-shrub sucklings that drain resources adding that society will strengthen when the pandemic is all settled we would have significant loss of life we would lose many elderly that would reduce burdens in our defunct social security system health care cost once the wave subsided make jobs available for others and it would also free up housing in which we are in dire need of turnage wrote in the post that has since been deleted we would lose a large portion of the people with immune and other health complications i know it would be loved ones as well but that would once again reduce our impact on medical jobs and housing prieve 2020these comments made all the more chilling as they appear delivered in a dispassionate pragmatic and businesslike manner echo aktion t4 the program for involuntary euthanasia in nazi germany a project of mass murder that took the lives of approximately 300000 people between 1939 and 1945 the program was based on eugenics theory racial hygiene and budgetary concerns certain people were selected as lebensunwertes leben unworthy of life or useless eaters and were killed by lethal injection gas or other means that we have politicians that would so easily condemn americas useless eaters to a suffocating death should serve as a warning that the unthinkable could happen again and this time in a country that brags about its concern for human rightsthe herd immunity argument is similar judith butler writesbecause the vulnerable are not deemed productive in the new quasi-aryan community they are not valued lives and if they die that is apparently acceptable since they are not imagined as productive workers but drains on the economy although the herd immunity argument may not make this claim explicitly it is there cited in yancy 2020well i hope burning away the rotting old brush is worth it to mr ken turnage ii maybe he can make another killing on estate auctionscharles sykes 2020 reports that feckless and fancy-free evangelical jerry falwell jrwho is as subtle about his adoration of trump as the hair and mustache dye on mypillow ceo mike lindellhas held in flagrant disregard the health of his students at his liberty university and by extension the health of all those with whom his students will come into physical contact falwell who has maintained that the coronavirus was a plot to hurt trump and hinted that it could be a bioweapon created by north korea or china to attack the usa has acted recklessly and irresponsibly despite the escalating coronavirus pandemic several thousands of students and professors returned to liberty universitys main campus while the rest of the nations campuses were locked downfalwell who is the president of the conservative christian school defending his decision by insisting that 99 percent of students are not at the age to be at risk and they dont have conditions that put them at risk that of course is factually untrue young people are not immune indeed last week the centers for disease control and prevention said more than a third of us patients ill enough to be hospitalized were ages 20 to 54 and of course even young people who do not become seriously sick can pass the disease to others sykes 2020 see palma 2020asv date 2020 reports that trump has been trying to convince the american people that he has been a great wartime president who has done a miraculous job in protecting the country from the coronavirus having sold himself as a great business and military leader despite bankrupt casinos and bone spurs president donald trump faces his greatest challenge yet making americans forget the two months he dismissed concerns about a deadly pandemic as a hoax at the time of this writing trumps approval ratings are increasing demonstrating yet again that the american public have fallen victim to the swarmy cult of trump trumps evangelical followers can continue to bask in his carnivorous gloryan immediate challenge to be reckoned with is the idea that the coronavirus can be cured by prayer or by being implored by a preacher to touch the television screen very likely close to the commercial break sky palma writesone of those people is evangelist kenneth copelandwho visited the white house in 2018 for a dinner trump held with a group of evangelical leaders earlier this month copeland went viral for a segment he did on this victory network channel where he asked his viewers to put their hands on their tv screens in order to receive gods divine protection against the coronavirus put your hand on that television set copeland said hallelujah thank you lord jesus he received your healing now say it i take it i have it its mine i thank you and praise you for it palma 2020bwhen the catholic church is searching for a miracle to prove sainthood it is well understood that finding such proof can take years even decades of careful investigation including scientific investigation do we really expect those desperate for a cure for say liver disease to find the holy spirit cascading through the neon xenon and argon gases that have miraculously combined into the phosphor gas that makes up the cells of their flat screen television set or by making such a statement am i admitting to an egregious lack of faith will my television set suddenly turn on by itself in the middle of the night with an urgent message from john the baptist that the second coming is now in progresssince it is unlikely that those pastors under 60 have ever frequented pavilions for pulmonary patients my father died slowly and painfully of emphysema and hacking coughs and mounds of bloody mucous were a steady fixture of my childhood and adolescence they may feel that they have been granted divine immunity by the holy spirit or should they contract the disease and survive they can then make the boastful claim that their daily baptism in the word of god protected them from a painful death by calling for church services to continue they willingly subject themselves and the hundreds or thousands who pack their churches to the virus and this is true even if they hold their church services outdoors do pastors think outdoor winds do not carry christian spittle even if that spittle is born againreverend tony spell who defied an order from louisiana governor john bel edwards against large gatherings in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak because the good reverend spell believes the handling of the coronavirus pandemic is politically motivated was charged on six misdemeanor counts for his actions but hallelujah he is going to be advised in court by alabamas infamous judge roy moore even though moore is not licensed to practice law in louisiana moore believes that charging rev spell is a violation of the acknowledgment that god is sovereign in america gstalter 2020 and even though he has been charged reverend spell is back at it again intent on holding more services at his life tabernacle megachurch in baton rouge with the justification that jesus is a physicianpeoples hope is in the house of godif they do contract the virus if they have fears of the virus the church is more essential now than ever to pray with people to let them know there is a physician in jesus christ he is the healer come under you all that are weary and heavy-laden let me give you rest we were supposed to be at a million and a half body bags and were at 4800 so the narrative is false spell in boggioni 2020breverend spell claims to believe the science surrounding covid-19 but then argues astonishingly that because he heard that some people are infected with the virus and recover without even being aware they had the virus this somehow justifies putting his parishioners and those with whom they may come into contact at serious risk for the good reverend spiritual healing supersedes medical safety precautions he also claims that his services are preventing incidents of domestic violence suicide and starvation spell in boggioni 2020b in fact rev death wish let-me-be-remembered-as-a-martyr-spell is advocating religious fanaticism calling for christians literally to die from the coronavirus in the name of religious freedom he proclaimed that those who prefer tyranny over freedom do not deserve freedom he also said that the bible teaches us to be absent from our bodies so we can be present with the lord  so like any revolutionary or like any zealot or like any pure religious person death looks to them like a welcomed friend palma 2020c does this sound to you a bit like a christianized version of the heavens gate cult whose leaders preached that suicide would allow them to exit their bodily containers in order to enter an alien spacecraft hidden behind the hale-bopp comet a nightmare scenario aaron bundy joins rev spell in a waco-like standoff this is an attack of the branch covidians other megachurch pastors are intent on flouting social distancing guidelines during palm sunday and easter kelly burton a pastor at lone star baptist church in lone star texas wrote satans trying to keep us apart hes trying to keep us from worshipping together but were not going to let him win barone 2020 fundamentalist christians as a spiritual tribe frequently rally around the idea that they are being persecuted remember how indignant christian evangelicals felt about being persecuted by the vile evil satanic greeting of happy holidays because they felt it was an attack on merry christmas and christianity in general fox news played this persecution to the hilt trump bragged to a conservative student group turning point usa that he had given the right to speak the words merry christmas back to americans after it was falsely claimed that the white houses national christmas tree was renamed the holiday tree under president obama does anyone remember when in 2003 france criticized the us plan to invade iraq and elected officials in the us house of representatives decided to rename french fries freedom fries fortunately im not ancient enough to recall when during world war i sauerkraut was renamed liberty cabbage and german measles became known as liberty measlesif evangelical christians want to understand religious persecution in a more serious vein they can certainly find valid examples of the persecution of christianswhere those faithful to their beliefs have been exiled or tortured or burned alive at the stake but the idea that christians are being persecuted for having to hold their church services onlineas most college professors have been required to do with teaching their classes during this pandemicis stretching the notion of persecution to absurd proportions mclaren 2020 but this christian persecution complex does serve a purpose evangelical congregations can now identify as martyrswith those christians thrown to the lions in ancient rome by emperor nero but seriously we are talking here about throwing christians to their laptops so that they are forced to watch their pastors speak in tongues on their computer screens how traumatizing is that have the faithful forgotten that you can now be healed by touching a tv screen while a church service is in progress and im sure god would not discriminate against computer screens just ask evangelical preacher kenneth copeland havent these evangelicals heard of cybertemples and churches and online prayer chapels in networked environments that can be customized to any religious belief system yes be wary of technology but do not be too fearful that watching a church service in lieu of the real thing is the digital equivalent to being a loser is there anything worse in trumpworld than not winning the public release of the apple iphone was regarded as the jesus phone when it first came out in 2007 and then for those with more conservative inclinations there is the flip-phone sometimes called the kosher phone that has no internet to tempt the user into entering the world of sinthe original model being the lg vx5500 which was released in 2008ammon bundy of the malheur militia who once led an armed takeover of a wildlife refuge in oregon has encouraged idaho residents to defy the social distancing orders at a public meeting he told the audience that the coronavirus is a relatively low-risk situation and added that if nine out of 10 people were dying it still does not justify the taking of rights humphrey 2020 bundy warned that he was willing to use weapons to defend the rights of businesses to remain open during the pandemic humphrey 2020 and you can be sure that white supremacist militia members all over the country are all on board with this sentiment perhaps they frequent the same shooting ranges as their fellow evangelicals where they can share information on the best firearms to have during a pandemic hey you rookies avoid the five-shot snub-nose j-frame revolvers they have heavier trigger pulls and a shorter sight radius and lack the accuracy of revolvers with larger frames get your asses in gear on this okay pandemic preppers arm up already lawmakers in michigan are wearing bulletproof vests to the statehouse to protect themselves from duck dynasty lookalikes carrying assault rifles youve got them running scared bobby lee ever since you were knee-high to a grasshopper ive been telling you that the day will come when you need to soak the flag of freedom in the blood of tyrants hey bubba why not use your 1200 cash payment to invest in an ar-15 with a scope in the meantime most of the money in the governments economic stabilization plan will be used by the federal reserve to buy up us treasury and other bonds in order to prevent a collapse of the international financial system and they will be lending money directly to corporationsa frightening prospectbut of course all of this drama around putting people at risk of the coronavirus is supposedly for the benefit of the younger generation who will otherwise die and according to trump many will die of suicide should the economy collapse besides its a chance to show that born again christians are not wimps trump has now tacked to the left in so far as stressing the deadly seriousness of the virus yet immediately afterwards he tacked to the right again by saying that we need to open the country up again for business some people are questioning if trump has business ties to the drug hydroxychloroquine or if hes onto something that has escaped the attention of the medical establishment after all hes a billionaire and in his own words a stable geniusperhaps trump would be willing to attend a service at the river church in tampa where as burris 2020b notes pastor rodney howard-browne has denounced social distancing claiming that he can cure the coronavirus just like he did with the zika virus which still exists howard-browne promised his flock that he would never close the church regardless of what scientists and doctors say burris 2020b howard-browne is insistent that he has a cure for the covid-19we are not stopping anything ive got news for you this church will never close the only time the church will close is when the rapture is taking place we brought in 13 machines that basically kill every virus in the place and uh if somebody walks through the door its like it kills everything on them if they sneeze it shoots it down at like 100 mph itll neutralize it in split seconds we have the most sterile building in i dont know all of america burris 2020bamen so let me ask this if the evangelical leaders are so sure that their faith will protect them will they volunteer to be the last ones to receive the vaccine when it is availableif we learn one thing from this pandemic it is that the us health care system ripped to shreds by tax breaks for the rich privatization austerity capitalism and the rise of the gig economy needs to be replaced by socialized medicine the whole country needs socialismand if people cannot see this then it just shows how powerful a hegemon the media industrial complex is as it continues to create the necessary illusions that so far have worked effectively in keeping the american people from mounting a popular ground-level challenge to the overall capitalist system here the media serve as a self-replicating filibustering mechanism that keeps the public in a state of endless debate over whether or not there are viable alternatives to the current capitalist system creating a pendulum of inertia at both ends of the argument it appears that many christian nationalists formulate the pandemic in a way that metaphysically juxtaposes nature to history producing a manichean duality of good versus evil a social universe overpopulated by metaphysical reflections of a mystified world they understand the pandemic not as historically mediated by circumstances engendered in a world that is both real and law-governedie as in the chronic tendency of capitalism toward overproductionand that can be explained dialectical analysis but as trapped within a chamber pot history in which the laws of nature remain static timeless and stagnant in this way the virus can be interpreted as an indication of gods wrath against those who support abortion or who are homosexual and those in the deep state who are working to undermine trump and setting up cannibal-pedophile rings underneath dingy strip mall pizza jointsan attachment to this type of paranoid ideology clearly is preventing evangelical christians from understanding the virus in an historical and materialist mannerfrom the vantage point of a deep realismand thus promoting relief from spiritual constipation does not the basis of the spiritual reside in the materialin flesh blood and brain im not taking a physicalist position heresince i think it is very likely that consciousness exists beyond the material and is mediated that is refracted not reflected in along and through the brain what i am saying is that evangelicals appear in many cases to have adopted a creed of thought that antiseptically separates the general from the particular and the universal from the specific and conceives of dichotomies ie fact versus value from an abstract and metaphysical perspective but binary oppositionslet us say male and female black and white and up and downare not oppositions only in a metaphysical or idealistic sense but in the real world of scarcity they exist as distinctions trapped within dependent hierarchies capitalism constrains labor whiteness constrains blackness maleness constrains femaleness and so onvia capitalisms institutionalized structures and their normalizing functions attached to racism sexism division of labor judicial system etc we must wake up to the fact that we make ourselves our self and social formation in accordance with wider laws of nature and in so doing we are dependent upon laws of necessityexternal nature imposes necessity upon human beings but there is after all absolute necessity and contingent necessity necessity is absolute only in relation to the needs of society which are historically specific we live in a capitalist society and we necessarily have to sell our labor power for a wage unless we own the means of production in other words needs are contextually specific they are contingent upon the situation at hand ie mode of production geopolitics existential challenges so that contingency and necessity have to be understood dialectically not as eitheror but as bothand all things are relative to the necessity that produces them yet evangelical preachers declaim messianically that humankind is universally born of the spirit and propagate the falsehood that contingent phenomena such as the coronavirus are in reality divine plagues cast upon humankind for the sin of homosexuality abortion fornication political correctness and multiculturalism in this way for evangelicals faith in the transcendent supernatural power of jesus must supersede science humans are perceived as powerless if they decline to pray to the god of prosperity here science is glibly supplanted by a metaphysical abstraction but prayer should not be done in the spirit of helplessness we cannot pray and then abdicate our responsibility for achieving what we are praying for because we are denying the difficult work ahead in saving the country from covid-19prayer can serve as a smokescreen that hides the class struggle and the socialist structures that are necessary to create a world prepared for disasters such as the coronavirus pandemic i am not denigrating the power of prayer here since i endorse the following statements of the galileo commissionno human intellectual activity including science can escape the fact that it has to make assumptions that cannot be proven using its own methodology ie absolute presuppositionsthe prevalent underlying assumptions or world model of the majority of modern scientists are narrowly naturalist in metaphysics materialist in ontology and reductionist-empiricist in methodologythis results in the belief that consciousness is nothing but a consequence of complex arrangement of matter or an emergent phenomenon of brain activitythis belief is neither proven nor warrantedin fact there are well-documented empirical phenomena that contradict this belief galileo commission 2020this is not an argument against materialism as a bona fide teslified ecopedagogicalized social scientist i rely on materialist analysis but i can affirm that there are reasons to move beyond materialist explanations for understanding and appreciating certain phenomena this is not prophecy television gobbledygook speech i remain committed to an historical materialist analysis of capitalism and still at the same time consider it possible that prayer may have some effects that cannot be explained by traditional paradigms of science see mclaren and jandri 2020b but during a pandemic prayer should not be a substitute for medical research and prayer circles cannot replace medical treatment and religious bullshit cannot take the place of rational adjudication and dialectical reasoningpaula jerry and franklin are you listening you might want to order some books on liberation theology or join a paulo freire or thomas merton reading group im sure they will encourage you to pull up a chair attend a sunday service by dr william j barber ii co-chair of the poor peoples campaign you can still accept jesus as your lord and savior without at the same time blaming the filthy commies from waging a war against christianity through their advocacy of multiculturalism feminism lgbtq rights bilingual education and democratic socialism well the list goes on liberation theology advocates a preferential option for the poor and its exponents and practitioners have stood beside peasant resistance movements in latin america even as us trained and sponsored death squads of the salvadorean military and police forces assassinated many of their leaders including six jesuits their housekeeper and her daughter in 1979 in their residence on the campus of the jesuit central american university uca in san salvador el salvador the death squads also participated in the assassination of archbishop scar arnulfo romero the voice of those without voice who was gunned down saying mass at hospital de la divina providencia a catholic hospital specializing in oncology and care for the terminally ill liberation theology has learned from the writings of karl marx without abandoning the teachings of jesus teachings which condemn differentiating wealththe egregious reality that some people are rich at the expense of others who are poor you can learn too check your local library better still visit some base communities in america latinait is a well-known story disease epidemics by their nature sweep through countries exposing underlying weaknesses and vulnerabilities and in the process eventually revealing inequalities in access to healthcare and means of protection our challenge in african countries with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is how to change these threats into opportunities so that we could be better prepared to manage our response to this pandemic and also to prepare for the next and possibly worse infectious disease pandemic a colleague with experience from the 20142015 ebola epidemic in west africa advised us to make the most of the calm before the storm the period between the early cases and widespread community transmission to get health staff informed and skilled to run drills and practical training to organise health facilities to improve patient flow to explore strategic approaches that describe clear roles tasks and communications and to develop ways of supporting each other when things get worse johnson o 2020 personal communication 04 april 2020the epidemic has evolved from those who could afford to travel and brought the infection from distant lands to local transmission through social work and other networks it will initially spread through urban areas and to areas of high population density and will impact the poor and less privileged the most the purpose of publishing special reports in the african journal of primary health care and family medicine is to share examples of preparedness and lessons already learnt from the covid-19 pandemic we would like to know how we can become better in coping with the crisis having stopped to take a breath how can we re-frame the future so that it is more compassionate more respectful of diversity and inclusive of all sectors of societieswe need to share ideas on how to maintain critical health services during this emerging crisis especially in areas where there is lockdown to avoid longer term consequences primary care services play an important role in this regard and must be part of the strategic emergency response we can learn from previous epidemics in african countries the decrease in utilisation of healthcare services during the 20142015 ebola outbreak in sierra leone was estimated to cause 2800 excess deaths from malaria human immunodeficiency virus hiv and tuberculosis tb nearly three quarters as many as the direct ebola deaths in the country declines in utilisation of family planning antenatal care facility delivery and postnatal care services were estimated to translate to 3600 additional maternal neonatal and stillbirth deaths mandatory curfews border closures disruption of transport and fear of exposure to infection led to a decline in the numbers of people seeking healthcare clinic closures and interruption of routine health services such as hiv and tb treatment childhood vaccinations and maternity care had long-term consequences on the health of communities12although we tend to think of cholera in terms of outbreaks it is endemic in 47 countries of sub-saharan africa ssa between 2000 and 2015 83 of 63 658 deaths from cholera reported to the world health organization occurred in ssa3 mapping of incidence of cases during spikes in incidence outbreaks allows for identification of hotspots areas of high-risk populations which could be targeted for intensive interventions to control outbreaks and prevent further transmission34 the approach to hotspots could be used in covid-19 outbreak control also and is underway in south africa at present using community health workers to screen people in households for symptoms an intervention common to both diseases is the promotion of handwashing therefore ensuring that soap and water are provided to communities is essential the second best strategy for those who are unable to get to a facility to wash their hands is that hand sanitiser with at least 60 alcohol also needs to be provided the most vulnerable to both diseases are those who live in overcrowded accommodation sharing toilets with large numbers during cholera outbreaks in zambia and zimbabwe donations of soap and water supplies were often provided by civil society organisations religious institutions and non-governmental organisations ngos along with health education on the importance of handwashing engagement of such organisations is essential for covid-19 also during the response to the devastation caused by cyclone idai civil society and community organisations coordinated the response in an efficient and timely manner they provided transport collected materials needed identified those who needed support the most and distributed food packages medications and equipment in high-income countries volunteer support for health staff has been notable including providing emotional and material support for critical care workersa targeted hotspot approach may work as an alternative to total lockdown once community transmission has become established but relies on very good information systems linking laboratories with action groups and rapid response teams transparency of data on case-finding and contact tracing when vaccinations became available for cholera identifying hotspots was crucial as a way of targeting areas of greatest ability to benefit4 inevitably there will not be sufficient vaccine supplies for covid-19 when they are cleared for general use targeting hotspots will ensure that covid-19 vaccines are used for the most vulnerable and those with best ability to benefit rather than general disseminationthis is a pandemic that has been unfolding rapidly with the internet buzzing with new information sharing protocols guidelines research articles ideas and examples as well as some fake news we can learn from the experiences of those who faced these challenges before us diaspora doctors in britain and the united states of america are sharing their workplace experiences in critical care with their counterparts in district hospitals in zimbabwe non-medical journals have carried stories about whether giving oxygen only is as good as putting patients on ventilators some of us have learnt for the first time about proning and the benefits of this for patients in respiratory distress the preoccupation with critical care has been a natural progression in understanding why the aim of prevention is to keep total numbers down so that we have fewer seriously sick patients in hospitals needing critical care 5 of those infected otherwise we would be fine with having a mild infection with a few days of illness sadly about 1  4 of those who get this infection will die from it these will not all be elderly or those with comorbiditieslockdown is easier for people who live in houses with big gardens it is harder for those who live in crowded homes sharing their living spaces and toilets with others if they are not at work or at the shops they will be sitting outside rarely alone there has been frustration with people who seem to ignore the calls to stay at home and for social distancing as though they do not appreciate the seriousness of this disease the sad truth is that for many in our communities they know that if they or their family members get seriously ill they will die even before covid-19 going into hospital with a serious problem getting critical care was out of reach and unaffordable some have accessed funding for medications from family members abroad through remittances the majority do the best they can so covid-19 is no different for them they need to earn money through vending or small jobs and then to join the queue to buy basics for the day to feed the family they are very aware that they are more likely to die of high blood pressure or diabetes than covid-19 some feel they are more likely to die of hunger these needs are much more real to them than talk about ventilators and oxygen concentrators most governments do not pay social benefits or provide food parcels unless campaigning for an election most governments do not consult communities on how they would like to respond to crises like covid-19there are stories of initiatives and innovations that groups all over africa are exploring in how to transform this crisis into something radical sustainable and will endure we must share them and learn from themthe recent outbreaks of epidemic diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars swine-origin influenza a h1n1 and the possibility of airborne pathogen transmission have garnered both social and scientific attention lee et al 2003 smith et al 2009 tellier 2009 numerous methods to control transmission and subsequent outbreaks have been suggested including the use of thermal energy jung et al 2009a jung et al 2009b ultraviolet irradiation lin and li 2002 peccia and hernandez 2004 air filtration pyankov et al 2008 yoon et al 2008 and other treatments feng et al 2000 hwang et al 2010the use of antimicrobial nanoparticles has also shown considerable promise ji et al 2007 kim et al 2007 pal et al 2007 due to their high surface area-to-volume ratios compared with their bulk counterparts their unique physical and chemical properties and their applicability in a wide variety of fields vallejos et al 2012 silver ag nanoparticles boast a broad antimicrobial spectrum panek et al 2009 shrivastava et al 2007 and have shown greater antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi than copper cu ruparelia chatterjee duttagupta  mukherji 2008 or titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles yun bae lee ji  kim 2009 the antimicrobial efficacy of ag nanoparticles depends on the size shape and concentration of particles and exposure time ji et al 2007 jung et al 2011a lee and lee 2006 lee et al 2010 as a result ag nanoparticles have been extensively studied with regard to indoor air quality and public human health the airborne dispersion of ag nanoparticles is an effective means of air purification ji et al 2007 jung et al 2011a and coating surgical masks with nanoparticles improves the bactericidal performance of the masks li leung yao song  newton 2006 ag nanoparticle-coated activated carbon filters exhibit both effective gas adsorption and antimicrobial activity yoon et al 2008recently antimicrobial treatments using natural plant products have been studied as a means of improving indoor air quality pyankov et al 2008 these natural products nps are widely distributed and exhibit a wide range of biological activities such as anticancer antibacterial antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties donaldson et al 2005 kuroyanagi et al 1999 young et al 2008 they are typically less toxic inexpensive and relatively environmentally friendly compared to inorganic materials such as ag cu and tio2 carson hammer  riley 2006 as such nps may be more appropriate for indoor environments jung et al 2011b suggested simple and continuous aerosol processes for synthesizing np nanoparticles from sophora flavescens extract and demonstrated satisfactory inhibition of bacterial aerosols when the particles were applied to air filters another study found that essential oil vapors of savory had a lethal effect on bacteria in ventilation systems and reported a bacterial reduction rate close to total disinfection pibiri goel vahekeni  roulet 2006the synthesis of hybrid nanostructurenanocomposites has also been suggested as a means of enhancing the antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles carbon nanotubes cnts are known to be toxic to bacteria kang herzberg rodrigues  elimelech 2008 and they have been used as a substrate to prepare antimicrobial ag nanoparticle composites due to their excellent chemical and mechanical stability using a supercritical fluid technique niu han wu yu and xu 2010 synthesized one-dimensional 1d carbon nanomaterials wrapped with ag nanoparticles which exhibited a high degree of antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli rangari et al 2010 showed that agcnts and nylon-6agcnt hybrid particles were more toxic to microbes than pure ag particles or cnts alone jung et al 2011a demonstrated a simple aerosol technique for fabricating agcnts hybrids and antimicrobial filters in addition aymonier et al 2002 and weickmann tiller thomann and mlhaupt 2005 synthesized various antimicrobial hybrid nanomaterials using polymers they found that polymethyl methacrylate pmma hybrid nanocomposites containing ag nanoparticles and polyethylenimineag hybrid nanoparticles had inhibitory effects on several bacteria strainsnumerous methods have been used to produce hybrid nanoparticles including vapor deposition of a metal onto a surface-supported monolayer

fig 2a the bacteria were nebulized at an airflow rate of 5 lmin dispersed bacterial aerosols were passed through a diffusion dryer to remove moisture and then introduced to a filter holder in which the fabricated antimicrobial filter was installed the size distribution and concentration of the bacterial aerosol were measured using an aerodynamic particle sizer aps 3321 tsi shoreview mn usa the bacteria were allowed to reside on each filter for 5 min the filter was then removed from the holder and soaked in a 50-ml conical tube containing 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline pbs ph 74 with 001 tween 80 samples in the fluid were vortexed for 2 min and then sonicated in an ice bath for 10 min to ensure bacterial transmission from the filter to the pbs buffer finally the suspension was serially diluted and 100 l of each resulting suspension were respectively plated onto nutrient agar becton dickinson and incubated at 37 c for 24 h colonies that formed on the plate were counted after incubationthe bacterial inactivation rate was calculated using the following equation1inactivationrate1cfuantimicrobialcfucontrol100where cfuantimicrobial is the number of bacterial colonies cfu counted from the antimicrobial filter and cfucontrol is the number of bacterial colonies counted from the pristine control filterto investigate the filtration efficiency of the antimicrobial filters the total number concentration of bacterial aerosols was measured at the inlet and outlet of the filter using an aerodynamic particle sizerfiltration efficiency was calculated using the following equation2filtrationefficiency1concentrationoutletconcentrationinlet100where concentrationoutlet and concentrationinlet are the total particle concentrations particlecm3 of bacterial aerosols measured at the filter inlet and outlet respectivelyas shown in fig 2b pressure drop across the test filters was measured using a micromanometer fco12 furness controls ltd bexhill ukthes was used to prepare npmwcnt hybrid nanoparticles the procedure consisted of two steps electrospraying two kinds of droplets followed by controlled ethanol evaporation and coagulation of particles resulting from coulombic collisions between oppositely charged nps and mwcnts in the first step the droplets containing dissolved nps experienced a transient phase change from a liquid to a solid camelot et al 1999 morozov 2011 tan et al 2007
fig 3 shows the wps size distributions and tem images of the nps mwcnts and npmwcnts a significant transport loss of particles 90 was observed when generating pure np nanoparticles or pure mwcnts via single-nozzle electrospraying without charge neutralization these losses were due to the high electrical charge per particle this phenomenon was similar to that shown in the experimental results of fu et al 2012 to mitigate this effect as shown in fig 3a and b np nanoparticles or pure mwcnts were generated using simultaneous electrospray of pure ethanol the opposite charge polarity of which served to neutralize unipolarly charged np nanoparticles or mwcnts the neutralized np nanoparticles had a positively skewed size distribution of 10100 nm with a peak diameter of 115 nm a geometric standard deviation gsd of 163 and a geometric mean diameter gmd of 185 nm fig 3a

fig 4 shows the surfaces of pristine filters and antimicrobial filters onto which np mwcnt and npmwcnt nanoparticles were deposited the surface of the pristine filter fig 4a b was smooth and clear while the surfaces coated with np fig 4c d and mwcnt fig 4e f nanoparticles were relatively uneven compared to the mwcnt coatings the np coatings were uniformly deposited onto the filter surface in contrast the npmwcnt-coated filters fig 4g h formed dendrites on the filter surface which suggests that the unique shape of the npmwcnt particles contributes to the formation of dendrites on the filter surface and that the deposition structure increased the contact surface area between the antimicrobial substance and bacteria there was no additional separation unit for np and npmwcnt nanoparticles therefore the coating on npmwcnt-coated filters also contained np nanoparticles however the npnwcnt nanoparticles were expected to show a greater antimicrobial activity than that of either the pure np nanoparticles or pure mwcntsprior to conducting this study we collected filter samples with similar pressure drops at a face velocity of 8 cms to prevent false results from filter variations alone as shown
fig 5 the pressure drops of the antimicrobial filters were higher than those of the pristine filters 66 mmh2o the mwcnt- 111 mmh2o and npmwcnt-coated filters 116 mmh2o showed a significant increase in pressure drop compared with the np-coated filters 71 mmh2o the surfaces of the np- and mwcnt-coated filters were yellow and black respectively the npmwcnt-coated filter was gray due to the combination of np nanoparticles yellow and mwcnts blackthe filtration efficiencies of pristine np mwcnt- and npmwcnt-coated filters were tested using s epidermidis aerosols
fig 6a shows the normalized aerodynamic particle size distribution of tested bacterial aerosols generated by the nebulizer the size distribution of the aerosols was a monomodal curve with a peak diameter of 0898 m a gmd of 0914 m and a gsd of 117 the concentration of s epidermidis in the aerosols was 133103

fig 7 shows that the npmwcnt filters had a higher antimicrobial activity than the np and mwcnt filters under identical experimental conditions the npmwcnt filters inactivated 95 of the test bacteria while the other filters inactivated 70 of the bacteria spss t-test p005 these results are consistent with the results of previous studies showing that agcnt nanoparticles or nylon-6agcnt hybrid polymer nanocomposite fibers had significant antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species including e coli staphylococcus aureus and s epidermidis jung et al 2011a rangari et al 2010 such inhibition appears to be due to the high contact surface area between bacteria and antimicrobial substances factors that have been shown to influence the antimicrobial efficacy of such coated filters include the size concentration and shape of the coating materials ji et al 2007 kim et al 2007 pal et al 2007 the np nanoparticles used in this study were composed primarily of flavonoids flavonoids exhibit an antibacterial activity by reducing the fluidity of the inner and outer layers of bacterial membranes thereby inhibiting dna and rna synthesis and deterring energy metabolism cushnie  lamb 2005 in addition direct contact between cnts and bacteria cells causes damage to the outer bacterial membrane and subsequent cell death short cnts are more effective in damaging bacterial cells due to increased interactions with the cell membrane the open ends of nanotubes can induce further bacterial cell damage kang et al 2008 the primary reason for the enhanced antimicrobial activity of the npmwcnt filters was the increased contact surface area resulting from the high surface area of the np particles and the presence of the mwcnts the net effect was the high antimicrobial efficacy of filters coated with hybrid npmwcnt nanoparticlesnpmwcnt hybrid nanostructures were produced using a thes technique the particle size distribution and tem and sem analyses showed that np particles were successfully combined with mwcnts the hybrid nanoparticles were continuously deposited onto filter surfaces using an aerosol process the npmwcnt-coated filters exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than those coated only with np particles or mwcnts the fabrication technique described is simple and the resulting hybrid particles have demonstrated a potential for applications in indoor air andor water purification systems however the experimental results also showed that electrical charge optimization on the particles was necessary to increase the synthesis rate of the hybrid nanoparticles thus future studies will include electrical charge optimizations for efficient hybrid nanoparticle synthesishealth psychology is a relatively new field and international health psychology even newer anthropologists and cross-cultural psychologists have worked in africa and asia for many years but i rarely find another health psychologist when i work in the poorest countries with their skills they would have a great deal to offer health psychologists know not only about cultural differences but also about basic cognitive and social processes as they apply to health problems they know how to use qualitative and quantitative methods to describe problems and evaluate solutions health psychologists generally are problem-focused they study health problems where socialpsychological and behavioral processes are part of the problem health psychologists are also solution-focused they are not satisfied with simply describing and measuring stress and its effect on health they also want to evaluate ways to reduce stress they study diet and exercise and ways to enhance these and other lifestyles through health promotion international health psychologists use the same problem- and solution-focused approach in developing countries working with a local team of experts who have identified the pressing local health problems they examine sources of the problem and ways to tackle it the problems are different in developing countries but the steps taken to solve them may not be if you cannot use public service television advertising to tell people about the benefits of breast feeding and bed nets you can nonetheless train community health workers or teachers to provide lively entertainmenteducation on these topics to groups of people instead of tackling heart disease stroke and cancer international health psychologists tackle diseases of children who die in large numbers or are left physically and mentally disabled by the age of 5 they also focus on women who are at greater risk than men of getting hiv who die or are disabled as a result of giving birth and who are the guardians of their familys health yet have little decision-making power instead of working with hospitals where only a small minority of the population go for treatment international health psychologists work with rural communities and village health workers to prevent death and diseasewhy might psychologists want and need to become informed about international perspectives on health first we have come to realize that we can learn from problems and solutions being evaluated in other countries we can learn how people from different cultures think about causes of illness and find strikingly similar ways of thinking in our own country we can learn how strategies to change health behavior have succeeded or failed in other countries for example with respect to abstinence and condom use and adjust our own strategies accordingly we can broaden our theories for example theories of stress and coping or theories of behavior change on the basis of research in developing countries second psychologists have an important role to play in improving the health of people in developing countries as health psychologists with a population health perspective we are welcomed by multi-disciplinary teams of researchers and health workers who attempt to resolve health problems through environmental social psychological and medical changes prevention of illness is less expensive than cure and psychologists are experts in preventive behaviors health workers therefore seek input from psychologists to help them promote a large array of good health behaviors for example hand-washing and home management of dehydration far exceed hospital or medical treatments of diarrhea behavior change in the use of treated mosquito bed nets are at the forefront of the fight against malaria given that no vaccine is yet available abstinence and condom use are still the only ways to prevent hiv having a birth plan to give birth at a clinic rather than at home increases a womans chance of surviving without disability  in many countries delivering a baby is riskier than an abortion persuading mothers to breast feed their infants for 6 months and to serve animal source foods and vegetables to their young children are keys to overcoming the appalling levels of malnutrition psychologists may not study viruses and vaccines but they know more than others about attitude and behavior changefurthermore why might psychology students want to become informed about international perspectives on health more and more young people are traveling out of curiosity about others and a desire for personal growth they feel a sense of responsibility at least to be informed about the struggles of people who live in other countries some want to work abroad after their degree with peace corps or one of the many non-governmental organizations such as world vision or save the children most are relatively nave about the challenges they will encounter but they are eager and well-intentioned other students are critical of these adventurers and accuse them of being neocolonials and cultural universalists my class always has a rousing debate on these two positions some students mistakenly think that american psychologists parachute themselves into remote places and start controlling peoples health behaviors the reality is that we are visiting experts who work alongside local people who want to change organizations are happy to have students not because they have the skills to really make a difference but because they are the international experts of the future their international perspective will help american donors set proper priorities for the fight against hunger illiteracy hiv and malaria they will understand that the usual strategies of funding hospitals and expensive equipment are not the best solutions students with a background in psychology will see first-hand that their skills in the area of environmental social and behavioral change are put to good use as part of class preparation students can be encouraged to google organizations welcoming young volunteers and at the same time discover the common problems faced by people in places such as africa and south asiahealth is highly valued by people everywhere along with education health is recognized as one of the most important resources a people and a nation can possess goals set by the international community toward which all international experts are now working called the millennium development goals consist largely of improved health compare with the us healthy people initiatives among the eight goals to be reached by the year 2015 are reducing hunger child deaths womens deaths during delivery and infectious diseases such as hiv and malaria to accomplish these are goals that include clean sources of water proper waste disposal use of skilled birth attendants use of condoms and other forms of contraception and gender equality in education although some but not all of the goals will be met on time by some but not all regions of the world their ratification by all countries belonging to the united nations provides an incentive to work cooperatively students can find online the site for the millennium development goals and how much progress has been made in sub-saharan africa south asia and latin americain this chapter i provide lesson plans for three international topics that might be used in a course on health psychology rather than describe exotic cross-cultural examples of how a remote tribe in africa conducts trepanation to reduce pain or a how western surgeons fly to asia to perform cataract surgery small examples that add one unusual twist to an otherwise smooth-flowing lecture i have selected three millennium development goals
reducing the number of women who die delivering why is it riskier to deliver than to abort why do young women find it difficult to live healthy lives this is one of the most popular topics among my students because they note striking contrasts with their own life yet they strongly identify with the issuesenvironmental health including sources of clean water waste disposal and personal hygiene water shortage is a worldwide obsession and a looming problem for the usa why is water in developing countries unclean and what are the consequences for health this is a story of health behavior change in particular as it relates to waste disposal hand-washing and face-washing at the family level it extends to the use of mosquito nets and condoms psychologists are famous for their theories of behavior change but most theories have not worked well in developing countries why not there is ample scholarly space for insightful and creative students to answer this questioneliminating child hunger and its disabling effects on physical growth and cognitive development while nine to ten million children under 5 years die each year from preventable causes another 200 million are unable to reach their psychological potential because they lack food and stimulation as psychologists we grasp the tragedy of such waste one-third of children in developing countries are short for their age meaning they have suffered long-term hunger a similar proportion of american children are overweight two lectures back to back on obesity and hunger provide an instructive contrast
other topics might fit your course and inclinations as well these include hiv and aids particularly in south africa where school programs imported from the usa and modified for the african context have been evaluated gallant and maticka-tyndale 2004 new programs to promote condom use in the community are currently being created and evaluated jewkes et al 2006 2008 it is also connected there with alcohol abuse intimate partner violence and coercive sex patientpractitioner interactions and quality of care can also be studied in developing country settings shared decision making privacy and adherence are dilemmas in family planning clinics health posts and hospitals abdel-tawab and roter 2002 hadley and roques 2007 health psychology students would enjoy arguing about the social cultural and ethical issues involved even where shared decision making and privacy are not cultural norms women may still want both finally alcohol and tobacco abuse are increasing in developing countries in the usa health education in schools target youth and environmental restrictions regulate where and to whom these items can be sold health psychology students might consider whether these strategies would be successful in papua new guinea india or chinawhere in the world is papua new guinea where are all these 50 least developed countries you can find a list of them along with some facts and figures at the unicef web site httpwwwuniceforg my students get the latestpdf copies of the tables at the back of the unicef document called the state of the worlds children there are statistics on the proportion of children who die before their fifth birthday this is the most telling indicator of a nations overall health if you cannot keep your children alive then those who survive must also be doing poorly and their mothers must be in poor physical and mental health as well there are also figures on how long people can expect to live maternal mortality malnutrition literacy hiv prevalence among young people condom use immunization how much donor money goes into the country called official development assistance or oda and funds spent on health this and more information is available about each country about regions such as sub-saharan africa and latin america and about groupings of countries such as the 50 least developed countries and 39 industrialized countries you can also see how each indicator is defined and its source of data one instructive group assignment for students is to give them a list of indicators then let them pick a country in sub-saharan africa south asia and latin america for which they find the indicator data in the end the instructor creates a composite table in full view of all fielding figures from the three groups and inserting them into the table the three columns of figures for say ethiopia bangladesh and nicaragua may be compared with each other and with a fourth column of figures for the usa students can then decide which countries need the most work and in what areas of healthother sites with useful information are the world health organization httpwwwwhoint and unaids hiv and aids httpwwwunaidsorgenissues along with unicef these organizations have teams of experts providing guidelines on the best practices known to date research is constantly updating these guidelines and psychologists contribute in important ways to this research incidentally this research is rarely published in mainstream american psychology journals although there is recent interest in doing so it is published in international journals such as the bulletin for the world health organization social science and medicine and the lancet international health psychologists collaborate with other health disciplines such as medical anthropologists epidemiologists nutritionists health programmers and public health specialists they all speak the same jargon and read the same documents to coordinate students introduced to international health psychology should be socialized into this team effort at a local and a global levelwhy is it riskier to deliver than to abort why do young women find it difficult to live healthy lives women in the usa live longer than men but have more health complaints if they want to have a career and family there are resources to support their choices husbands can support them during delivery maternity leave gives them time off and day care centers provide quality care in the early years women may feel stressed but they actually thrive with multiple roleswomen in developing countries have a hard life over 500000 mothers die giving birth each year many more are disabled because they get infections lose blood or rupture the birth passage you might be reluctant to get pregnant under such dangerous conditions but young and uneducated women do not have much say maternal mortality is a health event with the greatest disparity between developing and industrialized countries in the usa only 1 of 4800 women will die during her reproductive years and at the time of delivery only 11 of 100000 will die from complications in the 50 least developed countries 1 of 24 women will die during these years and 870 of 100000 will die delivering her baby sub-saharan africa has a worse record than south asia and both are considerably worse than latin america see the lancet 2005 series on maternal mortality eg campbell  graham 2005 filippi ronsmans  campbell et al 2005 ronsmans and graham 2005 reasons for the deaths will be presented shortly along with some surprising new research findings but first let students imagine they are collecting the data to calculate these figuresimagine we are the researchers collecting data on women who die during delivery in the usa we would go to a hospital or the death registry however most developing countries do not yet have registration of births and deaths furthermore most women do not deliver babies in hospitals or clinics they deliver at home so we go door-to-door using what is called the sisterhood method along with a verbal autopsy we interview women between 15 and 49 years and ask about their adult sisters survival for those sisters who died time of death along with details of the circumstances and symptoms prior to death is recorded if the death occurred during pregnancy delivery or up to 42 days after delivery from causes related to or aggravated by the pregnancy it is a case of maternal mortality obviously a much more reliable method is possible when health researchers set up a demographic surveillance site as they did in matlab bangladesh in the 1960s each year they visit households asking about births pregnancies deaths health and illness the following year outcomes of the pregnancy will be recorded if the mother has died the child commonly dies shortly thereafter because a child cannot survive for long without a mothers care and breast milkwhy do so many women die some reasons can be gleaned from the conditions of young women before they become pregnant others arise during pregnancy and delivery the first set of causes include early marriage parents arrange for their daughters to get married in their late teens perhaps to avoid her getting pregnant out of wedlock or to have one less person to feed usually they arrange an early marriage simply because everyone else in the village does and questions will be asked if a girl of 20 is still not married young brides and their families want children immediately because motherhood is a girls primary role and confers status young bodies especially bodies that are short due to malnutrition do not have a fully developed birth canal the fetus is likely to be either too large for the birth canal or low birth-weight young girls who live in an area across mid-africa have likely undergone a procedure called genital cutting which produces inflexible scar tissue this further impedes smooth passage of the fetus leading to the rupture of the birth canal if the woman is young and lacks primary school education she may be unaware of these risks she has simply followed the wishes of her family and the practices of her community if she has not completed fifth grade she is not sufficiently literate to read about alternative available practices health psychologists study the cultural social and behavioral practices that prepare girls for safe motherhoodchildbirth is a natural phenomenon but still things can go wrong during the growth and delivery of a fetus in the usa pregnancy is a time for joy and for preparation part of the preparation entails prenatal visits to an obstetrician to check on the mothers weight gain and blood pressure and to check on the fetus vital signs in the least developed countries particularly those in africa and south asia only 60 seek prenatal known as antenatal care the others claim that because they did not experience a problem they did not need to go the purpose of antenatal care however is prevention for example if it looks like the baby is too large for the mothers pelvic gap a cesarean section may be planned to prevent malaria during pregnancy she may be given anti-malarial pills if she is anemic and most are she may be given iron and folic acid supplements many of these services are provided free of charge by government clinics so health psychologists may try to create pictorial leaflets with messages that motivate pregnant women without scaring them to seek antenatal care our involvement with screening programs for cancer gives us a sense of how difficult it is to motivate women who fear bad newsantenatal screening unfortunately is not a reliable predictor of who will encounter serious problems most common causes of maternal death and disability cannot be detected early and thereby prevented because of these limitations concerted effort now focuses on the need to encourage mothers to seek a skilled doctor nurse or midwife to deliver their newborn and to train these professionals in a few essential emergency obstetric procedures but delivery practices are difficult to change most mothers over 60 in the least developed countries deliver at home with the help of a traditional birth attendant or female relative who perform deliveries on a regular basis but know little about cleanliness and less about what to do when the mother starts to bleed she has no medicines to stop the pain or the bleeding the family is left on their own to cope with the crisisthe common reasons for women dying are excessive bleeding in the 24 h after delivery and infection of the genital tract due to unclean hands and instruments being inserted neither can be predicted from an antenatal visit but both are preventable if the woman goes to a nearby clinic or hospital another preventable cause of deaths is obstructed labor due to a small birth passage to scar tissue from genital cutting or to awkward positioning of the fetus antenatal care would have alerted the mother of potential problems associated with these conditions perhaps to prepare for a cesarean section deliveryhealth psychologists and other social scientists are helping to reduce maternal mortality in several ways the first is to show mothers the benefits of delivering at a clinic or hospital if women will not go to clinics to deliver then they need to seek a nontraditional skilled midwife you may have to convince not only the young mother but also her parents in-laws and husband furthermore health education along with pictures warns women of conditions that are life-threatening for which she should seek emergency obstetric care at the same time pregnant women are counseled on how to complete an advanced birth plan and to save some money for emergency transport to a clinic countries such as sri lanka and honduras have reduce their deaths greatly in recent years and so stand as good models for us to studyanother strategy to reduce maternal deaths is through family planning and the use of modern contraception women often continue to have children simply because they live in a culture that encourages having many children and they assume that their husbands want more children almost half of pregnancies 40 globally are unwanted meaning that the woman was not wanting or trying to get pregnant often she is too young or unmarried perhaps pregnant through rape or already has more children than she can care for some 22 of pregnancies result in induced abortion safe abortions have little risk but unsafe abortions often end in death and account for one-third of maternal deaths thus two common strategies for reducing maternal deaths are contraception and safe abortionone of the surprising research findings is that the most popular form of contraception worldwide is sterilization sterilization has such a bad reputation in the usa that few would choose it willingly yet in both india and china 34 of women undergo a simple sterilization procedure to stop having more children the intrauterine device iud comes next with again high use in korea and china chinas one-child policy has successfully reduced its population growth but countries in africa have no popular support for such policies overall india and bangladesh have close to 60 use of modern contraception latin america 70 sub-saharan africa has the lowest use at 23 education importantly increases the chances that both husband and wife will want to use contraception counseling women and particularly couples on the need to space or stop children is the preferred strategy but some countries also insert contraception episodes into television soap operas to raise awareness and create a social norm and demandstudents may be unused to considering family planning as both an individual choice and a social responsibility yet in places where responsibility to and for your extended family is strong neither marriage partner nor family size is solely an individual choice students tend to think that lifestyle and other health behaviors are under personal control yet there are many examples where governments for the protection of all have regulated safety most of us must wear seat belts while driving in a vehicle when seat belts were encouraged but voluntary most people did not wear them and so killed or maimed themselves and their children unnecessarily once laws were passed requiring seat belt use almost everyone buckled up and subsequently their attitudes changed in favor of seat belts this is a good example of how governments can regulate health behaviors for the good of all and let supportive attitudes follow in their wake another example is smoking governments regulate the age when one can purchase cigarettes and places where you cannot smoke  the latter being an example of social responsibility the age of alcohol purchase was raised in the usa as a result of alcohol abuse and drunk driving by high school and college students the people of china and india have social norms about limiting ones family size in many african countries the norm is to have many children in the usa there is no strong prescriptive norm some have no children some have the usual two and some have morea new and interesting research topic concerns hiv pregnancy and transmission to the newborn women between the ages of 18 and 24 are more than twice as likely as young men to become hiv-positive pregnancy increases her chances of becoming hiv-positive as does having an older male partner or husband who had premarital or extramarital sexual experience so for a number of biological and social reasons pregnant women have additional risks due to potential hiv infection a newborn child has a 35 chance of becoming infected mostly during delivery and partly from breast milk this is known as vertical transmission of hiv drugs given to mothers at the time of delivery prevent vertical transmission however expectant mothers need to first find out whether or not they are hiv-positive they need to go to a clinic that provides voluntary counseling and testing known as vct antenatal clinics in high hiv countries now offer this service as standard care so persuading pregnant women to attend an antenatal clinic is the first step then convincing her to accept testing is the second step on average about 70 do accept with a range of 33100 the reasons why they are reluctant to get tested include cost though the cost is usually subsidized by the organization or government running it fear of emotional trauma fear of losing her husband or partner and fear of social stigma the fear factor may explain why some women agree to get tested but do not return for the test results and why so few notify their partners of their status women who deliver at home have an extra responsibility to take the medication themselves at the right time health psychologists may have a special role to play evaluating womens fears and training counselors to be client-focused and sensitive thailand and uganda have the best records for tackling their hiv problems through open dialog and easy access to services we might learn from them something to apply at home and elsewhere see glick 2005 for more detailswhy is water in developing countries unclean and what are the consequences for health we have all become aware of the viruses bacteria and parasites that lurk in our homes hospitals and outdoor environments and the need to wash our hands in a spirit of international solidarity the centers for disease control and prevention cdc dispatch experts to solve mysterious outbreaks of sars avian influenza west nile virus and nipah virus their goals are to track down the environmental culprit and the unhygienic modes of transmission new and reemerging infections arrive on our shores and we naively send them onwards recall the american groom who boarded a plane to his honeymoon destination knowingly coughing with highly infectious tuberculosis surprisingly personal rather than industrial behavior has been the main culprit in most developing countries eg biran et al 2005 stanton et al 1987in the usa we take clean water for granted we turn on the tap and drink we have as much water as we want to bathe we have flush toilets at home and in public places in fact each person uses about 375 gallons of water a day for personal consumption the highest in the world however because of our profligate practices we will soon have to start worrying about water elsewhere in the world water has always been a problem  finding enough water finding clean water and finding water to keep clean unclean water unclean disposal of waste personal waste and unclean hygienic practices are the cause of much ill health in developing countries most of this illness could be prevented through health behaviors that create and sustain a clean environment the united nations declared 20052015 as the decade for action on water for life the millennium development goal 7 aims to cut in half the number of people without safe water and proper disposal facilities for waste currently 80 of people in developing countries use clean water but only 50 use toilets or latrineswhy is water in developing countries unclean and what are the health consequences the most common reason is that people and animals defecate on the ground or in the streams and this top water is used for drinking so two strategies are pursued persuading people to use latrines and having hand-drillers put a pipe down to raise water from a lower water table the former requires a change in health behavior and the latter requires technical skill and materials ethiopia has one of the lowest percentages of people using safe water and latrines only 22 drink safe water and 13 use latrines when we lived in ethiopia we boiled our water before drinking but of course no one else did most rural people defecated on the ground either in the bushes or around their home childrens feces are particularly contaminated so a government needs to ensure that water is brought up from a deeper level and attached to a hand pump cities generally provided the infrastructure for clean water and latrines but rural people had neitherviruses bacteria and parasites are too small to see without a lens without an education people tend not to know about these microbes still people like to explain their misfortunes so a number of interesting causal attributions get passed down the generations diarrhea comes from the eruption of baby teeth hepatitis if you urinate at night facing the moon malaria from morning mists a cough and cold from cold weather more serious illnesses come from the evil eye of a person or supernatural spirits that inhabit streams animals and trees these are regarded as traditional beliefs but their similarity around the world suggests that they arise not from a particular culture but from a universal need to understand uncontrolled causes of ill health beliefs may arise from noticed correlations for example baby teeth tend to erupt at an age when children start crawling and crawlers pick up contaminated soil on their fingers and then suck them likewise malaria comes from mosquitoes which propagate on stagnant waters from which mist coincidently arises in the early morning we all have health beliefs it is difficult to break the transmission of such beliefs as we know from the cold belief and from other false hiv beliefs do we need to change such beliefs to change the health behaviors that stop the transmission of microbeswhat are the microbes and what health behaviors are needed to prevent their disabling effects the most common is rotavirus causing diarrhea also escherichia coli bacteria and cholera there are the common cold viruses which may lead to pneumonia and other more serious respiratory illnesses anemia is largely caused by hookworms which thrive in contaminated soil malaria is caused by the plasmodium parasite transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito trachoma an eye infection is caused by a bacteria carried by flies we still have viral diarrhea and the common cold and cough in the usa but no one dies from them except perhaps the frail elderly we used to have malaria and trachoma but we succeeded in quarantining patients and controlling the mosquitoes and flies that carry them however infections such as these cause death malnutrition and debilitating illness in africa and asia over six million children each year die from diarrhea and pneumonia many more are left weak and malnourished from repeated bouts of these illnesses millions suffer from recurring episodes of malaria and are unable to work while the fever rages but pregnant women and children are most likely to die especially from a cerebral form of malaria or anemia trachoma is active in 84 million people and is already responsible for blindness in 13 million people primary prevention of diarrhea respiratory illness and trachoma can be largely accomplished if everyone used a latrine and washed their hands and face known as sanitation and personal hygiene prevention of malaria requires the use of insecticide-treated nets at home lindblade et al 2004 these are health behaviors that stop infections from being transmitted from one person to another or from an insect to a person as an aside secondary prevention is the second line of action once the person has the illness and needs to prevent adverse consequences prevention of death from diarrhea which is due to dehydration requires oral rehydration sachets and zinc to replenish lost water and nutrients unfortunately uninformed mothers withhold food and fluid in the hopes of stopping water loss prevention of death from pneumonia requires recognition of the signs in a young child and obtaining antibiotics from a health clinic antibiotic creams are also used to prevent blindness from untreated trachoma secondary prevention is costly it is also ineffective in the long-term because a month or year later the microbes are back sanitation personal hygiene and using bed nets are therefore the new health behaviors people need to adopt to prevent the misery of these illnessessurprising research findings demonstrate that providing information about the real causes is insufficient to change peoples habits and secondly that behavior change may precede rather than follow belief and attitude change psychologists are expert at belief attitude and behavior change we have a number of well-tested theories to take to the field but we were not in the field when well-meaning programmers popularized what is called behavior change communication it refers to the use of communication to inform people and thereby persuade them to change their health behaviors the strategy relied solely on the use of information to change beliefs and attitudes however what is known as the kap gap appeared again and again demonstrating the wide gap between knowledge k attitude a and practice p changing peoples knowledge and attitudes about microbes water and latrines did not change their behavior eg bilqis et al 1994 stanton et al 1987 health education by itself is rarely sufficient because most people do not use the systematic route to persuasion glanz et al 2002 petty and cacioppo 1986 well-reasoned arguments and cognitive elaborations do not always guide ones behavior too much theory testing has been conducted with college students who are unsurprisingly cognitive we might learn more about the heuristic route if we tested our theories in rural areas of developing countries here habits are learned young and overlearned through practice what can our theories of behavior change tell us about how to change health behaviors and sustain the changeour theories tell us that changing behavior requires an antecedent such as motivation and a reminder cue to trigger the new behavior lots of rehearsal of the new behavior so that it becomes perfected and automatic and pleasant consequences absence of debilitating illness ought to be pleasant enough but it is not a concrete and immediate consequence  no one notices its absence as an assignment students may be encouraged to search through their known theories to line them up in the before during and after categories of abc where aantecedent bbehavior and cconsequences we have so much to learn about applying theories of behavior change to serious health behaviors in developing countries we are still learning from our mistakesi find that the best way to present this information to students is through case studies there are generally one or two research articles on a specific program to change health behaviors and whether or not they were successful students like to dissect and evaluate the program each can be analyzed in terms of theories of behavior change and the abc elements the antecedent element may come in the form of self-determination theory intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and the health belief model which argues for a reminder cue in the environment the behavior element is implemented through the development and rehearsal of new behavior skills with the help of a model derived from social learning and social cognitive theory the consequence element may entail self-efficacy self-reward or a positive health outcome if you use the communication framework students can analyze who was the sender who the receiver and what was the message but then they will want to know if the resultant cognitiveattitude change translated into behavior change to examine its sustainability students may need to know more about social norms and social support in this regard a new model of community readiness pioneered in the usa is now being applied to norm change in developing countries eg mccoy et al 2007case 1 hand-washing steve luby from the cdc has worked in pakistan and bangladesh to increase hand-washing and thereby reduce childhood diarrhea and pneumonia he has had some success on both counts luby et al 2004 in bangladesh people had an intrinsic motivation and sufficient knowledge the motivation was for appearance and to reduce germs but they were not in the habit of washing we decided to increase hand-washing at two key points  after defecation and before eating  by posting visual reminder cues at these two locations we also encouraged families to have a water bucket with soap just inside the door of their home and beside the latrine a few village sessions were given in which one person from each family was coached while washing their hands with soap and water that person then took responsibility for ensuring that the family washed their hands curtis and cairncross 2003 have reviewed this extensive literature which is now very relevant to north americans women are generally better at this than men but we all need notices posted in critical places to remind us the most successful programs target the whole village to get community acceptance and instill hand-washing as a social norm and also individual families who may need help fitting the new habit into their familys schedule of activitiesone benefit to targeting women is their influence on children in a bangladeshi project we added hand-washing to a child feeding program aboud et al 2008 we encouraged hand-washing and self-feeding at the same time with the phrase first you wash your hands then you touch the food in weekly group sessions the peer educator washed all the childrens hands before giving them some food according to mothers recall that was one of the most memorable behavioral messages of the 5-week program and raised pre-meal hand-washing from 2 to 62 6 months later save the children usa in bangladesh helps to develop the habit early by having children wash their hands when they arrive at preschool and at mid-morning daycares in the usa also have to be conscientious about hygiene because children pass germs to each other in group settingscase 2 face-washing one of the cornerstones of the global elimination of trachoma by 2020 get 2020 includes face-washing mecaskey et al 2003 flies carrying trachoma seek the moisture in childrens eyes so eyelids need to be washed regularly tanzania is a water-poor country so the goal of a long-standing project was not only to promote washing childrens faces but also helping families overcome the water shortage which they said stood in the way of daily hygiene lynch et al 1994 mccauley et al 1990 the social norm implicitly understood by everyone was that precious water and time would be wasted on a childs face no woman wanted to be criticized for being wasteful furthermore her action might be interpreted as vanity provoking the evil eye from an envious neighbor the researchers therefore tried to build a community consensus by demonstrating that 30 people could wash their faces with water from a small gourd peer educators from the village visited individual families to help them identify reusable water for face-washing clean water is not necessary and a convenient time and to reward improvements in the end one village received eye ointment only and their levels of trachoma initially dropped but rose again 1 year later two villages with the behavior change strategy had more clean faces and less trachoma but still not enough to eliminate trachoma entirely a fourth village with the behavior change strategy showed no change at all some women persisted in shaming mothers who washed their childrens faces so the stubborn social norm proved to be an obstacle recent studies find that mass antibiotic treatment for whole villages succeed in reducing trachoma but not in eliminating it consequently without face-washing a resurgence followscase 3 latrine use eliminating animal and human feces from around the house and water sources would go a long way to preventing illness and death building latrines may go part way toward solving the problem any family with a shovel and some local material can build themselves a latrine but latrines have to be used some villages and schools like to keep their donor-supplied latrines spotless and unused one latrine promotion program was tried in rural ethiopia where only 7 of the people use latrines community leaders and health workers constructed demonstration latrines for families to view and copy oloughlin et al 2006 within 6 months 50 of households had built and 45 used their latrine social pressure is usually applied when the community gets involved in bangladesh community groups made a map of where every family defecated and this was discussed by the community at-large who then made a decision to ban open defecation in their village kar 2005 people who could not find the intrinsic motivation to comply presumably found the extrinsic motivation after being subjected to shame the combination of latrines social pressure and accompanying information seems to have led to change in most of these studies knowledge and attitudes by themselves work too slowly and are infrequently translated into behavior instead one might conclude that it is sometimes more effective to change the behavior of a critical mass of people whose behavior then sets a new social normthere is no quick fix for the health problems associated with lack of latrine use you cannot stop babies from sucking their fingers you cannot force everyone to wear shoes to protect them from hookworm there would have to be constant hand- and face-washing that is why 100 latrine use is essential malaria also relies on behavior change though a vaccine in the foreseeable future might obviate the need for nets social marketing in malawi raised peoples awareness of affordable bed nets but could not raise ownership and use above 20 however in kenya an organization called population services international psi started a subsidized program in rural child health clinics two years later the kenyan government distributed free nets to all children less than 5 years without going through a complicated explanation of why children more than adults needed the nets distributors realized that giving the nets to children ensured that they were seen as child protection within 2 years the percentage of children less than 5 years sleeping under nets rose from 7 to 67 noor et al 2007 is this sustainable students can look up kenya bed nets on the internet to find outcase 4 abstinence and condom use to prevent infection by the human immunodeficiency virus also requires health behavior change because this is a topic already covered from an american perspective students will know that abstinence and condom use are the preventive measures to be taken by youth many american researchers are transporting ideas and behavior change strategies between the usa and africa simply providing knowledge to african students is insufficient according to a review of these studies gallant and maticka-tyndale 2004 for example bonita stanton et al 1998 found that abstinence was sustained for girls for boys neither abstinence nor condom use was sustained william r brieger et al 2001 found that peer educators who met youth in bars to promote condom use convinced school-going youth to use condoms but did not manage to convert out-of-school youth for the former behavior change preceded and exceeded attitude and knowledge change because hiv infections are increasing most rapidly among youth aged 1524 and because the development of africa depends on its youth social scientists are looking for behavior change strategies with hard evidence for their effectiveness jewkes et al 2006 2008you can see from the above presentation that behavior change has not been a resounding success in developing countries yet most health experts believe that it is essential for cost-effective prevention of illness where vaccines are not an option i have outlined four cases where health would be immensely improved if psychologists identified a successful behavior change strategy for sustained change this is the new frontier for future research it is also important in the next and final topic to be covered namely feeding childrenwhile nine to ten million children less than 5 years die each year from preventable causes another 200 million are unable to reach their psychological potential because they lack food and stimulation the causes and solutions are multileveled growing more food and not losing half of it from field to home distributing food more evenly in communities and families and understanding that small bodies and small brains need more rather than lessone-third of children less than 5 years are short for their age meaning they have suffered long-term hunger most of these children live in developing countries particularly in south asia and sub-saharan africa in fact in some countries such as india bangladesh ethiopia niger and zambia 50 of children are stunted stunting or being short for your age is now known to be the central indicator of long-term malnutrition although famine and hunger grab headlines chronically under-fed children go unrecognized by journalists and even by their mothers their mothers think they look about right for their age whereas we might simply underestimate their age and think they look a few years younger than they are many of these children were born low birth weight less than 2500 g because they did not receive sufficient nutrients in utero many continued to receive insufficient breast milk if their mothers did not exclusively breast feed for 6 months however the major source of malnutrition is insufficient and low-quality food after 6 months of age especially between 6 and 24 months when children need energy foods and micronutrients such as zinc and vitamin a black et al 2008 bouts of diarrhea and respiratory illness leave young children further weakened because foods were withheld during illness or not added during recovery malnutrition is therefore a problem that requires coordinated research by psychologists nutritionists and agricultural experts who 2003we now know from neuroscience and nutrition research that the consequences of early malnutrition are long-lasting malnourished children have less resistance to infection partly because they lack vitamin a and zinc they have less energy to play and explore their world because they lack iron in their diets and lose what they have to hookworm infection many still do not receive iodine from salt fortification iodine and iron are essential nutrients for cognitive and language development even breast milk with its long-chain fatty acids allows for better brain development so there is a great deal of evidence that daily good nutrition in the early years is important for psychological development it is also important for school achievement and later productivitymalnourished children also often receive less stimulating talk from parents opportunities for stimulation in the home can be measured with the home inventory which in modified form has been used around the world bradley et al 1996 children need to hear language directed at them in response to their signals and sounds children need to play with objects not ready-made toys but blocks to stack and things to push and pull they need playmates for pretend play and games one study in jamaica gave prominence to the need for psychosocial stimulation in the early years stunted children under 2 years who received stimulation at home from a play leader for 2 years with or without extra food did better on cognitive and language tests several years later than those who received extra food alone here we see that nutrition alone is insufficient the brain needs early stimulation along with food possibly the stimulation kept children mentally and physically active which in turn led them to demand more fooda series of papers published in the lancet engle black behrman et al 2007 grantham-mcgregor et al 2007 walker wachs meeks gardner et al 2007 uses figures on stunting and poverty to estimate that over 200 million children or approximately 40 of children less than 5 years do not reach their mental potential the relation between stunting and poor development is so strong that they decided to include all stunted children in this group  30 of less than 5 years to that they added children who were not stunted but lived in extreme poverty ie they lived on less than us1 per day only half of these poor children were stunted including the other half raised the numbers with poor development to 40 their inability to reach their developmental potential is largely determined by malnutrition and inadequate stimulation which in turns leads to poor school achievement and early drop-out the economic prospects of these children are not likely to lift them out of daily wage work or subsistence farmingtwo new areas of research are being conducted in the usa as well as in developing countries one concerns teaching mothers to be more responsive when feeding and stimulating their children a second is school feeding both emphasize the need for food and stimulation which separately and together contribute to child health and developmentwhat happens to a child in the first 3 years sets the stage for many years to come extensive research on secure attachment in the usa demonstrates the profound and long-term impact of early security we know that children are born with certain biological tendencies eg temperament and needs eg for warmth tactile stimulation and food research has shown that as obvious as these needs are not all children receive them in a responsive manner eshel et al 2006 kangaroo care is the method for maintaining skin-to-skin contact between a mother and newborn to respond to needs for warmth this is particularly important in places where newborns die because mothers are unaware of newborns needs for warmth and breast milk kangaroo care is promoted in the usa for low birthweight babies but universally encouraged in countries where over 40 of newborns are under 2500 glikewise stimulation must be responsive to the childs needs young children usually signal their need for stimulation by crying waving looking smiling and vocalizing they also signal the desire for a reduction in stimulation by looking away children whose signals are answered learn to continue this kind of mutual communication which eventually becomes shared conversation children whose signals are not answered stop signaling but remain distressed although responsive stimulation and responsive language has been studied extensively in the usa the american size does not fit all akhtar and gernsbacher 2008 argue convincingly that the distal form of communication studied in middle class families namely looking gaze is uncommon in developing countries and even in the usa this is because tactile stimulation is more common likewise others have shown that the american context in which responsive stimulation and language is studied namely motherchild play rarely occurs in developing countries vandermaas-peeler 2002 play is seen as a child activity adults are unlikely to play with child toys or is this necessary so we need to select other contexts to study one of these is reading or looking at pictures the concept of dialogic reading namely having a dyadic conversation about the story book has been successfully exported from the usa and adapted to other countries even if mothers are illiterate they may talk in a responsive manner with their child about pictures it even works well when adapted to the preschool setting where the teacher can generate a responsive discussion with a group of children as heshe reads the storythe other context for responsive stimulation and language is mealtime a new field of responsive complementary feeding is documenting the lack of responsive feeding in many countries around the world this leads to malnutrition in developing countries surprisingly we see that the same problem leads to obesity in the usa the underlying theme might be that children stop noticing their bodily cues of hunger and satiety if caregivers feed them in an unresponsive manner it is not that the childs body tells it exactly what to eat and how much but good eating habits should start early and require motherchild coordination in some countries mothers are highly controlling and insist on feeding quickly and forcefully without consideration of the childs slower pace and desire to self-feed these mothers may encounter frequent refusals despite the malnourished state of the child eg aboud et al 2008 in other countries mothers are uninvolved and let children fend for themselves or are permissive and give children whatever they demand none of these styles is responsive this research sheds light on the style of feeding which in combination with the quality of foods can lead to malnutrition or obesityin addition to responsive feeding and stimulation in the home researchers are evaluating the benefits of providing food in a setting where childrens brains are expected to be active namely at school school feeding was common in the usa during the 1930s depression and is still common in poor districts it is now sponsored by the world food program in developing countries where some 18 million children receive a daily meal at school httpwwwwpforgfoodaidschoolfeeding education researchers examine whether it increases enrolment and attendance  it does nutritionists study the kinds of foods that will improve weight and height psychologists question whether students benefit in terms of school achievement as well as broader social and cognitive skills studies in jamaica south africa and kenya along with many others have now been conducted in a nutshell they tell us that animal source foods such as meat or fish have a stronger impact than a vegetable-based meal and the impact is greatest on arithmetic and nonverbal analytic reasoning skills neumann et al 2007 meat also results in students who are more active take leadership roles and initiate peer interactions furthermore the impact on mental outcomes is greatest for younger children in the early school years finally in line with the theme of this section the impact is greater if food is combined with a stimulating educational programthis final section brings us full circle education is known to be important along with the nutrition necessary for young brains to process information and learn however nutrition must start early at birth to prepare the childs physical mental and social health nutrition is cumulative in that the body cannot fully catch up if given food at 5 years but not earlier however the effects of responsive feeding behavior and food on childrens long-term development are still being explored more needs to be done to examine how nutrition and stimulation combine to promote all aspects of health  physical mental and social  in the preschool and school years nutrition and education are also important for maternal health but future research here needs to examine how to change delivery practices and their effects on mothers and newborns survival similarly ongoing research is examining ways to change other health behaviors and sustain these behaviors in particular behaviors that prevent debilitating diseases are at the forefront of international research american researchers from many disciplines are contributing to these exciting new developments bringing ideas from the usa to developing countries and returning with strategies to improve our own livesaboud f e 1998 health psychology in global perspective thousand oaks sagelewis s 2005 race against time toronto on

httpwwwwhointnutritionthe covid-19 pandemic has forced governments to enact drastic public health measures in order to minimize the impact of the disease these include social distancing but also clear recommendations of lockdown for the elderly that said if my grandmother was alive it would have been very hard to convince her not to go out and play cards at the social club even if the head of the government that she voted for was urging elderlies to stay home beyond my anecdotical grandmother we have seen many headlines in the media about generational differences the boston globe titled an article call your mom the generational politics of covid-19 and the telegraph wrote generation me must start thinking about others if were to stop the spread of coronavirus as a headline moreover on top of the media coverage there is a burgeoning number of data on age differences in attitudes and compliance to preventive measures in the context of the covid-19epidemiologists are crystal clear age is the most important factor in diminishing ones chances to survive the covid-19 especially after 65 years of age 12 hence governments strategy around the world has notably focused on targeting elderly people and trying to convince them to comply with the public health preventive measures 3 given the well-known greater mortality rate among elderly people and the clear objective of the governments around the world it is very reasonable to expect the elderly people to be the most dutiful group in the population that is we should expect them to be more willing to isolate if they were told to do so and to comply with preventive measures to a greater extent than their younger fellow citizensin this research i test these expectations using the imperial college london and yougov dataset it is to my knowledge the most extensive dataset including attitudes toward covid-19 and self-reported compliance to preventive measures the results from 27 countries are unfortunately clear and quite troubling that is elderly peoples prospect to self-isolate and willingness to do so is not the greatest among the whole population it is very similar to people in their 50s and 60s despite the fact that they are much more likely to die from the disease moreover the same applies to their level of compliance with many different covid-19 preventive measuresthis research improves our understanding and response to the covid-19 pandemic with clear descriptions methodological implications and normative concerns i it provides the first thorough description of the most vulnerable populations attitudes and compliance to covid-19 preventive measures in a comparative perspective ii the results clearly suggest that scholars interested in the covid-19 pandemic should not take for granted the linearity of the effect of age ii it clearly shows that governments strategies are not meeting their objectives and thus should be revisited the pandemic is far from over and we need to find better ways to minimize the number of deaths while improving our understanding of elderly people is not a panacea it would help minimize the number of deathsalthough we should be very cautious in dichotomizing age when it comes to deciding who needs intensive care by giving the resources to young people and not to the elderly for an important discussion on the ethical considerations see monter-odasso et al 4 age is clearly the most important factor in predicting the odds of surviving the covid-19 disease 12 in fact this is among the most robust consensus among scientists in an ideal world that alone should justify the expectation that older people will be more dutiful in terms of following public health recommendations however the issue is not that straightforwardcovid-19 is not the only disease for which the consequences are known to be the worst among older people this is the case for invasive pneumococcal disease or heat stroke among others in both cases there are existing preventive measures however schneeberg et al 5 have shown that among canadians the relationship between age and having gotten a pneumococcal vaccine is non-linear 45 of 65-69-year-olds did so a proportion that increases to 67 among the 70-79-year-olds but decreases by 6 percentage points for the 80 year-old group 5 moreover khare et al 6 demonstrated that among english people where there was an important heat wave in 2013 older people were not more likely to have greater scores on always keeping out of the sun between 100 and 1500 the 26-60-year-olds were more likely to comply with that preventive behaviour but the 76 year-olds were not compared to the youngest 1825 groupthat said the mortality rate of covid-19 among elderly people is objectively speaking much greater than other diseases such as pneumococcal disease or heat stroke moreover the governments and citizens reactions and measures to minimize the consequences of that disease are of a totally different scale hence it is very reasonable to expect that older people will be more dutiful when it comes to following the recommendation of public health agencies and governmentsthis is what one of the first studies in the united states showed older americans were more likely to perceive covid-19 as a significant crisis and as a threat to peoples health 7 the effect was quite linear in both cases the older the respondents the more likely they were to perceive the covid-19 as a threat several academic studies also examined the impact of age on attitudes toward the covid-19 pandemic and compliance with different preventive measures many studies measure the effect of age using linear models which is consistent with the raw findings of the pew research center cited above and is in fact very intuitivesee among others painter and qiu 8 for a study on the us pfattheicher et al 9 for a focus on the united kingdom and germany and brouard et al 10 for france some do allow non-linear relationships between age and covid-19 related attitudes or behaviours but they only do so as a control ie they focus other explanatory factors and thus only include age to obtain more precise estimates and do not discuss its implications 1112 in other words the majority of research does not include age as having a potentially non-linear effect on different variables related to covid-19however two studies provide more information on age and elderlies response to covid-19 first barari et al 13 do not focus on age but display their descriptive statistics over four different age groups including those over 60 years old although the authors do not discuss thoroughly the age effects it appears that the 60 age group is the most disciplined or dutiful group in regards to all nine attitudes or measures of compliance towards preventive rules and proceduressee their figs 1 and 4 thus barari et al 13 seem to confirm the expected relationship citizens are more dutiful with ageat least in their sample of italian peopleanother very insightful research is that of canning et al 14 who study a sample of us respondents the authors allow non-linearity in their analyses by dividing age in six different groupssee in particular their fig 3 their findings not only show a non-linear relationship among age groups but also that age has a contrary effect on social distancing than expected during the covid-19 pandemic this research while insightful is limited to a us sample includes a low number of observations among certain age groups like the 70 years of age and focuses on social distancing in this research i aim to extend the sample to include 27 countries with much more observations in each age group and study more than just social distancing below i detail the empirical strategy to do sothe institute of global health innovation ighi at imperial college london and the polling firm yougov have partnered to gather global insights on citizens perceptions and responses to the covid-19 pandemic 15 the project started the first week of april and surveys have now been systematically conducted in 29 different countriesfor a discussion on timing see the robustness check section i combined all the individual country datasets that include a nationally representative sample of each population i thus excluded china and india which do not fit this criterion that is their samples were not nationally representative the following countries are thus included australia brazil canada denmark finland france germany hong kong italy japan malaysia south korea mexico netherlands norway philippines saudi arabia singapore south korea spain sweden taiwan thailand united arab emirates uae united kingdom uk united states usa and vietnam while not exhaustive this sample of countries provides a great deal of variance in terms of many important features such as quality of democracy economic development and inequality cultural diversity political institutions etc it is to my knowledge the most extensive comparative individual-level and covid-19 related datasetoverall it includes a total of 72417 respondents across 27 countries with an average age of 45 years old a standard deviation of 15 and 51 of respondents being women as mentioned the samples are nationally representative of a country based on age sex and region s1 and s2 tables provides more information on the dataset and the variables finally see the sms first page on how to access the replication filesthe surveys systematically included measures of attitudes and self-reported behaviors related to the covid-19 the two attitudes were i prospective self-isolation and ii willingness to isolate the correlation among the two does not cause concern pearsons r of 31 the question wording and the answer choices are detailed belowprospective self-isolation thinking about the next 7 days  would you isolate yourself after feeling unwell or having any of the following new symptoms a dry cough fever loss of sense of smell loss of sense of taste shortness of breath or difficulty breathing yes no not surewillingness to isolate if you were advised to do so by a healthcare professional or public health authority to what extent are you willing or not to self-isolate for 7 days very willing somewhat willing neither willing nor unwilling somewhat unwilling very unwilling not sureprospective self-isolation is used as a dichotomous variable where yes is coded as 1 and no or not sure as 0 the willingness to isolate is rescaled from 0 to 1 where 1 corresponds to very willing and not sure is coded as 05 ie the same value as neither willing nor unwilling to measure self-reported behaviors we rely on a question asking about the frequency of several preventive measures self-reported behavior regarding preventive measures will certainly entail a social desirability bias 16 that said it would prevent inference only if there is systematic bias regarding who is affected by the social desirability bias we do not have any theoretical reasons to believe sothis is confirmed by larsen et al 17 who made use of an experimental design to tackle this issue in other words the bias could ideally be reduced and let citizens more readily admit non-compliance but it should not prevent statistical inference the question was formulated as follows with the different items shown belowthinking about the last 7 days how often have you taken the following measures to protect yourself or others from coronavirus covid-19i did not include the following four items because they would overwhelmingly apply or overwhelmingly not apply to elderly people i avoided going to hospital or other healthcare settings ii avoided working outside your home iii avoided letting your children go to school university iv slept in separate bedrooms at home when normally you would share a bedroomsee the first test of the robustness checks section for detailsanswer choices were always frequently sometimes rarely not at all we rescaled all the variables in a 0 to 1 range excluding the not sure descriptive statistics for every variable are shown in s2 table however i combined all the 16 items listed above to generate an index of compliance with preventive measures cronbachs   86 for the sake of parsimony i discuss some particular items that prove to be outliers in the findings see the robustness check section for a discussion on the operationalization of the itemsfinally age ranges from 18 to 90 14 respondents were in their 90s but i excluded age values for which there was less than 10 observations hence the range 1890 fig 2 below shows the distribution of age beyond the scope of the dataset one of its main advantages is that the number of observations allow us to study many age values there are even several hundreds of respondents over 60 years of age i do not aim to provide a definition of elderly people for the simple reason that of course it is a socially constructed concept and can vary among individuals and across countries are findings also do not defer whether we consider an elderly to be 60 65 or 70that said the number of people that are 80 years old or older is quite limited s3 table shows the number of observations using 10-year categories and we can see that there are only 544 respondents within the 8090 years old range as in several inquiries in social sciences it is likely that the dataset used in this research does not include a homogenous group of 80 year-olds due to the lower number of observations in that category for an example see blais and daoust 18 who mention that they are less confident about their subsample of 75 year-old respondents this should be kept in mind and explains the focus on the 1880 years old rangeconsidering our main interest one can access the distribution of age and the measures of attitudes and compliance towards covid-19 preventive measures in s1 fig the bivariate relationships of age with the prospective self- isolation and the willingness to do so are shown in fig 2 to allow for non-linearity i used local regressions with the kernel epanechnikov function and a bandwidth of 08 see the robustness checks section for a discussion of this choicein both cases using age as a linear predictor of these two attitudes toward covid-19 preventive measures would indicate a strong panel a or somewhat important panel b relationships however this interpretation would be misleading for the simple reason that the relationship is not linear in panel a the relationship is flat between 70 and 75 years of age and declines until the age of 90 for the reasons mentioned above we should be careful with the 80-90-year-olds even if the confidence intervals increase as the number of observations diminishes however it still leaves us with a quite pessimistic interpretation in the most optimistic case elderly people would not be substantially more likely to isolate compared to their fellow citizens in their 50s and 60sin panel b on the willingness to isolate the effect of age is much smaller but clearly positive until 60 years of age from that point on there is substantially no relationship for both attitudes we clearly fail to see an increased prospective disciplined or willingness for people after 70 years old panel a and 60 years of age panel b this is surprising and quite troubling given the governments strategy to publicize the fact that elderly people are much more vulnerable and more likely to need intense care or die from covid-19 i now turn to compliance with preventive measuresas it is clear from eyeballing fig 3 this is no substantial effect of age on ones score of compliance with covid-19 preventive measures overall the score for every age is substantively similar and is around 12 it ranges from a minimum of 119 to a maximum of 124 for a total effect of 05 on a 0 to 16 scale put differently it represents less than a fifth of the standard deviation of the index there are thus two main conclusions to fig 3 on the one hand the baseline level of compliance with preventive measures is quite high although not overwhelmingly high especially given that the maximum is 16 on the other hand there is no substantial effect of agethe index included 16 very different items in s2 fig i replicated the local regression for each item overall the main conclusion remains the same there is no substantial effect of age on compliance to covid-19 public health measures however there are some interesting variances by far the most interesting concerns wearing a mask outside the homefig 4 panel a shows the results the effect of age on wearing a mask outside is negative quite linear and the strongest among all the relationships for individual items from 20 to 60 years old there is a decrease of about 15 and there is another decrease of the same magnitude from 60 to 80 years of age before stabilizing the total effect is thus of 3 on a 0 to 1 scale it is astonishing that this particular age group 6080 years old which is much more likely to die from the disease than their younger fellow citizens comply to a lesser extent with the preventive measure of wearing a masksee feng et al 2020 for a discussion on recommendations around the world regarding face masks in community settingsslightly reassuring the other three items for which the effect is noteworthy although not even close to the negative impact of age on wearing a mask outside the home are positive older people are more likely to have avoided public transportation small gatherings and having guests over these effects are of a little more than 10in this section i test whether different choices in my approach would lead to different conclusions first i have excluded four items out of twenty in order to generate the index of compliance see footnote 3 but including them does not alter the findings as shown in s3 fig there is no substantial relationship second i have coded the not sure as people who would not self-isolate if they were told do so for the prospective isolation measure and i have put them at 05 with the neither willing nor unwilling for the compliance items s4a and s4b fig shows that excluding the not sure instead of putting them at 0 in the former case and excluding them instead of coding them at the neutral point in the latter case does not change the resultssecond i opted for an elegant way of presenting the results and did not include covariates to keep other factors constant some might worry about the impact of the national context and time over the five weeks it is likely that respondents attitudes are shaped by what happens in their country but i cannot think of convincing mobilizing national factors or time that would affect the relationship and not the distributions of age and attitudes toward covid-19 and compliance to preventive measures that said i replicated the models for the main results using logistic and ols regressions and used age as a categorical variable with values ranging from 18 to 90 to allow for non-linear effects i then estimated the predicted probability to self-isolate for every two-years change given the number of observations among respondents in their 80s that strategy allows to include country fixed-effect and covariates for time and individual-level variables the dataset does not include the exact date of the interview but as shown in s1 table the dates of the field are included hence i included dichotomous variables capturing whether the survey was fielded the first two weeks of april the last two weeks of april or in the first week of may for individual-level variable i include gender employment status in 8 categories having children at home and living alone 20 s5 fig shows the results with country fixed-effects covariates for time and individual-level controls the patterns are substantially similarhowever one may also want to include region fixed-effects to adopt a more conservative approach in terms of within-country regional differences the 27 countries vary in terms of how many regions they have but yougov provides a variable indicating respondents region based on what is used for the regional quotas it can be state lnder region province etc there are on average 89 regions per country s6 fig replicates the previous figure with the only exception that i added 236 region fixed effects this kind of estimation strategy controls for the fact that people in the uk are in the uk as opposed to another country however it also controls for a respondent in for example wales a region of the uk for whom the reality related to covid-19 might be different compared to respondents in other regions in the uk such as scotland or england for example as can be seen this does not alter the substantial interpretation of the findings one could think about adding covariates like 236 dummies to capture every region minus one as a reference category in the 27 countries included also mixed-effects logistic and linear regressions could be used where individuals are nested within countriesor within regions then within countries all these approaches do not alter the main findingsthird i showed local regressions with the default bandwidth of 08 s7 and s8 figs replicate the findings with a bandwidth of 07 and 09 these results not only confirm my conclusions but suggest an even more pessimistic scenario that is for attitudes about prospective self-isolation and willingness to isolate the lower confidence intervals decrease among the oldest to a level that is similar to the youngest people in their 20s all in all the difference is somewhat modest but points toward an even more negative picturegovernments around the world are working to reduce the number of deaths caused by the covid-19 while overcoming this pandemic relies on an efficient strategy that involves the whole population the elderly people are disproportionately affected by this disease thus attitudes toward covid-19 and compliance toward preventive measures among the older citizens will have a greater effect on minimizing the number of deaths hence there is a burgeoning literature on age and covid-19 which will be crucial in improving our responses to the pandemic however we have no systematic comparative perspective and most importantly age has been conceived to have a linear impact on a variety of dependent variables related to covid-19 i am not blaming scholars as even early rigorous work has shown results consistent with this view in the us but not only 7 13 that said i provided a thorough analysis of the impact of age with a focus on elderly people allowing for non-linear effects moreover i did so using a comparative perspective including 27 countriesthe findings show that the elderly people ie the most vulnerable population are not systematically more responsive in terms of prospective self-isolation if they were told to do so and willingness to isolate moreover they are not more disciplined in terms of compliance with preventive measures especially with wearing a face mask when outside their home this behaviour will become especially important when social distancing rules will be loosened this is surprising because it is very reasonable to expect that those who are more likely to be hospitalized andor die from the covid-19 will be more disciplined and dutiful whether we focus on psychological reactions such as fear or rational calculus we always have the same expectation not only is this surprising but it is also troubling why do we find such results clearly it is not due to a ceiling effect there is room for improvement in every figure shown in this research and especially when dealing with compliance such as the index or wearing a face mask there may be short-term or more deeply rooted predispositions among older people that can partly explain this non-effect but either way governments must revisit their approach in order to minimize the number of deaths caused by covid-19methodologically speaking this research is also important for scholars studying covid-19 some have put effort to capture a non-linear effect but this is not the case for the majority of the work in particular while using a us sample and focusing on social distancing canning et al 14 mention holding other factors constant people over 50 years of age have less than half the expected number of close contacts than people age 1829 this sounds like good news but we know that older people especially after 60 are more affected hence we should not see a positive effect of age until 50 but rather until 70 and ideally moreall in all focusing on age is not a panacea but it disproportionately helps to minimize the number of deaths 2122 by contributing to the research on age and the covid-19 i hope to improve our response which will lead us closer to that objectivethe perception of the covid-19 pandemic in my homeland croatia has been based on two main sources of information over the past three weeks on the one hand our civil protection headquarters as well as all of the experts and scientists to whom media space has been provided called for caution but without any panic they emphasized that this was not a cataclysm but an epidemic involving a serious respiratory infectious disease the cause of this disease is the new coronavirus for which we do not have a vaccine therefore it can be expected that the disease will be very dangerous for the elderly and to those who are already ill so it was an unknown danger worthy of caution but our epidemiologists remained calm they knew that they would be able to estimate the epidemics development using data and then control the situation with anti-epidemic measures and through several lines of defence 1on the other hand the people of croatia also followed the events in italy from there day after day apocalyptic news came with incredibly large numbers of infected and dead daily reports from italy seemed completely incompatible with what the experts and scientists in croatia were saying some have concluded that a scenario similar to that in italy if not worse is inevitable for croatia the population was in a very confusing situationin this text i will try to penetrate the very core of the infodemia that has been present in the media across many european countries as well as on social networks over the past three weeks i will explain how that disturbing situation arose and offer a scientific explanation for it this seems important at this point because the italian tragedy with the covid-19 epidemic has unfortunately hindered the credible and scientifically-based communication of the epidemiological profession to the population of croatiain my article 20 key questions and answers on coronavirus posted on the 9th of march 2020 on indexhr 1 in answer to question number 18 with the effectiveness of quarantine in china can we draw some lessons from this pandemic i statedif the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the public health systems of individual countries are functioning these will be very important lessons in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerouswe are now slowly entering a phase where many countries have been exposed to the pandemic for sufficiently long to be able to make some first estimates of their results from these days up until the end of the pandemic we will see that covid-19 will divide the world into countries that have relied on epidemiology and followed the maths and the logic of the epidemic as well as those in which this isnt the case and many sadly probably quite unnecessarily  will sufferan epidemic is a serious threat to entire nations during which citizens interest in other topics may vanish quite rapidly we could see that happening quite clearly in the past several weeks the task of epidemiologists is to constantly have tables in front of them with a large number of epidemic parameters reliable field figures and formulas to monitor the epidemics development and to know the laws of epidemics in order to organize the implementation of anti-epidemic measures in a timely manner and thus protect the populationnow lets look at the countries that we can already point out as being successful in their response to this new challenge first and foremost there is china it has completely suppressed the huge epidemic in wuhan which spread to all thirty of its provinces in doing so it relied on the advice of its epidemiologic legend 83-year-old zhong nanshan twenty years ago nanshan gained authority by suppressing sars although surprised by the epidemic they managed to suppress covid-19 throughout china through expert and determined measures they did so over just seven weeks with the death toll eventually coming to a halt at less than 4000 2 by comparison it would be as if the number of deaths in croatia as a result of this epidemic was kept at around 14 in totalfurthermore if at some point you find yourself caught up in the uncertainty surrounding the danger of covid-19 you should be able to learn more if you look at the state of things in singapore despite intensive exchanges of people and goods with china since the outbreak of the epidemic singapore has a total of 732 infected people as i am writing this article with two dead and 17 more in intensive care 2 for a long time this city-state has been nurturing the ambition to lead the world in all measurable parameters from this it must be concluded that the developments in singapore are a likely reflection of the real danger of covid-19 in a country that is based on knowledge technology good organization and general responsibility also singapore had a relatively recent sars experience and learned from it so they built capacity and ensured speed in their response to future challenges the situation in singapore therefore is an indicator of the effects of the virus on the population to the extent that it is truly unavoidableany deviation towards something worse than the singaporean results will be less and less of a consequence of the danger of the virus itself and increasingly attributable to human omissions in doing so human errors that can lead to the unnecessary spread of the infection are 1 omission to properly understand the epidemic parameters 2 reluctance to make decisions based on the changes in those parameters and 3 the irresponsible behavior of the population in complying with instructions from the authoritiesto confirm the statements about singapore lets look at the current situation in other countries that rely on knowledge and expertise and have good organization they were also the most common destinations for the spread of the epidemic from china in the first wave hong kong japan south korea the united arab emirates and qatar there were only 519 infected people in hong kong at the time of writing this article with 4 deaths and 5 more people in a serious condition in japan 1499 were infected 49 were dead and 56 were in a serious condition in south korea which had a severe epidemic behind its first line of defence 9478 were infected 144 died and 59 were seriously ill in the united arab emirates 405 were infected 2 died and 2 were seriously ill and in qatar 562 were infected 6 were seriously ill and still no one had died from covid-19 2fortunately croatia is now up there with all of these countries with 657 infected 5 dead and 14 more seriously ill 2 as you can see pretty clearly from all of these figures in countries that rely on the knowledge and the profession and properly applied anti-epidemic measures covid-19 is a disease that should not be life-threatening for more than a tiny percentage of all infected people this conclusion can still be reached if it is properly understood that the information on the number of cases and deaths at the website httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus 2 is based on positive tests and not on everyone who is actually infected we need to do further research to understand the denominator for the case-fatality rate properlywhat then is happening in italy as well as in spain but to a good extent also in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and portugal i did not include germany sweden the netherlands the united kingdom and the united states in this group of countries for now this is because at least for some time during the pandemic they have clung to the idea of intentionally letting the virus spread and infect at least part of the populationgiven all of the previous examples of a successful epidemiological response and what is now practically the coexistence of people with the new coronavirus in asias most developed countries how is it possible for italy to have nearly 85 000 infected people and over 9000 deaths at the time of this article or that spain has 72 000 infected people and more than 5600 deaths and france has almost 33 000 infected people and 2000 deaths or that even switzerland which everyone would expect to see among the most successful countries in any of these world rankings could already have 13 250 infected people and 240 deaths with 203 more critically ill people 2 the causes of all of this are however becoming increasingly clear to sciencefirst of all there was probably a premature relaxation around the real danger of covid-19 in europe the epidemic development by the end of february was already quite similar to the one seen previously with sars and mers in both of those epidemics the primary focal point was suppressed then the virus was stopped using the first line of defence  identifying all those infected tracing their contacts and isolating them all  in more than 25 countries by the end of february 2020 it was already clear in the case of covid-19 that it would be successfully suppressed in its primary focal point  wuhan it was also already stopped using the first line of defence in another thirty chinese provinces and surrounding countries in asia then on the 28th of february the first estimates of death rates were published suggesting that it was a disease with a death rate significantly lower than that of sars and mers 34 at that time it was reasonable to expect that the epidemic could soon be stopped as a result the world health organisation delayed the declaration of a pandemic until the 11th of march and the world stock markets increased by about 10 percent from the 27th of february to the 3rd of march 56 but for any unknown virus premature relaxation is very dangerous as will be shown later with covid-19second it is possible that chinese tourists from wuhan were visiting northern italy in january and february 2020 fever does not accompany all covid-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission is possible so infected tourists could have been allowed to enter italy even where proper checks at the airports were in place 4 italy cancelled flights linking it directly with china on january 31 following the news of the epidemic spread 7 some investigative journalists hypothesized although this has not been confirmed that it may be possible that the phenomenon of the mass immigration of chinese workers to northern italy may have contributed to the early introduction and spread of the virus 8 tens of thousands of chinese migrants work in the italian textile industry producing fashion items leather bags and shoes with the brand made in italy they worked in conditions where they were cramped closely together which would facilitate the spread 8-10 reuters and the reporter d t max wrote about this phenomenon back in 2014 and 2018 respectively 910 partly as a result of this development direct flights between wuhan and italy were introduced previous reports claimed that there may be many illegal migrants among those workers 910 whether through chinese tourists textile workers or through some other route the novel coronavirus has triggered an epidemic behind the back of the italian first line of defence which remained unrecognized in the first few weeksthird infected people from northern italy spent their weekends at european ski resorts although we do not know if the arrival of the warmer weather will stop the transmission of coronavirus what we can assume is that the cold helped it to spread that is why european ski resorts became real nurseries of coronavirus in late february and in early march as many media reported 1112 in this way more infected people emerged behind the front lines of defence in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and spain their first lines of epidemiological defence focused on air transport from asia not on their own skiing returnees where indeed no one would expect a large number of chinese people from wuhan to befourth although spain may not have had as many skiers as other european countries in this cluster the virus may have been introduced to them through a biological bomb on the 19th of february a champions league football match was held between italys atalanta and spains valencia atalanta is a team from a small city of bergamo italy which has 120 000 inhabitants this was possibly the biggest game in atalantas history as it progressed through group stages to the last 16 in the european champions league the local stadium was not large enough for everyone who wanted to attend the game so it was moved to a large san siro stadium in milan the official attendance was 45 792 meaning that a third of bergamos population with around 30 busses travelled from bergamo to milan and then wandered the streets of milan before the game 1314 unfortunately for spain nearly 2500 valencia fans also travelled to the match as atalanta scored four goals a third of bergamos population was hugging and kissing in the cold weather four times and spent the day closely together this is likely why it became the worst-hit region of italy by some distance moreover at least a third of valencia football squad also got infected with a virus and later played alaves in the spanish league where further players of that team got infected this football game has certainly contributed to the virus making its way to spain 14fifth it is very important for the early development of the epidemiological situation in each country to look at which subset of the population the virus has spread among northern italy has a very large number of very old people in the early stages of the epidemic the virus began to spread in hospitals and retirement homes 1516 they did not have nearly enough capacities to assist in severe cases among already sick elderly and immunocompromised people the virus spread more easily and faster and had a significantly higher death rate in some other countries such as germany most of the patients in the early stages were between the ages of 20 and 60 and were returning from skiing trips or were business people 17 therefore such countries have a significantly lower death rate among those first infectedsixth this is likely the most important factor required to explain the current situation in italy and other european union eu countries there must have been either the omission to monitor the mathematical parameters of the epidemic or perhaps the lack of clear communication of the dangers or the indecisiveness to adopt isolation measures for the population it is difficult to know at this time which of these three causes is the most important  a combination of them all is entirely possible however the nature of the omission largely explains the terrible figures on infections and deaths that are being reported from italy and other eu countries on a daily basisto understand the tragedy in italy and europe we must first return to wuhan when the epidemic broke out the chinese first had to isolate the virus then they needed to read its genetic code and develop a diagnostic test it all took time as the epidemic spread rapidly throughout the city when they began testing for coronavirus between the 18th and the 20th of january they had double-digit numbers of infected people 3 those numbers apparently stagnated so the epidemiologists did not know what that might mean but on the 21st of january the number of newly infected people jumped to more than 100 on the 22nd of january it jumped to more than 200 3 this was a clear signal to chinese epidemiologists that an exponential increase in the number of infected people was occurring at that time they had nothing further to wait for or to think about if the virus breaks through the first line of defence  and the chinese didnt even have any since the epidemic started there unannounced  then a quarantine measure needs to be triggered this prevents the virus from spreading further and generating a large number of infected people through the exponential growth of the epidemicafter such a sudden declaration of quarantine in wuhan the huge epidemic wave had actually just begun to show everyone who was already infected began to develop the disease in the next several days the maximum daily number of new infected cases was reached on the 5th of february on that day alone as many as 3750 new patients were registered in wuhan 3 this means that the jump from about 125 to about 250 newly registered infected persons signals to epidemiologists that they should expect an epidemic surge in 14 days with as many as 3750 newly infected people at the peaklet us now explain the time delay between people getting infected with a virus and the health systems ability to detect those infected based on their symptoms the new coronavirus kills primarily because it spreads incredibly quickly among humans as a result it creates a gigantic number of infected and sick in a very short time period table 1 among those who are sick about 5 will require intensive hospital care if all of them could receive optimal care we would be able to save nearly everyone but if they all get very sick at the same time then we cannot offer adequate care to everyone as a result most critical cases will die this is the main reason why this virus kills so many people in those countries which allowed it to spread freely for too long this is shown in a simple way in this table based on day-to-day growth in a number of cases by 26 which was a very realistic scenario for most eu countrieswith this in mind let us now look at the italian and other eu countries reaction to their own epidemic in view of what croatia did in the early stages of infection spreading in a country one or two infected persons are usually detected dailypersonally i advised the croatian authorities and public through social networks to start seriously thinking about social exclusion measures when they noticed a first notable shift from the first 10 confirmed infections towards the first 20 infected people on the 12th of march i posted a facebook status entitled contrast is the mother of clarity which was viewed and shared by many thousands of my fellow croatians who have been following my popular science series on the pandemics  the quarantine of wuhan this status has also been shared by many online and printed newspapers and media in croatia including radio stations 18 in that status i suggested that croatia should consider a large quarantine because we had already jumped from 14 to 19 infected people the day before however i also warned them to weigh this decision carefully against economic implications and their expected long-term effects on health the very next day on the 13th of march a decision was made in croatia to close the schools 1819that meant that up to that point croatia completed two of the most important tasks in this pandemic the first task was to hold its first line of defence this was being achieved through the identification of infected cases imported from other countries and their isolation and that of all their contacts croatia completed this first task better than the other eu countries based on an average percentage increase of cases between the 3rd of march and the 17th of march then from march 13th croatia also began to introduce social exclusion measures at the right time thus successfully carrying out the second key task in controlling its own epidemic many credits for this should be attributed to its epidemiologists who work at the croatian institute for public healthbut what went wrong with these two measures in italy and other eu countries on the 21st of february the number of confirmed infected cases in italy jumped from 3 to 20 as italy is a more populous country than croatia it might have still been too hasty to send all of lombardy into quarantine based on this but on the 22nd of february the jump was from 20 to 62 cases and this should lead to some serious thought about social isolation measures a couple of days later on the 24th of february they reached a situation very similar to that in wuhan before a strict quarantine the number of confirmed infections jumped from 155 to 229 this was particularly worrying in italy because they did not seem to proactively test at that time eitherthe jump from 155 to 229 in combination with the wuhan experience should have suggested that they would have at least 50 000 infected people under the predicted curve of the epidemic wave and they were just seeing its early beginning of it such a large number would imply that about 2500 affected would require intensive care units at the time lombardy had only about 500 such units in governmentstate facilities and another 160 in private health care facilities 20 as early as the 24th of february it was clear that there would be many deaths in lombardy weeks later with epidemics everything goes awry because the infected get sick a week later and some of the patients then die ten to twenty days later this time delay is a critically important factor that needs to be taken into accounthowever even then the italians did not declare a quarantine they did not do so on the 29th of february either when the total number of infected people rose from 888 to 1128 those figures implied that in mere days they would be having about 15 000 newly infected people each day they did not declare quarantine on the 4th of march either when the number of infected people exceeded 3000 and when the world stock exchanges started to fall again it had then become clear to most epidemiologists who have been advising global investors that an unexpected tragedy was about to unravel in italy and this was now inevitable at that point italy already had at least 30 000 infected people spreading the infection the quarantine was declared for lombardy on the 8th of march 7 the day before the number of cases had already risen and exponentially so to as many as 5883to appreciate the problem with epidemic spread in the population behind the first line of defence this is similar to borrowing 1000 from someone on the 29th of february with an interest rate of 26 each day meaning an interest rate of 26 on top of that the next day and so on furthermore there did not seem to be enough clear and decisive communication with the public the news of the quarantine for lombardy was in fact leaked to the media before it was officially announced this led to a quick escape of many students to the south of the country to their homes carrying the contagion with them as a result on the 10th of march all of italy had to be quarantined 7in an already difficult situation where every new day of delay meant another thousand or more people dying as we can all notice these days there were numerous media reports warning that the population may not have taken those measures as seriously as the chinese when they introduced orders to their population in wuhan 2122 any indiscipline under such grave circumstances could have allowed the virus to take yet another step quite easily with each new step another 26 of interest was added to everything before that and then 26 on everything on everything before that again that is the power of exponential growth characteristic of the free spread of the virus in the populationmany italians and then spaniards as well as residents of several other wealthy countries in europe had their lives cut short by their lack of recognition of the dangers of exponential function during the spread of the epidemic delaying quarantine for a week made the epidemic ten times worse than it should have been delaying it for two weeks made it a hundred times worse and after two weeks of it being finally proclaimed all those who may have not taken the orders seriously enough would have made the epidemic several hundred times worse this means that in italy and possibly in spain too we are now observing the covid-19 epidemic that is more than a hundred times worse than it should have been in a country that was much better prepared for the response such as singapore taiwan hong kong or the united arab emiratesto appreciate what is happening in italy it is enough to think of this sentence alone at least 100 times fewer people would die each day if quarantine had been declared 2 weeks earlier and had the population stuck to the recommendations during those fourteen days between 23rd of february and 7th of march they allowed the virus to spread freely and infect a huge number of people  maybe even up to a million or perhaps more it is very difficult to know at this point this would mean tens of thousands of people in need of intensive care with about ten times fewer units available nationwide about half of those who fall seriously ill will not survive without the necessary support at this point whenever we hear that 1000 people died in italy in one day we should know that the casualties would only add up to 10 had the quarantine been declared just a couple of weeks earlier i appreciate that it seems implausible that the delay of a political decision like the introduction of quarantine by just two weeks may mean the difference between 100 deaths and 10 000 deaths in the 21st century however i am afraid that this is unfortunately the reality of the exponential growth of the number of infected during an epidemicwhat does this mean for the public in countries like croatia who were confused and in awe of the events in italy they should know that they did not observe what the covid-19 epidemic should actually look like in a country where the epidemiological service and its communication with those in power works well as it does in singapore taiwan or south korea in italy we have unfortunately noticed the consequence of a free spread of the epidemic for too long such a development was not predictable the biggest surprise of this pandemic to date to the community of epidemiologists is undoubtedly the lack of response by the authorities of many eu countries to the apparent spread of the pandemic at an exponential rate for weeks leading to a very large numbers of infected people in a very short time it is even more surprising that although the italian example exposed this problem quite clearly a similar scenario is now happening in several other european countrieshow and why could this happen in italy and then in other countries in the european union eu i will try to offer at least some hypotheses first eu countries have been living in prosperity for decades focused mainly on their economies aside from the economic questions they have not had any challenges that theyve had to answer to swiftly and decisively that would measure up to this one back in the 1960s vaccines were introduced against most major infectious diseases especially childhood ones malaria is no longer present in europe and tuberculosis has been treated similarly for decades the challenge of hivaids in the 1980s is now being successfully controlled with antiretroviral drugs liver inflammation is treated mainly by clinicians the impact of influenza is controlled through vaccination while rare zoonoses are resolved with immunoprophylaxis even sexually transmitted infectious diseases stds are no longer as significant since the vaccine for human papillomavirus hpv was licensedthe last real epidemic that concerned europe was the hong kong flu which occurred back in 1968 and 1969 the broad field of biomedicine offers such a wide range of exciting career paths to all those students who study it these days but the epidemiology of infectious diseases is not really one of them  or at least it hasnt been in europe for a very long time it has probably begun to seem like an archaic medical profession to the majority of students and young medical doctors it seemed to belong to the past for the european continent which made it one of the least attractive things to specialize ineven the rare epidemiologists who specialized in infectious diseases have begun retraining for chronic non-communicable diseases due to the aging of europes population which is particularly the case in italy and spain it seems that at least some eu countries may have fallen victims to their own decades-long success in the fight against infectious diseases they faced this unexpected pandemic with few experts that could have had any experience in these events asian countries as well as canada have had enough recent experience with sars and mers but some european countries seem to have forgotten how to fight infectious diseases if it were not for the legacy of the great croatian epidemiologist social medicine expert and global public health pioneer dr andrija tampar and the relatively recent war in croatia it is difficult to say whether or not croatia would be as ready as it has proven itself to beanother factor that would understandably undermine the italian response was that no one before italy in fact could have observed how fast covid-19 was spreading among the population the greatest danger of covid-19 is its accelerated exponential spread when it breaks through the first line of defence but before italy only the chinese in wuhan and the iranians had experienced the free spread of the infection among their population after five days of monitoring the number of infected the chinese had to quarantine the entire wuhan and then further 15 cities a day later in order to contain the virus they did not know how many infected people were there outside of wuhans hospitals for iran however only a few knew exactly what was happening as that country is significantly isolated internationally due to political reasons the koreans however had a limited local epidemic but not an uncontrolled free spread  they caught the virus using their first line of defencethat is how the italians ended up becoming the first country in the highly developed world to monitor their epidemic spreading uncontrollably among the population the only estimate of the rate of spread of the virus to date has been in the scientific work of li et al from the 29th of january 23 however it was difficult to subsequently determine r0 parameter on the first 425 patients in wuhan the estimate of the r0 for covid-19 in their article was 22 but with a very wide confidence interval  from 14 to 39 it is a bit of tough luck for the italians again that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 14 exactly this figure is well known to all epidemiologists its the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community it should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that with more data r0 for covid-19 would start converging more towards 14 unfortunately the more recent data suggests that r0 is more likely to lean towards 39 implying an incredibly fast spread thus the greatest danger of covid-19 remained unrecognized in italy until the 8th of march quarantine measures at least 100 times fewer people would be dying in italy these days had they declared a quarantine for lombardy two weeks earlier than they didjust a few days ago an extremely useful piece of scholarly work authored by onder et al became available 24 their contribution finally provided answers to the three great unknowns about covid-19 many hypotheses have been presented in the media to explain the developments in italy since the very outbreak of the epidemic but thanks to just one simple table we can now dispel most of themthe first is the question that has plagued us for a long time  how dangerous is covid-19 for younger age groups it is clear that the media will tend to single out individual cases of death in younger people as they are of most public interest however it is interesting that until recently we didnt really have decent data on this in the public domain the first reason was that the chinese centre for disease control reported all deaths in the chinese epidemic using age groups structure that contained a very large age group of 30-79 years it only separated children up to 10 years then adolescents up to 20 years then 20-29 year-olds followed by this broad age group 30-79 years and those who were 80 years or older that is why the work of onder and colleagues is commendable as they subdivided this large group from china into 10-year age groups this finally allowed a comparison between the first 1023 deaths in wuhan up to the 11th of february with the first 1625 deaths in italy up to the 17th of march the comparison is shown in table 2it gives us some very important insightsfirst in italy more than half of the deaths initially were among people who were older than 80 years of age and a total of 88 of the deaths occurred among the persons over 70 years of age so contrary to the impression that individual media reports can easily make covid-19 is a very dangerous disease mainly for old people moreover a recent study by a and g remuzzi 25 showed that among 827 deaths in italy the vast majority of those people were already severely ill with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease diabetes and malignancies this is what epidemiologists expected because a more severe flu would have had a similar effect if there was no vaccine available however i doubt that the general public has the proper insight into this issue from the prevalent media reportssecond it was suggested in the media across europe that the virus in italy may have mutated and become much more dangerous however table 2 shows that death rates by the age of 70 are practically the same in china and italy then although the case fatality rate appears to be about 50 greater in italy than in china for the age group 70-79 this does not suggest that the virus may have mutated it is known that in wuhan many of the affected with a severe clinical presentation of covid-19 could rely on the two newly built hospitals and respiratory aids that the military had brought in from other parts of china 26 they also had medical teams coming in from other provinces 26 in italy however there were not enough respirators for this age group and there werent enough doctors either as many of them themselves became infected 1620 for those two reasons i would in fact expect even a larger difference between italy and china than the one we are seeing so i would not attribute this observed difference to the impact of the virus itself and finally the reported difference in case-fatality rates for the oldest age group should also not be attributed to the virus it is more likely a consequence of the fact that italians of lombardy live on average longer than the chinese of wuhan 27 therefore there are significantly more people in the oldest age group in italy ranging to much higher ages so the two oldest groups are not really comparable the average age of the italians in the age group 80 years or older is significantly greater than the average age of the oldest chinese age group therefore the table shows practically equal death rates across all age groups on sufficiently large samples meaning that the virus did not mutate in italy from the virus we see from wuhan at least not until the 17th of march 2020third and perhaps most importantly  this chart has now made it quite clear that covid-19 does not in fact kill people under the age of 50 unless they have some sort of underlying disease or some unknown achilles heel in their immune system that makes them particularly susceptible to the virus there are such cases with every infectious disease they are also present during the flu epidemics but they are extremely rare this suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses here after this table it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available however at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years toothere is another strangeness to the situation in italy that will not be intuitive to the general public the actual number of deaths attributable to covid-19 in italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends namely at present due to the sole focus on the epidemic most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to covid-19 however once the epidemic is over it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years it could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month or a year even without being infected with the new coronavirus it is possible that among some of them covid-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels and those above expected levels will then be attributed to covid-19this article provides an explanation from the epidemiologists point of view for most of the events reported so far in italy and then followed in spain and other european countries a combination of an early relaxation over this epidemic systematic lack of expertise in the field of epidemic infectious diseases in europe likely inexperience in containing epidemic spread in this generation of health workers relaxed immigration regulations for workers in certain industries champions league football event and a series of further misfortunes and omissions have all been implied so far in the media as contributors to the late withdrawal of lombardy into quarantine this allowed through exponential growth for a large number of people to be infected in a very short time  far too large for health systems of italy and other eu countries to cope with severe forms of illness led to many deaths due to respiratory failure in 88 of cases people over 70 years of age died who had underlying illnesses in the large majority of cases this viewpoint is based on the first 1625 deaths in italy and by the time of this writing there are now more than 10 000 dead given the size of the population this would correspond to 670 deceased in croatia if croatia manages not to follow the numbers of deceased seen in italy this will mostly be attributable to social exclusion measures being introduced early enough for its health system to come with severe casesthese days the people of italy spain and other european countries are suffering large losses a significant underlying cause may be the problem that the human brain simply cannot intuitively grasp the power of exponential growth nor that two weeks of delay could make the difference between 100 and 10 000 deaths any physics enthusiasts will know the quote attributed to the great albert einstein who is often cited saying that compound interest which leads to exponential growth is the most powerful force in the universe or the eighth wonder of the world he who understands it earns it he who doesnt pays it 28the theoretical framework that guides the present study integrates an adapted version of goffmans conceptualization of stigma steward et al 2008 with gender role theory feld and radin 1982 eagly et al 2000 goffman 1963 explains that society stigmatizes on the basis of what is considered difference or deviance resulting in a spoiled identity and devalued status labeled as deviants stigmatized individuals view themselves and are viewed by others as undesirable mahajan et al 2008stigma is a social process characterized by exclusion rejection blame or devaluation and resulting from an experience of social judgment scrambler 2009 research suggests that stigma strengthens and reproduces existing inequalities of class race gender and sexuality parker and aggleton 2003 by directly affecting individuals via mechanisms of discrimination and indirectly via threats to personal and social identity major and obrien 2005 in addition stigma can have a dramatic bearing on the distribution of life changes in terms of several health outcomes including psychosocial development income housing criminal justice involvement education and life span link and phelan 2001gender role theory grt emphasizes the importance of ascribed positions that individuals acquire by birth in describing the context of hiv among women in india ascribed positions may refer to gender caste socioeconomic status and religion the ascribed position of gender significantly impacts the experience of living with hiv for people in india achieved positions refer to those roles earned on the basis of accomplishment or effort such as being a client of a nongovernmental organization ngo a community organizer for public access to hiv treatment or the spokesperson for a pharmaceutical company women in low-prestige ascribed positions may view the attainment of certain achieved positions such as achieving quality health care as out of their reach when ascribed and achieved positions conflict hiv discrimination can ensuerole theory postulates that the social behavior of individuals can be understood in terms of societys expectations for what is considered appropriate behavior for occupants of particular social positions in specific situations feld and radin 1982 ultimately role theory posits that social dysfunction is not caused by psychopathology but rather by social context such an approach serves to shift the blame from individual choices and towards a more interactional view of health and human behaviorin the context of gender individuals encounter differing expectations and experiences by virtue of their socialization as men and women gender roles explain the division of labor within the household and the ascription of varying traits to men and women agarwal 1997 in the social construction of gender roles in india economic resources are not typically equally distributed among male and female family members gender roles can negatively affect the health of cisgender women when social norms prioritize the health of men or prevent women from making independent health decisions such as traveling alone to a clinic to seek medical care shah et al 2007 cisgender women in india are generally less nourished than men less healthy and more susceptible to physical and sexual violence agarwal and sethi 2013 nussbaum 2001 lack of gender equity in sexual relationships can also constrain indian women from protecting themselves during sexual intercourse and may fuel the hiv epidemic further existing research has not sufficiently addressed the social processes by which cisgender women in india uniquely experience hiv stigma particularly in regard to gender roles social isolation and depression to address these gaps in the current research the present study explores how hiv stigma affects experiences of social isolation for women living with hiv in hyderabad indiathe study population is defined as cisgender women living with hiv the analytic sample was defined as cisgender women between the ages of 18 and 50 living with hiv in hyderabad india inclusion criteria for the study were 1 identify as cisgender female 2 self-report as being hiv-positive 3 reside in hyderabad or secunderabad india 3 proficient in speaking hindiurdu or telugu and 4 being between the ages of 18 and 50a mixed methods study was conducted involving two interrelated phases that occurred consecutively with the quantitative and qualitative phases bearing equal weight leech and onwuegbuzie 2009 in phase one of the study 150 plwh were asked to participate in a survey regarding their experiences with hiv stigma depression and access to medical care one third of these respondents n  51 were cisgender women following the completion of surveys a preliminary descriptive analysis of these responses was conducted stratifying survey responses to the two hiv stigma scales used in the study jeyaseelan et al 2013 zelaya et al 2008 a subgroup was created of cisgender women comprised of the eight cisgender women with the highest hiv stigma scores and the eight women with the lowest hiv stigma scores these 16 cisgender women were recruited to participate in phase two of the study this sampling method was utilized in order to ensure heterogeneity in the interview subgroup in phase two participants were asked to complete in-depth interviews on how their experiences of hiv stigma have been influenced by gender roles interviews were intended to explore the gendered experience of hiv stigma and to contextualize the answers from the quantitative survey given that this manuscript focuses on experiences of social isolation there is a larger cluster of individuals whose stories are included here that had scored high on the stigma scalespurposive and snowball sampling techniques were utilized to recruit study participants for purposive sampling participants were recruited through existing collaborations with five local ngos serving individuals living with hiv in hyderabad as well as through additional snowball sampling of participants two of these organizations focused on offering services to people living with hiv in hyderabad another two organizations focused on services to third gender or queer communities and the fifth organization focused on health services for rural communitiesto recruit from these four ngos a local research assistant posted recruitment flyers in hindi and telugu at the field sites of the collaborating organizations the research team visited each of the four organizations to recruit potential participants to capture those men and women who were not currently connected to social service organizations the team additionally utilized snowball sampling snowball sampling has been heavily utilized in disease prevention and public health intervention magnani et al 2005 it is particularly well suited when the focus of study is a sensitive issue and thus requires the knowledge of insiders coleman 1958 biernacki and waldorf 1981 by taking advantage of the social networks of identified respondents vogt 1999 greater variance may be assured in the sample for the purposes of this study individuals who were initially recruited from the five collaborating organizations were asked to share information about the study to eligible peers to protect confidentiality no additional contact information of these peers was elicited from recruiters interested peers had the option to directly contact the research team if interested in participating in the studysurveys and interviews were conducted in both hindi and telugu to ensure translation accuracy and internal consistency all relevant documents including flyers consent forms and surveys were translated from english to both hindi and telugu and then back-translated to english a local translator conducted hindi translations a local research assistant conducted telugu translations certificates of translation were produced for the university of chicago institutional review board irb and the internal ethics committee at share india for respondents who were illiterate the interviewer read questions aloud and recorded answers for the participant these individuals consented to the study by utilizing a thumb print as their signaturea commonly accepted legal practice in indiaall participants who completed either the survey or interview were compensated 200 rupees equivalent to 314 usd at the time that this research was conducted individuals who participated in both phases of the study received a total of 400 rupees 629 usd this amount was determined after consulting with local staff members at community-based organizations who indicated that this is a fair incentive for research participants in hyderabad if a participant assisted in recruiting other individuals through snowball sampling the recruiter received an additional incentive of 100 rupees per completed referralinterviews lasted about 90 min the interview guide was organized around eight domains 1 gender roles 2 gender nonconformity stigma 3 hiv diagnosis 4 hiv disclosure 5 hiv stigma 6 caste poverty and religion 7 utilizing medical care and 8 social isolation and depression the first section of the interview asked questions related to gender roles and gender nonconformity gender roles were addressed by asking participants open-ended questions relating to their gender role demands and stress this section also included questions regarding household dynamics such as power to make decisions regarding money and health questions concerning hiv diagnosis and hiv disclosure followed next followed by a section on hiv stigma medical care social isolation and depression some questions in this section were adapted from the hiv stigma index in india gnp icw  unaids 2011all interviews were digitally audio recorded then subsequently translated and transcribed directly into english transcripts of the interviews were imported into the data analysis program nvivo 10 qsr international 2014 for coding using thematic content analysis krippendorff 2012 after reviewing the first ten transcripts three evaluatorsthe principal investigator a us-based research assistant and an india-based research assistantdeveloped an initial codebook of themes relevant chunks from transcribed data were assigned codes charmaz 2006 miles and huberman 1994 identified codes were placed in broad groupings the codes under each heading were clubbed together and the content analyzed for common themes quotes or passages were selected to illustrate each of these themes smith et al 2009after initial coding the team met to discuss differences in how codes were applied code definitions were redefined and codes were combined to reflect themes found in the data codes were then clustered together by specific themes to create a codebook the refined codebook was subsequently used to code the remaining interviews with each interview being coded by at least two people whenever there was a discrepancy in a coding decision between two coders the third coder would be asked to review the coding decisions and discuss any significant differences in coding decisions or patterns after deliberation consensus was reached on all coding decisions emergent themes included difficulties in disclosing hiv status to family members gender role conflict and lack of ease of accessing medical care only themes related to hiv stigma social isolation and depression are reported here all names of participants have been changed to maintain the confidentiality of participantsan irb application was approved by the university of chicago school of social service administrationchapin hall in september 2015 in november 2015 irb approval was also obtained through the internal ethics committee at share india in secunderabad india an additional irb approval was approved by fordham university in october 2018 for continued data analysis of the study findings all participants names and other identifying details were changed in this manuscript to protect their confidentialityupon disclosure of their hiv status many women expressed being ostracized from their own biological families or from their in-laws these interactions often centered on fears of contagion from both health-related and moral avenues one respondent sitara recounted how her family had stayed away from her because of the negative associations ascribed to living with hiv she also expressed that her family worried about becoming infected by hersitara i think what sin have i committed i am facing all these difficulties i am not happy madam i always think about my children i have to give them a good life when i became hiv-positive i felt so much tension madam and my small daughter is also positive people kept away from me thinking that they will get the disease from meinterviewer who kept away from yousitara we lived together as a joint family when they knew about this disease they my family kept away at that time i felt very bad thinking that everyone was healthy why has god given me this disease they kept away madam i felt very bad thinking about how i got this disease i cried a lot i felt like i was going to die tomorrow my husband and i felt horrible and thought about committing suicide only because of our children did we not kill ourselves in our family nobody is aware of this disease i have been living with hiv now for 14 yearssitaras story highlights how hiv stigma from family members persists even when they have been properly educated about transmission routes women often discussed how their hiv status led them to be seen as impure or unclean even when others were aware that they could not be casually infected by socially interacting with them in terms of sexual health cisgender women were often accused of being the vectors of sexually transmitted infections even though they reported that their only lifetime sexual partners were their husbands these experiences speak to the lasting social impacts of hiv stigma and social isolation and also highlight the gender imbalances between the experiences of cisgender women and their male partnersanother participant layla reported similar experiences of social isolation within her family she recounted her treatment in the hospital by her family and medical providers when she was first diagnosed she was blamed for having been infected with hiv from her bad behaviori was not tested when i was pregnant only about a half an hour before my delivery was i told of my hiv status they called my husband and made him test also he too was hiv positive then they tested my son but they did not tell me anything they were talking with each other but no one was saying anything prior to this they placed me in the general ward but now they put me in a separate room we have very little money and i wondered how we would be able to pay the bills for this big room before that day doctors would come to check on me but then no one would come to see me they were only giving me medications and kept me in a separate room no one bothered me it was tense and we had little money they had put me in an isolated room and after three days i was discharged and taken directly to gandhi hospital everyone was talking but no one was telling me anything after going to gandhi i came to know about my hiv status but prior to then i did not know anything i was nervous but they told me not to worry my parents didnt say anything and my in-laws thought i got hiv from my bad behavior after my baby was delivered i was taken to gandhi hospital and then they told me we all cried a lotwhile experiences of discrimination within the health care system were undoubtedly traumatizing for plwh some of the most hurtful experiences of being shunned occur within participants own families layla reported how her family treated her following her diagnosis and how these experiences left her feeling rejected socially isolated and depressed she reported that she had educated her family about the ways in which hiv could be transmitted and they were aware that contact with saliva was not infectious nonetheless layla was treated differently by her family following her diagnosis and was told not to feed her niece with her own handsmy mother treated me differently when i was released from gandhi hospital my parents took me back to their house one day my mother gave me rice to eat then my brothers daughter asked me to feed her when i was feeding her with my hands my mother came and said why are you feeding her your rice she said that she would feed my niece herself i told my mother that i had not already eaten from the same plate and that is why i was feeding her otherwise i would not feed her sometimes i think that because of my hiv status and my husbands death i have lots of problems and i often get fed up with my life but i have to be alive for my children i feel sad that everyone is happy but i am unable to be happy with them my mothers sister also has the same feelings towards me she told my family members to keep my plate glass soapeverythingseparate she would say why are you always allowing her to be with you people i have suffered a lot this waylaylas experience of having to use separate dishes within her own home and being advised to not feed her niece are examples that showcase how hiv stigma is based not on lack of hiv knowledge but rather on social stigma and prejudice about the cleanlinesspurity of the infected individual often these fears and prejudices persist even when people have been educated about hiv transmission routes as this family had been the stigma continues not solely out of the family members fear of being infected themselves but also out of a desire to not be socially associated with an infected and thus morally impure individualanother respondent jyothi reported how she finds it difficult to move freely in the world as the tethers of hiv stigma limit her everyday experiencesyes madam every day i am very sad about myself because we cannot move freely with everyone like regular people at that time when i was first diagnosed i felt very bad about myself i thought why should i live this life if i die who will take care of my children if i didnt have children i would have died i have thought about suicide but because i have children i have not attempted suicide at the government hospital we are treated differently compared with normal people we are kept away and when they prescribe us medicine they do so without touching usas has been shown in other narratives the participants children serve as their saving grace from depression and act as a source of prevention against fatalism gender role theory offers insight into understanding this phenomenon as the demand of being a responsible mother is of critical social importance to an indian woman this sense of dharma or the completion of ones familial duties and obligations ultimately trumped feelings of depression and suicidality that many women living with hiv in india experiencein this section we discuss ways in which people fear how the body will be negatively perceived by others as a result of being associated with sickness or ugliness several women reported their fears of incurring judgment from others if their hiv status became publicly known most women who worked in the formal labor sector reported being worried about losing their employment if their employer came to know about their hiv status sujatha recounts this experiencei have not told anyone at work that im hiv positive for fear i might lose my job because i am afraid that if i tell them that i have hiv they will remove me from my job thats why i did not tell anyone people would not touch me if they knew i was living with hiv and they would not even talk in close proximity to an hiv-positive person they were afraid that if they touch me they would also get the diseasesimilarly lakshmi reports how she refrains from sharing her status with others because they will assume that she had been infected through immoral actions and that her illness was a deserved consequence of these actionsi thought people would think badly about me they would say she doesnt have a husband she must have done wrong things thats the reason she got this and i thought they would hate me because of this fear i do not tell them people in the community think that people who are hiv positive made bad choices and that is the reason they are hiv positive when we go to the hospital they will hate us and harass us i have been treated differently by my sister she did not say anything directly but her behavior changed she stores our clothes separately from her own i have been living with hiv for nine years there have been many quarrels in my home about getting this disease even today none of my in-laws in my home know that i have hiv and i will not share this with them if i tell my sisters in-laws they will quarrel with my sisters they will say your sister got this ask them where i went and how did i get this they will pick on my sisters and say you are well why did your sister get this disease and not you they will fight with my sisters so i dont want to tell themkeeping ones hiv status a secret serves to protect not only the women themselves from stigma but also their family members such group associations when the action of one member of the family is reflective on the entire family are more typical of collectivist cultures like that of south asia that place greater social emphasis on family unity honor and group inclusion over individual freedom and autonomythe self-esteem and the mental health of women living with hiv were often shaped by the ways in which the progression of their disease affected their physical appearance women were concerned about how others would perceive them and then potentially discriminate against them based on their looks janaki reported how she felt ashamed when she started to lose weight and began to look visibly illi felt people didnt want to talk to me because i had this disease i felt embarrassed when i was walking on the street because i used to look so ugly i was 27 and my weight was 27 kg approximately 60 lb my hair color was black but i had lost all my hair and looked like a beggar i felt that people would be afraid of me when they saw me it was difficult for me to leave the house i used to leave the house only once a month to pick up my medication it was like this for two years i did not tell my relatives and neighbors about my hiv status i did not tell my friends when my friends asked me why did you become like this i told them i became depressed when my husband died i was fearful that if i told them they would stop talking to me and then they would tell my parents and my parents would send me out when i became part of the hiv network i heard of parents kicking their children out of the house after finding out about their hiv status that is the reason i did not tell anyonemost women do not share their hiv status for fear of the negative consequences of having their condition be known and for fear of the association of living in poverty or becoming a beggar the associations of living with hiv have connotations with socioeconomic status as well as with illnessthroughout the interviews we found that hiv disclosure outside of ones immediate family was a rare occurrence for most cisgender women because of fears of perceived discrimination women chose to not disclose their hiv status often even to people within their own family another research participant seema shared her experience of not wanting to disclose her hiv status to others as it made people assume that she had become infected through engagement in sex worki have only told my sister and my brother-in-law some people have hiv awareness and some people do not if i tell people that i am hiv positive people will look at us like we are cheap and they will think i am a street lady sex worker because of this reason i do not tell everyonethe source of hivs heightened stigma appears to be caused by its recurring association with illicit behaviorssex work injection drug use sex between menor their corresponding illicit identitiessex workers injection drug users and gaybisexual men women remained acutely concerned about how others in their community would treat them and their children differently should their hiv status become publicly known to avoid these anticipated experiences of discrimination they kept their hiv status a secretmultiple cisgender women in this study reported experiencing thoughts of suicide hopelessness social isolation and severe depression janaki reported how difficult it was to maintain the desire to be alivehaving hiv is like hell for two years i saw hell on earth besides i also get side effects i thought why do all these things happen to me sometimes i think it is better to die after that i gave myself courage i dont have any problem with this and i realized why should i die for this reason i will live till i die then i will stop thinking about deaththe statement of living till i die is at once pragmatic and existential janaki highlights the universal human experience of mortality and the accompanying fear of death that chronic illness may instill however she is nonetheless able to use the inevitability of her death as a motivation for continuing to livefor many women their children were their main motivations to stay alive sitara like many of the interviewed women in this study reported that her children offered her the sole hope for her futureat first i cried a lot and did not understand why i had this disease my mother did not know what this disease was today i feel that every person will die someday we will die a little early i have no fear because i am living a happy life with my childrenapplying the constructs of gender role theory we see that sitara finds her purpose through the fulfillment of her gendered role as the primary caretaker for her childrenseema like many women in the study initially experienced feelings of hopelessness regarding her hiv diagnosis but after being informed that there were treatments for her condition and that living with hiv would not necessarily lead to an early death she regained hope for the future it is noteworthy that her sense of purpose is also obtained through the fulfillment of her role as the mother of her daughtermy husband was sick madam he got piles hemorrhoids and jaundice he was becoming very sick we took him to the hospital when the doctor did an hiv test for him we came to know that he is positive then the doctor immediately did the same test on me and we found out that i also have hiv i was very depressed and i cried a lot i thought my life was a waste because i have only one daughter i thought we all have hiv my daughter might also have this we thought to die but i gave my husband courage why should we die we have medicine we will take medicine when we came to know at first i cried a lot i did not eat rice for two days and thought why has our life become like this after that we got used to it my husband also cried a lot he might have done a wrong thing knowingly or unknowingly and he said sorry to me as a wife and husband we cannot quarrel and separate if i am healthy and separated that would be different he has hiv and i have hiv we thought to die but for our daughters sake we stayed aliveonce again the recurring theme of remaining alive for the sake of ones children is evident in this passage seema also highlights traditional views regarding the lasting nature of marriage and how quarrels between husband and wife need to be worked out regardless of infidelity or sickness she hints at his infidelity as she mentions her husband having done a wrong thing knowingly or unknowingly perhaps this wrong thing was injection drug use having sex with another male or female person or having solicited a sex worker seemas strong commitment to maintaining a marriage at all costs is again reflective of the importance placed in south asian culture on family unity conversely being single divorced or widowed in south asian culture are considered undesirably tragic life experiencesmany women reported that the reason that they were able to pull themselves out of moments of considering self-harm or suicide was because of the responsibility they felt for the well-being of their children seeking purpose only through ones children is a recurring theme reinforcing the notion of womens primary and essentialized role as mothers and caretakers one participant rubaina reportedmy husband would cry a lot we have a big family my husband has six brothers in his family and we used to think that we should die without suffering and without giving trouble we used to cry often thinking about our children we would wonder that if we were to die who would take care of our children my husband was taking homeopathic medications but he was becoming sicker by the day after seeing him become more ill for two months i stopped taking homeopathic medications at the time of his death i was very afraid but i thought i should live for my children if i died i knew anyone would be able to take care of my elder daughter but nobody would take care of my younger daughter because she is hiv positive it was then that i regained the courage to live we used to go to freedom foundation for a checkup every month people there were so friendly and would take us to lunch my daughter would come with me people said that even though my husband died i should live for my children and give them a good future i got a lot of courage from freedom foundationthis example illustrates how community-based organizations play an important role in linking people living with hiv with health care and social services these settings serve as spaces where women can receive the type of social support that is often unavailable to them from their own families communities or the government health care system radhas resilience against the forces of social exclusion speaks to the strength that cisgender heterosexual women living with hiv have developed in the hyderabadi context these traits serves to protect them against the spoiled identity conferred onto them by the judgments of society another participant azmath reported her feelings upon being diagnosed with hivafter i found out i had hiv there was not one day i did not cry first i cried about my husband and when i found out i had hiv i continued to cry in the beginning i was not aware of this disease my doctors told me i had aids and i would not live for more than six months to a year they told me to not give my milk to my son nor kiss him they told me to go to hyderabad where there are many hospitals otherwise go to kurnool her village and you can get medicine for this i thought if i take medicine the disease will go away when i saw my husband i feared i would become like him and die when the doctors said to me to keep away from my son and not to kiss him i became very depressed not about my disease i was depressed about the doctors words about keeping away from my son when i felt suicidal and attempted suicide my relatives told me to get married again that my husband did not make me happy and that i would not get any property from my in-laws give your children to your mother and get married they would say wherever i would go i heard this sort of talk and i was fed up with this talk and i decided i wanted to commit suicide i took a few pills but i thought of my children and that god had taken their father if i were to commit suicide who will take care of them immediately i went to my mother and told her i took these pills and she took me to the hospital and i was given treatmentonce again the saving grace in this instance was the womans recognition of the importance of her children given the high cultural value placed on marriage with children this causes clinicians to question whether cisgender women living with hiv in india who are unmarried or without children like lasksmi still have the same motivations for life clinicians working with single divorced or widowed women living with hiv should take utmost care to ensure the prevention of extreme depression in their clients as these women are at increased risk for social isolation and suicidality azmaths report that her doctor told her not to kiss her son is reflective of misinformation about hiv transmission that is being disseminated by medical staff to their patients in india thereby exacerbating pre-existing social stigmasboth the interviews and surveys were subject to social desirability bias where respondents answer questions or behave in a way that will portray them favorably to the researcher participants may have consciously wanted to present themselves in a way that emphasizes the challenges they have experienced as a result of living with hiv alternatively they may also have wanted to portray themselves as strong resilient and healthy and may have downplayed these same experiencesthese results were not intended to be generalized for cisgender women living with hiv outside of india or perhaps even outside of the city of hyderabad regional variation in cultural norms religion language and socioeconomic status within south asia confer significantly different contexts for the interpretation of gender roles and social interactions the context for cisgender heterosexual women may not be readily comparable to populations outside of south india making it difficult to make generalizations regarding plwh in locations outside of the cities of hyderabad and secunderabad given that this study was qualitative and had a small sample size no expectations regarding generalizability have been madein terms of the sampling method using a largely organizational recruiting method entails a strong source of sampling bias watters and biernacki 1989 people living with hiv who are recruited from social service organizations are by definition connected to receiving resources so we may be eschewing the very population that we are seeking to findthose individuals who are so stigmatized by their hiv status that they are avoiding medical treatment or hiv-related social services altogether although we additionally utilized snowball sampling and online recruiting to identify respondents these methods may also be considered biased because they are not random and instead select individuals on the basis of social networks who again are more likely to disclose their hiv status browne 2005 another issue with snowball sampling is whether the phenomenon being studied actually results in the formation of social networks if the phenomenon is private as is hiv stigma and snowball sampling is network dependent we can expect to encounter problems in capturing the actual variance within the population additionally the verification of eligibility and the accounts of respondents may be compromised as the sources used to initiate referral chains become more distant biernacki and waldorf 1981in our study cisgender women experienced multiple forms of intersectional stigmafrom their hiv status to their caste position to their widowhood our research adds to a body of evidence that demonstrates how intersecting systems of oppression intimately affect the lives of women in developing contexts our findings validate previous research that highlights how people living with hiv who experience stigmatizing interactions experience higher levels of stress and distress hutton et al 2013 van hollen 2010 women in our study experienced disproportionate stigma and blame from their husbands and the families of their in-laws causing them to have painful experiences of social isolation confirming previous research kang et al 2005 we found that hiv stigma increases pre-existing social prejudice disproportionately affecting individuals already socially marginalized for other reasons such as sexual orientation gender nonconformity occupation or caste occupying multiple marginalized identities creates intersectional vulnerabilities for cisgender women living with hiv making it more difficult to obtain quality medical care and compassionate psychosocial supportmany participants expressed their fears regarding hiv disclosure and were concerned that social perceptions regarding people living with hiv would negatively impact their lives the majority of the women in our study hailed from scheduled castes or were living in poverty leading to the experience of multiple layers of stigma pulerwitz and bongaarts 2014 as highlighted by our research cisgender women experience unique challenges in overcoming hiv stigma because of the ways in which hiv stigma differentially impacts women women are less likely to disclose their positive hiv status to medical providers and are less likely to receive the support they need to cope with their illness wingwood et al 2007our research has important implications for social work research and policy research on gender and sexuality in south asia suggests that a patriarchal hierarchy for decision-making is recognized by both families and communities key family decisions such as those regarding health and money are reserved for men in their capacity as heads of the household women are often assigned other responsibilities in their capacity as nurturing wives mothers and daughters kabeer 1999 the importance of this primary role as mother and wife is repeated throughout the narratives of the cisgender women in our study the primary gender role of mother is reflected in womens explanation that their children are their main justification for remaining alive according to gender role theory from the time of childhood men and women are socialized to engender specific attributes and social behaviors eagly et al 2000 in the south asian context it becomes increasingly important for women to fulfill the gender role demand of being mothers and being the primary caretakers of their children for example laylas experience of being prevented from feeding her niece creates role stress as she is unable to complete her role as a mother caretaker and nurturer within the home the inability to perform this role leads layla to suffer a lot this way an experience which we might translate as gender role stressthe existing literature examining gender roles and differences in social support and well-being suggests that men and women differ not only in their social behaviors but also in the sources from which they draw support eagly et al 2000 previous research indicates that women do not want to relinquish their role as care providers and nurturers as a result of their hiv-associated illnesses gordillo et al 2009 married women in india are also likely to experience secondary claims on household resources violence at the hands of their husbands and a willingness to bear and support children to the detriment of their own health kabeer 1997 the rise of new waged opportunities and changes in gender roles in south asia may make it easier for women to demand greater equity within their sexual and marital partnerships or to gain the financial ability to leave unsatisfactory marriages without fear of living in poverty there may be important implications of these nuances in gender interactions in the south indian context for social and public health policies impacting women living with hivour findings highlight the need for greater local and regional public health programming that focuses on the health disparities faced by cisgender women living with hiv understanding how gender interacts with hiv stigma is of critical importance for policymakers as they develop programs for hiv prevention and care van hollen 2010 in the context of hiv progression to aids delaying or avoiding medical care because of the fear of discrimination in healthcare settings ultimately leads to poor health outcomes conversely a high level of social support can lead to an improved quality of life particularly in regard to mental health strong social support has been shown to be protective against the negative impacts of depression and social isolation charles et al 2012in our study many women reported contemplating suicide yet almost none of them had sought formal treatment for these suicidal ideations or attempts these narratives also highlight that there is a lack of publicly available programming within government hospitals and ngos to address the mental health needs of cisgender women from a cultural perspective it also reiterates how many indian women see their mental health to be a private problem and would feel uncomfortable sharing these experiences with a counselor who they perceive to be a stranger mental health professionals may be viewed as outsiders to the family and bringing up such issues to them may be viewed as causing shame or dishonor to the familyfrom a clinical social work perspective our findings reinforce the need for greater emphasis on culturally appropriate treatments for depression particularly for cisgender women living with hiv such programs need to be made available within the context of sexual and reproductive health care as indian women are more likely to seek out obstetricgynecological care over mental health care a more holistic approach to the wellness of women living with hiv will need to pay attention to not only immunological functioning but mental health as well individual counseling and the taking of psychotropic medications for anxiety and depression are still not widely accepted practices in the indian context therefore both psychoeducation and the tailoring of social interventions for the cultural context of south india are needed to ensure the success of clinical outcomes family and community-level interventions are also sorely needed to ensure that misinformation about disease transmission does not cause people living with hiv to continue to be socially isolated from their family or community members additionally education vocational training and employment opportunities for cisgender women living with hiv are needed to help foster womens financial independence this may be especially relevant for women who have lost their partners to aidsgiven the greater emphasis on groups and collectivism in the south asian context the practice of group therapy or social support groups may be a more appropriate intervention for women experiencing depression in a clinical pilot intervention in san francisco an hiv stigma-reducing group intervention was held in a community mental health setting to gay and bisexual men living with hiv who were currently connected with care but reported ongoing difficulties due to hiv stigma based on acceptance and commitment therapy this intervention was effective in reducing stigma among persons with substance abuse histories and in reducing internalized homophobia the intervention incorporated exercises from compassion-focused therapy to increase compassion while decreasing shame skinta et al 2015 such an intervention might be adapted for the context of cisgender women living with hiv in indiain another group-based behavioral intervention for adolescents and young adults newly diagnosed with hiv four dimensions of hiv-related stigma were addressed personalized stigma disclosure concerns negative self-image and concern with public attitudes about people with hiv harper et al 2014 while results were effective at reducing stigma for males across all four dimensions females only experienced a decrease in personalized stigma and this effect was not maintained at a 3-month follow-up all other types of stigma actually increased for women at post-intervention and 3-month follow-up these findings lead us to conclude that researchers have failed to identify effective means of decreasing hiv stigma for women reiterating the need for further research on gender-specific health interventionsprevious research has demonstrated that women with a heightened sense of fear around health-decline and death may use avoidant coping behaviors to manage their anxiety resulting in poor self-care behaviors such as lack of adherence to hiv medications willie et al 2016 psychosocial factors are important predictors of quality of life for women living with hiv in a study of 600 women living with hiv in india an intervention led by nurses who worked as social health activists was found to be effective at increasing womens access to social resources and social support garfin et al 2019 this case management approach well known to clinical social workers may be especially useful in not only helping link women living with hiv with needed resources but also ensuring that they are connected to circles of social support in another intervention a support group used narrative therapy to help plwh process experiences of suffering and share insights connections and comfort to each other dean 1995 social workers working with plwh should incorporate the association between stigma and depression into their programs li et al 2009 and should address social support as a protective factor for mental health given the intersectional nature of hiv stigma in india it is especially important for women living in poverty to overcome social isolation in order to lead healthy and connected livessimilarly for social workers who serve women living with hiv certain clinical insights may be important to consider for clinicians who have been doing hiv work for a long time there must be an awareness of the vicarious trauma and compassion fatigue that can result from having witnessed the illness and death of many clients over time gabriel 1991 in such cases of having survived ones patients it is the clinician who becomes the bereaved causing experiences of grief mourning and loss being carefully attuned to countertransference and the impacts that this work can have on clinicians may help prevent burnout and sustain a clinical social workers career longevity in the field of hiv care clinicians working with plwh may be further aided by receiving clinical supervision being in psychotherapy themselves and taking meaningful breaks away from the work smith 2007 addressing social isolation in vulnerable communities like women living with hiv in india who are experiencing multiple forms of marginalization requires clinical tenacity resilience and compassionwhat is meant by the good death since i will make frequent use of this familiar phrase let me begin with some clarifications about how i will understand and use it first inclusion of the word the is not meant to presuppose that there is a single unique type of good death if deaths can be good presumably there will be a diversity of ways that death can go well for people this is especially plausible if there is a diversity of goods in life eg knowledge pleasure appreciation of beauty virtue as this would suggest a range of possible good deaths corresponding to the different prudential goods and various combinations of them however even if there is only one sort of thing that makes our lives go well it is likely that there are many different forms that the good can takesecond in talking of the good death i do not mean to restrict attention to the positive side of prudential value not unlike discussions of the good life that address both the prudentially good and the prudentially bad it is important to attend to the full spectrum of possible deaths from the very good if such a thing is possible to the very bad this is particularly important because while it is uncontroversial that deaths can be bad there is room for debate as to whether any death qualifies as all-things-considered good in any case my focus in this essay is less on the overall prudential assessment of deaths and more on features that contribute to making a death go better or worse for an individual a less misleading phrase for our topic might be the better or worse deathlastly death in the present context does not refer merely to the bare event of death the event of a persons permanently ceasing to exist5 nor does it refer only to the process of dying which might be understood as a process of physical deterioration leading to the event of death instead let us understand the good death to refer to a good end of life or even a good final chapter of ones life the literary metaphor is illustrative in a biography a chapter about an individuals death is not typically restricted to the dying process much less the bare event of the death it tends to be far more inclusive encompassing relevant events leading up to the dying process and the event of death as well as events that occur in the aftermath understanding death in this broader biographical sense the good death concerns how well or poorly the final portion of a life goes for the individual living that life

my grandmother died in the hospital it was the first time shed ever been in onethe hardest part about it was that the very last thing she asked me was to take her homein my grandmas case there was such clarity of thought and when the last thought on your mind is i want to be home then that must be the most important thing there isif you look at this landscape every day it becomes a part of who you areso how can you see yourself in the hospitala place that is so totally foreign to the nourishment of the soulful self

a persons location at the time of death is one obvious candidate for a good death factor humans across a range of cultures express a preference to die at home8 this wish is not universal but it is relatively common it often manifests itself as a desire to die in ones homeland rather than abroad or to die in ones home rather than the unfamiliar setting of a hospital no doubt one reason why one might have a preference to die at home concerns the quality of ones experience while dying people may predict that their experience leading up to death will be more tranquil and less alienating if they are in a familiar setting in that case dying at home might be valued instrumentally inasmuch as it is seen as a means to a more positive state of mind however in some cases what would lie behind that positive experience is the perception that being in ones home is something that directly makes for a better death this might be grounded in the fact that you bear a special relationship to your homeit is where you belong it is where you experienced so many valuable and intimate moments it is connected to your identity these are properties of dying at home that might explain why many people desire it if it is doubted that people ever really care about such things apart from their impact on their experience let us keep in mind that people often have strong preferences about where their bodies are buried or where their ashes are scattered such preferences obviously need not be about ones own mental states even atheists who reject the idea of an afterlife often have preferences about this

arguably ones company in death has prudential significance as i write this the world is in the throes of the covid-19 pandemic one of the prominent reasons why covid-19 hospital deaths are widely regarded as tragic is that infected patients often die alone isolated from their family members due to hospital policies that prohibit or strictly restrict visitation10 many people have a deep fear of dying alone and it is quite common for people to want their loved ones to be with them at the end there may be specific individuals you would especially hope to have at your deathbed and specific people you would especially not want presentpeoples preferences about who surrounds them in their final days or moments might be purely instrumental hedonic considerations often lie behind such preferences and one can instrumentally desire others presence in order to repair or nurture relationships even so a preference to have certain people present at ones death can be grounded in the thought that their very presence makes for a more desirable or less undesirable death this point applies to other kinds of significant life-events my brother was unable to attend my wedding due to illness i wanted him to be there and this was not merely a desire to make us both happier if asked to choose between having him at my wedding or both of us receiving a pleasure-inducing drug that would have guaranteed a more positive experience i would have preferred the former his presence at my wedding would have had value for me apart from any hedonic effects similar points apply to death just as we can have a special relation to our homes that makes it more desirable to die there a person can have a special connection with others such that their presence at the end arguably makes for a better death11

an urban youth in america12most of us are not wholly indifferent to what will bring about our death while there do not appear to be many causes of death that are popularly regarded as being prudentially good dying from a noble act of self-sacrifice may be one exception it is relatively easy to identify causes that are widely thought to make for a worse death the quote above concerns causes of death that are purposeless and arbitrary other examples abound imagine dying from an act of betrayal or consider cases of people dying as a result of their own risky or imprudent actions such as heavy smoking ignoring social distancing recommendations during a pandemic or attempting to live amongst grizzly bears or consider cases where the cause of death is ridiculous or embarrassing there is the story of a man visiting the grand canyon who decided to joke with his family by pretending to fall into the canyon in his attempt to jump onto a lower ledge he plummeted to his death13 in the eyes of many these causes make for a worse death granted some will find them undesirable only for instrumental reasonsthey can lead to psychological pain for the one dying they can taint how one is remembered after one is gone and so on but many will retain this conviction even where there is not greater psychological suffering a diminishment of ones posthumous reputation or any other instrumental harm in a word they are thought to directly detract from the desirability of ones death just as other causes might directly enhance a deaths desirability

for many how one approaches death has prudential significance one might hope to face death contemplatively like socrates or hamlet or with a sense of levity and good humor like voltaire who when his bedside lamp flared up is said to have remarked what the flames already or with defiance like susan sontag who fought to stave off death by blood cancer until the bitter end15as with the other three factors what constitutes the ideal manner of facing death is a subject of normative disagreement in a 2000 survey a majority of subjects which included terminally ill patients doctors nurses and family members thought it important to maintain a sense of humor at the end of life16 yet otherslike james boswell who was disturbed by humes cheerfulness in the face of deathwill see humor on ones deathbed as inappropriate and lacking the proper gravity some will value the defiant struggle against death that was preached by thomas and practiced by sontag others will see such resistance as futile or pathetic while there is room for normative debate about this good death factor many people believe that there are better and worse ways to face ones deathhedonism maintains that what makes something good or bad for us is its effect on the pleasantness or unpleasantness of our experience thus the only things that are basically non-instrumentally good and bad for us are pleasure and pain broadly construed18hedonistic theories do not recognize our three good death factors as being basic components of well-being none of the factors under consideration pertain directly to the quality of ones experience nor does hedonism fully recognize them in the second way for pleasure and displeasure are not essentially linked to these good death factors there are countless cases where these features of death are not attended by an increase or decrease in pleasure or suffering dying at home and the presence of loved ones at death pertain most fundamentally to the physical or perhaps virtual location of the dying person in relation to a certain place and certain people19 these things can obtain irrespective of the mental states of the dying person further in talking of an embarrassing cause of death i am not referring to a cause of death that leads a dying person to actually experience the unpleasant state of being embarrassed what is being referenced is a cause of death that is worthy of embarrassment an event may be embarrassing relative to a certain party irrespective of whether that party ever actually feels embarrassed and indeed there are plenty of examples of embarrassing deaths where the person in question feels no embarrassment including but not limited to sudden or instantaneous deaths cases where the embarrassing features of death are unknown to the person dying and cases where the person is well positioned to experience embarrassment but simply fails to have the fitting responsehedonism cannot account for the prudential value of the good death factors in these cases where there is no hedonic difference furthermore if our good death factors have non-instrumental prudential value in these cases they presumably also have some prudential value that cannot be explained by hedonism in the cases where there is a hedonic difference consequently it appears that hedonism cannot fully accommodate our three good death factors though it may partially account for their prudential value in some casesdesire-fulfillment theories center around the idea that well-being consists in getting what one wants according to the simplest form of desire-fulfillment theory a state of affairs is good for you if and only if you desire it and it obtains since our actual desires can be distorted by ignorance false beliefs and bad reasoning some have proposed more sophisticated idealized desire-fulfillment theories which focus on the desires that a person would have if they were fully informed and rational on these theories if you or your idealized counterpart desire something for its own sake then it is good for you in and of itself20the first thing to note is that desire-fulfillment theory is remarkably flexible and can recognize virtually anythingany state of affairs that can possibly be desiredas having prudential significance since people commonly do have desires regarding the features of death that we are considering it is tempting to suppose that desire-fulfillment theory accommodates them if i desire to die at home or in the company of my family or to avoid some embarrassing end and that comes to pass desire-fulfillment theory deems this good for mehowever desire-fulfillment theories make space for our good death factors in a way that does not do justice to how many people will view their prudential significance a distinguishing mark of desire-fulfillment theories is that they imply that each individuals well-being is partly grounded in their psychology what is good for a person depends crucially on what they desire since peoples desires about their own deaths vary this theory implies that the contours of a good death will also vary from individual to individual there is much plausibility to the idea that what impacts the goodness or badness of a death will depend to some extent upon the particular context and circumstances of the individual including various psychological facts for instance if someone has not forged a positive connection to their home perhaps it was the site of domestic abuse or other traumatic events then presumably dying at home is not good for that person likewise it might be that the best manner of facing death will be different for different people and must have a certain fit with their temperament and the overall character of their livesyet many people will reject the idea that these features of death are good for a person if and only if they or their idealized counterpart desires them and they occur imagine a man who dies from accidentally shooting himself with a gun that he himself just loaded most people will think the embarrassing nature of his death makes it worse for him and this apparent badness does not dissipate if it comes to light that this particular man would in no way have minded dying in this pointless and embarrassing way or for some reason desired that kind of death if anything this may suggest a kind of evaluative insensitivity on his part that provides a further reason to think him badly off this example draws out the fact that desire-fulfillment theory has implications that are counterintuitive for many people it can only recognize our good death factors in those instances where they happen to be desired by the dying person actually or under hypothetical idealized conditionsin sum if our working assumption is true and our examples of good death factors do have non-instrumental prudential significance it appears that the two leading subjective theories of well-being cannot fully accommodate this fact this result does not seem particularly surprising nor will it generate much worry among subjectivists while it is possible that some will want to argue that their favored theory can fully accommodate these popular good death views most committed subjectivists will simply reject our working assumption perhaps supplementing that rejection with a debunking explanation as to why people have these objectivist intuitions21 what is more interesting to investigate is whether proponents of objective theories of well-being who tend to take objectivist intuitions more seriously are able to recognize our examples of good death factors let us now turn our attention to the most prominent objective theoriesperfectionism about well-being holds that the good life for humans consists in the development and exercise of capacities or excellences that are distinctive of our kind22 precisely which capacities those are is a matter of some debate some perfectionists rely on an account of human nature as a guide while others do not the most popularly cited capacities include theoretical rationality practical rationality and autonomy23 for our purposes we can follow richard kraut and think in terms of some broad categories of capacities physical sensory affective social and cognitive24how might perfectionism account for our good death factors it might be thought that desiring or choosing a certain kind of death reflects some excellence of character to be sure the desire or choice to die at home or have loved ones present in death may indicate a healthy and fitting sentimental attachment to the places and people of ones life the desire to avoid an embarrassing end might also reflect some excellence of character but our examples of good death factors concern the actual circumstances of ones death desiring or choosing these aspects of a good death is neither necessary nor sufficient for them to actually occurperfectionism may be able to partially account for the prudential significance of dying at home with loved ones nearby or from some embarrassing cause for there will be cases of each kind where that feature of death is bound up with the exercise of ones capacities dying at home might involve reminiscing about ones personal history with that place or taking stock of ones life cognitive capacities and feeling various emotions that arise affective capacities having loved ones present at death can be good for individuals insofar as it involves the exercise of their affective and social capacities and sometimes the cause of a death is embarrassing because it stems from a persons failure to exercise their capacities well in the grand canyon case mentioned above it is possible that the man who fell to his death in an attempt at humor exhibited practical irrationality and clumsinesseven so there are instances where these good death conditions cannot be explained in perfectionist terms dying at home and having loved ones present may seem to make for a better death even in cases where the dying person is unconscious or is conscious but unable to meaningfully engage because they are heavily medicated or in severe pain likewise dying for some embarrassing reason might seem to make a death worse even in cases where the person exercised their capacities to the fullest consider another embarrassing cliff death in september 2010 the owner of the company that makes segway motorized scooters died by accidentally going off a cliffon a segway25 for the sake of argument suppose that he was fully justified in believing that the path was safe and that he was operating the vehicle with expert skill i suspect most would agree that even if he did exercise his capacities perfectly well to the very end the cause of his death is quite embarrassing and made for a worse death than if he had simply fallen off a cliff while taking a walk an embarrassing cause of death need not stem from a failure to exercise ones capacities well or any lack of excellence in the person who dies hence as traditionally understood perfectionism seems unable to account for these cases where a good death factor obtains apart from any success or failure in exercising ones capacities26 and if it cannot account for the prudential significance of the factors in these cases it presumably also fails to fully account for it in cases that do involve the excellent or poor exercise of perfectionism-relevant capacitieswe turn finally to objective list theories where one might most expect to find some recognition of the distinctive goods and evils of death we have been considering objective list theories are objective and pluralistic these features create a hospitable environment for our good death factors pluralism allows for multiple factors that directly impact well-being and the objective dimension allows for factors that have some independence from the attitudes of the person who diesobjective list theories are sometimes portrayed as explanatory theories which purport to identify the things or properties that are basically good or bad for us and explain why anything else is good or bad for us and sometimes as enumerative theories which list various things that are good or bad for us without any commitment about whether they provide the deepest explanation of prudential value27 this difference is neatly illustrated in essays by guy fletcher 2013 and christopher rice 2013 these philosophers present very similar overlapping objective list theories but fletcher regards his list as enumerative while rice presents his as explanatory if an objective list theory is merely enumerative it may be compatible with a range of explanatory theories including hedonism desire-fulfillment theory perfectionism or an explanatory objective list theory in contrast an explanatory objective list theory is a rival to all other explanatory theories for that reason our interest is in explanatory objective list theorieswith this interpretive groundwork in place it may be asked do our three examples of good death factors find a place on objective list theories what i wish to establish in this section is that although an objective list theory could in principle recognize these good death factors by and large the objective list theories discussed in the philosophical literature have not recognized them to ground this discussion consider a representative sample of objective lists proposed over the past four decadesfinnis 1980 life knowledge play aesthetic experience friendship practical reasonableness

2013 achievement friendship happiness pleasure self-respect virtuerice 2013 achievement meaningful knowledge loving relationships pleasure autonomy28the first thing to notice is that our three examplesdying at home having loved ones present in death an embarrassing cause of deathdo not appear on any of the nine lists indeed there is no mention of anything explicitly death-related thus our three good death factors have not been acknowledged as things that are basically good or bad for a person this rules out one way in which the lists might have accommodated our examplesthe other way they might do so is by recognizing other things that are essentially linked to our three examples and explain why they have non-instrumental prudential significance let us examine whether the above lists recognize the good death factors in this way since i have already discussed hedonism at length i will not discuss happiness or related hedonic notionspleasure suffering etc objective list theories that include these goods will generally recognize our good death factors at least to the extent that hedonism does29our first example of a putative good death factor is dying at home the fact that one bears a special relationship to ones homewhich could be based on a certain fit shared history or its role in ones identitymay explain the prudential significance of this factor while most of the above objective lists speak to relationships they appear to be gesturing toward reciprocal relationships with other sentient beings friendship loving relationships deep personal relations there is no indication that special relationships with places or objects might serve to enhance the desirability of a persons life or death it might be thought that dying at home is a form of self-expression which appears on jean kazezs list though that seems wrong since the phrase suggests a kind of activity perhaps it is self-expression to choose to die at home or to struggle against obstacles to ensure that that happens but setting aside cases of suicide and active voluntary euthanasia dying at home itself doesnt seem to be appropriately regarded as an act of self-expression even so one may regard it as making for a better death even when the person plays no active role in bringing it aboutthe second example is having loved ones present at your deathbed at first glance it may seem obvious that friendship and loving relationships adequately account for this good death factor but on reflection it is not so obvious when friendship or deep personal relations appear on an objective list what prudentially significant property or properties are being indicated presumably the idea is that what is ultimately good for us is having loving personal relationships acquiring them maintaining them and perhaps also developing and deepening them having loved ones at your deathbed could serve to maintain develop or deepen your relationship with them but it need not30 nor must the absence of a loved one at the end of ones life have an adverse effect on the relationship if your spouse or child is physically unable to reach you due to weather conditions or transportation restrictions this need not diminish the quality of your relationship in any way nonetheless it remains a natural thought that being in the company of loved ones makes for a better deathturning now to an embarrassing cause of death it might be thought that respect or self-respect addresses this issue but a loss of self-respect or the respect of others is not an essential feature of an embarrassing death presumably the man who died at the grand canyon did not have the time or mental clarity to lose self-respect as he fell in any case embarrassing deaths can be instantaneous and some embarrassing deaths never become known to other people and therefore do not weaken others respect for the person who died a much more plausible candidate is an item that appears on derek parfits list of prudential bads being deprived of dignity arguably this helps to explain why an embarrassing cause of death is bad for the one who dies it constitutes a loss or diminishment of ones dignity whether or not the one who dies or others are aware of this factin summary none of the nine objective list theories we have considered seem to be successful in capturing all three good death factors those theories that include happiness or some related notion might be able to partially account for some instances of our good death factors in the way that hedonism can only one of the lists parfits appears suitable to more fully capture just one of our good death examples an embarrassing causemy investigation thus far suggests that if our three examples are indeed good death factors then hedonism perfectionism desire-fulfillment theory and most of the proposed objective list theories undergenerate inasmuch as they cannot fully recognize the prudential value of all three good death factors even if they might account for some instances what i now wish to suggest is that hedonism perfectionism and objective list theories may also have the further shortcoming of misgenerating with respect to the good death factors a theory can be said to misgenerate when it correctly identifies that a given thing is prudentially significant though it does not accurately capture how it is prudentially significant for instance it might misidentify what it is about something that makes it good or bad for us or it might misidentify the degree to which it is good or bad i will now suggest that three of the leading theories may misgenerate in the second waymany people seem to attribute greater axiological weight to goods and bads that occur at the end of a life for instance imagine a person experiencing a migraine headache at some otherwise uneventful point in the middle of their life and then imagine them experiencing it at the very end of their life for many the latter seems worse and presumably what explains this is the proximity of the suffering to ones death even if the amount of suffering and opportunity cost would be the same it seems worse that ones life should end on that note likewise for happiness the experience of joy contentment and other pleasant emotions seems better to have at the end than at some less significant earlier point in our lives and similar points can be made about exercising ones capacities and facing embarrassment and a loss of dignityif goods and ills that occur at the end of a life do indeed carry greater prudential weight it is not obvious that hedonism perfectionism or the typical brand of objective list theory have a principled way of accounting for this fact nothing internal to hedonism seems to explain why pleasures and pains at lifes end would carry greater weight than otherwise equivalent pleasures and pain occurring earlier in life nor is it clear that perfectionism can make sense of the idea that the very same type and level of capacity-exercising has different prudential weights at different points in life finally while an objective list theory might in principle include some goods or bads that could account for this difference in axiological significance the nine objective lists given above seem to contain no such items consequently it appears that most of the leading theories have trouble accommodating one aspect of commonly held views about the good death31i have now surveyed the most popular and widely discussed theories of well-being to see whether they recognize some paradigmatic good death factors my preliminary investigation suggests that if my working assumption is true each of the theories undergenerates by failing to fully account for the goodness or badness of all three good death factors moreover hedonism perfectionism and the popular sort of objective list theory seem to misgenerate insofar as they cannot account for the greater axiological significance commonly associated with goods and bads at the end of life all of this lends support to the following conditional conclusion if our three examples are indeed good death factors the leading theories of well-being are inadequate insofar as they do not fully recognize them granted this investigation has only been preliminary i have left many stones unturned so it is quite possible that proponents of the leading theories will find inventive ways to honor these commonsense convictions about the good death still the present investigation should at least suffice to shift the burden of proof to those who are inclined to think that the leading theories can fully accommodate these popular views of the good deathone partial explanation for the neglect of the good death has to do with methodology well-being theorists tend to take as their starting point such broad all-encompassing questions as what does human well-being consist in or what makes a life go well for the one who is living it the most widely debated theories of well-being are broad answers to these broad questions such simple broad questions encourage us to take a wide-angle view of the topic and may foster the expectation that there is a simple broad answer to be discovered they nudge us away from an approach that takes a close look at particular dimensions of our lives our exploration of the good death shows that a narrower in-depth focus on a certain portion of human life can reveal greater complexity and richness in the realm of prudential value it helps us see and appreciate what is easily missed from a birds eye view of human well-beingthis is not to say that the good death provides the only avenue for learning this lesson the philosopher anthony skelton 2014 has argued that the leading theories of well-being are not well-suited to address the well-being of children skeltons critique of the extant well-being literature has affinities with the present critique the main difference is that skelton is focusing on the beginning of life rather than the end of it still both projects arguably reveal oversights in the well-being literature that are attributable to a methodology that focuses on human well-being in generalthere is nothing wrong with taking an interest in ambitiously broad questions about well-being yet if narrowing our focus to some restricted dimension of well-being such as the prudential value of death or the well-being of people with autism32 yields new insights about the good life and reveals shortcomings of the most popular theories we should be wary about theorizing only at the most general level ideally philosophical work will draw not only upon our reflections and intuitions about what is good for human beings in general or what makes for a good life in general but will also examine well-being in narrower dimensions of human life this could constitute a kind of reflective equilibrium methodology for the philosophy of well-beinganother part of the explanation for why well-being theorists have not recognized the four good death factors may be an overly restrictive understanding of objective list theories to date the sorts of objective list theories that have been proposed tend to acknowledge only a relatively short list of prudential values achievement friendship happiness loving relationships knowledge and so on while these lists may hit upon the prudential goods and ills that matter the most in our lives they might neglect a wide range of goods and bads that matter to a lesser extent33 i assume that many of the good death factors we have considered qualify as minor goods and bads dying at home having an embarrassing death and facing ones death with good humor are the not the sort of things that are likely to make the difference between a good life and a bad life they are not typically regarded as having anything close to the prudential importance of such things as life-long loving relationships major achievements long-term life-satisfaction and happiness and so on still even if these good death factors are not sufficient to make or break a persons overall well-being arguably they do have some significance and should sometimes figure in peoples prudential deliberation particularly as they approach the end of their livesto capture the subtleties of peoples views about the good death and in all likelihood many other aspects of our lives we may require a different kind of objective list theoryone that incorporates both major and minor goods and bads of life and thereby constitutes a more radical form of pluralism this may be an unwelcome development to philosophers who are eager to arrive at complete and digestible answers to our normative inquiries and perhaps because of this are drawn to simple elegant theories completeness in a theory of well-being might be attainable if prudential value can be boiled down to a single property or some small set of properties however it is possible that the prudential landscape is far more complicated and nuanced than any monistic or modestly pluralistic theory is able to capture to repeat a popular misquoting of einstein our theories should be as simple as possiblebut no simpler34 if there are minor prudential goods and bads there is a real possibility that a complete and plausible theory of the good life will always remain beyond our reach this would not mean that theorizing about well-being is futile or that we can never arrive at worthwhile knowledge proponents of this new brand of objective list theory might reasonably hope to increase their knowledge of the major goods and bads of life and perhaps also their understanding of some of lifes minor ones but they should expect their understanding of the good life to always remain a work in progress35philosophical discussions of the good life have been relatively silent on the topic of the good death and it appears that the leading theories of the good life cannot do justice to certain widely held views about the good death this is explained at least in part by a methodology that focuses on providing broad answers to broad questions and does not attend to narrower domains of life and by an overly restrictive understanding of objective list theories this suggests two recommendations for future work in the philosophy of well-being first the dominant methodology needs to be counterbalanced by attention to narrower domains of human life and experience second there is the need to explore and develop more nuanced and complex objective list theories that make room for minor goods and badsincluding though certainly not limited to all of the features that make for a better or worse deathit is a strange time i do not know what will be tomorrow i have to stay at home i do

dreamsof coursewith people who have homecomputersinternetand timethe verdict on the success of the global response to the covid-19 pandemic remains to be written but the consequences of the disease are indisputable and rapidly coming into focus in many countries efforts to contain covid-19 have resulted in an economic recession pushing millions out of their jobs and creating previously unprecedented unemployment in many countries worldwide in addition to the millions of people infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 hundreds of thousands have diedand will diefrom covid-19 an anticipated wave of mental and behavioural problems is beginning to be documentedcompounded by social and economic stressors and uncertaintiesthat will likely present a population health burden for months and years to comecovid-19 has also triggered enormous displays of pro-social behaviour with neighbours coming to the aid of those isolated by the containment efforts and of support for front-line workers including doctors nurses and other health-care personnel whose responsibilities keep them at risk of infection in the public conversation about this pandemic an admirable empathy has been evident for those who have been affected and for those who have died from covid-19 in some ways the pandemic has brought populations together generating an understanding that our health is interlinked and that we could all be at risk that understanding made it possible perhaps in an unprecedented way to empathise with those with the disease and to wish them well out of a clear sense that they could also be usinfectious diseases have always been the paradigmatic example of diseases that show how our health is interlinked we take vaccinations and make sure our children are vaccinated both to protect ourselves and as a social good this impulse is laudable and indeed useful it has helped for example ensure that during this pandemic an enormous number of people worldwide have followed guidance and orders to physically distance with relatively little demonstrable social disturbance in fact the opposite quickly became true in many countries social norms shifted to encourage physical distancing casting opprobrium on those who may have flaunted physical distancing norms and expectations public apologies by prominent figures who were found to be flaunting these guidelines became a feature of national media coverageand yet it is worth reflecting on the extent to which our response to the covid-19 pandemic has been informed by an understanding that we are all in this together that the virus does not discriminate and that as a result it benefits us all to comply with physical distancing guidelines to protect others and ourselves our empathy our capacity to envision that we too could be affected has been a powerful tool in the public health arsenal but in large part it is hard not to notice that our empathy is informed here as it often is by an appreciation of our own personal risk we feel regret and feel terrible about those who are suffering in no small part because we can imagine that suffering being our ownbut is it true that this suffering is our own is it true that covid-19 does not discriminate evidence is emerging that the effects of covid-19 far from being indiscriminate follow deeply entrenched patterns of health inequities mirroring burdens of disease that are near universal those with resources money and power often majority racial or ethnic groups are better able to physically distance work from home and retain their employment those same groups then have lower risks of becoming infected or dying from covid-19 probably reflecting a combination of factors including better access to health care and a lower underlying burden of morbidity that predisposes to worse covid-19 outcomes it turns out that covid-19 does discriminate and that those who are already vulnerablefor example the unstably housed people on low income those with poorer education and individuals with less access to reliable nutritious foodare more likely to both become infected with the virus and die from covid-19and this is where empathy fails empathy in the context of health is largely predicated on our appreciating the risks of a disease because we can imagine getting the disease ourselves when we imagine we can also be infected we are then willing to take the steps necessary to protect ourselvesand othersfrom the disease and that force has been powerful and contributed to the dramatic change in how we live and in a shutdown of large parts of the worlds economy informed by fear of a novel disease and the need to protect ourselves and others around us

but what if those efforts contribute to health divides what if those efforts also result in economic consequences that are inevitably going to be borne principally by those who are vulnerable and marginalised to begin with what if those efforts are therefore going to result in the long-term widening of health inequities consigning many people to worse mental and physical health for years to come how do we account for this eventuality and how do we factor this into our thinkingthis calls ultimately for compassion as the animating force behind our thinking about health and our thinking about how we go about informing the decisions we make to contain a novel threat like covid-19 compassion extends beyond empathy it does not motivate our action because we too may be harmed compassion motivates action because the phenomena we observe are unjust not worthy of the world we would like to live in martin luther king jr spoke often of compassion enjoining us to see that compassion ultimately motivates not to fling a coin to a beggar but to see that the edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring compassion pushes us to understand how we have structured the world and to ask how we can structure it better not because we may suffer but because others are suffering and that is not how the world should bewhat would such a world look like it would be one that is grounded in the principles of justice and the equitable distribution of resources an approach to health that is rooted in compassion would help us see beyond ourselves and place the good of others first a world rooted in compassion would embrace health as a public good this means treating health the way we do parks education the post office fire stations or our environmentin essence as a crucial piece of the global commons supported by our collective investment for the benefit of alli recognise that this might seem theoretical but such an approach would have concrete implications for our approach to health that can shape all our actions be they in times of crisis or in other times in some respects the current overwhelming investment in doctors and medicine has pushed a vision of health as a private commodity something we can buy and sell particularly in countries like the usa that do not have access to universal health carebut what we can buyhealth carecan only help us after we have become sick and what we have been buying in the time of covid-19 is largely an approach to bludgeon an epidemic into submission informed by strict prioritisation of the biological imperatives of viral transmission but our focus should always have been and more importantly should now be on building a world that is resilient to these challenges our focus should be on health as a state of not being sick to begin with grounded in an approach that balances the health of all in all our actions we must recognise that unless we invest in the preventive conditions of healthlike safe housing good schools liveable wages gender equity clean air drinkable water and a more equal economyany action we take during this and any future pandemic is likely to widen entrenched health gaps and that situation should be unacceptable to all of uswould our approach to covid-19 have been different were we accustomed to seeing health through the lens of compassion i would argue yes first we would have long invested in the conditions that make people healthy aiming to remove the underlying disproportionate burden of preventable illness that accrues to vulnerable populations worldwide second our response to covid-19 would be informed in equal parts by efforts to contain the spread and to mitigate how the consequences of our efforts to do so can bring about disproportionate harm to those who are removed from the decision making around this pandemic third our response would recognise the global differences that characterise a world that puts the burden of disease squarely on countries with fewer resources often driven to that condition by centuries of cross-national injustice and would push us to redouble our efforts to do everything in our power to help those countries perhaps before our ownsurely this moment calls for careful reflection and a reinvestment in compassion as a foundational approach to health calling attention to compassion in this way is not sentimental it is pointing out a tangible good without which health for all is impossible in a sense covid-19 has shown us that a healthy person and a healthy world are the same and healthy people and a healthy world are both strengthened immeasurably by having compassion at the heart of health
fair and beneficent treatment of participants in a challenge trial depends not simply on reducing the likelihood of severe clinical outcomes such as fatality in the study for participants might have experienced similar or worse events anyhow and it makes no sense to hold such outcomes against the protocol the trial should reduce for each participant and for the entire cohort how much that likelihood exceeds that of commensurate bad outcomes for the same people under two alternative scenarios delineated below which do not involve participation in that particular studythe idea is straightforward doctors offer patients surgeries and toxic drugs that may result in severe clinical outcomes or they experiment with new interventions all the time these approaches are perfectly justified when the doctors thereby save these same patients from greater likelihood of similar bad events without the treatment or the experiment one thing that is worse than getting your belly cut for an indicated operation is not undergoing that indicated operation because say you are uninsured the operation injures you and puts you at risk but it usually brings a net benefit to move from the fact that an injured belly would in itself be a harm and a source of risk to the conclusion that being uninsured is a blessing would be fallacious in assessing the risks and the benefits to study participants research ethics heeds not simply the risks of study participation it also heeds the balance of incremental risks and incremental benefits from participation which matters much more
10

this calculus applies to human challenge trials as well what matters in assessing the offer that researchers make to candidate participants is not simply the socalled absolute risk
11
 better described as the raw or contributing risk that comes with the challengewhether viral exposure poses only minor or controllable risks or alternatively more serious onesbut the net risk the risk from participating in that trial minus the risk that the same person would face otherwise in other words what matters is the full balance of personal risk and benefit the evaluation of a challenge trial ought to look at the difference the trial would make to the participants health or life an institutional review board for example should heed the change in risk exposure that would apply to the participant because she would be in the trial and not in some alternative scenariofor judging the ethics of a sarscov2 challenge trial two alternative scenarios to participation in the challenge trial are especially pertinent in one a person declines to participate in any sarscov2 vaccine efficacy test that scenario helps identify how trial participation may affect that person overall for good and for ill in another the same person participates in the competing form of trial namely a standard efficacy trial for the same vaccine the latter would result in delay but it may be tempting to argue that it is kinder to study participants and hence more ethical to compare personal risks between the two studies we shall look at the participants average counterpart in the efficacy study whether or not the participant of the challenge trial can herself join a standard efficacy study
it turns out that compared to either of these two alternative scenarios both for each individual and for the cohort the net risk from participating in a sarscov2 vaccine challenge would be negative small or unclear the net risk could not be clearly very large differently put a sarscov2 challenge trial may turn out to constitute indirectly beneficial research for study participantsso that they would be medically disadvantaged if ultimately excluded from it or if they were admitted to a standard efficacy trial instead properly done a challenge trial certainly would not expose participants to a known far higher prospect of net harm than would either of these alternativeshow might introducing a sometimes deadly and incurable pathogen into the body of a perfectly healthy person improve that persons health and welfare prospects the explanation lies in the peculiarities of the current pandemic which features a highly transmissible virus and overwhelms health systems worldwide for any individual the probability of incurring death or disability from an infection is a x b where a stands for the probability of getting infected and b stands for the probability of either dying from or developing a longterm disability as a result of the infection what is a x b if an individual participates in a challenge trial what is it if she declines what is it if she participates instead in a standard efficacy trial is the probability largest in the first case and by enough to justify blocking willing and decisionally capacitated adults from enabling highly valuable trials to gauge the magnitude of a x b in a challenge trial versus outside any trial versus in a standard efficacy trial let us look separately at a and at b in each of these three scenarioswhen people assume that challenge trials are very dangerous to participate in they usually focus on a the probability of getting infected under these three scenarios for any candidate participant the likelihood of getting infected is clearly greater with the challenge trials artificial challenge than if the person either declines to participate in any trial or participates in a standard efficacy trial however in the sarscov2 case the research team can and should select participants for whom the probability of infection is least larger in a challenge trial recent models predict widespread worldwide exposure to this coronavirus some areas are likely to experience infection rates of greater than 50
12
 and the proposal is to recruit only from areas with ongoingly or expected high transmission rates

 since the world is a large and variegated place and candidate selection can be careful and targeted there should be many outlier areas among which to choose where the probability of getting infected later would be very high at the time of candidate selection because expedited vaccine trials could shorten the current global economic recession and prevent many deaths worldwide it would make perfect sense to invest in carefully selecting and then safely transporting a few hundred healthy candidate participants from hightransmission areas to the isolated research centerseven across international borders in light of the public health emergency related red tape should be removed if participants are selected in that way the challenge trial is much likelier to hasten participants exposure than to impose an exposure that they would have otherwise avoided in the rare event that exposure kills a participant the earlier exposure could mean that the individual dies a few months sooner than if exposed to the virus outside the trial design but this temporal factor seems less significant than the substantial effect trial participation could have on how likely the person is to diewith appropriate trial procedures and smart participant selection b the probability of dying or developing disability if infected would be smaller in a challenge trial it may be much smaller first the proposed trial design includes frequent monitoring that may catch disease and enable participants to receive supportive care and any therapeutics proven by that point very early probably before any complications develop
14
 outside the challenge trials by contrast testing could be scarce and many carriers could remain asymptomatic which impedes a testandtreat approach that may be deemed promising for some patients any therapeutics proven by then might not be universally available yet
so long as challenge participants are selected and supported as recommended the prospective harms properly understood as the incremental harms are unlikely to far exceed the benefits for individual participants they could actually be smaller
it would be only prudent and fair toward trial participants to prioritize them for any novel therapeutics
15
 challenge trials for a sarscov2 vaccine should also offer guaranteed access to standardofcare lifesustaining treatments including immediate assistance during cardiac arrest as lifesupport services reach capacity in many parts of the developed world over the coming months patients from hightransmission areas who develop severe disease will often die outside trials it is true that according to reports published so far most covid patients who rely on critical care do not survive
16
 but crucially here younger covid patients who need critical care tend to survive
17
 in the united kingdom for example of the covid patients aged 16 to 39 whose critical care outcomes were reported by may 15 2020 819 had been released from critical care
18
 it is also true that a period in intensive care for covid19 treatment may leave patients physically or psychologically disabled
19
 but the option of receiving critical care which significantly helps prevent the very worst outcome of shortterm fatality is clearly a substantial medical benefit because for young patients with severe covid19 the absence of lifesustaining interventions makes a big difference between likely survival and no chance at all the probability of averting death in the event of infection would be substantially better inside a challenge trial than outside any trial and this probability would be somewhat larger than in a standard efficacy trial which would find it somewhat harder to provide that full guarantee of support to its thousands of participantsin short if researchers conducting challenge trials act as recommended admittedly the probability of getting infected would remain larger inside a challenge trial than either outside any trial or in a standard efficacy trial but the probability of death or disability is likely to be much smaller inside a challenge trial than in these alternative scenarios overall a x b could be smaller for any individual inside the challenge trial than either outside any trial or in a standard efficacy trial what the individual would lose in the probability of averting infection with that probability rising she could gain in better protection from deatheven if eventually with more data and calculations a x b turns out to be equal under these alternative scenarios or slightly better under them here is what is unlikely to be the case dynamic and uncertain data notwithstanding that a x b is much much smaller if a properly selected and treated individual does not participate in any trial or if she partakes in a standard efficacy trial instead this matters in espousing a limit on how risky participating in a trial may justifiably be contemporary research ethicists usually describe what exceeds that limit in terms of extremely high net risk to the participant the limit is surpassed only when the overall balance of prospective medical harms and medical benefits to the participant is highly adverse
20

there is another important welfare or borderlinemedical benefit from participation some potential challenge participants simply could not extinguish risk of getting exposed say because they have to leave home for essential work they could not extinguish it either by declining to participate in any trial or by participating in a standard efficacy trial instead among them those who live with others would understandably worry about infecting household members including in some cases old or frail relatives they would know that if reinfection is rare or impossible something that scientists are still examining they would not infect them as long as their own infection and infectious period take place in isolation putting at least a temporary end to the risk of infecting others would help keep their loved ones alivesurely a substantial benefit
21
 by contrast if they do not join any study or if they participate in a standard efficacy study the probability of infecting those dearest to them could remain substantialall in all so long as challenge participants are selected and supported as recommended above the prospective harms properly understood as the incremental harms are unlikely to far exceed the benefits for individual participants they could actually be smallerto sum up so far the answer to the right question about the appreciation in net risk is that on balance challenge trial participation could be either prospectively beneficial or neutral or slightly prospectively harmfulcertainly not highly prospectively harmful therefore it cannot justify paternalistic protection when adults with the requisite decisionmaking capacity wish to help researchers do enormous goodone objection is that my argument compares participation in a challenge trial to the wrong scenarios the correct comparison it could be objected is to idealized circumstancesof greater justice otherwise a vaccine producer might exploit unjust background strife of candidate participants to offer them less safety than it should
22

to exploit someone is roughly to use their unjust disadvantage to ones unfair advantage leaving them with less than they should have
23
 for example a sweatshop owner makes to potential workers a worse offer than she should the pay is unfairly low and the degree of safety is not what it should be exploiting their alternatives which are unfairly even worsestarvation for instance the fundamental problem here may have to do with the distributive consequences say that the owner winds up with too much and the workers too little or with the workers effective inability to decline the offer or simply with the perverse relation in which the owner stands to them whatever the fundamental problem may be we usually consider this problematic and inasmuch as widespread infections and lack of access to critical care flow from injustices one could claim that recruiters for human challenge trials or the societies they serve are likewise exploiting an unjust disadvantage instead one could argue the appropriate comparator of participating in a challenge trial is living in a world free of these injustices or their disadvantageous sequelae indeed two senior french doctors were recently condemned for having proposed testing coronavirus vaccines in african patients based on assumptions about african nations financial inability to fight the virus effectively
24
 while the backlash probably had more to do with unsympathetic and somewhat racist suggestions that these doctors made on the occasion the potential exploitation of background economic injustices may also have been a concernthe challenge trials i discuss here would probably take place in leading research centers in the richest countries but inside these countries transmission rates and the need for unavailable critical care services may typically end up being worst in impoverished minority and undocumented migrant neighborhoods among the uninsured and underinsured and among other victims of societal injustice some unethical historical challenge trials were done on such participants improving these participants overall risk exposure compared to their unjust alternatives
25
 while these historical comparisons are obviously inappropriate given that these abuses also involved violations of consent of independent review and so forth
26
 their unethical nature may also have involved the exploitation of background injustices
27
 does the potential for that kind of exploitation undermine my case for testing sarscov2 vaccines through the challenge trial designthere is a simple answer to the concern about exploitation to avoid preying on victims of injustice likely to live in certain areas all research teams need to do is recruit elsewhere the world is a big place and unfortunately there will be plenty of areas with ongoing and expected high transmission as well as devastating demand for critical care services even absent grossly unjust background poverty disparities lack of insurance and the like some locales are experiencing or can expect a surge in covid19 cases for reasons other than preexisting systemic injusticesimply because of bad luck or even warranted choices that panned out poorly for example governments may not have invested a great portion of health care funds in intensive care units and supplies in the years before the pandemic in favor of investing in costeffective interventions that over time promote population health and longevity more researchers could always focus recruitment on such locales indeed although researchers should recruit from hightransmission areas those need not be areas of the very highest transmission rates if the latter locales correlate closely with background injustices some other areas that are generally betteroff would do of course it is impossible to project which locales will have become hightransmission areas when it is time to test the efficacy of each candidate vaccine for illustrative purposes however consider middleclass areas of stockholm if social democratic swedens recent choices to avoid social distancing turn out to have been epidemiologically mistaken not quite the same thing as unjust
28
 again transporting a few hundred candidate participants from afar even across borders to the research center is a rational financial and administrative investment toward alleviating a deep recessiona second answer is that in this instance research teams may be able to recruit volunteers driven not solely by promoting their own health but also by altruism the nonprofit 1day sooner is collating contact details of potential volunteers for live sarscov2 challenge trials and reports over 21000 applications at the time of this writing
29
 many potential volunteers study or teach at elite academic institutions many are selfidentified effective altruists who recount past altruistic acts while selfreports ought to be taken with caution it may turn out that enough participants would volunteer with full comprehension of the medical risks perhaps out of altruism and not because of misunderstandingand not because they have suffered systemic injustice that makes them vulnerable to exploitation avoiding financial incentives for participation would further help select volunteers with the best motives
30
 the causal route to their participation would not exploitatively rely on offering benefits to thwart major injustices toward thema third answer is that the ethics around nonexploitation is complex avoiding exploitation as defined above would mean that some victims of injustice are denied any benefits of trial participation and that many people like them of the same racial minority for example or as undernourished as they are are denied the benefit of the vaccines having been tested in people like them the upshot of showing that an action would be exploitative is therefore unclear sometimes it is much better to be exploited than not to be exploitedfinally even if exploiting unjust strife were unavoidable in challenge trials of sarscov2 vaccines concerns about exploitation would not be strong enough to unseat the otherwise very strong case for these trials it is true that even with a study volunteers willing consent and even given the need to thwart a public health disaster some research ethicists not all
31
 would consider high likelihood of grave harm to a volunteer to remain forbidden
32
 but no one i know seriously argues that worries about beneficial perfectly consensual research that is marred merely by an exploitative route to benefit and consent is enough to ban a study that can be expected to save an inordinate number of lives remember that the challenge trial design could cut several months in the wait for vaccine rollout translating into thousands or millions of lives spared from exponential growth in direct covid deaths
33
 true only a third to one half of all vaccine efficacy trials lead to vaccine approval
34
 and there is some chance that none of the over 100 extant vaccine candidates will work or that an approved vaccine will not be rolled out widely but even a portion of the potential lives that might be spared thanks to sarscov2 vaccine challenge trials from covid death from death or serious harm from other diseases that are neglected during the pandemic and from famines and halted economic development during months of delay could be a very large number of lives sparedput more dramatically the main factor resting on one side of the moral scale is a significant chance at averting a great number of deathsprobably vastly more than in the 20142016 ebola outbreak with 11315 deaths or even the 2004 indian ocean tsunami with around 250000 deaths what stands on the other side is not averting serious net harm to an individual which is the consideration that some research ethicists count more the complaint on that side is that while admittedly challenge trial participation could benefit that individual on balance and she could rationally and autonomously choose to enroll the causal roots of that benefit are impure this is not a balance that would stop any serious research ethicist from approving a crucial trialfor all these reasons the concern about exploitation even if applicable and cogent cannot unseat the initial case for conducting challenge trials this is not to say that researchers should ignore that concern it may affect how best to conduct the trialssay by recruiting from areas with high transmission rates but no blatant injustices still some form of challenge trial remains permissible and to accelerate vaccine rollout highly recommended ethicallychallenge trials should enroll individuals only with their fully free and informed consent
35
 but with some medical trials just or unjust background circumstances are so dire that they leave candidate participants no reasonable option except to enroll perhaps that is what troubles ethicists who consider challenge trials and warn about dire background injustices it may also be part of what worries some about the quality of consent in trials of novel cancer therapeutics which give terminal patients a last hope to fight off a cancer that is irresponsive to approved treatments
36
 in a sense these desperate patients cannot because they cannot afford to say no and are forced to participate in english when one chooses the less bad of two bad options one is often said to have been forced or compelled to make that choice
37
 all this may seem to invalidate any consent that people in dire circumstances may give to trial participation and may make their inclusion in the trial unfree and one could argue wrongful and given the effects of the current pandemic anyone joining a challenge trial for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus may be said to be forced to participatethis argument that bad alternatives to trial participation invalidate consent to participate cannot work it would forbid many ordinary participant selection procedures for cancer therapy research it could even absurdly invalidate consent to advanced cancer care on the parallel ground that the patient cannot afford to say no but the argument is even more questionable when applied to vaccine research the risk profile of someone who knows that she has advanced cancer is very different from that of someone wholike vaccine trial recruitshas not been infected and is therefore at far less dramatic risk especially if research teams recruit only young and healthy individuals for whom even infection is highly unlikely to translate into severe disease recruits should not feel desperate or compelled to participate in the trial for their own healths sakes what i argued above is only that there are health benefits from participation not that recruits should feel desperate for them if some persistently do they should be excluded in the consent process for misunderstanding relevant facts or on psychiatric grounds in that respect since we should permit these cancer studies we should also permit human challenge studies of novel coronavirus vaccinessome vaccine candidates may turn out only in efficacy testing to be toxic
38
 some may turn out only during efficacy testing to enhance covid19 severity manifold
39
 the greater the chance for vaccine safety issues the better in that respect for individuals to decline to participate in trials
40
 this may suggest that participating in the challenge trial is prospectively harmful after alllet me offer four responses first challenge trial participants would prospectively benefit in other ways and so may still prospectively benefit overallthis risk notwithstanding second that chance for vaccine safety issues is as likely per person to arise in standard efficacy trials assuming that some form of efficacy testing of vaccines is legitimate in this crisis this factor should not weigh against challenge trials third in standard efficacy trials toxicity and severe disease are much less safe for participants because they erupt in the field not in a controlled medical environment with frequent monitoring and guaranteed medical help
41
 therefore vaccine unsafety is far more dangerous to a participant in a standard efficacy trial than to one in a challenge trial fourth in standard efficacy trials any risk of toxicity or enhanced severity accrues to 10 to 50 times as many participants for the simple reason that such trials require 10 to 50 times as many participants in short appropriate concern about enhanced severity cannot constitute an advantage of standard efficacy trials over a human challenge trial quite the contrary it only strengthens the ethical case for challenge trials to replace standard efficacy testing of vaccines against the novel coronavirusi have argued that if challenge trials are done right the incremental risk from participation in them may be smaller than the incremental benefit from it the main benefit invoked was priority access to critical care and therapeutics in the event of severe covid19 however that benefit may seem irrelevant or tertiary to some either because harm allegedly matters more than benefits or because this particular benefit is indirectcontempt for mere benefits merits only a short response researchers as well as clinicians appropriately offer countermeasures known to be riskier when the expected benefits exceed the expected risks while some benefits such as mere enhancement and mere financial benefit might be less important than a trials primary benefit to the participant others are clearly as important the benefits discussed here are in terms of avoiding covid19 fatalitythe main risk under consideration indeed it is not even clear what counts as reduction in incremental risk and what as increase in incremental benefit
42

what is worth further discussion is the worry that these lifesaving benefits are nevertheless merely indirect because they would not arise from receiving the intervention being studied
43
 nor is treatment for covid19 among the clinical benefits of the procedures that are scientifically necessary to test the experimental intervention under study
44
 an anonymous reviewer of an earlier version of this article thought that indirect benefits should not count toward the assessment of study participants balance of personal risks and personal benefits lest researchers address any major risk with financial compensation or still other indirect benefitshowever for the purposes of this article we can set aside the question whether money can ever adequately compensate for acute medical risk again priority access to covid19related critical care is a medical not a financial benefit it directly addresses the main risk of challenge participation namely premature covid19related mortality how can such an indirect benefit not countin addition some benefits from participation in a covid19 challenge trial would be direct benefits consider potentially better protection for ones family if infection provides longterm immunity and a safer environment for episodes of enhanced disease severity compared to the environment for standard efficacy trial participants these benefits emanate directly from the best scientific way to hold the studyfurthermore scholars who have looked at indirect benefits usually propose including them in institutional review boards riskbenefit calculations
45
 or even on informed consent forms
46
 in fact the questionable in my view regulatory block on invoking indirect benefits pertains in the united states only to research on people who cannot provide informed consent such as children
47
 and is irrelevant to the present case of challenge trials on decisionally capacitated adults
48

even the benefit of better access to critical care and therapeutics in a challenge trial than in ones hightransmission area is borderline direct while not strictly speaking scientifically necessary to test the experimental intervention under study this care would be part of trial safety it is not ancillary care or retroactive compensation for a trial that risks covid19 fatality instead it preempts high risk of covid fatality resulting from the viral exposure in the studyaccess to critical care is also ethically owed to study participants per most accounts of research ethics anyhow critical care is not experimental treatment that as such might not be owed nor is it in rich countries so exquisitely rare that despite participants especially strong claim to it they should be denied it not to offer critical care would be preposterous in a challenge trial for a deadly disease that critical care helps treat far from an afterthought to appease those protesting an unfair riskbenefit ratio critical care is owed in the first placewhat if a candidate participant who hails from a hightransmission area actually has low risk of getting infected for a reason that sets her apart from her neighbors such as being personally willing and able to isolate herself extraordinarily well then there is an important sense in which trial participation could harm that individual greatly in the trial exposure would be certain whereas outside the trial it would remain unlikely
49

researchers should go some way toward identifying and excluding such individuals for example by asking about candidate participants work and household arrangements or even surveying them on risk behavior perhaps informed consent forms should exhort candidate participants to consider personal risk factors and avoid participation if they are highly unlikely to get exposed naturally however just as some participants would have less risk of natural exposure than researchers could know others would have greater risk of natural exposure than researchers could know researchers should ascribe to candidates the average risk level for the risk category package they investigate by sticking with the average nonomniscient researchers are as likely to introduce more net harm than expected as they are to introduce less net harm than expected it should all balance out and the risk exposure that researchers are ethically responsible for is arguably the one that they know or could with reasonable effort find out about not the objective one discussed here
as i have argued the right ethical question about human challenge trials for sarscov2 vaccines is not the commonly raised one about their likelihood of leading to deaths and other severe adverse events given the diseases seriousness and the current lack of proven therapeutics the right question is whether challenge trials would increase study participants likelihood of similar bad outcomes compared to two alternative scenarios nonparticipation in any trial and participation in standard efficacy trials for the same vaccines as shown surprisingly compared to these two alternatives human challenge studies would on balance probably benefit or at least not dramatically harm study participants challenge trials could also reduce the overall prospect of harm in the participant cohortwith respect to sarscov2 ethicists should not advocate a ban on a trial design that may accelerate a proven vaccines rollout by months just because risks were calculated the wrong way let us not miss our chance to quash the current global crisis earlier through perfectly permissible researcha further conclusion follows based on the ethical requirement to give participants a fair balance of risks and benefits it need not be important to recruit individuals or a cohort who would be at low risk of bad outcomes in the trial the balance of risks and benefits may turn out to be similar for participants who would be at low risk in the trial such as young and healthy individuals and for ones who would be at high risk such as older people and individuals who have relevant underlying health problems it may turn out that compared to these alternative scenarios challenge trial participation is prospectively beneficial or not very harmful for all potential recruits including highrisk onesif and when that is indeed the case it would seem compatible with sensibly calculated riskbenefit requirements to recruit for a challenge trial not only young and healthy people
50
 for whom both risks and benefits are low it would also seem permissible to recruit old people and people who live with health conditions that make them especially vulnerable to covid19 people for whom both risks and benefits are high all could benefit or at least not lose a lot in their prospects compared to if they do not participate and compared to if they participate in a standard efficacy trialrecruiting an ample number of participants from several such vulnerable populations may allow us to skip further testing for vaccine safety
51
 or efficacy in populations earlier excluded from the efficacy study and move straight to conditional approval and alongside further rigorous testing in broader populations wide rollout additional months would be saved in the race to a universal vaccine rolloutother ethical considerations may be thought to weigh against recruiting older patients and patients with conditions that increase risk from infection one is that their recruitment could increase the risk that some patients would die from trial procedures undermining public trust another is that for these higherrisk populations the benefit of guaranteed access to therapeutics and lifesustaining interventions in the event of severe infection might be crucial enough to force them to participate in the sense expounded above whether these two considerations are sensible and weighty enough to forgo cutting additional months from the process is a question that i shall leave for another dayfunding for this work comes from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases through grant ai11461706 hiv cure studies risk risk perception and ethicsfor helpful comments i am grateful to paul firth scott halpern samia hurst gregory kaebnick peter k lee marc lipsitch alex j london harisan nasir dan wikler and an anonymous reviewergenomic alignments suggest that the covid-19 virus sars-cov-2 from the genus betacoronavirus may be the result of recombination of genetic material from two different viruses one similar to the chinese horseshoe bat virus 1 and the other closer to the pangolin virus two divergent viruses could have infected the same organism simultaneously to date aside from bat coronavirus ratg13 962 similarity the pangolin-cov 9102 similarity is the coronavirus most closely related to sars-cov-2 2 even though the exact origin of the virus remains unclear it is possible to infect a chinese horseshoe bat or a pangolin with the sars-cov-2 and evaluate the success of the infection to determine the origin of the new virus responsible for the pandemic did it come from animals or from a laboratory while the absence of disease symptoms in these animals may be due to the effectiveness of their immune systems the intensity of viral proliferation can be easily detected using the real-time pcr technique however the genie has already escaped from the bottle and now we need to deal with the result not the cause moreover a hand-made virus is likely to be effective against both animals and humans investigations suggest that sars-cov-2 may bind human ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor with high affinity but computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal and that the rbd receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is optimized for binding to human ace2 receptor with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted 3 4 this evidence is strongly arguing against culture-based scenarios thus the high-affinity binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to human ace2 receptor is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ace2 receptor that permits another optimal binding solution to arise however more scientific facts are needed to answer the question about the origin of the virus obtaining related viral sequences from animal sources would be the most definitive way of revealing viral origins 1 the possibility of the existence of a potential intermediate host of sars-cov-2 a missing link between a bat and human or a pangolin and human can also shed light on the current pandemic to date however there is no credible evidence to support the claim that sars-cov-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered coronavirus 5in early december 2019 the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were identified in wuhan the capital city of hubei province in china 6 the pathogen has since been identified as a novel enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna betacoronavirus 7 this virus which has a phylogenetic similarity to sars-cov 8 has been given the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 also covid-19 virus to date among the total number of patients with covid-19 globally the case-fatality rate ratio between the dead and total number of infected ranges from 51 to 52 and is constantly increasing this is ten times more than from the usual seasonal flu also sars-cov-2 is supposed to be more contagious and environmentally stable than seasonal flu viruses since seasonal flu usually ends by april in northern hemisphere in addition it seems that the virus is also more likely to affect the heart than any other similar viruses so although pneumonia is often the main cause of death cardiologists and infectionists for example in russia are seeing infected patients whose worst symptoms are not respiratory but cardiac and many people infected with covid-19 are dying from heart attacks as a possible complication of sars-cov-2 infection high expression of the ace2 receptor via which covid-19 virus enters cells using its spike glycoprotein was identified in type ii alveolar cells at2 of the lung 911 esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon 11 cholangiocytes 12 myocardial cells kidney proximal tubule cells and bladder urothelial cells these findings indicate that those organs with high ace2 expressing cells should be considered as a potential high risk for sars-cov-2 infection 9investigations suggest that the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 is the result of the combination of a bat sars-cov with an unknown beta-cov 13 probably a coronavirus of pangolin origin the s1 subunit containing the receptor-binding domain region of the spike protein of pangolin-cov is much more closely related to that of sars-cov-2 than to that of the bat coronavirus ratg13 moreover while five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 mainly expressed in a small subset of cells in the lung called type 2 alveolar cells 8 are completely consistent between pangolin cov and sars-cov-2 four amino acid mutations are present in ratg13 2 the spike protein of sars-cov-2 contains a 3-d structure in the receptor-binding domain region to maintain the van der waals forces 14 the 394 glutamine residue in the receptor-binding domain region of sars-cov-2 is recognized by the critical lysine 31 residue on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a key receptor for virus penetration it is also believed that the single n501t mutation in the sars-cov-2 spike protein corresponding to the s487t mutation in sars-cov may have significantly enhanced its binding affinity for human ace2 and subsequent penetration 3for the human population this is the third significant coronavirus infection to occur in the twenty-first century following severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 20022003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2011 both sars-cov and mers-cov were newly identified coronaviruses of zoonotic origin in the genus betacoronavirus with a much lower incidence than sars-cov-2 8096 cases for sars since 2002 mortality rate  10 and 2494 cases for mers since 2012 mortality rate  35 oddly enough sars-cov-2 is not very similar to the genomes of sars-cov about 79 or mers-cov about 50 7 15 despite the initial reports stating that most of the laboratory-confirmed infected patients 27 of 41 cases had links to the wuhan seafood market where different animals including bats snakes birds pangolins and other small mammals are normally traded within the market 6 it is now obvious that the newly identified coronavirus sars-cov-2 is transmitted with enormous efficacy from human to human via respiratory droplets or close contact the highly contagious nature of sars-cov-2 is probably due in large part to the virus spreading via asymptomatic infected individuals 16 which is exacerbated by an un-usually long incubation period of up to 1114 days based on data from hospitalized patients the majority of covid-19 cases about 80 presented as asymptomatic or with mild symptoms while the remainder were severe or critical 6 17most covid-19 patients developed lymphopenia and pneumonia with characteristic pulmonary ground-glass opacity changes seen on chest computed tomography 6 17 18 sars-cov-2 is believed to dampen anti-viral interferon responses resulting in uncontrolled viral replication for sars-cov and mers-cov the response to viral infection by type i ifn is suppressed the influx of neutrophils and monocytesmacrophages results in hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines 19 the study of 41 hospitalized patients revealed high-levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-2 il-7 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf in the most severe cases of covid-19 6 this so-called cytokine storm can initiate viral sepsis and inflammatory-induced lung injury which lead to other complications including pneumonitis acute respiratory distress syndrome ards respiratory failure shock organ failure and potentially death 19 individuals particularly susceptible to covid-19 are elderly people with underlying diseases including diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease 6 since sars-cov-2 mutates constantly and more frequently than other rna viruses coronaviruses possess the longest genomes of all known rna viruses so more errors are made when they are copied also viral rna-dependent rna polymerases do not have a proofreading nuclease activity it is likely that strains of the virus will appear whose host preference will change for instance by reducing the average age of patients with a severe course of the disease as global infection has progressed we are now more frequently seeing young patients dying from covid-19tang et al found single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in sars-cov-2 at location 8782 orf1ab polyprotein t8517c synonymous and 28144 orf8 protein c251t s84l non-synonymous among the 103 sars-cov-2 virus strains in genbank 101 of them exhibited complete linkage between the two snps 72 strains  71 exhibited a ct haplotype defined as l type because t28144 is in the codon of leucine and 29 strains  29 exhibited a tc haplotype defined as s type because c28144 is in the codon of serine at these two sites although the l type  71 was more prevalent than the s type  29 in the sars-cov-2 viruses examined the s type is actually the ancestral version of sars-cov-2 nucleotides of the s type at sites 8782 and 28144 were identical to the orthologous sites in the most closely related viruses the ratio observed 7129 suggests that the l type has a higher transmission rate than the s type or was more prevalent at the start of the pandemic interestingly while the l type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan 963l37s the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 possibly because human intervention efforts may have caused severe selective pressure against the l type 20what about reinfection earlier a pivotal role for virus-specific memory t-cells in broad and long-term protection against sars-cov infection was elucidated 21 22 indeed the crucial protective role of t-cell immune responses in coronavirus infections has been clearly documented in several animal models eg feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv mouse hepatitis virus mhv and avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv 2325 moreover reinfection did not occur in sars-cov-2 infected rhesus macaques with the same strain 26 what about reinfection with other possible strains of people who recovered from initial infection with one strain at present it remains unclear whether convalescing patients are at risk for relapse or reinfection it is also worth noting the theory that coronavirus infections might play a part in multiple sclerosis it is known that mouse hepatitis virus a murine coronavirus is a close relative of common human coronavirus hcov-oc43 which causes a multiple sclerosis-like demyelinating disease in the central nervous system of rodents 27 some studies have suggested that human coronaviruses in particular hcov-oc43 may be involved in gastrointestinal disease coronaviruses can be detected in stool samples and antibodies directed to hcov-oc43 have been observed more frequently in children with gastroenteritis 28 thus the future health of people who have recovered from covid-19 may be accompanied by complicationsit should be noted that in nature the number of host organisms is regulated by parasites including viruses outbreaks are eventually replaced by a population decline lotkavolterra system of equations as an example of a kolmogorov model it is necessary to consider the r-strategy of virus survival in which a large number of descendants as well as mutants are formed based on the lotkavolterra equations when the human population declines as the result of the action of a virus following a delay the overall population of the virus also decreases thus in the human population during the decline phase the majority of individuals have genotypes adapted for the virus strains prevailing at the moment under these circumstances the human population will start to grow until the virus genotypes capable of suppressing the human population significantly appear again the same line of reasoning can be applied to a medical drug-virus system except that a drug cannot change by itself therefore it is necessary to control viruses constantly with new drugs developed for use against both new strains of viruses and new species of viruses to save the lives of virus-sensitive people taking into consideration the natural genetic mechanisms of mutations and recombination it is impossible to imagine how to deprive a virus of the opportunity to generate new strains and time to time threaten our world with new pandemicsit must be understood that the short-term relationship between the virus and the host is always the result of darwins microevolution individuals who do not die in the fight against the virus will form a generation that is more resistant to the virus over time the virus will continue to reproduce in these individuals but will not pose a great danger to them on the other hand humanity is capable of inventing drugs against viruses and slowing down the progress of darwins microevolution saving the lives of those who otherwise might die without treatment would covid-19 patients after successful treatment or recovery again become severely infected with other strains of this virus there are no guarantees at the moment but it is clear that the virus will continue to circulate and kill the people who are most susceptible to itthus based on the facts accumulated so far it is clear that while the new coronavirus is more aggressive it does not have mortality rates as high as those seen with sars-cov and mers-cov humanity will definitely survive drugs and vaccines will save the lives of some virus-sensitive people deaths among people of reproductive age will gradually lead to a human population in which the next generations will be more resistant to this virus fig 1 this is one of the primary reasons why pandemics of spanish flu h1n1 subtype did not last for many years because the overwhelming majority of people who died were aged 1845 individuals genetically resistant to the virus survived it and formed the next virus-resistant generation published studies indicate that 2040 of populations in some areas have been infected by the h1n1 virus and thus have some level of protective immunity 29the origin of sars-cov-2 is not completely understood if this virus is man-made then it is necessary to go back 45 years and rethink the results of the asilomar conference on recombinant dna held in 1975 when scientists met to discuss the potential biohazards and regulation of biotechnology and banned some potentially dangerous experiments including cloning of recombinant dnas derived from highly pathogenic organisms if the virus is of natural origin then it is necessary to understand how new coronaviruses are transferred from animal reservoirs to humans and reduce the likelihood of a person coming into contact with them in addition it is imperative to develop new vaccines and drugs against coronavirus infection in case of emergencyis it important today to stop the spread of infection as quickly as possible yes if possible it must be stopped however is it in our power to do so when the official number of diagnosed cases has already exceeded 1 million people worldwide probably not in some cases the human population has been able to completely obliterate a viral disease by enacting successful anti-epidemiological measures as happened with the smallpox virus 30 but smallpox virus had no animal reservoir apparently covid-19 is not one of these cases in our opinion the high contagiousness of sars-cov-2 and the ability of coronaviruses to persist for a long time in host organisms 31 32 will allow the covid-19 virus to continue to circulate in the human population until the fall of 2020 when a new pandemic wave seems to occur again the most likely outcome is that this new coronavirus as occurred with the four other well-known non-severe acute respiratory syndrome nonsars-related human coronaviruses hcovs including hcov-229e -oc43 -hku1 and -nl63 will take its place next to the seasonal flu viruses where the infection rate is high and the mortality rate is very low in the near future your doctor will routinely prescribe you something like covidol and say that in the coming days you are likely to recover interestingly after the discovery of non-sars hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 several groups reported infections by these viruses in different countries illustrating that these viruses have spread worldwide 3339 the viruses can be detected in 110 of patients with acute respiratory tract infections and double infections with other respiratory viruses are common 37 of note for sars-cov a close relative of sars-cov-2 there is evidence of at least seven potential regions of recombination in the sars-cov genome in the replicase- and spike-coding regions with possible recombination partners that include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev bovine coronavirus bcov hcov-229e mhv and ibv 40 a similar study involving the human coronavirus hcov-nl63 likewise demonstrated that hcov-nl63 exhibited signs of having arisen from multiple recombination events from its nearest relative over the course of hundreds of years 41 thus it is possible that sars-cov-2 through multiple recombination events can trigger an outbreak of respiratory diseases caused by new strains of nonsars-related human hcovsnow as a century ago during the spanish flu pandemic the emphasis on washing hands frequently avoiding crowds and wearing masks are recurrent in newspaper records and on websites as is disdain for people flouting the rules in the meantime when we wash our hands with soap we should thank providence that the sars-cov-2 does not have the same mortality rate as mers-cov as the situation stands right now it is better to become infected with covid-19 as late as possible to allow vaccines and drugs to be developed and tested as there are no guarantees yet concerning who is at risk of a severe course of the disease and who is not apparently the bitter and unpopular truth is that most of the worlds inhabitants need to make contact with the sars-cov-2 before we can all return to normal life quarantine slows down this process gaining time for doctors and scientists who through their professional activities can save virus-sensitive individuals so often we have to choose quickly but painfully or gently but slowly today we find ourselves in a zugzwang situation a greater number of deaths or the collapse of the global economy we are on the second path so far but soon we will need to reach a compromise because sars-cov-2 will continue to circulate in the human population this coronavirus is with us forever perhaps we can learn from the seasonal flu viruses that kill hundreds of thousands of people every year since we are used to these viruses they do not scare us anymore so we have reached the compromise that lets us all move forwardthe who declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 an emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 and a pandemic on 11 march according to whos situation report - 79 as of 8 april 2020 the epidemic has caused 79 235 deaths worldwide1 while it is seemingly nearing its end in china where it was first reported it is still on the rise in europe in the usa and in other parts of the world including in many low-income and middle-income countries lmics the pandemic has triggered unprecedented measures worldwide many countries have installed travel bans confinement and lockdown policies these responses have been adopted in an emergency mode and are largely reactionary aimed at mitigating the spread of the disease while waiting for a specific cure andor vaccine to be developedhere we do not want to underestimate the risks caused by the pandemic nor to question the measures taken by the who and governments but we would like to express our concerns regarding four covid-19-related issues and advocate for a paradigm shiftthat is a scientific revolution encompassing changes in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline2to prepare for future crisesit is important to remember other acknowledged and preventable health conditions when compared with the focus that covid-19 has triggered at global and national levels respiratory diseases have been leading causes of death and disability in the world before covid-19 it is estimated that globally four million people die prematurely from chronic respiratory disease each year in particular one million die annually from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pneumonia kills millions of people annually and is a leading cause of death among children under 5 years old each year 14 million die from tuberculosis and lung cancer kills 16 million people a year and is the deadliest cancer3 the who estimates that seasonal influenza kills up to 650 000 people a year4 in 2018 an estimated 405 000 people died of malaria5 in 2017 about 295 000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirththat is approximately 810 women each day6 in the usa alone a lower limit of 210 000 deaths per year was associated with preventable harm in hospitals7whereas infectious diseases seem to inspire the most terror among the public and policymakers non-communicable diseases are responsible for almost 70 of all deaths8 depression affects 300 million people globally and is the leading cause of disability worldwide and nearly 800 000 people die from suicide every year9 the global boom in premature mortality and morbidity from non-communicable diseases has now reached a point where some have even suggested it to be a pandemic10 moreover climate change through increased heat waves and disasters and atmospheric and environmental pollution are expected to increase deaths and injuries especially in lmics11 in some debates climate change has become more than a risk factor with increasing calls for the who to declare it a public health emergency12from a public health perspective covid-19 needs to be appraised as part of a much bigger health picture for instance beyond the lethality and direct mortality rates of covid-19 attention should be paid to the interaction with other pathogens as well as to the more indirect effects of its mitigation measures13 indeed the pandemic and its containment measures interact with and impact on other health conditions and will have system-wide effects highlighting the importance of adopting a systems approach to its resolution14the global health community national security agencies and all governments have known that a pandemic like covid-19 was likely to come yet global health policy has remained woefully unprepared nor fit-for-purpose in 2015 the g7 members proclaimed that ebola had been a wake-up call for the need for better global cooperation it was also recognised that antimicrobial resistance amr threatened to kill 300 million people by 2050 thus demanding urgent action yet little has been done to address these existing global health governance shortcomings15for example the lauded g7 and g20 response the global health security agenda httpsghsagendaorg continues to speak in the terms of costly counter-measures versus prevention and health system strengthening moreover the pandemic emergency financing facility pef httpswwwworldbankorgentopicpandemicsbriefpandemic-emergency-financing-facility meant to deliver up to 500 million in epidemic assistance to curb expansion into a pandemic sits idle as a complicated loan mechanism at the world bank available to only a few countries eg china and india do not qualify for the money there is also serious ambiguity about how the pef intersects andor complements the whos contingency fund for emergencies cfe httpswwwwhointemergenciesfundingcontingency-fund-for-emergencies the cfe is available to more countries for more risks and more quickly but represents far less money than the pef which in theory should come after the cfe if you happen to prequalify for the loan16 the one health approach which was meant to offer a more responsive research and policy agenda to combat zoonotic diseases remains sluggish at best and underdeveloped in terms of including environmental factors such as soil and water which play a crucial part in amr and other threats17in terms of pathogen monitoring and response the 2005 international health regulations which are meant to help the international community and governments prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide18 are not fully implemented by many countries due to limited financial resources and political will and have been violated in response to the covid-19 outbreak19 what is more confounding is that many high-income countries like france have failed to fully implement the international health regulations particularly in their overseas territories16 in addition other disease control mechanisms like the who global influenza surveillance and response system httpswwwwhointinfluenzagisrslaboratoryen remain inadequate and underfunded with too few who laboratories and a market-based model where a global public good pooled influenza knowledge is turned into a private good pharmaceutical profit with historical inequities in terms of public health20 moreover many countries like china are incentivised not to raise the epidemic alarm too soon due to fears of diminished direct foreign investment like with severe acute respiratory syndrome h7n9 and now covid-19 and fears that the government will be perceived as weak21these conditions of incapacity at the international level are exacerbated by a weakened who whose budget has been radically reduced and ring-fenced for example the who used to receive three-quarters of its financing from assessed contributions levied on members however a change to a zero real growth policy for its regular budget in the 1980s has meant it now only receives a quarter of its budget from member contributions as a result the who is dependent on extra-budgetary ring-fenced pet project funding from donors to fill an increasingly shrinking budget22 as the money flows to other multilateral health initiatives the whos authority dissipates with numerous organisations like the institute for health metrics and evaluation the bill and melinda gates foundation and mdecins sans frontires able to command greater epistemic authority23 financial influence24 and response effectiveness25 however this expansion of initiatives creates a condition of policy fragmentation which significantly weakens coordinated global public health26 27one real result of fragmentation of global health governance is an inefficient division of labour where hundreds of actors such as the who global fund presidents emergency plan for aids relief united nations programme on hiv and aids united states agency for international development world bank the gates foundation and the clinton foundation to name only a few produce parallel programmes or bric--brac vertical health silos that have neither generated overall system strengthening in high burden countries nor allowed for effective global health policy27 28 this creates two failures first contrary to sector-wide approaches29 vertical pet-project global initiatives often fail to promote sustainable long-term local health system strengthening which is the best preventive defence for disease control of all types not just infectious diseases second the global level is woefully unprepared for epidemics since global policy has remained reactionary symptom-based and dependent on vaccine discoveries without full appreciation of other upstream determinants of disease and access to those vaccinesgiven the state of global health governance and inadequate investments in health system strengtheningas well as the failure by many actors to adopt a systems approach to problem resolution14the spread and danger of covid-19 is not surprising what is required we argue is to shift global health policymaking from a specific reactional paradigm to a systemic holistic and preventive paradigm there is no doubt that this approach will require serious resources governance reform and political will nevertheless the global economic costs of covid-19 have already reached into at least a trillion dollars30 thus serious efforts to improve global and local health systems would be a small fraction of this cost with a tried and true cost-saving philosophy that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of curethe emergency responses to covid-19 so far are based on the so-called pasteurian paradigm which states that each disease is due to one pathogen thus for each disease there is one cure targeting the responsible pathogen in this case laboratories are racing to find the cure or the vaccine against covid-19a vaccine which will come too late for the current epidemic and will have limited efficacy if the virus mutates in the coming months or years yet it is easy to see how the more pathogens there might be in the future which there will be the less this paradigm makes sense moreover the pasteurian paradigm has imposed its preferred research methodnamely randomised control trials that try to isolate one variable from all possible variablesas the gold standard of science relegating other approaches as near charlatanismhowever there is a multitude of evidence indicating that beyond a single pathogen the development of a disease as well as its outcome is considerably affected by the physical and social parameters in which it operates and that this is considerably affected by social political environmental and individual factors31 32 this seems widely known by the public as far as chronic non-communicable diseases are concerned but is also the case for infectious diseases especially for emerging infections in which the pathogenic role of social inequalities is recognised33 moreover the traditional frontiers between communicable and non-communicable diseases are being blurred by evidence of biosocial contagion34 in this light the globalised world is now facing a syndemicthat is a synergy of epidemics that cooccur in time and place interact with each other to produce complex sequelae and share common underlying societal drivers35 covid-19 is no exception since its mortality rate varies significantly according to age sex and comorbidities36as an alternative we argue that it would be more effective efficient and equitable to adopt a holistic approach to health how to tackle the silent killers and how to prepare populationsincluding the most vulnerable37against future epidemics should be on the top of national and global health policy and research agendas this should reflect both a security approach fighting symptomatic issues and a health development approach tackling upstream causes and determinants in doing so the objectives should not be merely be the response mode but a more concerted effort to limit environmental factors protect biodiversity38 reduce social health inequities strengthen local health systems for preventive health help populations reduce their individual risk factors and augment their natural immunitynotably through various healthy behaviours and diets that are proven to strengthen the general immune system3946 like what recently took place in the field of evaluation of complex systems and policies47 a realist revolution of medical research is probably needed to help support thisit is ultimately important that the resulting policies are not copy-pasted from other countries but adapted to each context and backed by strong local health systems by definition preventive health policies must be tailored to local specificities including local environments and health systems must be strengthened at the local level so as to be able to respond to a populations needs and expectations this is also the case for the response to covid-19 viruses and epidemics have always existed and will always exist and should be anticipated48 49 coronaviruses are a well-known family of viruses and even if this one is particularly aggressive its genome has been rapidly identified the difference with this epidemic which is causing the semicollapse of health systems is that it has revealed a profound lack of national prevention and preparedness in response to the epidemic the most hit countries so far have faced a lack of equipment and critical care beds in the uk and france as just two examples decades of austerity policies and an obsession with evaluating health facilities based on technical efficiency ie minimising inputs and increasing outputs have considerably decreased the capacity of health systems to respond to above-average frequentation50the covid-19 emergency responses of many states have revealed important inconsistencies in many european countries the authorities have adopted a one-size-fits-all policy and imposed the same measures everywhere more worryingly some governmentsnotably in africahave not performed their own adapted risk assessment before copy-pasting strategies from abroad51 this is problematic since it makes little sense to use a predictive model developed from a country where the median age is 47 and translate it to a country with a median age of 18 without adjusting the parameters in addition current policies fail to account for regional or transborder contextual parameters where either more stringent or relaxed measures could be more suitable depending on geographical determinants the universal lockdown of a whole country may not be necessary when there are only one or two epidemic outbreaks separated by hundreds of miles especially if containment is quick and determined what we suggest in order to be effective is that policies should fit each context and be adaptive at the territorial or ecosystem level versus being unreflectively and uniformly bounded by national jurisdictions this is the best way to not impose measures that are too coercive which may face legal constraints and may be counterproductive eroding public trust and cooperation52 53in the post-covid-19 recovery phase we hope the lessons learnt from local national and global responses to this pandemic will foster support by policymakers and by the public for tailored policy responses that support stronger and more integrated local health systemsin summary the current crisis calls for a paradigm shift in public and global health policies we will not be prepared for the next epidemic unless we take bold steps first global health policies should not be designed on a response mode to case-by-case threats but should adopt a systems approach that can support a holistic picture of global disease burdens risks and health conditions as well as better consider the system-wide effects of adopted measures second countering current fragmentation in global health governance will require a substantial shift in global health policymaking from a reactional paradigm to a systemic and preventive paradigm with meaningful commitments to human health security third there is a need to shift our focus from short-term curative policies based on the pasteurian paradigm to long-term preventive and promotional policies based on a holistic view of peoples health which notably implies limiting environmental factors reducing social health inequities helping populations reduce their individual risk factors and augmenting their natural immunity lastly such holistic preventive policies must be adapted to local contexts and implemented through strong local health systems able to have the cushion capacity to respond to emergenciescovid-19 is caused by coronavirus sars-cov-2 most cases of covid-19 are asymptomatic but some are severe and lethal mortality is the simplest marker of covid-19 vulnerability covid-19 vulnerability can be defined as a chance of death from covid-19 once infectedagein all studies conducted in all countries the mortality rate from covid-19 increases exponentially with age 111 exact mortality rates varied in hundreds of studies because they depend on testing and therapeutic interventions but the rule is clear the mortality rate is increasing exponentially with ageage-related diseasesmortality is especially high in patients with pre-existing conditions 6 9 10 1223in italy 99 of patients who died had at least one illness
httpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles2020-03-1899-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-saysin other words infected people without pre-existing diseases do not die this may seem paradoxical because we just discussed that age is sufficient to increase mortality exponentially this is because pre-existing conditions are manifestations of biological age whereas aging and diseases are two sides of the same coin 2426 these conditions are typical age-related diseases hypertension diabetes obesity ischemic heart disease ihd and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and other diseases 9 1223of course not all only some patients with age-related diseases die from covid-19 in other words age-related diseases are necessary but not sufficient for mortality from covid-19age and pre-existing age-related diseases are interdependent a number and severity of diseases correlate with age an average 60 year old person has more age-related diseases than an average 50 your old person yet a particular 60 year old person may have no age-related diseases whereas a particular 50 year old person may have multiple diseases including hypertension diabetes obesity and cancer in this case it is a chronologically younger person who is biologically older and it is the biological age that determines the likelihood of death from covid-19male genderat the same age the mortality rate is twice higher in men than in women 9 27 28 in part because men age faster than women and at any chronological age men are biologically older than women 29so three rules can be combined in one covid-19 vulnerability is determined by biological age biological age combines chronological age age-related diseases and gender a combination of all age-related diseases and pre-diseases is a biomarker of biological age figuratively sars-cov-2 can measure biological age which is thus the best predictor of mortality from both covid-19 and other diseasesaging can be measured as an increase in the probability of death with age mortality increases exponentially starting from age 8-9 men have a higher normal age-related death rate than women because men age faster than women 29covid-19 mortality rate parallels the expected aging-related death rate supplementary figure 1 and see second graph in
httpsmediumcomwintoncentrehow-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196chances to die from covid-19 are proportional to chances to die from aging itself at any age the only discrepancy between natural and covid-19 mortality is observed below the age of 8 years old whereas natural death rate is relatively high covid-19 mortality is low no mortality 11 this discrepancy will be discussed later but first how do animals including humans die from aginghumans and other animals including the worm 30 and the fly 31 do not die from aging itself but from age-related diseases such as ischemic heart disease ihd hypertension diabetes cancer alzheimers and parkinsons diseases age-related macular degeneration osteoporosis and sarcopenia as we will discuss even seemingly non-deadly diseases such as osteoporosis can lead to deadly complications the incidence of these diseases increases exponentially with age some diseases such as obesity hypertension and diabetes develop earlier in the course of aging other diseases such as alzheimers disease and macular degeneration are usually diagnosed later 32 33 age-related diseases may also occur in younger people with genetic predisposition and environmental exposure hazards but even without these factors diseases develop because they are quasi-programmed see quasi-programmed aging section these diseases are not diseases of civilization as it may seem humans simply now live long enough to develop them of course hazards of civilization can accelerate them at a younger ageaging and its diseases cannot be separated healthy aging or aging without diseases is merely a slow aging when biological age is less than chronological age during a period of seemingly healthy aging pre-pre-diseases and pre-diseases are progressing until they eventually reach clinical manifestations thus healthy aging progress to unhealthy and pre-diseases become diseases 34age-related diseases and covid-19 vulnerability are highly intertwined patients who die from covid-19 otherwise would die from age-related diseases such as heart disease cancer diabetes hypertension just a year later covid-19 approximately doubles a patients aging-dependent risk of dying during one year for example numbers are very approximate a sixty year old woman has 1 chance to die from aging before her 61st birthday at that age if infected the death rate from covid-19 is around 1 for females if infected a patient has approximately doubled chances to die compared with usual age-related mortality during one year as david spiegelhalter put it getting covid-19 is like packing a years worth of risk into a week or two
httpsmediumcomwintoncentrehow-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196children and young adults have a very low risk of death from aging-related diseases so that risk remains extremely low even when doubledalthough natural mortality is relatively high in the youngest age group especially in infants they do not die from age-related diseases of course instead infants are vulnerable to bacterial infections and candida infections due to underdeveloped immune system 35 low covid-19 mortality in the pediatric age group 11 is consistent with the notion that covid-19 vulnerability is not due to a weak immune system in contrast as we will discuss in the next section it is hyper-functional immune response that leads to death from covid-19 in the elderly by causing cytokine stormsevere covid-19 is characterized by hyper-inflammation cytokine storm acute respiratory distress syndrome ards damage to the lung heart and kidneys 3639in response to viral replication hyperfunctional monocytes and macrophages infiltrate the lung causing hyper-inflammation and hyper-secretion of cytokines such as interleukin il-6 il-2 il-7 il-1ra interferon- inducible protein ip-10 tumor necrosis factor tnf- ferritin monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip 1- granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf c-reactive protein crp and procalcitonin 22 3642this leads to leukocyte recruitment vascular permeability edema and further pulmonary damage in vicious cycle 37 38 41 43 44 hyper-inflammation becomes systemic in turn causing hyper-coagulation and thrombosis disseminated intravascular coagulation 45 this causes injury of distant organs such as the kidneys pre-existing organ damage late stages of age-related diseases exacerbates organ damage caused by cytokine storm 42 43 46 in addition cellular hyper-functions and systemic hyper-inflammation may lead to cellular exhaustion such as exhaustion of lymphocytes lymphopenia 4749 hypercoagulation is associated with hyperactive fibrinolysis and increased d-dimer blood levels 23 cytokine storm is a systemic hyperfunctional response figure 1of course age-related hyperfunctional response such as cytokine storm is not caused by lifelong accumulation of molecular damage aging is not caused by molecular damage after all instead its a continuation of developmentalgrowth programs that lead to hyper-functions and in turn eventually to dysfunctionsquasi means resembling or seemingly but not really quasi-program of aging is not a program but a continuation of developmental programs that were not switched off upon their completion 24 50 they purposelessly unfold leading to age-related diseases secondary organ failure and death quasi-programmed program-like aging is associated with higher than optimal cellular and systemic functions which eventually via cellular exhaustion and organ damage lead to functional decline figure 2 for example starting from birth blood pressure increases and continues to increase after organismal growth is completed therefore hypertension is the most prevalent age-related disease in turn hypertension can cause organ damage stroke infarction and renal failure similarly obesity develops in post-development as a continuation of growth yet it can be prevented by low caloric diets illustrating that quasi-program of aging can be deceleratedhyperfunction is an excessive normal cellular function contraction by smooth muscle cells smc adhesion and aggregation by blood platelets insulin secretion by beta-cells lipid accumulation by adipocytes secretion by stromal and immune cells oxidative burst by leukocytes just to name a few when higher than optimal they cause vasoconstriction and hypertension thrombosis hyperinsulinemia hypertrophy hyperplasia obesity hyper-secretory phenotype or senescence-associated secretory phenotype sasp hyper-inflammation and so onhyper-function is not necessarily an absolutely increased function it may be also insufficiently decreased function relative hyperfunction levels of igf-1 and growth hormone decrease during lifespan despite this decrease igf-1 levels are still higher than optimal relative hyper-function because further genetic decrease in igf-1 levels by genetic means extends health span and lifespan in mammals 5153cellular hyperfunctions may eventually switch to cellular exhaustion and loss of functions at late stages during the course of type ii diabetes mtor overactivation and hyperinsulinemia eventually lead to beta-cell exhaustion and insulin insufficiency from pre-diabetes to diabetes 54 55 as another example after puberty hyperstimulation of the ovary eventually leads to oocyte exhaustion and menopause see figure 3 in ref 29 depletion of nave lymphocytes is another example as reviewed here later age-related alterations are mostly noticed when they switch to functional decline which is a late eventin some cases functional decline can be primary and programmed for example thymus involution replacement of t cells by adipocytes starts early in life accelerates at puberty and continues later still loss of thymocytes and their niches may be in part due to adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy 56 in fact obesity accelerates involution whereas calorie restriction decelerates it 57 58 furthermore the oblation of sex hormones decelerates or even reverses thymus involution 59 thus involution is triggered by adipocyte hyperplasia and increased production of sex hormones during puberty 56quasi-programmed aging is not driven by molecular damage it is driven by nutrienthormonecytokine-sensing and growth-promoting signaling pathways such as target of rapamycin tor mtor which are involved in developmental growth and later cause hyperfunctional aging and its diseases 24 26what is the cause-effect relationship between age-related diseases and covid-19 lethality do patients die from age-related diseases complicated by covid-19 or in contrast do these various diseases make covid-19 infection lethal both scenarios take place to some extent however the relationship is mostly indirect both age-related diseases and covid-vulnerability result from the same underlying cause figure 3 this is why they are highly correlated the cause is aging itself aging is manifested by a sum of deadly - and not so deadly - diseases and conditions ranging from cancer to grey hair although not all diseases seem to be deadly they can cause complications such as stroke ventricular fibrillation renal failure lung edema even sarcopenia and osteoporosis lead to falls and broken bones culminating in a deadly sequence of events cosmetic manifestations such as aging spots and wrinkles while not deadly by themselves can be manifestations of other diseases for example baldness correlates with prostate enlargement 60 and the later can lead to urinary obstruction and renal failurediseases occur together for example chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd is associated with diabetes cardiovascular disease and hypertension 61 if a person has one disease eg diabetes this patient has higher chances of having other diseases eg hypertension ihd cancer or conditions including covid-19 vulnerability which is revealed only during infection but can be predicted by pre-existing diseasesaging is initially driven by an increase in cellular and systemic functions hyperfunction leading to age-related conditions for example hypertension is a systemic hyperfunction due to hyperfunction of multiple cell types such as arterial smooth muscle cells asmc similarly covid-19-vulnerability is associated with hyperfunction of inflammatory cells that in response to covid-19 infection causes cytokine storm hyper-coagulation and damage of the lung and distant organsthe covid-19 vulnerability syndrome is an aging-related disease strictly dependent on biological age associated with other age-related diseases and exemplified by hyper-functional response to infectionwith hundreds of cell types acting in concert the immune system is so complex that we cannot discuss age-related alterations without oversimplification the most noticeable alteration is that memory t and b cells replace naive t and b cells 62 this seems natural since life-long exposure to pathogens replaces nave cells by memory cells replacement of nave immune cells decreases adaptive responses to novel antigens such as sars-cov-2 in contrast immune protection by memory t cells from viral re-infection with known pathogens is usually increased with age 62immune responses are roughly divided into a innate responses carried mostly by neutrophils macrophages and nk cells which react to pathogen rapidly and nonspecifically and b adaptive responses carried by t and b lymphocytes which are delayed slower and specific eg antigen-specific clonal expansion of t and b lymphocytes and antibody production by b lymphocytes 6365 in the elderly immune responses to sars-cov-12 are stuck in innate immunity with insufficient progression to adaptive immunity 37 however decline in adaptive response such as antibody production plays little role in covid-19 mortality it is hyper-functional innate immunity hyper-inflammation cytokine storm and hyper-coagulation that lead to organ failure and death in agreement hyper inflammatory response rather than high virus numbers leads to death of sars-cov-infected old nonhuman primates 66aging is associated with diseases of immune hyper-function such as autoimmune disorders with paradoxical increase in certain signaling pathways and cytokine levels 6769in the elderly innate immune cells are in a state of sustained activation producing pro-inflammatory cytokines 67 7072 increased pro-inflammatory activity by the innate immune system especially by monocytesmacrophages is a state of alertness and hyper-reactivity on the cost of potential age-related inflammatory diseases 67 7072 whereas some functions are decreased others are increased according to the inflamm-aging concept innate immune system overtakes adaptive immune system in aging cause-effect relationships are bi-directional immunosenescence namely a decrease in adaptive response is a cause and consequence of inflamm-aging 67 7072we can consider inflamm-aging as an example of hyper-function while some functions are decreased others are increased hyper-function is damaging in analogy increased electric power without an adaptor would damage a laptop damaging hyper-functions can lead to loss of function and cellular exhaustion and vice versa loss of function may cause compensatory hyper-functions of another componentscellular senescence is a continuation of cellular growth when actual growth is completed 73 74 in proliferating cells cellular mass growth is balanced by cell division cells grow in size and then divide when the cell cycle is blocked eg p21 and p16 then growth-promoting pathways such as mtor and mapk drive conversion to senescence geroconversion 24 74 75 during geroconversion cells become hypertrophic and fat cellular functions increase hyper-secretion and lysosomal hyper-function are manifested by sasp and beta-gal staining hyper-activated growth-promoting pathways cause compensatory resistance to growth factorsinsulin permanent loss of re-proliferative potential 74 rapamycin everolimus pan-mtor and mapk inhibitors slows down geroconversion maintaining reversible quiescence instead of senescence 73 7688geroconversion is a continuation of cellular growth 73 74 similarly aging is a continuation of developmental growth see figure 1 in ref 89 when the developmental program is completed it becomes a quasi-program of aging as discussed in detail chronically activated nutrient-sensing and growth-promoting pathways drive age-related diseases culminating in organismal death 24 26age-related diseases are quasi-programmed aging is a common cause of age-related diseases a sum of all age-related diseases they are diseases of hyper-function secondary hypo-function and compensation reactions 25 they are deadly manifestations of agingfrom activation of cellular functions to systemic hyperfunctions from diseases to organ damage and death hyperfunction theory of quasi-programmed aging describes the sequence of events 26 and as discussed in 2006 suppression of aging by gero-suppressants such as rapamycin will prevent and treat all age-related diseases 24 this point of view is becoming widely accepted and in recent literature quasi-programmed model of diseases 2006 is called geroscience hypothesis 2 90if aging were functional decline due to accumulation of molecular damage then it would be near to impossible to restore functions and rejuvenate the immune system in contrast if functional decline is secondary to hyperfunctions see figure 2 in ref 89 these hyperfunctions can be suppressed pharmacologically to restore lost functions typical drugs are inhibitors of their targets rather than activators so they decrease functions of their targets by decreasing hyper-functions which otherwise lead to secondary loss of functions rapamycin may restore lost functions figure 4rapamycin improves vaccination against viruses such as influenza in old mice monkeys and humans 92100 importantly rapamycin increases pathogen-specific but not graft-reactive cd8 t

tissue-specific cellular functions terminally differentiated b t and nk cells can rapidly react to already known pathogens 102 decrease in nave t and b lymphocytes and thus diminished response to novel antigens results in part from cellular hyper-differentiation in the immune system 64 103 hyper-functional differentiation can be counteracted by rapamycin 98as another example age-related

blocks insulin and gf signaling rapamycin abrogates the loop restoring signaling 113118a high prevalence of age-related diseases often called diseases of civilization is a success story of modern medicine in the past most people did not live long enough to develop age-related diseases and those who developed them died soon after due to medical advances people survive to 85 on average despite suffering from age-related diseases standard medicine preferentially extends life span without necessarily affecting health span see figure 3 in ref 119 for example defibrillation and coronary stenting can save life but not cure heart disease it is anti-aging interventions that extend health span delaying diseases thus extending lifespan aging is a common cause of all age-related diseases by suppressing aging anti-aging interventions may delay all age-related diseases 119as a well-known example low calorie diets such as calorie restriction intermittent fasting and low carbohydrate diets extend both health and lifespan figuratively low calorie diets prolong life by improving health nutrients and obesity activate growth-promoting pathways eg mtor thus accelerating development of quasi-programmed age-related diseases obesity is associated with all age-related diseases from cancer to alzheimers and from diabetes to sarcopenia covid-19 vulnerability is also associated with obesity 9 19 20 22 according to hyperfunction theory obesity accelerates aging and all age-related conditions including covid-19 vulnerabilitydiabetes is one of main risk factors of death in covid-19

one study vlcd reversed diabetes in 46 of patients with up to a 6-year history of diabetes 120 vlcd is most effective for its prevention and at early stages of diabetes 121 this anti-aging modality is so simple that remission can be achieved at home by health-motivated individuals 122 simultaneously it treats other age-related diseases such hypertension 123 obesity is associated with other diseases of hyperfunction from diabetes and sarcopenia to cancer and alzheimers disease since age-related diseases are predictors of covid-19 mortality vlcd in theory may decrease covid-19 vulnerabilityin the

prevent age-related diseases and slow aging hundreds of recent reviews discussed rapamycin and everolimus in detail so i will just emphasize a few pointsas soon as covid-19 epidemic started it become clear that covid-19 vulnerability is an aging-dependent condition and the use of rapamycin sirolimus was immediately suggested by independent researchers 1 3 133137 these proposals were based on a mixture of several rationales which need to be clearly distinguished in theory there are at least three independent applications of rapamycin and everolimus for covid-19 currently they all are still

good  wootton 2017while there is a growing body of research focused on select aspects of peoples
experiences with advanced cancer there is a dearth of research attending to
the process of living with advanced cancer across the trajectory towards
death one exception is the work of olson and colleagues olson morse smith
mayan  hammond 2001 who were concerned about the lack
of theory linking the living-dying experience of people with advanced
disease these researchers asked the question what is the experience of
people with illness who expect to die and used the answer to modify the
illness constellation modela recent metasynthesis garca-rueda carvajal valcrcel saracbar-razquin 
arantzamendi solabarrieta 2016 resulted in a model that
suggests people with advanced cancer desire to live normally while also
being aware of the closeness of death suffering is inherent in the context
of advanced cancer which people seek to reduce and at the same time live
life with new meaning this entails a process that has an impact on family
dynamics because the sick person not only needs to be cared for but also has
the need to care for his or her family the model addresses the importance

et al 2015 walshe and colleagues 2017
emphasized that useful strategies for coping well with advanced cancer are
only generated through engagement in the process of living with disease but
that process requires articulation it is clear that there is a much bigger
story to the process of living with advanced cancer than we currently
understandthe limited studies transmit the underlying idea that it is possible to live
well with advanced cancer but little is known about this process nor how to
support it however there is a theory that captures the process of living
well with chronic illness developed through grounded theory research
conducted with 43 participants who perceived themselves to be managing well
with a variety of chronic illnesses robinson 2017 the theory
explains that there is an iterative healing process of moving on through
which people revisit five interconnected phases the fight accepting
living with the chronic illness sharing the experience and reconstructing
life the iterative phases revolve around a core category of making hard
choices this model shows a dynamic process that occurs as the chronic
condition or the responses to it change and people develop new ways to live
well moving sometimes back and forth between the phases multiple chronic
illnesses were represented among the participants which was an intentional
decision to enhance applicabilitythe first author was familiar with the theory of living well with chronic
illness and during data analysis for the primary study was struck by
possible intersections between the participants accounts and the theory
the stories of the participants made us reflect on how well the participants
lived with their serious illness which was congruent with the theory this
was discussed with the team and we became curious about whether the theory
might be relevant to people living with advanced cancer considering that
this stage of the cancer journey is often prolonged and can be considered
chronic due to treatment advances moghaddam et al 2016 in
addition we wondered whether the theory would be applicable within a
different culture that is spain versus canada this led to the secondary
analysis that is reported here the aim of the study was twofold a to
explain the process of living with advanced cancer to enhance understanding
and inform the ability to effectively support people when time is both
uncertain and short and b to determine the applicability of the theory of
living well with chronic illness to the more specific scenario of advanced
cancer within a spanish sample and if appropriate refine the theory
theory testing refinement and development is recognized as one way to
advance applied disciplines such as nursing swanson  chermack

phenomenological study designed to gain a deep understanding of the
essence of the lived experience of having advanced
cancer garca-rueda

narrations of experiences and not on the experience as a
process secondary analysis enables the researcher to

collected in qualitative research hinds vogel  clarke-steffen
1997 this study is an analytic expansion according to thornes 2012
classification analysis focused on a new question the
process of living with advanced cancer and used the
method of constant comparison glaser  strauss 1967
secondary analysis is appropriate for clinical inquiry in nursing
particularly with vulnerable populations such as those with advanced
illness because it reduces respondent burden szabo  strang 1997 one of
the limitations of secondary analysis is the appropriateness of the data for
reanalysis hinds et
al 1997 our new question fitted well with the data as the
central concern life with advanced cancer was similar for both studies in
addition during analysis of the primary study the researchers noted how
well the participants lived with their serious life-limiting illness the
approach that was taken here was to reanalyze all of the data set while
attending to a concept the process that seemed to be present but was not
specifically addressed in the primary analysis hinds et al 1997 p 410the original data were collected by the second author in conversational
interviews with 22 spanish adults purposefully selected from three different
centers promoting variation on sociodemographic characteristics who had
been living with advanced cancer for a minimum of 3 months twelve
participants were men and 10 were women who ranged in age from 45 to 83
years nine were married six single five widowed and two divorced they
lived in urban n  15 or in rural environments
n  7 and most lived with family members four
people lived alone the time interval between the interview and
participants death varied from 22 days to almost 2 yearsopen-ended questions were used to initiate the interview such as would you
describe your life with this disease and the interviewer then followed the
participants stories which were audio-recorded the data for the current
study were comprised of 22 verbatim transcripts of interviews as well as a
vignette of each participants characteristics and story that provided
valuable contextual information to facilitate interpretation of the
transcriptconstant comparative analysis was conducted by two members of the research
team one researcher had been involved in the original study and is fluently
bilingual in spanish and english which enabled culturally appropriate
translation of the spanish transcripts the other researcher was conversant
in spanish and intimately familiar with the research underpinning the theory
of living well with chronic illness this relationship reduced the
limitations implicit when there is lack of detailed contextual knowledge
about the circumstances of the data collection in this case for both
studies coltart
henwood  shirani 2013 seale 2011both researchers were familiar with the theory of living well with chronic
illness but set this temporarily aside so as not to impose an analytic
framework on the data the researchers independently read and coded one
transcript at a time and then met to discuss the coding before proceeding to
the next transcript initial open coding was directed by two basic
questions what is this about and what is going on here in relation to
living with advanced cancer this enabled the data to be fractured and
labeled with a name or code that was close to the data ie at a
relatively low level of abstraction the second step of coding focused on
comparing the evolving codes with the theory based on the questions does
this code fit the theory if so how if not what is going on that is
different the transcripts were sequentially coded by hand in this two-step
fashion and through consensus a coding framework was developed by
constantly comparing one piece of data with another both within and between
transcripts as well as with the theory we questioned tested and
challenged if the coding fit with the phases of the original theory and
whether the theory provided an adequate complete explanation for the
process of living with advanced cancer for example it was evident that the
participants living with advanced cancer had difficulties with the diagnosis
and subsequent illness problems in the original theory the first phase is
termed the fight this did not seem to fit what we were learning about the
beginning of the process of living with advanced cancer through careful
constant comparative analysis of the transcripts we came to understand that
these participants experienced a unique phase of difficulty that we called
struggling indeed it was surprising to us that fighting often viewed as
key to living with cancer was minimally evident thus every code needed to
earn its way into the conceptualization of the process theoretic memos were
used to keep track of ideas questions and concerns as the analysis
proceeded and a new core category was identified finally the theory was
confirmed with two of the primary researchers who had not participated in
the secondary analysis they were asked to judge whether the new theory
resonated or fit with the data and whether the theory presented a
credible explanation of the process of living with advanced cancer as a way
to enhance the trustworthiness of the findingsas suggested by thorne
1998 ethical issues were considered and the secondary
analysis was approved by the university research ethics board identifier
2016104this was where each participant began their experience with advanced
cancer by struggling with the diagnosis this was a process of
resisting the presence of advanced cancer in ones life that was
colored by a sudden awareness of the possibility of dying
participants described emotional responses of shock anger anxiety
and fear cognitively they expressed disbelief and uncertainty while
questioning am i dying the first thing you think is that youre
going to die behaviorally this was accompanied by crying shouting
and for some quiet withdrawal
at first it was worse because i did not understand that this
could have happened to me i felt good    and it was a
very hard blow moreover what i have is a pretty ugly
serious serious tumor    so i was very scared   
i thought i was going to die the day after tomorrow
for some participants who were aware that something was wrong struggling
began before the diagnosis
i knew something was wrong with my body for example i could
hardly swallow and its like you do not want to see i
knew something was wrong but i was feeling well
the duration and intensity of struggling varied among the participants
however there were very few accounts of aggressively fighting the
disease over time participants realized that struggling created
additional life difficulties and was not useful in fact they
understood it was counterproductive to moving forward with living so
they made a pivotal choice to let go of struggling participants
talked about it being the only choice and some even
talked about there being no choice however this realization took
time to evolve they felt stuck in their struggling and needed to
stop which enabled them to move on toward accepting the advanced
cancer in some measure
well i did not want to believe it im going to have to
mourn and all     so its like that you rebel against
cancer right that you rebel i needed my time to
internalize accept
as discussed participants chose to stop struggling however struggling
did not end with this first decision instead over time when new
challenges such as treatment failure or difficult illness problems
arose struggling reoccurred for example one participant poignantly
described returning to the struggle when physical suffering increased
and when awareness of dying was more present
and then i start thinking about things i like to    avoid
   to thinkid rather be dead than be like this i try
to think of things i like to avoid that thought but i
think about it imagine if you were really like that every
day i would rather die than be suffering continuously
like this if there is no hope
another participant quietly described balancing between awareness
of dying that arose when symptoms increased and
forgetting he has advanced cancer
i stand it the best that i can inside of course now i give
a little more to my head which before you have cancer
bah it will be cured but now seeing myself with less
strength and less vitality well of course you give more 
  a little more thought but oh many times i forget
that i have cancer eh    so either    laughs no 
  and the truth is that i see that there is a pretty
good progression    now it has stopped again its
stopped by now for the moment then when he cancer
wakes up again until there is no solution and when there
is no solution what are we going to do this is   
this is my life
again as struggling was revisited it called for a new choice to let go
rather than to be stuck in turmoil which enabled moving forward into
the next phase of acceptingaccepting was a process of acceding or agreeing to the presence of
advanced cancer in ones life along with the problems it brought to
attain some level of peacefulness about the situation this could only
occur after struggling stopped most participants used the word
accepting and described it as the only choice because it was
viewed as essential to being able to move forward with living
why has this touched me for that god knows and and i have
accepted it of course i have accepted and also    is
that i see that this is what i have to do what do you get
not accepting it if its there    you have it    
take it to your best silence
another participant highlighted the hard work of learning how to let go
of struggling and move into accepting
theres no more struggling im not very much a resigning
person really its not my character but i learned i
guess i do what i can and what i cannot do cannot be
done if it cannot be done there is no other way than
assuming it and taking your best i do not want not to
accept it i dont want that because i would be embittered
all the time
it is important to recognize that accepting was also a process that was
revisited many times when life got challenging because of such things
as new information or illness problems it is the acceptance of what
you have and what you have to do depth of accepting varied widely
and was navigated over time it involved coming to some level of
agreement about the situation for example that there was a diagnosis
of cancer or that the cancer was not curable or that life might be
shorter or that the person was dying achieving some degree of
accepting was not only influenced by awareness of
dying but also it involved it as illustrated below
participants moved from awareness of the possibility of dying toward
accepting that they were dying
now i think more but im not thinking all day that im going
to die i mean thats not it because when it has to be
that is    no i do not    i mean its not that i
want to die no please but if it has to arrive it
should arrive
accepting in turn enabled a degree of peacefulness that contrasted
sharply with the turmoil of struggling accepting involved making
pivotal choices about what to agree to include as part of ones life
for example several participants talked about not fully accepting
that their cancer was incurable instead they hung on to the hope
that even though the cancer was advanced there was still a
possibility of cureone strategy that facilitated accepting was making sense of ones
situation which enabled answering the hard questions of why me or
why now or did i do something wrong or is this my fault the
belief shared by many of participants that their situation came from
god and god would take care of them was particularly helpful in
making sense of their situation in a way that supported accepting
they described being in gods hands for some this was an active
choice to turn toward god while for others it was automatic and a
reflection of a strong ongoing relationship with god accepting
enabled movement into the next phase of living with advanced cancer
rather than against itthis was a process of figuring out how to integrate advanced cancer into
ones life which entailed working to accommodate or mitigate illness
problems so their impact on life and living were minimized all the
while taking awareness of dying into account
accepting to some degree enabled the development of a negotiated
coexistence with advanced cancer because struggling against it had
stopped and there was willingness to consider making necessary life
adjustments illness problems were the everyday problems of living
that arose from serious illness for example problems moving
incorporating demanding treatment regimens or difficulty caring for
ones children due to pain or fatigue taking awareness of
dying into account had to do with the possibility of
time being shorter and the need to focus on what mattered most in
life
what happens is that i think of this as a bit    a little
obstacle race in which i first said to myself ill see
if i get to my daughters communion and then a little
more and then another   
in some instances living with advanced cancer involved very challenging
priority setting and choices for example one mother of young
children highly valued being a good mother however this meant that
she needed to let go of having her children close by her because she
was not physically able to care for them she needed to let them go to
other family members to receive the care they needed which was
heartbreaking for her but enabled her to hang on to the fact that this
is what a good mother did being a good mother in this way was what
mattered mostfour strategies facilitated the phase of living with advanced cancer when
time may be short making life adjustments maintaining a positive
attitude normalizing and hoping making life
adjustments occurred to accommodate illness problems or
treatments for example one couple living in a small village found
social interactions on the street with neighbors to be a problem
because of the constant focus of others concerns on the illness the
couple adjusted their life by going to the next village for coffee
allowing them a pleasant outing together where they could attend to
life rather than illness many participants spoke of the need to
balance dependence and independence in making necessary life
adjustments which was a tricky endeavor it was important to accept
assistance but at the same time it was essential to maintain a sense
of being worthwhile and to reduce the perception of being a burden as
one participant explained you depend on someone when you have never
depended on anyone and now need to silence and thats the most
complicatedmaintaining a positive attitude was often expressed as
choosing to see the positive which facilitated living well this
strategy enabled participants to choose where they put their
attention for example one participant was no longer able to work but
this was quickly dismissed with expressions of gratitude for the small
things that were still possible such as being able to shop for
groceries enjoy a coffee with friends or see beautiful flowers
another participant emphasized it this way there is no need for big
things the little things of everyday life    i depend on those
   well i guess you learn to value things every day right
maintaining a positive attitude was recognized as a powerful influence
on the experience of living with advanced cancer by all the
participants and at the same time many acknowledged that sometimes
it was difficult which caused them to return to struggling from time
to timenormalizing was also a focusing strategy like the lens
of a camera participants focused on the normal aspects of their
life setting aside the not normal aspects by ignoring them which
minimized the impact of advanced cancer on everyday life
i make an effort to continue having a normal life like any
person i achieve it and it gives me strength to say im
normal as my life is like the one of any other person i
feel alive in the sense that i make a normal life as any
person who is not sicki understand that this disease is very present in our society
and i happened to get it and i accept it in the sense of
normalizing it trying to live with the disease not
denying it or not to be angry all day because it has
touched me but try to cope and become a little friend of
what i carry with me    i mean to accept to normalize
it to cope with it
significant illness problems such as treatments or being unable to work
which could not be put aside were reconstructed as ones new normal
again minimizing their impact some participants even spoke explicitly
about the normality of their own death and dying awareness of
dying constructing this as a natural part of
life
before i did not think it seemed that you were going to last
forever or you did not have death in mind but now its a
matter of course that you think about that and there are
times when you talk about it normally and other people are
not prepared to speak with that normality
another participant stated it this way i told the doctor the other day
that i know we were born to diethe final strategy was hoping which involved being open
to possibilities this was particularly important when normalizing was
not possible for example during extended hospitalization when
holding onto the hope of feeling better leaving hospital and
resuming enjoyable activities was critical as one participant
explained if one treatment did not work there was the possibility
that another one would i take    strength from myself i choose
to hold onto possible treatments being thankful for treatment
optionsthis piece of the puzzle of living well with advanced cancer and
awareness of dying involved maintaining family
and social relationships such that the ill person experienced being
supported having a sense of being loved and accompanied in the
experience was critical but needed to be balanced with protecting
loved ones from unnecessary suffering participants deeply appreciated
that family members also experienced awareness of
dying and that this generated suffering therefore they
made pivotal choices about how much information to share and with
whom we have called the two characteristics of this phase of sharing
the illness experience as a having someone to count on and b
protecting loved ones table 1having someone to count on to share the experience was
highly valued and generated immense gratitude as well as a sense of
well-being despite serious illness participants counted on different
people for different things often expanding their circle of support
beyond immediate family the caring physical presence of family was
central to the participant feeling accompanied and did not necessarily
include talking together about the situation as one participant explainedmy life is now calmer my wife is here all day    every
night remains one of my children every night    
which is very nice for me it is bad to have the disease
but it is    very nice things that come with itsharing the experience and having someone to count on often meant
relationships deepened however the participants worried about the
fact that suffering was also shared and they were concerned about
being a burden which led them to protect those they loveprotecting loved ones was primarily focused on selective
communication that involved carefully choosing what to tell how to
tell and who to tell setting limits aimed at preventing or
alleviating suffering most participants talked about limiting sharing
as a way to protect in the moment and a way to enable loved ones to
continue on over time as illustrated below while awareness
of dying may have been shared with family members
discussion of this awareness was not
from the first day i knew it was this bad disease what will
i say if i already know what it is    i have not
wanted to ask a lot so they family do not suffer i do
not want them to suffer gets excited because every time
i raise the issue they say forget it forget it thats
not going to come its the only thing    what am i
going to tell him interviewer would you like to talk
about it    it would hurt me to have to say son
im going to die of this it is an uphill    struggle
it would be a hard time    do you get me this is
complicated for me they already know because we are not
fools as i know they know it
thus participants used two strategies a balancing giving and
withholding information and b relying on themselves as much as
possible such as in problem solving or doing self-care for example
one participant who needed to talk about his illness situation but did
not want to burden his family explained that he turned to others who
were diagnosed with the same disease without fear of increasing
suffering participants were resourceful in their caring for self and
othersawareness of dying was a process within the larger
process and as has been discussed influenced all the phases
for example struggling could involve resisting
awareness of dying even if advanced
cancer was accepted participants awareness of
dying changed in relation to two dimensions the
first being time and the second being the position of the
awareness in relation to the finitude of self time was about
whether dying was viewed as close or far away while time was
always uncertain and something that participants struggled
with there were aspects of the experience that brought
awareness of dying into the near rather
than distant future dying took on more immediacy in the
circumstances of increased intensity of illness and
hospitalization however the ability to make meaning of the
situation such as the illness being within gods hands eased
struggling and facilitated acceptinghow the participants positioned their awareness of
dying determined how it influenced the process of
living well with advanced cancer sometimes the awareness was
foreground occupying their day-to-day thoughts and actions in
this situation some participants struggled against the
awareness while others were motivated to plan for their
families well-being by preparing wills or negotiating child
care envisioning a future for their family that was
characterized by their absence brought awareness of
dying firmly into the foreground the pain and
preoccupation that participants experienced when envisioning
their absence resulted in actively putting the awareness
of dying in the background where thinking about
it could be avoided at least for a time this active and pivotal
choice took energy but enabled a focus on living and living well
as time was perceived to be short and precious finally some
participants seemed to carry the awareness of
dying comfortably beside them which arose with
deep accepting that supported reconstructing life for all the
participants awareness of dying led them to
focus on living well with advanced cancer they were aware that
did not have time to losethe original theory of living well with chronic illness was based on family
interviews and therefore represented the family perspective the study
being reported was based on interviews with individuals diagnosed with
advanced cancer and represents the perspective of the person with advanced
cancer although frequent references were made to family family clearly
played an extremely important role for the participants but the theory does
not reflect a family perspective it is well recognized that the diagnosis
of advanced cancer affects and is affected by family badr 2014 furthermore the
spanish cultural context is relatively homogeneous it would be interesting
in future studies to explore the family perspective and different cultural
contexts to further assess theory applicability and support theoretical
development in addition the data were comprised of a single interview with
each participant we note that olson and colleagues 2001
utilized multiple interviews and found a stage of enduring to die which was
characterized by withdrawal that was not represented in our data therefore
where possible repeated interviews over time may be helpful to further
refine the conceptualization of the process of living well with awareness of
dyingthe aim of the study was twofold a to explain the process of living with
advanced cancer to enhance understanding and inform the ability to
effectively support people when time is both uncertain and short and b to
determine the applicability of the theory of living well with chronic
illness robinson
2017 to the more specific scenario of advanced cancer within a
spanish sample and if appropriate refine the theory we found that the
theory of living well with chronic illness was indeed useful to
understanding this situation but required refinement to adequately explain
the process of living well with awareness of dying the adjusted theory
illuminates a five-phase iterative process struggling accepting living
with advanced cancer sharing the experience and reconstructing life that
revolves around awareness of dying which captures the
challenges as well as resilience of the participants as they grappled with
life-limiting illness and the desire to live life fully table 1as walshe et al
2017 have recently suggested the strategies for coping well
with advanced cancer which are the focus of several studies coyle 2006 dale  johnston

et al 2015 sand olsson  strang 2009
walshe et al
2017 are only generated through engagement in the process of
living with disease which is a bigger story than has previously been put
forward this study offers one explanation of the process of living well
with advanced cancer that addresses the bigger story and enables us to
understand the findings of previous research in a new and integrated
contextawareness of dying is the core category around which the
larger process revolves and like each of the phases is a process unto
itself that was revisited over time awareness shifted from initial
recognition of the possibility of dying to ultimately for some accepting
that i am dying awareness of dying centers on the
meaning participants gave to being sick with advanced cancerit meant that
time was uncertain and more limited than they had imagined which colored
the process of living the time between the crisis of diagnosis of advanced
cancer with accompanying knowledge of death and the point of death which
has been termed the living-dying interval may be months to years due to
medical advances colosimo et al 2018in this context of a prolonged living-dying interval double awareness broadly
refers to the capacity of individuals with advanced cancer to sustain and
negotiate the dialectical tension that arises between remaining engaged in
the world while preparing for impending death colosimo et al 2018 p 1this double awareness was clearly evident for the participants in our study
whose primary focus was on remaining engaged in the world of the living the
tension that colosimo and colleagues so aptly describe resulted in
struggling and required some degree of accepting to move more fully into
living rather than dying however as these authors point out the tension
was negotiated or navigated and was not resolved based on our findings and
the work of others awareness should not be viewed as a stable attribute

1999 rather it varies over time which challenges the more
traditional idea that awareness that one is dying is relatively stable
glaser 
strauss 1965 our theory contributes to understanding the
nuances and dynamic nature of awareness within the concept of double
awareness furthermore it highlights the centrality of the process within
the larger process of living well with advanced cancer people diagnosed
with advanced cancer are confronted with their mortality in a way that does
not allow for evasions and requires hard work to find a way to live without
a clear future coyle
2006 willig 2015 the heightened concern about living and dying
accompanying a diagnosis of advanced cancer creates an existential plight or
crisis that requires time to adjust bai et al 2015 our findings
address the gap identified in the literature about the ways in which the
dying person engages with the challenges posed by the living-dying interval
mcsherry
2011 willig 2015the larger process began with struggling and was characterized by discomfort
emotional distress as well as suffering which has also been identified by
research conducted by olson and colleagues 2001 participants were challenged with
uncertainty about the future etkind bristowe bailey selman 
murtagh 2017 shilling starkings jenkins 
fallowfield 2017 but did not get stuck in struggling and give
up as found by olson et
al 2001 or put plans on hold for an extended period to live
one day at a time as found by shilling et al 2017 loss of
control etkind et al
2017 shilling et al 2017 was not a significant focus for the
participants in our study instead they moved past struggling and into
accepting by making an active choice to stop resisting the illness and
awareness of dyingaccepting entailed coming to some level of agreement about the presence of
advanced cancer in ones life it is important to note that we have used the
term accepting rather than acceptance to emphasize that
accepting is a process that can occur in many forms and in relation to many
facets of the experience such as accepting the diagnosis the worsening of
the situation or dying accepting is embedded in the findings of olson et al
2001 but not explicitly identified as critical to moving past
the initial phase of distress this is one of the contributions of the new
theory through accepting suffering was mediated thompson et al 2009 and our
participants gained a sense of peace that has been identified as an
important contributor to quality of life for people with advanced cancer
bai et al
2015 furthermore accepting was facilitated by spiritually
making meaning of the illness which also positively influences quality of
life bai et al
2015 the importance of accepting is supported by the research
of nipp and colleagues
2017 who found that accepting the reality of the situation
something that many of our participants emphasized was associated with
enhanced quality of life and moodaccepting enabled movement into the next phase of living well with advanced
cancer where participants got to know the illness and made adjustments to
accommodate both the illness and illness problems in their daily lives
olson and
colleagues 2001 have conceptualized this phase as enduring to
live keeping going our participants seemed more focused on living a life
than enduring to stay alive by fighting death olson et al 2001 as already
noted there was very little evidence of fighting in our data although
participants did return to struggling from time to time when significant
challenges arose so this phase may be more akin to stage 5 of the illness
constellation model learning to live with the altered self the importance
of living a meaningful and productive life now has been
identified as critical for people with advanced cancer cottingham et al
2018 these researchers term it living in the face of death
maintaining a positive attitude one of the strategies that participants
emphasized is akin to positive reframing or looking for something good in
the situation which has been associated with enhanced quality of life and
mood nipp et al
2017 this supports the notion that the participants in this
study were indeed living well with advanced cancer and awareness of
dyingsharing the illness experience comprised the next phase here participants
highlighted the importance of family relationships which have been linked
to a sense of belonging and enhanced quality of life nipp et al 2017 peoples nissen brandt
 la cour 2018 social belonging is nurtured through
shared emotional connections and the ability to contribute to the lives of
others peoples et al
2018 both highly valued by participants shilling and colleagues
2017 noted that people with advanced cancer and their family
caregivers seldom discussed their concerns about an uncertain future with
each other see also olson et al 2001 our theory offers one way to make sense
of this phenomenon at least from the perspective of the person with
advanced cancerthat constraining conversation is protective and aimed at
limiting suffering this challenges the assumption that complete open
awareness is the most adequate way of dealing with awareness of dying glaser  strauss
1965 lack of open awareness has been perceived as an
indication of nonacceptance thompson et al 2009 as a
barrier to adequate planning of dying careers seale addington-hall  mccarthy
1997 and as a negative influence on the quality of life of
the dying person lokker van zuylen veerbeek van der rijt  van der heide
2012 however timmermans 1994 challenged the
original concept of open awareness proposing a subcategorizing to include
a suspended open awareness where the patient or family has heard
information about the terminal condition but do not believe it b
uncertain open awareness where information is given about the terminal
illness but it is qualified by expressions of uncertainty to make room for
hope and c active open awareness where the patient and family understand
the situation fully we propose that perhaps rather than these being
different kinds of awareness they represent different phases of awareness
that occur over time and may be revisited limited sharing enabled the
participants to balance the need to be supported and the need to protect
loved ones people with advanced cancer may need assistance achieving a
supportive balance between communicating and protecting that does not
perpetuate a conspiracy of silence and also respects varying needs within
the familythe next phase in the theory is reconstructing life where life and living fully
in the moment was foreground and illness as well as awareness of
dying was background participants experienced joy and beauty
in moments of being fully present to life and the tension inherent in the
living-dying interval was temporarily suspended these five phases of living
well with advanced cancer were revisited as illness progression and
awareness of dying along with uncertain time shaped
the process of living with advanced cancerthis study offers an integrative explanatory theory of living with dying and
refines the theory of living well with chronic illness the healing process
of moving on robinson
2017 it is clear that in both chronic illness and advanced
cancer living well involves an iterative process that is revisited over
time one difference is that quite quickly the participants with advanced
cancer chose to let go of struggling to move into accepting because they
experienced the negative consequences of resisting a situation that could
not be changed resisting got in the way of living which became more urgent
in the context of awareness of dying and knowledge that
time might be short the other phases of living well are similar for
advanced cancer including the same underlying ideas but with nuances in
the case of the people with advanced cancer accepting entailed making space
for the awareness of dying which was a new core category
and not a facet of the original theory current study participants did not
identify themselves and were not selected based on the idea of living well
instead the data supported the idea that the participants wanted to live
and to live well awareness of dying underpinned moving on
toward living a life rather than living an illness it may seem incredible
from the perspective of someone who is not in this situation how well these
people lived with advanced cancer but as one of the participants said
its not that im a brave ive never been they helped us understand that
living with advanced cancer involved a process requiring deep engagement
time and effortand that it is indeed possible to live well even if it is
in momentsseveral things stand out in terms of potential implications for practice it is
evident that accepting is key to moving forward in the process of living
well with advanced cancer it may be tempting to promote accepting and to
judge lack of accepting negatively however accepting takes time and as
has been explained can take many forms furthermore it is not stable over
time it is conceivable that prematurely focusing on accepting might
interfere with building a supportive therapeutic alliance careful
assessment of where the ill person is in the process based on an
understanding of the phases and levels of awareness will likely be most
useful to effective therapeutic alignmentmaintaining a positive attitude eg finding the positive in the situation
was a helpful strategy for living well and should not be viewed as an
indication of lack of awareness of dying the participants
in this study worked hard to live a life rather than live an illness all
the while being aware of dying so the implication here is to support the
positive it has been found that hoping for a cure when cancer is advanced
is also not evidence of lack of awarenessit can be a choice in focusing on
positive possibilities robinson 2012it also must be noted that awareness of dying was pervasive
and was something that participants were willing and able to discuss early
introduction of palliative care temel et al 2010 along with
advance care planning bernacki  block 2014 has been shown to enhance quality
of life for people with advanced cancer awareness of dying
and willingness to discuss it will likely facilitate acceptance of
palliative care and serious illness conversationsfinally the importance of family love and support cannot be underestimated
this should be assessed and supported in particular people with advanced
cancer may need assistance balancing the sharing and withholding of
information in relation to their desire to protect loved ones from
sufferingin the last twenty years techniques of simulation have multiplied in the world of disaster management revet 2013 the stated objective of these exercises is to rehearse a disaster situation in order to better prepare for it armstrong 2012 actors in a simulation treat the expected disaster as if it had happened in order to immerse themselves in the reality it should produce seligman weller puett  simon 2008 as such simulations offer opportunities for social anthropology to combine science and technology studies with the ethnography of rituals enacting the imaginary of coming catastrophes simulation creates an extraordinary setting for performances separated from ordinary lifetwo kinds of simulation can be distinguished desktop or tabletop exercises relying on computer programs and occurring indoors and realground or fullscale drills involving actors in an outdoor setting both techniques use worstcase scenarios written by disastermanagement professionals trained in fiction writing if simulation is a regular activity for scientists working on computers it also shapes the stage of extraordinary performances for ordinary citizens involved in drills sismondo 1999 however the distinction between these two forms of simulation is not between reality and fiction since those who write scenarios for these two kinds of simulation constantly play on the shift between virtual and actual they rely on the memory of previous catastrophes and the anticipation of future disasters to inform a realistic engagement in the present of the simulation if scenarios are considered as shared forms or schemes of action simulations can be described as ritual performances displaying relations between humans and nonhumans in extraordinary settingsthis article starts from observed simulations of an avian influenza pandemic in china influenza viruses emerging from birds have been considered as potentially causing future pandemics because birds particularly waterfowl in south china have been identified as the reservoir in which flu viruses mutate before spreading successfully between humans shortridge  stuartharris 1982 among other techniques such as early warning systems and stockpiling vaccines preparing for the next pandemics therefore involves simulating the transmission of pathogens from birds to humans caduff 2015 lakoff 2007 arguing that a human pandemic is a symmetrical threat to the extinction of a bird species i then consider another bird disease for which chinese experts organize simulations botulism this disease which doesnt affect humans is considered a potential disaster for blackfaced spoonbills because it kills migratory birds when they concentrate in wetlands on their flyways wilson 2010 76bringing together simulations of avian influenza and botulism this article questions the ethnography of simulation from the perspective of animal studies how does preparedness transform relations between humans and birds what does it mean to include birds and more generally animals in exercises simulating coming disasters how does the description of animals as victims of disasters transform them into actors of simulations keck  ticktin 2015 i will show that animals become in a paradoxical way passive actors when they carry the signs of diseases that can potentially affect humanstechniques of preparedness have been included in the set of tools for global health initiatives either in humanitarian actions or in biosecurity interventions which have shaped contemporary affects and anticipations of the future adams murphy  clarke 2009 lakoff 2010 global health has been extended to animals and the environment  an approach called one world one health  thus requiring an interspecies approach towards the ethical issues involved hinchliffe 2015 one of the most debated questions in the anthropology of pandemic preparedness is the adequacy of the notion of sacrifice to describe how some populations are separated from others and killed or left to die for the sake of public health in exercises of triage some patients are prioritized over others through the framework of urgency nguyen 2010 redfield 2013 in the management of human populations migrant workers are considered as a threat by educated experts using viral connectivity as a metaphor of modernity macphail 2014 mason 2016 in the management of zoonotic pathogens the notion of sacrifice seems even more obvious since animals are massively killed to eradicate the reservoir of emerging infectious diseases and in the management of wild animals some individuals are sacrificed to protect the species van dooren 2014 other descriptions however have been proposed of the entangled relations between animals and humans in the hotspots or sentinel devices where emerging pathogens connect them in productive ways brown  kelly 2014 fearnley 2015 keck  lakoff 2013 lezaun  porter 2015 lowe 2010 while sacrifice separates some living beings from others to eradicate pathogens sentinels instantiate relations between living beings through the anticipation of future pathogenssimulations of bird diseases shift perspectives between humans and animals through the use of fiction to support this argument i rely on the anthropology of hunting societies by contrast with pastoral societies while public health relies on pastoral techniques of power combining sacrifice and surveillance to contain the threats coming from outside in a population foucault 1981 the one world one health approach uses techniques from birdwatchers and wildlife managers to monitor data about changing relations between humans and animals1 whereas pastoral techniques are asymmetrical relying on the pastors superior gaze over the flock manifested by sacrifice cynegetic techniques are symmetrical as hunters and prey constantly change perspectives when displayed in rituals chamayou 2012most analyses of simulation have placed it in a genealogy starting with the cold war using notions of ritual performance and play davis 2007 galison 1997 gusterson 1996 lakoff 2007 masco 2006 but they dont take the perspective of animals because they consider simulations as pastoral techniques of biopower therefore bypassing what the anthropology of hunting societies shows about ritual action in this article i define a cynegetic practice of simulation that is always mixed with forms of planning combining two different forms of anticipation i call avian preparedness this mix of cynegetic becominganimal and pastoralist care for populations initiated by microbiologists considered both as virus hunters perrey 2012 and as microbe farmers caduff 2015 76to analyse simulations of bird diseases i combine the notion of reverse scenario schull 2015 with the notion of reflexive ritual pandemic or extinction scenarios i argue connect humans and animals in realistic ways to play on the imagination of what could happen if a pathogen emerges using animal reservoirs as mirrors in which anxieties about pandemics are reflected humans exchange their perspectives with animals in an imagined future where their relations are reversed simulations can thus be situated in an anthropological space between play and ritual roberte hamayon 2015 97 has called simulation the way shamans in mongolian hunting societies imitate the movements of animals in a ritualized setting to prepare for the uncertainties of hunting in an article entitled dissimulation and simulation as forms of religious reflexivity michael houseman proposes to move away from a definition of ritual as a collective action based on a shared secret to study the emergent properties of ritual simulation generally 2002 77 he draws on two cases taken from hunting societies of central africa one in which male novices are symbolically killed and the other in which a goat is actually sacrificed he asks how do participants come to believe in a series of speeches and actions  the novices death and the goats consent to sacrifice  that are obviously false he answers that ritual action creates an extraordinary space of reflexivity with regard to the ordinary relations that constitute the group while the ritual for male novices is a dissimulation in which the relations between initiated and uninitiated are constantly reversed in such a way that the moment of death becomes uncertain the ritual of goat sacrifice says houseman is a simulation of consent in which the silencing of the goat through the consumption of herbs mimics the consent of male hunters to their initiation the ritual is reflexive in the sense that it stages the condition of the ritual itself  the secrecy known by initiators and unknown by the initiated  through the manipulations of daily relations between humans and nonhumans whose asymmetries are reflected as in a mirrorsimilarly i suggest that we call reverse scenarios the ritual performances by which simulators reflect playfully on the relations between humans and birds in the imagination of a disease that could affect them both simulations i argue are far more than mere rehearsals of a pandemic drama they are catalysts in the transformation of humannonhuman relations into asymmetrical biopolitical and ontological processesto support this argument i will describe three ethnographic cases in hong kong taiwan and singapore these three territories have competed at the global level since the sars crisis in 2003 to be the best sentinel posts where pandemic pathogens coming from china can be detected abraham 2007 as hubs for the intense circulation of persons and commodities in asia but also as repositories of chinese traditional relations between humans and birds they have prepared for the catastrophic effects of a bird flu outbreak but while the hong kong government regularly culls its poultry and sends warning signals from the chinese border taiwan and singapore rarely had to cull their poultry and rather invested in scenarios for the simulation of pandemic taiwan on the other side shares with hong kong the monitoring of blackfaced spoonbills considered as one of asias most threatened and charismatic speciesthis article thus connects the rationalities of preparedness with the economies of humananimal relations in three different but interconnected settings it will examine indoor and outdoor simulations of avian influenza in singapore and hong kong and compare them with simulations of botulism in taiwan however my analysis is not restricted to simulations of bird diseases in east asia but highlights general traits of disaster simulation as a technique of preparedness by looking at the relations between humans and birds in these three contexts through their common exposure to emerging pathogens this article also analyses the relations between national states in asia as they have to manage a common disaster since simulations of bird diseases connect relations at different scales from the microbiological to the biopolitical this article combines science studies ethnography of rituals and political economy through an anthropology of morethanhuman relations helmreich  kirksey 2010 kohn 2013 sagan 2011in july 2013 i was visiting gavin smith who was then an associate professor at the duke graduate medical school of the national university of singapore nus i had known gavin in hong kong while he was working in the state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases at the department of microbiology of the university of hong kong born in australia gavin had studied botany and ecology at the university of melbourne and then moved to hong kong for a phd in molecular systematics gavin had first analysed the genome of fungi then of the sars coronavirus then of bird flu viruses he described this development of his research as a reduction of the size of the living beings he was sequencing and a refinement of the data and results he could producegavin and his team relied strongly on the collaboration between the state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases and the university of shantou this university had been created by the hong kong tycoon li kashing who opened it in 1990 in his native guangdong with the approval and administrative support of the chinese authorities it provided the state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases with samples collected in poultry markets in fujian province thus offering a realtime surveillance of influenza strains emerging in this epicentre of pandemic flu but after the publications of gavins team showed the role of the chinese poultry industry in the emergence of these new strains smith et al 2006 the guangdong authorities had severely restricted hong kong virologists access to these samples gavin then moved to singapore in 2012 where he had more freedom to continue his fundamental research and more funding from international institutions he had shifted from the sentinel post where the new strains of avian influenza emerged such as the h5n1 virus in 1997 keck 2010 to a place where he could simulate the evolution of flu viruses in hightech computers there was no need to be close to the site where viruses emerge he explained to me as he could simulate viral emergence through the use of genetic data bankssingapore was then considered the new pole of excellence for biological research the small citystate founded by lee kwan yew in 1965 at the end of the malay peninsula had converted its industrial and financial power owing to its position on the commercial trade routes between east and west into an economy of knowledge and information with high investment in biotechnologies ong 2010 2016 the nus graduate medical school was located just next to the ministry of health and the singapore general hospital in the centre of the city it had been created in 2005 to train hightech medical leaders on the model of the duke university school of medicine in north carolina the programme in emerging infectious diseases for which gavin had been hired to work was headed by wang linfa who was also leading a team on bat viruses at the australian animal health laboratory in geelong his programme was running projects for the surveillance of emerging infectious diseases particularly influenza and other respiratory diseases in singapore and the rest of southeast asiagavins career took a meaningful turn when his team published two major articles at the height of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic the first one entitled dating the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses was published just after the emergence of the h1n1 virus in mexico in april 2009 it showed that genetic components of the 1918 h1n1 pandemic virus circulated among pigs and humans as early as 1911 thus challenging the commonly held view that spanish flu jumped from birds to humans in 1918 in the context of the new h1n1 swine flu this article stressed the need for intensified surveillance of pigs to detect emerging flu viruses before they become pandemic if future pandemics arise in this manner gavin and his team concluded this interval may provide the best opportunity for health authorities to intervene to mitigate the effects of a pandemic or even to abort its emergence smith bahl vijaykrishna et al 2009 11712this conclusion was immediately reinforced by gavins teams second publication entitled origins and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 swineorigin h1n1 influenza a epidemic published in nature at the end of 2009 in which they showed that a twin virus bearing the same genetic sequence as the pandemic h1n1 had been identified in pigs in hong kong in 2004 gavins conclusion was not that the asian swine industry was to blame for the emergence of h1n1 but that there was a better surveillance of the animal reservoir for influenza viruses waterfowl and pigs in hong kong than in the united states the teams paper ended despite widespread influenza surveillance in humans the lack of systematic swine surveillance allowed for the undetected persistence and evolution of this potentially pandemic strain for many years smith vijaykrishna bahl et al 2009 1125in july 2009 i took a course at the hong kong university pasteur research centre in bioinformatics during which gavin and his team partners vijay and justin explained to virology students how to obtain this kind of result bioinformatics is a method to analyse the massive amount of biological data available on the web  particularly through the website of the us national center for biotechnology information genbank  with the help of dedicated software this software called blast basic local alignment search tool or msa multiple sequence analysis calculates the probability that genetic sequences derive from one another such a procedure called alignment aims at approximating the real descent relationships between viruses through a calculation of the optimal tree of life based on the darwinian hypothesis that life expands in a rational manner to maximize fitness capacities mackenzie 2003for gavin and his team however bioinformatics was not only about probability calculation in the construction of a phylogenetic tree biological knowledge is necessary because some correlations proposed by the computer make no sense in an evolutionary perspective as they can be due to errors in sequencing or genetic deletion to decide which correlations to take into account and which to consider as irrelevant virologists use other software such as bootstrap jukes cantor or tamura providing the probability of correlations based on a given scenario as for other techniques of preparedness probability is not enough to simulate a coming disaster it requires a work of imagination lakoff 2007 peter galison has shown that computer simulation emerged in the field of particle physics as a subculture among experimenters and theoreticians under the monte carlo programme funded by nasa in the 1960s to simulate a nuclear explosion simulation replaces experimentation when the data needed for the theory are too numerous and complex to be processed with traditional instruments creating a trading zone in which different professional groups share a common language or pidgin galison 1997 50 similarly bioinformatics produces new images shared by microbiologists computer scientists and public health executives in the anticipation of epidemics software such as bootstrap can be considered as an accessory or decoy to trap the live bird viruses through the sequences that have been stored in genbankgavin opened the course with a simulation of the work his team had done a few months before on the h1n1 virus presented as a desktop exercise of what to do when a new virus emerges imagine weve received this new sequence from atlanta paste it to blast and take as much information as possible make a tree so big you can never print it on a sheet of paper it will be good starting material before reducing the inquiry gavin and his team explained that in contrast to other virologists working on flu viruses they had decided to use the eight segments of the viruss rna2 not just the two segments that shape the h and n proteins usually considered to be the most significant markers of antigen evolution they could thus build eight parallel evolutionary trees which by their similarities gave an indication of the real evolution of the whole flu virus there was nothing secret in the images of pandemic viruses built by these microbiologists unlike simulations of nuclear explosions built indoors by particle physicists gusterson 1996 all the phylogenetic trees produced by gavin and his team were publicly available on websitesdrawing back the molecular clock based on the estimated kinship relations between viruses virologists could see the branches where evolutionary ruptures occur and pathogens jump from one species to another such as the emergence of the h1n1 pandemic in 1918 and 2009 following continuities between genetic sequences they exhibited the discontinuities between evolutionary niches gavin said that when a virus jumps from one species to another it inaugurates a new set of lines as the immunity pressure of the environment creates an evolutionary bottleneck in which this mutation can replicate drawing back these lines then lead him to what he named the most recent common ancestor i love those trees he added the amount of information provided in a single image was correlated to the unity of an evolutionary hypothesis drawing this information back to a common ancestorhistorians of science have shown the power of evolutionary trees in the books through which darwinism came to be accepted as a new worldview bredekamp 2005 helmreich 2009 and their reframing in global health under the notion of an animal reservoir in which emerging pathogens spill over from animals to humans king 2002 lynteris 2017 but i was mostly intrigued by the way gavin and his team turned sequences into images through an anticipatory mode of reasoning that i call reverse scenario natasha schull proposes the term in her work with online gamblers to describe the way they cope with the necessarily uncertain futures of any hand by returning them to a point in the past and confronting them with a branching diversity of outcomes that might have emerged from it 2015 56 it applies well to the practices of virus hunters who use reverse engineering to reconstruct potentially pandemic pathogens such as the 1918 h1n1 virus caduff 2015 105 napier 2003 2 just as a gambler speculates how much he could have won if he had played this or that card gavin imagines what could have happened if the h1n1 virus had been detected in pigs prior to 1918 or 2009 virus sequencing allows him to trace potential connections between birds pigs and humans and to imagine other futures of crossspecies transmission yet we dont know how birds and pigs are actually involved in the construction of pandemic scenarios because we dont see how virologists take virus samples from birds we thus need to turn from desktop simulations to realground exercises organized by public health officials and birdwatchersafter my visit to gavin smith at nus duke graduate medical school i went to a nearby building to meet jeffery cutter at the singapore ministry of health trained as an epidemiologist jeffery cutter was the director of the communicable diseases division of the ministry of health coordinating preparedness for emerging infectious diseases in singapore there are 50 million passengers every year at singapore changi airport he told me so there is a high probability that emerging infectious diseases will come to singapore we need to be prepared during the sars crisis in 2003 he said 238 people were infected by the new coronavirus with thirtythree deaths they were all treated at the tan tock seng hospital which had been designated by the government as an isolation hospital for sars patients at the peak of the crisis all schools in the country were closed for ten days and home quarantine was established for more than 6000 people known to have come into close contact with a sarsinfected person prime minister goh chok tong said publicly that sars could possibly become the worst crisis singapore had faced since independence when a journalist asked him if he was being alarmist goh responded well i think im being realistic because we do not quite know how this will develop this is a global problem and we are at the early stage of the disease zolli 2012jeffery cutter introduced me to yoong cheong wong head of the emergency preparedness  response division at the ministry of health mr wong was a former policeman in charge of organizing exercises for emerging infectious diseases in hospitals the first national exercise for influenza in singapore was organized in 2006 after the first cases of humantohuman transmission of h5n1 were suspected in thailand called sparrowhawk it was organized in two stages a tabletop discussion and assessment of pandemic response plans among six hospitals in the country between april and june and a practical exercise on 212 july in which the six designated hospitals had to manage potential patients and share information about their circulation mr wong explained that a thousand people were involved in the realground drill mostly volunteers from grassroots organizations and nurses from training institutions while patients moved from one hospital to another some hospitals assessed the behaviour of others and gradually raised the number of casualties the main question according to mr wong was if there are 200 casualties in one hospital which resources do they needthe goal of these exercises is officially the identification of unplanned gaps in coordination between the actors who manage epidemics but the actual criticism of planners most often focuses on the drills lack of realism we try our best to do it as real as possible said mr wong but everyone knew it was just an exercise to explain the improvement between sparrowhawk exercises in 2006 and 2008 in singapore an official leaflet notes the exercises were activated unannounced to inject greater realism the ministry of health emergency medical staff turned up without prior justification at the general ward of the exercise hospital and triggered the simulated case of human infection with avian influenza unsic 2008 56 realism in this case came from the fact that people were surprised and yet they knew that they were faking the epidemicwhat does it mean for a simulation to be realistic here the notion of reverse scenario is useful just as microbiologists imagine what could have happened if viruses had been stopped in their animal reservoir public health planners imagine what would happen if contagious patients were stopped before entering hospitals but in both cases death is not performed in the scenario by contrast another type of exercise conducted in singapore was very real on 17 july 2013 the agriculture and veterinary authority ava organized a drill in one of the poultry slaughterhouses on the border with malaysia there are no authorized poultry farms on the territory and only five chicken farms for eggs which constrains singapore to import and slaughter 40 million live chickens from malaysia every year malaysian farmers need to be licensed by the ava to import their poultry to singapore and are always regarded with suspicion by border authorities and yet no case of h5n1 has been found in singaporei was able to watch the drill online because it was streamed widely on a number of websites the name exercise gallus vii referred to the fact that it was the seventh avian influenza exercise conducted by the ava since 2002 it took place in the biggest of the ten slaughterhouses in singapore run by soonly food processing industry which processed 80000 chickens daily providing 25 per cent of the fresh chicken meat in singapore asia one 2013 the scenario for the exercise was the following 1500 chickens had been infected with h5n1 and should be killed and destroyed according to emergency response plans about 100 employees of the slaughterhouse mostly indians had to be screened for their temperature take an antiviral drug and then wear personal protective equipment boots cap mask glasses gloves on the back of which their name was written the affected chickens were placed in green cages on belts immersed in water and electrocuted their cadavers were then placed inside two layers of biohazard bags to be incinerated dr yap him ho director of the quarantine and inspection group declared on television to make sure that ava is prepared for any incursion the main thing we want to do for this exercise is to train our officers as well as the other parties that are involved in the contingency planning to be familiar with the steps of the procedures straits times 2013although much could be said on the paternalistic ethnic gender class and age divides that structured these exercises i want to focus on the distinction between humans and animals while the simulation at the clinic was animated by a sense of urgency and scarcity of resources confronted with a fake pandemic the simulation at the slaughterhouse was quietly following the procedures in actually killing false positive chickens i was also intrigued by the fact that while the hong kong government organized many such exercises on the human side they had never simulated bird flu in poultry farms because outbreaks occurred regularly in farms on its territory while singapore authorities actually killed poultry for a disease that remained virtual hong kong authorities simulated the transmission of bird flu from chickens to humans because it was already circulating among birds although avian influenza kills birds as well as humans the reverse scenario of a pandemic represents massive death in a different mode for humans and for birds depending on past experiences of pathogens crossing borders between speciesi now turn to the simulation of bird flu in hong kong on 13 november 2006 hong kong coordinated a desktop exercise called great wall which simulated a virtual cluster of three human infections with h5n1 in a family returning to hong kong and macau after their visit to a poultry market in mainland china the goal of the exercise was to synchronize the three systems of pandemic preparedness to engender an effective response among them unsic 2008 18 the exercise opened with a ceremony attended by the viceminister of the chinese ministry of health wang longde it was considered as a success in creating good relations between mainland china and the former british and portuguese colonies while the sars coronavirus had caused a division between china and the former colonies in 2003 because of beijings reluctance to share information abraham 2007 great wall unified the country against an imagined enemy pandemic avian influenza but it instantiated ruptures between humans and birdsin january 2009 after long discussions with the centre for health protection i was allowed to participate in an exercise in a hong kong hospital the centre for health protection was created by the department of health after the sars crisis to anticipate outbreaks similar to sars through active surveillance and communication leung  baconshone 2006 within this centre the emergency response branch headed by a police officer was in charge of writing scenarios and organizing simulations twice a year a field exercise was held in hong kong with observers from china and overseas bearing the name of natural entities maple cypress chestnut redwood eagle jadeite and so on there was no epidemic simulation in hong kong in 2009 because the emergency response branch considered the management of the h1n1 virus in the spring and autumn to be a reallife exerciseexercise redwood took place in the clinic of shau kei wan located in the workingclass district of hong kong island the following scenario was distributed to the participants and posted at major public buildings confirmed human cases of bird flu had been reported in hong kongs neighbouring countries as well as a rising trend in patient attendance with influenzalike illness in hong kong hospitals live poultry had tested positive for avian influenza in hong kongs markets and were then culled at farms and markets a member of the staff participating in the culling was reported to carry the h5n1 virus as was an 8yearold boy who had played with live poultry four clinics were designated in hong kong for triage only the final part of the scenario was held in shau kei wan the first part was meant to provide a plausible contextthe official purpose of the simulation was to coordinate hospital services in the management of patients with influenzalike illness eighty actors playing patients came in through the front door of the hospital and were sent to different departments depending on their symptoms pulmonary conditions tuberculosis etc twenty players treated them in the services and two simulators communicated with other hospitals on a hotline those who were diagnosed with h5n1 were evacuated by ambulance through the back door of the hospital where the media took pictures the head of the department of health gave a press conference after visiting the hospital but the journalists asked him about new bacteria found in a private jacuzzi not about the exercise itself the drills success was not questioned it was successful because it had been held the scenario was designed in such a way that no surprising event could happen the only reality that came up was the bacteria in the jacuzzi not the virus in bird marketsall the actors i saw looked young and relaxed wearing blue caps and casual clothes their symptoms were described on a tag they wore around their necks indicating their name address nationality sex and age these cards were red or green depending on whether they had bird flu or only influenzalike symptoms they did not have to fake illness their only role was to move to the designated departments in another exercise organized by the centre for health protection a plane was evacuated because a patient had been found with influenzalike symptoms those who sat next to the patient received a red tag and those who sat at a good distance received a yellow tag what was remarkable in exercise redwood was the absence of tension or anxiety in the medical staffs behaviour although humanitarian ngos consider triage to be an ethical issue when a higher number of patients is met with limited resources nguyen 2010 redfield 2013 the medical staff of the shau kei wan clinic only separated symptomatic and asymptomatic patients to avoid the spread of the disease the tension of the situation  who would be considered a spreader who would receive treatment first  was delegated to objects tags and caps people were reduced to bearers of signs that circulated fluidly in the hospital under the gaze of the mediawhile the medical staff of the hospital played their own role the actors playing patients with influenzalike illness came from a humanitarian association the auxiliary medical service ams this association created in 1950 to deal with the influx of chinese refugees was registered in 1983 under the security department of the hong kong government its 4000 members are trained for disaster management in hong kong and outside one of them described it to me as afterwork entertainment a place to meet other singles it is an elite association where similar people express and share moral values during their own exercises performed every month they train how to rescue victims of car accidents or fires they simulate heartbeats on dummies with fake hearts patients cannot fake the heart rate or the respiratory rhythm said the organizer so they have tags tags have an indirect realistic effect while dummies can actually simulate the heartbeat of an injured victimmembers of the ams who describe their own exercises as significant moments in the life of the association were frustrated by exercise redwood from their perspective there is a sharp difference between regular accident rescue exercises and extraordinary epidemic evacuation drills that coordinate several departments one of the actors said he felt passive playing on the ambivalence of the term
as we had experienced sars in 2003 we all can forecast how we would behave in another similar situation like avian flu being a citizen we are quite passive i believe that we should follow the guidelines and the governments advice so as to prevent ourselves from getting affected but in the exercise we were being passive3

it can be said consequently that when they simulate patients in an epidemic exercise members of the ams literally act as if they were dummies there is thus a fundamental distinction in the realground exercises between actors and players while actors are passive reduced to the objects that act or speak for them players and simulators introduce uncertainty by the way they combine these objects in the scenario if actors have to appear real to produce good images in the media the simulators play on the fictional possibilities of the scenario the distinction between simulators and actors in realground simulations runs parallel to the distinction between virologists and public health planners in desktop exercises while actors and planners only follow their roles in the exercise simulators and virologists explore the potentialities of reverse scenariosanother example shows how realground exercises combine the virtual and the actual as desktop simulation does in an exercise called jadeite organized in january 2007 members of the emergency response branch were simulating the evacuation of a residential building on computers and the scenario specified that they had to evacuate the simulation room to a fallback room the simulation room from which the vulnerability of vital infrastructures in hong kong was virtually assessed thus came to be seen itself as a material environment under threat the head of the emergency response branch who described this exercise to me said it was more fun than a movie as if images had suddenly burst through the screen in this reversal of the scenario simulators became actors and fiction reality neither a ritual performance nor a scientific model of prediction the simulation was for this former policeman a game he enjoyed playinganimals take part in simulations in a general category that can be called passive actors if there was no need to simulate the culling of poultry because it regularly happened in hong kong markets simulators for the evacuation of residential buildings in hong kong planned that some residents were accompanied by pets that should be handled with care by the agriculture department because their reaction to the evacuation was unknown just as simulators of the evacuation of planes planned how to handle reluctant potential patients the real opposition in simulations is thus not between humans and animals but between poultry handled as commodities that can be destroyed ordinary citizens and pets considered as passive actors that should be handled with care and simulators changing the rules of the game more than sharp ontological distinctions between fiction and reality or between animals and humans there is a virtual gradient of actors in the anticipation of massive death produced by simulationthe use of accessories and animals in simulations of disasters is indeed an essential part of their realism tracy davis has shown that people coming from the world of theatre were hired by cold war experts to implement scenarios of nuclear blast through the design of accessories simulation designers were therefore less concerned with the participation of the public than with the realism of the objects after an exercise organized in coventry in 1954 prime minister winston churchill complained about the high degree of realism of the simulations which he considered a waste of public money who thought of the bloodstained old woman with the birdcage i hope there is not going to be any more of this sort of thing at government expense quoted in davis 2007 51 women were the main targets of civil defence after the second world war as they had been the targets of public health campaigns against microbes at the beginning of the twentieth century because they were in charge of the household with children and pets animals were portrayed as good accessories of nuclear blast simulations not only because they were good laboratory models masco 2006 305 but also because they were part of a familiar landscape disrupted by an extraordinary eventthe extraordinary context of the simulation thus provides the opportunity to display a series of apparent contradictions people become objects animals become people actors turn out to be passive fiction enters into reality this capacity to displace oppositions in an extraordinary context through reverse scenarios brings simulations close to rituals however if simulations can be considered as rituals of public health administration justifying the work of virus hunters who sound the alarm about future pandemics it doesnt mean that there is a secret worldview shared by simulators gusterson 1996 rather simulations display openly contradictions that public health administrations have to solve often by the use of sacrifice in operations of culling of infected poultry or triage of suspected patients they create a tension between two techniques of power those of biologists and simulators who follow viruses as they mutate between species which i describe as cynegetic and those of public health officials who have to protect some populations against others which i call pastoral to support this hypothesis i will now turn to simulations organized by birdwatchers can we say that birdwatchers take the perspectives of threatened wild birds as virologists take the perspective of poultry infected with flu viruses how do humans in charge of the protection of animals cope with the oppositions we have seen in reverse scenarios of pandemicsbirdwatchers have been involved in the surveillance of the avian reservoir of influenza viruses public health and agriculture authorities realized that they could not follow the mutations of flu viruses in wild birds and collaborated with birdwatching associations to monitor potential cases in wild bird reserves and natural environments in hong kong and taiwan birdwatching practices a privilege of british and american expatriates until the 1980s have become popular among chinese middle classes with the development of a leisure society the commercialization of camera equipment and the awareness of the vulnerability of the environment choy 2011 birdwatching has taken the form of a citizen science with the opening of websites where amateurs post their observations and experts turn them into statistical data every year bird races offer opportunities for birdwatchers to compete in observing the highest number of birds on a designated territory thus birdwatching practices like simulations have virtual and actual aspects orientated by the imagination of a disaster the extinction of bird speciesin hong kong and taiwan the introduction of birdwatching was linked to techniques of preparedness and concerns for biosecurity the main wild bird reserve in hong kong mai po is situated on the estuary of the pearl river delta and on the border with mainland china after 1949 british officers used to sit there with their binoculars to trace chinese refugees or to signal an attack by the chinese army and took this opportunity to inventory the more than 500 bird species in hong kong hong kong and taiwan were part of the migratory animal pathological survey a programme of surveillance of pathogens carried by birds particularly japanese encephalitis through this programme british and american ornithologists trained chinese workers to band birds and collect samples transforming birds into data and following the evolution of their numbers has been a way to simulate threats coming from birds since the second world war keck 2015methods derived from us wildlife management have changed the perception of birds in the last twenty years in taiwan and hong kong with the introduction of the concept of the flyway species that fly from japan and korea to australia along what came to be called the east asianaustralian flyway have been shown to have declined owing to the urbanization and development of the chinese coast climate change is also supposed to damage the places where wild birds feed and roost on their migratory routes among the bird species affected by these changes one of the most charismatic is the blackfaced spoonbill a waterbird breeding in japan and korea in the summer and migrating to south china in the winter in the 1990s the number of these birds was estimated to be 2000 but thanks to the conservation efforts shared by the countries to which they migrate it increased to 3000 at the end of the 2000s wetlands have been developed in hong kong taiwan and fujian as shelters on their flyways images of spoonbills abound in schools environmental agencies and natural reserves often portrayed as funny birds smiling to the public to understand how reverse scenarios of disasters enter the management of spoonbills in china we have to go beyond these anthropomorphic images and look at how they actually perform in simulationsin the winter of 20023 seventythree blackfaced spoonbills were found dead from botulism in taijiang national park the wild bird society of tainan consequently organized a campaign to vaccinate spoonbills against botulism and used decoys to train their staff on how to safely handle the birds since then drills have been regularly organized for bird protectors to learn how to manipulate fake spoonbills with caution these decoys are also used to attract spoonbills for gps monitoring carved in wood and painted in black and white they are posted in the wetlands close to traps decoys are different from images of spoonbills on posters wildlife managers interact with them as if they were alive because of their accurate mimickingthe use of decoys is a traditional feature of bird hunting by contrast with lures which attract birds based on their appetites decoys attribute intentions to prey schaeffer 1999 64 in england duck decoys take the form of pondside wooden houses into which ducks are attracted by a fake dog because hunters have observed that ducks swim towards the dog to signal that it has been seen in the same way the fake spoonbill is used as a decoy because it creates a situation of communication with the bird but at the same time the fake spoonbill is used as a dummy by birders who train to manipulate spoonbills in risky situations as in epidemic simulations the use of spoonbill decoys mixes hunting techniques and pastoral techniques because decoys are considered both as intentional agents and as objects that should be manipulated with carethis hypothesis was confirmed on 29 april 2013 when the wild bird federation of tainan led me to a site where three blackfaced spoonbills had been trapped  a very rare event which i was considered lucky to have witnessed birdwatchers had found shelter in a taoist temple on the banks of the marshes and they turned on some buddhist music to soothe the birds with very calm gestures a man equipped with gloves and a mask sewed a gps satellite tracking device around the waist of the spoonbill while a woman held it gently but firmly five other birdwatchers watched them with amusement taking pictures and making comments on the birds reactions the man explained to me that he had to be cautious because it was a young spoonbill so the weight of the satellite tracking device had to be imposed on its body in such a way that it would not hamper its growth or unbalance its flight how to build techniques of monitoring that do not kill animals considered as indexes of the fate of their species is a major concern for wildlife managers who often talk about the sacrifice of individual animals when they die as the result of an improper monitoring device benson 2011 but taiwanese birdwatchers focused the discussion on how to properly release these birds so that they would not be sacrificed but become sentinels of a threatened speciesthe release of birds is a major ritual concern in south china known as fangsheng literally let live this practice finds its roots in aristocratic practices of opening the cages of birds who sang well and was codified in taoist rituals as a specific sequence of releasing a live animal but it has developed massively in recent centuries with its qualification by buddhists as a practice of compassion that increases the merits gongde of those who release live animals handlin smith 1999 in hong kong and taiwan buddhist associations entered into discussion with birdwatching societies because many birds were found dead after they were bought in bird markets and released in surrounding natural parks these associations had to warn through posters that releasing birds could cause the death of birds because they were released in an improper environment and the death of humans since some of the birds found dead after the release carried avian flu severinghaus  chi 1991consequently when they released a bird equipped with gps that they had learned to manipulate through the use of decoys taiwanese birdwatchers inserted a ritual sequence into a simulation practice while the ritual introduced the bird into a cycle of life and death the simulation used the decoy to produce signs of future threats for birds and humans the blackfaced spoonbills were released in the taijiang national park with the hope that they would fly over to hong kong or the fujian coast where their signals could be captured it should be noted that the taiwan straits are also the sites of military exercises or drills through which threats coming from china are mitigated to prepare for an attack from the peoples republic of china the taiwanese centers for disease control was organizing exercises simulating the use of bioweapons in a public space such as sars smallpox and avian flu virus rollet 2010 311 the release of a blackfaced spoonbill in the same chinese straits mimics and reverses the scenario of an avian flu outbreak from china instead of carrying information on the potential war between two longterm enemies it produces signals on the changes of bird habitats that concern birds as well as humans while in the public health simulations birds are considered as carriers of infectious diseases birdwatchers simulations frame them as living beings with which humans share pathogens as signs of communicationanother practice with birds in taiwan clarifies by contrast their role in simulations according to peta more than a million pigeons are released every day from boats in the taiwan straits by pigeonracing clubs and only 1 per cent survive to come back to their shelter huge amounts of money an estimated us2 billion are spent in bets on those which will return welcomed as heroes if they are first killed if they are too slow4 this is neither a ritual nor a simulation but a gambling practice through which birds crossing the sea between china and taiwan are qualified as political signifiers the reverse scenario of the game producing strange identifications between humans and birds tells the story of a pigeon successfully returning home while others fail and die in the taiwan straitsreleasing a bird in taiwan can thus appear as a simulation when it is embedded in the framework of an environmental flyway as a ritual when it mobilizes a cosmological view of the circulation of souls between humans and animals or as a game when it is organized on the border separating two competing territories simulation ritual and play are three frameworks to mitigate the uncertainties of catching and releasing a potentially sick birdi have considered three stages where bird diseases are simulated computer simulations of avian influenza by microbiologists outdoor performances of pandemic influenza by public health administrations and exercises of manipulating threatened birds by birdwatchers these three types of simulation displace the problem of sacrifice that is the definition of those who deserve to live and those who will die microbiological surveillance of viruses moves away from the site of emergence where birds are killed to prevent the spread of pathogens to humans and traces continuities between humans and animals as a reservoir where viruses silently mutate simulations of epidemics dont address the problem of triage between humans in a situation of exception but rather configure new relations between humans and animals through accessories in a performance exercises of vaccinating and releasing potentially sick birds dont raise the issue of how many birds can die for the sake of the species but rather reflect on how to handle a bird with care in a political environment where they carry signals of threat in the reverse scenarios of simulations birds appear not as sources of infection that must be eradicated but as sentinels with which humans can communicate to imagine potential futuressimulations therefore should be analysed not only as a pastoral technique of power as ways to mobilize populations under a common threat in which some are sacrificed for the sake of others but also as a cynegetic technique of power creating relations of identification between humans and animals around a perceived uncertainty at the borders between species in the world of databased science and transparency of communication simulations of bird diseases imply playing like animals or with animals to anticipate the impossibility of a mass extinction thus mobilizing elementary forms of identificationin the cases i have considered the question of the realism of exercises is a way to draw attention to the circulation of objects that recast relations between humans and birds by simulating the diseases they share the use of computer software accessories and decoys in the three types of simulations i have analysed blurs the sharp opposition between humans and nonhumans these objects can be considered as decoys because they carry the intentions that humans attribute to animals and shift their perception from inanimate objects to living beings while scenarios of birdgenerated epidemics play on the asymmetries between humans and birds the horizon of the simulation the extinction of the human or of a bird species integrates them as common actors of a game simulations can thus be considered as reflexive rituals because they display the uncertainties of the beings they play with and help to mitigate their threats framing simulation as an operation unfolding between the spheres of mimetic play and reflexive ritual and at the same time performing a series of subjectobject reversals i have argued for the need to approach this key apparatus of preparedness through a lens that allows for the mixing of pastoral and cynegetic techniqueswhat i have called in this article avian preparedness takes place in a long history of simulating bird movements from classical divination by roman augurs to medieval bird hunting and modern birdwatching the specificity of contemporary forms of anticipation through sentinels simulation or stockpiling is that the distinction between cynegetic techniques of preparedness taking the perspectives of birds on future threats through imagination and communication and pastoral techniques of prevention protecting human or nonhuman populations from external dangers through risk calculation has become more difficult to make and yet more urgent this article has argued for such a distinction while opening the stage for future analyses of simulations as forms of play and ritualthe novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has upended health care in the united states and around the world
1
 as the first wave of surges hits the coasts of the united states the rest of the country is likely to follow and most of us will be faced with challenging decisions at personal professional and institutional levels as transplant professionals we will encounter even more limitations in donor organs as well as personnel capacity and equipment limitations in our hospitals these limitations will differ among states cities and programs making it exceptionally challenging to come up with national guidance on how to approach transplantation during the covid19 pandemicwhile transplants have been categorized as tier 3b by the centers for medicare and medicaid cms recommendations for limiting nonessential surgical procedures meaning they are of the highest acuity and should not be postponed we all know that there is nuance to which transplant patients and procedures truly meet this standard
2
 we therefore must prepare ourselves to make difficult decisions about which patients to transplant when to limit transplant capacity and how to best care for those patients who have undergone transplantation
3
 transplant capacity is being constrained by limited resources beyond that of donor organs and absolutely constrained in areas where resources are not available eg if there are no icu beds transplants requiring postoperative icu beds cannot be done
4
 as resources become limited our decisions about who to transplant will need to be guided by both the practical reality of each centers capacity as well as underlying ethical values in this manuscript we discuss the ethical standards and values that we can use to guide the transition into making decisions regarding transplantation in each of our centers and programs as we are faced with the covid19 pandemicas transplant professionals we have significant experience with allocating scarce resources most of us make listing decisions regularly considering not only medical factors but also financial and psychosocial factors all needed to make a transplant successful
5
 the balance we have tried to strike is between justice or providing an equal opportunity for transplantation and utility or ensuring acceptable benefits from transplantation
6
 the way that we currently put allocation into practice is a twostep process to achieve utility if a patient is deemed to have an acceptable potential to benefit from transplantation he or she is listed to ensure justice when an organ becomes available for transplant a match run determines the order in which listed patients are prioritized for that organ what the covid19 pandemic is forcing transplant programs to do is determine which of the patients who have met the bar for utility or have been deemed acceptable for transplantation in general should continue to be considered for transplantation given the new concerns of increased limitations on our ability to transplant patients as well as the risks of covid19 infection
4

as we move into the era of covid19 it is time to think beyond our traditional use of the two principles of justice and utility for organ allocation and begin to think in terms of the ethical values framework for rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources described by dr emanuel and colleagues to make the transition from usual practice to increasingly resourceconstrained practice
7
 the four ethical values that guide rationing of absolutely scarce healthcare resources are to maximize benefit treat people equally promote and reward instrumental value and prioritize the sickest patients maximizing benefit can be conceptualized as saving the most lives and saving the most life years treating people equally is based on the principle of justice which sets rules for how to treat people with the same need for a scarce resource in the same way eg first come first served as done with kidney allocation or random selection so as not to advantage those with quicker and easier access to hospitals promoting and rewarding instrumental value means giving priority of treatment to those who have made contributions eg healthcare workers those involved in research or to those who are likely to make contributions in the future eg healthcare workers who can return to the workforce and treat patients finally prioritizing the worst off requires determining who is the worst off and what they should be prioritized for the following sections apply each ethical value to transplantation making the argument that we will have to transition our mindset from the simple utility vs justice calculous of organ allocation to the more nuanced ethical values approach of rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources during the covid19 pandemic this paper is not a call to abandon the already established ethical principles of justice and utility in organ allocation but rather to add the consideration of the ethical values framework for decisions that deviate from standard transplant practice due to capacity constraints risks of covid19 transmission and transplant team safetymaximizing benefits to our transplant patients is a delicate balance in the setting of covid19 just looking at a match run and determining if the donor and recipient pairing is a good combination will not be enough and continuing to apply the dominant mindset that the more patients we transplant the more lives we save and the more life years we gain will not be adequate we have to pivot and think about what patients will truly benefit from transplantation in each program during this pandemic
4
 
8
 there are several ways in which we can answer this question based on the local environment
4
 in severely resourceconstrained areas the answer is to transplant only the sickest patients who are already using medical resources and most likely to die in a short time frame without an organ transplant for example patients with fulminant hepatic failure who will die without a liver transplant or status 1a heart patients who are nondischargeable on biventricular assist devices both of whom are already occupying an icu bed in less affected areas maybe the answer is to transplant the moderately ill patients who still have significant shortterm mortality but are likely to have better outcomes shorter icu stays hospital stays and use less blood products and other scarce resources in minimally affected areas we may broaden this to patients who will benefit from transplant use fewer resources and are low risk for exposure to covid19 one example that comes to mind is a straightforward kidney transplant recipient who will have a 2hour operation 3day hospital stay will be able to go home and selfisolate and has a low risk of readmissionin order to answer the question of who we can benefit from transplantation we must begin by determining the resources that are needed for a successful transplant and if those resources are available if we start with the donor we have a dead person who is utilizing an icu bed nursing staff and mechanical ventilation after the icu the donor utilizes operating room resources including personnel surgical masks and gowns here we must consider the competing needs of the donor hospital for these resources after donation the organ transplantation is also resource intensive recipients utilize operating rooms blood products and icu beds albeit to different extents depending on the organ transplanted again this requires personnel ventilators and personal protective equipment that may be needed in other areas of the recipient hospitalmaximizing benefit goes hand in hand with minimizing risk therefore we must also consider the parallel risk of covid19 transmission to the recipient either through donorderived infection nosocomial spread or community transmission pre or posttransplant
9
 
10
 kumar et al
4
 suggest that transmission of covid19 in lung transplantation is high risk as the virus is primarily isolated from the respiratory tract but that there is evidence of viremia in 15 of cases making donor to recipient transmission possible in any transplant in areas of high rates of community spread it is essential to screen all recipients for covid19 risk and may be ideal test some or all recipients prior to transplantation currently only south korea is testing all asymptomatic recipients with np swabs prior to transplantation
4
 moreover as part of patient screening we must determine if patients can enact a postdischarge quarantine or physical distancing plan including virtual clinic visits to minimize the risk of exposure to covid19 patients who are unable to physically distance from others after transplantation due to living arrangements may need assistance from the transplant program to secure alternative housing for to allow for this or be given supplies such as masks to assist in decreasing the risk of covid19 transmission if postdischarge housing arrangements are high risk and cannot be changed then transplant programs may need to consider not transplanting these highrisk patients acknowledging that this type of policy may affect lower income patients more harshly than higher income patients and should only be a consideration if there is truly no alternative strategy for risk minimizationmoreover as a transplant community we should strive to test all donors so as to minimize the risk of transmission from donors to recipients as has been done in italy canada switzerland spain and korea
4
 even with universal donor testing there will be false negatives so a negative test does not guarantee zero risk of donor to recipient transmission
11
 just as we discuss the risk of infectious disease transmission from increased risk donors with recipients we have an obligation to discuss the risk of covid19 transmission with recipients even if that discussion is focused more on the unknown rather than known risk table 1 provides a series of questions to address the resource limitations and risk minimization capacity to consider prior to transplantationwhen considering the limitations and risks we have to recognize that each solid organ transplant is different with respect to the risk of transmission of covid19 anticipated icu and hospital stay level of immunosuppression needed to prevent early rejection and intensity of postoperative monitoring a standard kidney transplant from a good donor for example will not require intensive care and be discharged within 3 days of the operation while a decompensated lung transplant patient will require both postoperative icu care and a longer duration of hospital stay a frail heart transplant candidate with a high likelihood of needing postdischarge inpatient rehabilitation afterward is at higher risk for covid19 infection than a robust candidate who can quarantine at home after discharge each donorrecipient scenario will have different considerations when it comes to resource limitations potential benefits and risksin our assessment of the ethical value of maximizing benefit we must acknowledge that there are many unknowns
9
 
10
 we currently do not have the supplies to test for covid19 on a large scale and therefore do not know the true prevalence in our communities we do not know the risk of transmission of covid19 to solid organ recipients from donors who have the disease as there are no known donor to recipient transmissions at this time
4
 moreover we do not know how transplant patients who acquire covid19 postoperatively or who undergo transplantation while infected will fare given their immunosuppressed state we are entering a time of uncertainty and have to acknowledge this uncertainty to ourselves and also to our patients as we try to make the best decisions to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of transplantationthe section above addresses the consideration of assessing the potential benefits and risks for each individual transplant scenario however as programs become more resource constrained they will have to make decisions about categorically excluding certain groups of patients from transplantation even if patients are currently active on the transplant waiting list
4
 the ethical value underpinning these decisions is that all people must be treated equally
7
 for example many programs have made the decision to discontinue living donor kidney and liver transplantation that means all living donor operations are discontinued regardless of patient desire to proceed some programs have had to limit liver transplantation to only high meld patients lung transplantation to unstable patients and heart transplantation to higher status patients some programs are refusing to consider donors who are not tested for covid19 each of these decisions is made at the level of the program and not at the level of the patient they do not consider whether the patient is willing to take a risk on a donor that is not tested or if a patient with a lower meld than the cutoff would still like to be considered for transplantation as programs are forced to make decisions that set more stringent criteria regarding who will be considered for transplantation it is essential that these decisions are made in a transparent and equitable manner one way to ensure this is for programs to communicate their decisions to patients who do not meet the new criteria and make these patients inactive so that they do not receive offers for transplantationthe discussion thus far regarding maximizing value and treating patients equally has focused primarily focused on transplant recipients as we transition to a more global assessment of transplant practices within the context of a pandemic we have to think beyond the recipients promoting and rewarding instrumental value in the framework of rationing absolutely scarce healthcare resources is aimed at ensuring the protection of the healthcare workforce who both take on personal risk by treating covid19 patients and who have the potential to continue to provide societal benefit with their expertise after recovery
7
 the idea of instrumental value can also play into transplantation in at least two ways broadening the scope of consideration beyond the transplant recipient the first is the instrumental value of the deceased donor a deceased donor has the potential to save the lives of several patients who are suffering from end organ disease this is a huge societal contribution which should be generally be rewarded by prioritizing the utilization of critical care and operating room resources however the scale can be tipped against prioritizing deceased donors if the donor is suboptimal a dcd unlikely to pass within an acceptable time frame or the donor or recipient hospitals are too overwhelmed to have the capacity for organ donation or transplantation during a surge there will likely be a live person with a competing need for the resources being utilized by the donor can we as the transplant community recommend that a donor takes priority over a live individual in need of icu care and mechanical ventilation we might if that donor will save more lives or more life years with their organs thereby maximizing overall benefit but we must be selective about which donors will truly maximize benefits to transplant patients through donation and be expedient in our donor evaluation and timing so as to minimize the utilization of these scarce resources we must keep in mind that in a severely resourceconstrained scenario the donor has the potential to save many lives while there is a patient or multiple patients whose real lives are in jeopardy awaiting a ventilatora second consideration in the framework of instrumental value is that of the transplant team members most transplant physicians surgeons and advanced practice providers are ready to jump in and do what is necessary not only to take care of their transplant patients but also to care for any patients where they are needed many of us have the training to be versatile in our roles for example abdominal and thoracic transplant surgeons generally have critical care acute care surgery and trauma surgery training if we cannot do transplants due to a covid19 surge we can step in to assist our acute care and trauma surgery colleagues as they will have to continue to operate even in the face of the pandemic we can also offer to do donor operations at our own hospitals so as to minimize donor team travel
4
 
12
 an area in which we have to be thoughtful is who should take on the role of direct patient care of covid19 patients it is essential that those of us caring for immunosuppressed transplant patients are not also caring for covid19 patients thereby putting our immunosuppressed patients at risk

 in a surge situation we must all have a plan for how our groups can care for our transplant patients while supporting the needs of our institutionsa final more global consideration that must occur as resources become further constrained is how to prioritize the worst off in general the concept of prioritizing the worst off is secondary to and supportive of the first concept of maximizing benefit
7
 it requires defining who is the worst off and how the worst off are prioritized this value is useful in determining who should be prioritized for vaccines experimental treatments icus and ventilators we must specifically consider transplant patients in these scenarios should for example transplant patients or waitlisted patients get priority for vaccination if one becomes available so as to protect those who are already immunosuppressed or those likely to become immunosuppressed should they receive priority for experimental treatments as they are potentially more vulnerable due to immunosuppression for icus and ventilators should a transplant patient who suffers a complication and is likely to have a prolonged resourceintensive recovery take priority over a young patient with covid19 and respiratory decompensation in addressing these types of questions we have to determine which patient is worse off and then balance the worse off patient with the value of maximizing benefits and favor the individual who will meet our first goal saving more lives or life years these global decisions about prioritization of the worst off within a hospital are not decisions that physicians in the united states are used to facing moreover the culture of transplantation is that of pushing the limits and getting patients through their postoperative course even when it will be a long resourceintensive process our desire to do everything for our transplant patients may conflict with the competing interest of other patients in the hospital and may end in triage decisions that go against our nature as transplant physicians ultimately we must be willing to consider what it means to be the worst off in a pandemic and make or allow our institutions to make prioritization decisions in light of the larger picture of all patients in need of scarce resourcesthe transplant enterprise is wellversed in allocating scare healthcare resources because of the limited supply of donor organs and we are now facing new challenges with the covid19 pandemic while the examples we provide in this manuscript come from abdominal transplantation our area of expertise the general principles values and processes for determining who we should transplant applies across organ types we cannot afford to continue business as usual when we are faced with more limitations in donors personnel supplies and hospital capacity we must begin thinking of transplantation in the context of the covid19 pandemic and apply the framework of ethical values for rationing absolutely scare healthcare resources to this transition so that we can be thoughtful stewards of donor organs honest advocates for our patients and continue to add value to our institutions moreover this is unfortunately unlikely to be the last time that we face a pandemic or largescale disaster situation and this framework is not just applicable to covid19 but can guide us in future scenariosthe authors of this manuscript have no conflicts of interest to disclose as described by the american journal of transplantationin late december 2019 a patient in wuhan jinyintan hospital in hubei province in china was diagnosed with pneumonia1 the illness was caused by a novel coronavirus disease named covid-19 by 20 february 2020 there were over 75 000 cases of covid-19 in china the median age of those infected was 51 years but ranged from just 2 days to 100 years over three quarters of cases were aged between 30 and 69 years just over half were malecovid-19 was quick to spread beyond chinas borders on 11 march the world health organization who declared a pandemic by early april the who reported that there were 125 million confirmed cases worldwide and over 69 000 deathsit is now clear that covid-19 presents two major health problems the first problem is the illness caused by the virus itself which is usually self-limiting but can be fatal especially in the vulnerable the elderly and people with underlying health conditions the second problem is the anxiety and panic that the virus triggers in the minds of virtually everyone who hears about it both problems present substantial challenges to psychiatryregarding the first problem the illness itself much of the solution lies in the hands of public health authorities the governments that fund them and citizens all around the world who adhere to public health advice about hand washing coughing etiquette not touching our faces physical distancing and staying at home when advised to do so these methods work to reduce community transmission of the virusin addition medical staff around the globe are using established methods of infection control and treatment that were developed during previous outbreaks and are being adapted to this new challenge ultimately covid-19 will be controlled albeit at very considerable cost to health mental health and economies around the worldthe physical illness caused by covid-19 is an urgent concern for psychiatry we already know that people with mental illness have a lower life expectancy and poorer physical health outcomes than the general population2 this means that our patients appear less likely to access public health advice about covid-19 more likely to contract the virus and less likely to receive prompt diagnostic and treatment servicesvulnerable populations are at particular risk the homeless people with disabilities the chronically ill prisoners and all who live in institutional settings people in these groups often have accumulations of risk factors including poor physical and mental health impaired access to services and diminished control over their day-to-day livesas a result there is a clear need for greater focus on providing care to the mentally ill and other vulnerable groups at this time and a clear need to question any proposed re-deployment of mental health staff to other duties during the crisis unless absolutely necessary3 this is a mental health emergency as well as a physical health crisisone of the challenges with providing enhanced psychiatric care during the pandemic is the high risk of infection among psychiatrists and other mental health workers careful awareness of risk judicious rostering and remote working where possible can help reduce this risk this concern applies not only to fully trained psychiatrists and other mental health professionals but also to trainees and students whose education needs to progress as best as possible in the current radically altered circumstances they too need our assistance fortunately the website of the royal college of psychiatrists provides excellent information advice and support wwwrcpsychacuk it is important that this continues and that we support the colleges tireless work on covid-19the second problem with the covid-19 pandemic is the anxiety panic and other mental health issues that are attributable to or worsened by covid-19 among the public health professionals our patients people with the infection and their families many of these problems are understandable in the context of a pandemic but they still require careful consideration accurate diagnosis and active management where necessaryamong the public free-floating anxiety can be helped by advising people to manage their use of media especially social media and focus on reliable sources of information such as the who wwwwhoint this will help combat false information and conspiracy theories that simply stoke anxiety and cause enormous distress to many good diet exercise and sleep are also important at times of heightened emotion along with practices such as mindfulness and reaching out to others for mutual supportironically some of the public health measures required to control this infection can have negative effects on mental health quarantine for example can be associated with fear of infection frustration boredom and anxiety owing to lack of information4 there can also be problems with stigma and finances afterwards these problems can be mitigated by terminating these public health measures when they are no longer necessary providing adequate information and basic supplies reducing boredom and improving communication using technology where possible children require particular attention to maintaining structure in their day and providing schooling as best as feasible children respond to honesty practical suggestions such as hand washing and their parents setting a good examplefor people infected with covid-19 there can be feelings of guilt anxiety and despair compounded by the physical effects of infection cough fever hypoxia and prolonged hospital stays for the families of those affected there can be feelings of guilt remorse and loss following bereavement grief is likely to be complex owing to limits on visiting the sick or dying in hospitals uncertainties about the spread of infection and complications about the conduct of funerals in this emotionally charged setting psychological support is vital both at the time of death and into the future the best strategy is to give people the time and space to rely on their informal networks to cope but also ensure they know that the door is open to mental health services if they need them at any point now or in the futureregrettably there is already evidence that in china at least psychological and psychiatric care have been neglected in the context of covid-195 although this is partially understandable in the white heat at the epicentre of a pandemic it would be deeply unwise to neglect mental healthcare at this time never before has there been greater need for multidisciplinary mental health teams clear communication about psychological supports and use of new technologies to provide diagnostic and therapeutic services where and when they are neededas with virtually all outbreaks of infectious diseases many of the people who die during the current pandemic will in truth die of a combination of covid-19 and poverty although there is already considerable morbidity and mortality in high-income countries these problems will inevitably be worse in countries with underdeveloped health systems inadequate sanitation and poor nutrition that is why on 5 march 2020 tedros adhanom director-general of the who emphasised the importance of global solidarity in addressing the pandemic
ultimately how deadly this virus will be depends not only on the virus itself but on how we respond to it this is a serious disease it is not deadly to most people but it can kill were all responsible for reducing our own risk of infection and if were infected for reducing our risk of infecting others theres something all of us can do to protect vulnerable people in our communities thats why we keep talking about solidarity this is not just a threat for individual people or individual countries were all in this together and we can only save lives together6for psychiatrists this means solidarity with our patients solidarity with their families solidarity with our multidisciplinary colleagues and perhaps most of all solidarity with each other we need each other nowcovid-19 is the greatest public health challenge that most of us have ever encountered and hopefully it will be the worst that we ever encounter in the future how psychiatry responds to this situation will play a large part in defining the nature and role of psychiatry in the years to come the message from psychiatrys history is clear we can rise to this challengethe core values of the royal college of psychiatrists are courage innovation respect collaboration learning and excellence the covid-19 pandemic requires that we translate all of these values into actions as a matter of urgency covid-19 demands no lessour patients need us now more than everthe current outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection has reached most countries around the world and has had a devastating impact on several of them physicians of various specialties have found themselves in the eye of the storm of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 physicians and physician-scientists are working around the clock to treat infected patients educate the public about social distancing measures and test potential treatments and vaccines to fully understand the nature of the pandemic and the impact of social distancing measures one must understand the mathematics behind it one of the most relevant mathematical models relating to the spread of a pandemic is the susceptible-infectious-removed sir model and its variants unfortunately the mathematical depth of this model can seem daunting to some physicians and physician-scientists in this paper we will try to explain and simplify the mathematics behind some of these epidemiological modelsepidemiological studies that divide a population into compartments are called compartmental models the most commonly used of these models is the sir model this type of model has been used in several studies analyzing the spread of covid-19 58 these models help us understand how covid-19 spreads predict the regional peaks of the pandemic and understand the impact of various quarantine measures all the epidemiological models which we will discuss in this paper are based on analyzing systems of differential equations differential equations focus on the rate of change of a variable or group of variables as time passes they are found in almost all aspects of medicine they help us in dose medications understand disease spread and even dialyze patients when more than one variable is involved we usually need more than one differential equation to model a given situation these are referred to as a system of differential equations let us begin with the most basic form of sir modelsduring a pandemic some of the most important factors to know is how fast it will spread and what measures can be taken to slow it down these impact public health policies including quarantines travel restrictions and resource allocation the sir model divides a given population into three groups susceptible infectious and removed as time passes by the number of people in each of these groups changes the number of susceptible people is highest at the very beginning of a pandemic since everyone who is not or has not been infected is considered susceptible in most cases on the other hand the number of infectious individuals is at its lowest during the beginning of a pandemic as time passes by the number of susceptible people decreases and the number of infectious people increases these changes can be modeled using differential equationslet us assume that the independent variable t stands for time measured in days time is the only independent variable in this case in other words all other variables evolve as a function of time let us use s to refer to the number of susceptible individuals at any given time t another way to indicate that s is a dependent on time is to call it st similarly i or it represents the number of infectious individuals as a function of time r or rt represents the number of removed individuals as function of time removed means that they are no longer contagious either because they recovered or because they died the three dependent variables s i and r represent the three possible segments of a given population with n number of people this means that the sum of all three variables is equal to n 13 8documentclass12ptminimal

the military defines it asan incident or situation that typically develops rapidly and creates a condition of such diplomatic economic or military importance that the president or secdef considers a commitment of us military forces and resources to achieve national objectives it may occur with little or no warning it is fast-breaking and requires accelerated decision making sometimes a single crisis may spawn another crisis elsewhere joint chiefs of staff 2011 pp ii29

crises catastrophes and calamities are an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life they have been with us since the beginning of time it can be argued that they will be with us until the end of human history itself in short they are an integral part of the human condition they are the human condition mitroff 2004 p 33
a crisis is an unstable time or state of affairs in which a decisive change is impending  either one with the distinct possibility of a highly undesirable outcome or one with the distinct possibility of a highly desirable and extremely positive outcome it is usually a 50-50 proposition but you can improve the odds fink 1986 p 15
these definitions both from scholars and practitioners share several things in common they all point out that crises happen quickly many times without warning and in order to be considered a crisis they must imperil an organizations objectives or goals while forcing the organization to take steps to mitigate the possible consequences it is important to note that many if not most organizations do not have a defined concept of a crisis nor a list of what constitutes a crisis to their organization this would be helpful for many reasons chief among these reasons in terms of importance is that by having a list of events describing what constitutes a crisis the organization will be much quicker to recognize and respond and will be less likely to overreact when less severe events occurwhy is having a definition of a crisis important how we define it will predict and dictate how we see the world with a good understanding of the definition of a crisis is we can also be better prepared to lead and respond when needed we have all likely been in situations where an event occurred and only several people or maybe only one person viewed it as a crisis while the minority of the group is responding to the event as a crisis the others cant quite fully understand what the big deal is this is exactly the situation that can be avoided when proper crisis planning is conducted and a generally agreed-upon definition of a crisis exists for the organizationa persons worldview impacts how they define a crisis people who have a secular or atheistic worldview will see a crisis as an opportunity for man to conquer nature and for the strongest to survive and succeed those with a more animistic or spirit-ruled worldview will see a crisis as something that cannot be prepared for or even responded to but rather as something that must be submitted to finally those of us with a christian worldview will see a crisis as something that is of god but that he will help us respond to if we follow his way those people who see their time on earth as an end will more than likely see a crisis as a possible end christians should see a crisis as only one part of our time on earth that is leading to our ultimate salvation and entry into gods never-ending kingdom miller 1998the relationship between a leaders viewpoint and a crisis goes both ways our perception of a crisis based upon our worldview can become reality because our actions will be shaped by this perception boin et al in couto 2010 explained the importance of perception to crisis in the following definitionin sum crises are the combined products of unusual events and shared perceptions that something is seriously wrong however no set of events or developments is likely to be perceived fully uniformly by members of a community perceptions of crisis are likely to vary not only among communitiessocieties experience different types of disturbances and have different types and levels of vulnerability and resiliencebut also within them reflecting the different biases of stakeholders as a result of their different values positions and responsibilities these differential perceptions and indeed accounts of a crisis set the stage for crisis leadership p 230
this means that if we perceive a crisis a certain way we may change it into what we think it is similarly how we view difficult events in our lives can over time impact our worldview and how much control we believe we have over difficult situations this is why a leader needs to be prepared to guide the organization through a potential crisisas mentioned earlier it is important for leaders to prepare their organizations for a crisis by educating the members on what the group defines as a crisis pearson and clair 1998 below is a suggested general list of events that can be edited to fit the needs and specific circumstances of an organization this should be a starting point for a leader to consider when evaluating the types of crisis that might affect their organization table 21
as you can see from this list of crises that can impact an organization the scope and severity can vary greatly many of the listed items are events that occur outside of the organization while others like corporate reorganization happen internally in addition to being able to bin crises as either external or internal occurrences we can further group them into several different categories across the spectrum of impact to an organization harvard business essentials 2004 the list below represents how these categories can be separated into like events with a few examples for us to consideraccidents and natural eventshurricane sandy hurricane katrina australian wildfires tohoku earthquake and tsunamihealth disasterscoronavirus ebola and zika virustechnological accidentschernobyl fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster and gulf oil spilleconomic problemsimpacts from the coronavirus of 2020 the great recession and the 1970s oil crisisgeopolitical turmoilgulf war hong kong protests and the israelipalestinian conflictunethical actionsenron bernie madoff scandal and wells fargo scandal harvard business essentials 2004
this list and the table presented before it are only a limited representation of crises that can occur they are intended to provide the leader with an idea of what sort of things may happen so that they can develop a top ten list of possible crises which they can develop their crisis action plan to combat having this list of ten of the worst things that might happen to the organization is important not just so you can prepare for the specific crisis it is also important so that you can get your organization to start preparing in a general sense for any crisis that might occurit is interesting to note the difference between a crisis and a disaster while many treat the two as one and the same and most view the response as the most important thing to consider there is a difference that should be considered by an organization bhaduri 2019 explains this difference best when he writes a disaster happens within the larger environment in which some crucial element of an organization is situated while a crisis typically happens to an organization but does not cause an issue for most of the units external to the organization you can see from this list above that the tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami are listed disasters while the resulting crisis of the fukushima daiichi nuclear accident is listed as a separate crisis this definition appears to pertain mainly to scope but it is important for an organizations leadership to understand the difference so they can communicate effectively and accurately what is really happeningit is important to understand that one disaster and even one crisis can lead to additional crises this is true in the case of tsunami leading to a nuclear reactor meltdown and it is also true of a corporate crisis that is mismanaged that leads to an even larger crisis like what we have seen with companies like enron and wells fargo there is more value in the planning for a crisis than in a prescriptive response that can be prepared for a specific crisis since we never know precisely what might occur one of the favorite sayings in the military planning community is plans are nothing but the planning is everything this simple saying acknowledges that the plans made may not be implemented perfectly due to the varying circumstances of the crisis what is important is the planning process where all of the different variables and possible responses can be considered so that an organization is ready when the crisis happens this benefit from the planning process is why a plan should never be put on the shelf for years instead an organization should have an active planning cycle where plans are reviewed and discussed yearly if not more frequently
natural disasters have occurred since time began and they have always affected humans within close proximity to them with the population of the earth constantly expanding and humans spread out across the earth these disasters tend to affect more people than in the past what we see even more today are crises that are not related to natural causes large-scale factory accidents nuclear plant mishaps corporate crime and mismanagement and oil refinery explosions are a few of the examples of crises we can view as more internal and preventable than natural disasters mitroff 2004 and todays man-made crises can rival the worst impacts we have seen from any natural disasters the exponential improvement in technology combined with the flattening of the world around us has given rise to a world where many now view crisis as a way of life what this means is that crisis leadership is even more important now than it has been in the past we need crisis leaders who are prepared for crisis as a way of lifecrisis leaders are not needed simply to guide organizations out of crises research shows that more and more of the crisis we see today are caused by human error typically it is not just a simple error by one person that leads to a major crisis instead it is typically a chain of errors or an overall systemic error involving humans that leads to most of the crises we see in organizations simonsson and heide 2018 perrow 1984when we look at a crisis we should understand the difference between error and risk as was just explained error is something that can be prevented by an aware leader who encourages their organization to report errors and work to improve in the areas identified risk on the other hand is typically not avoidable when reviewing risk we assume that something will happen and we project the likelihood of when it will occur and how badly the organization will be affected we should not make error and risk synonymous because our organizations should be encouraged to identify areas of human error report them and correct them in short we should not place error and risk in the same category when we plan for the crises that will inevitably come simonsson and heide 2018the bible provides us with plenty of examples of crisis and peoples response to them while the old and new testaments are different in many respects they both contain many examples of crisis and how those affected responded to these difficult times and while i agree with irving and strauss 2019 that the bible is not a handbook on leadership i do believe there is much that can be learned from scripture on how to lead especially during a crisisfrom almost the beginning of the bible we are presented with stories of people and groups in crisis we see several specific examples of crisis leadership with moses in exodus 667 god tells moses to inform the israelites that he will deliver them out of their servitude to the egyptianstherefore say to the israelites i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the yoke of the egyptians i will free you from being slaves to them and i will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment i will take you as my own people and i will be your god then you will know that i am the lord your god who brought you out from under the yoke of the egyptians niv
do you think the israelites believed this and were encouraged to respond to this crisis i highly doubt it we read soon after that  moses reported this to the israelites but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor niv it is almost unfathomable to think that the israelites after being told very clearly that they would be saved from their current situation decided not to listen to moses because their situation seemed so difficult and hopeless it may seem unfathomable but is it any more unfathomable than what we see today when people are going through crisis and do not think they will ever get beyond the issue facing them we are not that much different than the israelites but as leaders we must see beyond our current situation and instill confidence in our people that we will be able to overcome the crisis facing us we should use our faith in god to bolster this confidence and allow us to lead through the crisis presented to us as authentic leadersthink back to difficult times in the life of your organization or in your personal life was your first instinct to reach out to god for his support the bible teaches us that the most prudent thing for us to do and the thing god implores us to do is reach out to him during our time of need there probably is no better figure to evaluate on leading during a crisis in the bible than moses time after time he faced difficult circumstances that he could only overcome with the help of god did he have doubts most certainly early on in exodus 31114 moses questioned how he could be expected to leadbut moses said to god who am i that i should go to pharaoh and bring the israelites out of egypt and god said i will be with you and this will be the sign to you that it is i who have sent you when you have brought the people out of egypt you will worship god on this mountain moses said to god suppose i go to the israelites and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me what is his name then what shall i tell them god said to moses i am who i am this is what you are to say to the israelites i am has sent me to you niv
but by the time the israelites had been led out of egypt and were about to be engaged by pharaoh by the sea near pi hahiroth it became obvious that moses understood the importance of believing in god when challenged by a crisis we see this clearly in 141014as pharaoh approached the israelites looked up and there were the egyptians marching after them they were terrified and cried out to the lord they said to moses was it because there were no graves in egypt that you brought us to the desert to die what have you done to us by bringing us out of egypt didnt we say to you in egypt leave us alone let us serve the egyptians it would have been better for us to serve the egyptians than to die in the desert moses answered the people do not be afraid stand firm and you will see the deliverance the lord will bring you today the egyptians you see today you will never see again the lord will fight for you you need only to be still niv
this education of moses to trust in god during difficult times is what leaders need today no matter the crisis or difficult circumstances that present themselves we must first believe in god and understand that he will be with us during any problem while it is difficult to first see thiseven moses was not convinced at firstit is imperative for leaders in todays world to live this way in order to improve the ability of their organizations to survive crises and to even thrive during such challenging timesthe story of moses reminds us that life can be difficult at times for us as individuals and as collective groups nowhere in the bible does god tell us that life will be easy we are told that we will have a better life in heaven but this implies that our life here on earth will have many struggles and crises for us to overcomethe main thing we should take away from this is that god is with us during a crisis and that he wants us to overcome the challenges presented to us one great example of this is seen in mark 435 where the disciples and jesus were threatened by a storm while at sea upon seeing waves breaking over the boat the disciples woke jesus and asked why he did not care if they drown jesus calmed the storm and then asked why the men still did not have faith in him this example shows us that even the disciples men who were close to jesus and witnessed him conduct countless miracles still had moments when they lost faith with this understanding it is not too difficult to see why leaders today can sometimes forget their faithwe read in the bible that god understands we will have difficult times and he wants us to succeed it is written in james 112 that blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because having stood the test that person will receive the crown of life that the lord has promised to those who love him niv god knows we will have challenges but he wants us to face them head-on and lead our organizations to success with him by our sidegod knows that life is imperfect and we see many examples in the bible that this is so what is perfect is our life beyond earth the first thing we need to understand is that god knows that there will be crises for us individually and in our organizations we need to trust that he will stand strong with us through these crises he wants us to succeed and has a plan for each of our organizations and for each us of personally of course like many things in our walk with god this is easier to say than for us to actually do accordingly we must stay rooted to our faith and be steadfast in our beliefsmuch like scholars have generally defined leadership and management as different entities crisis leadership and crisis management should be similarly treated as distinct from one another when looking at both concepts researchers generally regard crisis management as concentrating more on the distinct steps taken to respond to an individual crisis while crisis leadership is more concerned with enduring issues that come from leading during a crisis and how leaders can prepare their organizations to better handle these situations over an extended period of time mitroff 2011 klann 2003 explains the difference between crisis management and crisis leadership very welltraditionally books and articles about crisis management place a great deal of emphasis on management actions to be taken in preparation for a crisis this focus on management functions implies that you can prepare for a crisis by writing a plan and then executing it when the crisis occurs certainly an effective leader is competent in such functions as planning organizing staffing budgeting controlling and directing but a narrow emphasis on management strategy and planning ignores the leadership necessary for putting the plan into action that kind of approach sidesteps the human element that plays such a large role during a crisisthe needs emotions and behaviors of people at all levels of the organization p 27boin et al in couto 2010 describe the subtle difference between crisis management and crisis leadership in the following statement we should not assume that crises are simply bad news for leaders with crisis management focused purely on damage limitation both operationally and politically crises may also provide leaders with unique opportunities to discard old policies and commitments kick-start new ones reform public organizations and reshape the political landscape by forging new coalitions p 230prewitt and weil 2014 provide us with a good understanding of what it means to lead during a crisis instead of just reacting in an effort to simply manage the situationreactive leadership and crisis management have been synonymous for years this flows from the belief that crisis is unpredictable and unexpected which is simply not true crisis has its genesis in the values beliefs culture or behavior of an organization which become incongruent with the milieu in which the organization operates a leader who is able to read the signals of looming crisis and understands how to harness the exigency brought on by the situation can diminish the potential dangers and take full advantage of the resulting opportunities p 72
i believe we need to reframe how we look at crisis management compared to crisis leadership for years crisis management has been synonymous with general clean up and recovery operations in the leadership field we need to focus on crisis leadership since this connotes a definitive difference versus the simple management of a crisis and promotes leading with a broader and more holistic view of crises here the point is that the immediate clean up of and reaction to a crisis both fit much better in the definition of crisis management while the leader who uses the crisis to improve the organization can be seen as conducting crisis leadership this is not to say that crisis management is not important because it is definitely vital rather it is to say we need to prepare leaders to do more than manage the effects from such events
crisis management in short is not sufficient for the world we live in today we need the leaders of our organizations to do more than simply respond and react to crisis events while crisis management is concerned with how to respond in the short term after a crisis a crisis leader will be proactive and will prepare their organization for an event before one occurs furthermore a crisis leader will see how different crises connect and can be used to improve their organization over a long period of time table 22

pearson and clair 1998 framed organizational crisis as a low-probability high-impact event that threatens the viability of the organization and is characterize by ambiguity of cause effect and means of resolution as well as by a belief that decisions must be made swiftly this definition moves beyond the somewhat simple definitions of a crisis and adds to it the impact felt by the entire organization in terms of the ambiguity and stress and the role of the leader in guiding the process through sound decision-makingas long as there have been organizations and leaders there have been crises for them to overcome we see many examples of good and bad crisis leadership in every field imaginable such as the military government industrial and church fields just to name a few similar to the fact that the study of leadership is a relatively new discipline compared to many others the study of crisis leadership is also relatively new research in this specific area of leadership has burgeoned within the past 25 years due to the numerous large-scale crises we have seen during this period combined with the sharp increase in the speed that news travels due to the internet and social media whereas in the past we would have had to wait days or weeks to hear about a crisis and even longer before we could attempt to understand the role of the leader in the specific crisis now we know many of the specifics within moments after a crisis occurs in addition to providing access to more information this has also caused researchers as well as the general public to probe for information on the actions of leaders during these moments in order to better understand how their leadership style impacted the ultimate responsethe military has one of the longest histories with dealing with crisis response they have also been in the lead with their training for leaders on how to best respond when unexpected events occur the military tends to view crises as part of a much larger plan for battles campaigns and strategy they teach their commanders to understand how the crisis will impact the larger organization of the defense department and ultimately the nation as a wholethe business world has also begun to realize the importance of being prepared to respond during a crisis since one misstep here can lead to the end of a company if the response is not well thought out this increase in preparing business units has grown dramatically from the 1980s but so has the level and severity of the crises seen business continuity planning and crisis response plans are much more commonplace in medium and large-scale businesses than it was in the past lewis 2006 what is missing in most instances is a focus on leading throughout the crisis lifecycle what is missing in even more instances are leaders who lead from a christian perspective trusting in god to help them shepherd their organizations through such troubles this book is one effort to reinforce the value of living with christ through whatever happenscrisis leadership is important to both the student and the current leader it is important that we understand what a crisis is and what it might look like so that we are better able to detect one and put a plan into action while crisis management and crisis leadership may appear similar the differences are apparent when you see that crisis management is more concerned with the immediate recovery effort while crisis leadership looks at the enduring role of a leader before during and after the crisis the remainder of this book is intended to serve as a guide for leaders to incorporate their faith into their leadership as they stay faithful with the knowledge of what god has done what he can do and what he has promised to do several new ways of looking at crisis leadership from a christian perspective will also be presented and should serve to encourage continued thought and conversation on this important subject
a crisis is a fast-developing event that puts the organization at risk and forces it to actpersonal and organizational worldviews affect how crises are perceivedcrises are increasingly caused by events other than natural disasterscrisis leadership is more than simply leading an organization through the response to a crisisleaders should lean on their faith to make it through a crisis
as soon as theresa may resigned boris johnson was quick to announce he was standing for the party leadership giving him the key to downing street one source of strength was his ability to win votes as demonstrated by twice being elected mayor of greater london at a time when the conservatives were trailing in the opinion polls his campaigning skills made him appear a potential election winner when pitted against jeremy corbyn and nigel farage in the three years after johnsons shambolic first attempt to become prime minister his opposition to mays negotiations had established him as a committed adherent of brexitjohnson campaigned for the leadership with a do or die commitment to take the uk out of the european union echoing farages pledge to repair a broken political system johnson claimed that respecting the will of the referendum majority was fundamental to trust in democracy in doing so he created a bidding war in which his opponents were pressed to be just as hard or harder in their position on brexit his chief opponent foreign secretary jeremy hunt a late convert to brexit declared if we dont do what the people tell us to do were not a democracy sylvester 2019in the two-stage process for electing the conservative leader there were seven candidates in the initial round johnson came first with the votes of 114 of 313 conservative mps after other candidates were progressively eliminated in the fifth and final round he won the backing of 160 mps an absolute majority in the contest against hunt for the support of conservative party members johnson won 664 of the 139318 votes this made him not only party leader but also prime ministerthe legacy of theresa mays handling of brexit left the new prime minister facing formidable tasks internal disagreements in the conservative party meant that not only was there no withdrawal agreement acceptable to brussels but also there was not even a domestic foreign policy that is an agreed position among ministers and backbench conservative mps internal party divisions exacerbated the effect of being a minority government the governments standing with public opinion was even worse at the start of january 2019 the yougov poll gave the conservatives 41 support six points more than jeremy corbyns labour party after multiple defeats in the house of commons and the european parliament election when theresa may left office yougov showed the conservatives with only 19 tied for third with labour and behind the liberal democrats and the newly formed brexit party by the time that a new leader could be installed in downing street there would be only a few months before the uk was officially due to leave the european unionin keeping with his image as an english eccentric johnson was happy to be associated with cricket but once in downing street he made the name of the game hard ball instead of including mps of diverse views in his cabinet as theresa may had done he sacked 17 ministers and gave top jobs to mps who were committed to brexit when 21 conservative mps including former cabinet ministers broke ranks to support a measure that imposed constraints on his dealings with brussels johnson withdrew the party whip one of those pushed out mays chancellor of the exchequer wrote i no longer recognise this party of radicals hammond 2019 in his first appearance in the house of commons as prime minister johnson uncompromisingly pledged to fulfil his promise to the people to come out of the eu by 31 october with or without a dealwhereas theresa may gave parliament its power over brexit negotiations by losing a general election boris johnson was determined to take back control for downing street by calling a general election and winning an absolute majority of mps as long as he could convince brexit supporters to vote conservative and the remain vote was divided the first-past-the-post electoral system would convert a plurality of votes into the absolute majority he sought opinion polls were encouraging by the time parliament met in september after the summer recess polls showed the conservatives with a lead of 10 percentage points or more over labour and the brexit party relegated to fourth placea cross-party majority of mps was fearful that in eagerness to meet his self-imposed deadline for withdrawal by 31 october johnson would accept britain leaving the eu without a deal to prevent this happening parliament approved an act requiring the prime minister to ask the eu for an extension of the date of withdrawal to 31 january 2020 if parliament had not approved a withdrawal deal by johnsons do or die deadline cf walker 2019 johnson called this measure a surrender act because he saw the threat to leave without a deal as putting pressure on brussels to make concessions rather than a powder keg that could blow up and damage the british economyin an attempt to prevent the house of commons from imposing constraints on downing streets dealings with brussels johnson promptly prorogued parliament so that it would not meet for six weeks the reason he gave was that the new government needed time to prepare measures to introduce in the new session of parliament opponents of johnsons leave strategy filed suits in scottish and uk courts to annul his action on 24 september the uk supreme court unanimously ruled that johnsons decision was unlawful a retired supreme court justice explained the courts upholding the supreme legitimacy of parliament against johnsons constitutional vandalism the courts decision did treat the referendum as a source of legitimacy sumption 2019boris johnson sought to escape the constraint that parliament had imposed on his goal of leaving the eu in october by securing a last-minute compromise deal with brussels he hoped to sell it both to soft-brexit mps by saying it met their priority of avoiding leaving the eu without any deal and to hard-brexit mps by claiming it met their demand to take britain out of the euthe change of british prime ministers left the policy of brussels unchanged jean-claude juncker the president of the european commission declared that there was no scope for renegotiating the deal that brussels had agreed with theresa may and the british parliament had rejected three times he called it the best and only agreement possible michel barnier the eus chief negotiator for brexit dismissed johnsons fresh proposals for withdrawal as a combative and unacceptable demand the irish taoiseach leo varadkar described new proposals for a border between northern ireland and the republic as not in the real world leaked whitehall files showed that if britain left the eu without a deal at the date of johnsons self-imposed deadline there would be substantial and immediate disruptions to trade industry and the health service eu leaders assumed that johnson would live up to his reputation for flexibility by agreeing a deal within the eus red lines and then sell it to parliament
the withdrawal agreement that johnson reached with the eu on 17 october differed little from the three points in the ill-fated agreement with theresa may the uk still had to pay tens of billions of pounds to meet its pre-existing financial commitments to the union and there was little alteration in provisions for protecting the rights of eu citizens in britain and british citizens living in eu states the agreement removed a backstop ensuring the border for trade between northern ireland and the republic of ireland was kept open on conditions set by the eu johnson had branded the backstop as anti-democratic and presented its removal as a triumph to pacify hard-brexit mps however the border arrangement he agreed tothe introduction of a check on internal trade between great britain and northern irelandhad previously been described by may as something no british prime minister could accept and by johnson as inconsistent with the sovereignty of the ukthe series of votes that followed in the house of commons led to an impasse on 19 october in the first saturday sitting of the commons in more than a third of a century the commons approved by 322 votes to 306 a motion by conservative mp oliver letwin to delay approval of his new agreement and force the prime minister to fulfil his obligation under the benn act to request a further delay in withdrawal until 31 january johnson did so by sending brussels the act of parliament requesting delay on a plain sheet of paper without his signature and simultaneously sending a signed letter stating why he thought delay undesirable the following tuesday johnson won an initial vote approving his deal in principle however mps showed their distrust of the prime ministers plan to refuse parliament time to scrutinise it in detail by rejecting his timetable for rushing enactment to meet his end of october deadlinejohnson sought to overcome mps repeated rejection of his proposals by calling an election in the belief that voters would return a pro-brexit majority in the new parliament however the fixed-term parliaments act of 2011 frustrated johnsons proposal to call an early election before 2022 each time the government proposed an early contest it failed to meet the acts requirement that calling an early election required the positive support of two-thirds of all mps the labour party was unwilling to co-operate in triggering an election arguing that brexit should be settled before a fresh election was held moreover opinion polls indicated that the conservatives had a fair chance of winning an absolute majority over labourto get what he wanted johnson introduced a fresh bill to hold an election on 12 december because no parliament can bind its successor it overrode the earlier fixed-term parliaments act and only required a majority of mps votes to secure adoption this was achieved by division among the opposition parties while labour was fearful of a popular vote the bill was supported by the scottish national party which rightly saw this as an opportunity to gain seats and by the leader of the chief pro-remain party the liberal democrats who wrongly saw an election as an opportunity to gain enough seats to eject johnson from downing street and install a government that would reverse the referendum decision the election bill was fast-tracked through the commons and approved on 30 october the day before johnson was due to die in a metaphorical ditch in his own words because of failing to deliver brexit by then it was also the day on which a yougov opinion poll reported the conservatives enjoying a 15 lead over labourrunning a general election with the slogan get brexit done replicated the simple emotional appeal that his chief adviser dominic cummings had used to win the brexit referendum it also played to johnsons journalistic ability to frame issues in simple headline terms it was designed not only to appeal to those who had voted to leave the eu three years earlier but also to others who accepted the authority of a referendum and were tired of endless indecision in westminster labours ambivalent policy could only be framed in terms of yes but we want to leave on much better terms or no but if second referendum produces another majority for leaving the eu we will respect it getting brexit done appealed to a significant bloc of voters who saw a hung parliament as worrying depressing or despairing moreover by an 11-percentage-point margin voters saw a labour government led by jeremy corbyn as a worse outcome than leaving the european union ashcroft 2019the brexit slogan was used to counterattack the big spending policies that labour promised to end what it described as nine years of economic austerity when social policies were raised with johnson he would typically argue that after brexit the uk would no longer be contributing billions of pounds a year to the eu budget and this money could be spent on improving health care education and other popular services as a form of political rhetoric it linked the partys pro-brexit stance with support for popular social policies johnson was correct to emphasise that after paying a 39 billion divorce bill to the eu the uk would no longer have to make a 13 billion annual contribution as well but from a public finance point of view the statement omitted many relevant facts such as the billions of pounds that eu programmes paid to british institutions and farmersframing the election in terms of the people vs parliament was a contradiction in terms of the theory of representative democracy because they depend on each other see chapter 101007978-3-030-44117-31 members of parliament need popular votes to get elected and re-elected likewise the people need mps to decide which party forms a government and to monitor the activities of government on their behalf ironically eurosceptic conservative mps had used their position in parliament to force the brexit referendum on a prime minister who saw no popular demand for such a voteclaiming to speak for the people with a capital p against the political elite is a textbook strategy of populist party leaders they charge members of parliament and government ministers with being a self-interested class who do not care for what ordinary people think mudde and kaltwasser 2017 there is substantial empirical evidence that the political elite are seen as unresponsive by the people they represent table 101007978-3-030-44117-31 britons tend to have a low level of trust in institutions of representative government such as parties and parliament and 74 see a majority of politicians as ready to say one thing to get elected and then do the opposite once in office rose and wessels 2019 table 1
for an eton- and oxford-educated classical scholar to speak for the people against the elite appears paradoxical but from johnsons point of view it is a means of intimidating a parliament that had imposed checks on what he wants his government to do and on judges said to be making decisions that conduct politics by another means the conservative party manifesto 2019 48 promised to set up a constitution democracy  rights commission that will examine these issues in depth and come up with proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operatesby contrast with the tightly controlled and focused campaign led by boris johnson the opposition was divided into multiple parties they differed about whether to settle for a soft brexit or to demand a second referendum that could reverse the decision of the narrow majority to leave the eu in the first referendumthe labour party wanted to avoid the issue of brexit because its labour mps in the london area tended to represent constituencies that had voted to remain in the eu while labour mps in the north of england had voted to leave jeremy corbyn viewed the eu as a capitalist institution imposing austerity on europe a majority of labour mps lacked confidence in corbyns fitness to be prime minister in a parliamentary labour party vote of confidence after the 2016 referendum 197 labour mps voted no confidence in corbyns leadership and only 40 supported him johnsons personal reputation for untruthfulness was offset by corbyns disdain for traditional english values and reliance on support from a marxist and trotskyite coterie associated with undemocratic regimes and left-wing anti-semitesconservative campaigners saw the labour leader jeremy corbyn as an electoral asset second only to brexit yougov surveys supported this view in a pre-election poll 59 considered corbyn unsuitable to be a party leader while boris johnson also had a negative rating among the electorate by comparison with the labour leader he was the lesser evil when lord ashcrofts final pre-election poll asked about the worst election result 48 said it would be a labour government under jeremy corbyn as against 38 saying leaving the european union would be worsethe logic of the first-past-the-post electoral system recommended that opposition parties make electoral pacts so that there would only be one anti-brexit candidate in each constituency by successfully putting pressure on nigel farage to withdraw his partys candidates from conservative-held seats to get brexit done the conservatives assured themselves of the pro-brexit vote however major political and personal differences between parties and their leaders prevented electoral pacts being agreed that would consolidate the anti-brexit vote in a way that might have prevented johnson gaining a parliamentary majorityopponents of brexit had no inhibition about voting tactically and campaigners for a second referendum to reverse brexit placed loyalty to their referendum cause above party loyalties they set up a number of websites offering advice about which anti-brexit party had the best chance of unseating a sitting conservative mps recommendations were based on a mixture of sources such as the constituency voting patterns census data and surveys given differences in data and interpretation tactical voting websites sometimes disagreed about which party had the best chance of winning a seat for the anti-brexit sidewhile the conservative party was consistently ahead of labour in opinion polls during the campaign there was uncertainty about whether johnson would win an absolute majority or end up heading the biggest party in a hung parliament two of the three preceding conservative victories had involved a hung parliament and this had stopped theresa may from delivering brexit on schedule see chapter 101007978-3-030-44117-311 if boris johnson had won a plurality rather than a majority of seats he would have been challenged to form a cross-party alliance to deliver brexit since every other party had rejected his brexit deal nor were other parties inclined to back a minority labour government under jeremy corbyn to resolve the brexit deadlock without a government in place britain was scheduled to leave the eu without a deal on 31 january 2020the first-past-the-post electoral system disposed of the threat of a hung parliament it turned the conservatives plurality of 436 of the popular vote into 561 of seats in the house of commons table 121 winning 365 seats gave the conservatives a majority of 80 seats over opposition parties which were divided on many issues this was the conservatives biggest parliamentary majority since 1987 since labour won only 202 seats the conservative government now enjoys a 163-seat lead over the official opposition
voting at the constituency and regional levels tended to follow a division between places where a majority had voted to leave or remain in the eu in the 2016 referendum thus the conservative party did worst in the two strongholds of remain voters in scotland it lost 31 of its previous share of the vote and seven seats and in london it lost 11 of its previous vote and one seat to labour the party did best in the industrial midlands its vote went up 42 and it gained 16 seats in the north east helped by the brexit party taking most of its votes from labour supporters the conservatives won seven seats that had not gone tory for generations or ever including tony blairs old constituency as in the 2016 british referendum these regional differences showed that while london had a more cosmopolitan and prosperous electorate the north of england had more votes and mps see chapter 101007978-3-030-44117-35collectively the oppositions share of the vote was 12 percentage points greater than that of the conservatives but its vote was split table 121 the labour partys claim to be the only party capable of displacing boris johnson from downing street was offset by being ambivalent about whether it would deliver a softer brexit or a referendum that would keep britain in the eu jeremy corbyns policy was to negotiate a soft brexit but to remain neutral and let voters decide whether to accept it or vote to remain in the eu after all the seven parties unambiguously committed to the euthe scottish nationalists the liberal democrats plaid cymru the greens and three northern ireland partieswon only 22 of the vote and 74 seatswhile the brexit party had won more than three times the conservative vote in the ep election seven months earlier johnsons get brexit done policy was critical to the conservative partys rapid recovery of the brexit vote see table 101007978-3-030-44117-35 because the december election was about who governs the conservatives were the only choice for people who had voted to leave the eu in 2016 and wanted to get brexit done among that group the conservatives gained 73 of the vote and only 4 went to the brexit party table 122
the remain vote fragmented among parties offering a variety of alternatives for dealing with the referendum vote for brexit and no party received a majority of the remain vote labours policy of renegotiating a withdrawal with brussels and then calling a second referendum that might reverse brexit gained it less than half the vote of the remain supporters if it had been able to get as big a share of the remain vote as the conservatives did of the leave vote this would have deprived boris johnson of a majority and created a hung parliamentboris johnsons strategic gamble has given him a majority of conservative mps committed to getting brexit done on his terms neither david cameron john major nor edward heath had ever managed to command an unquestioning majority of tories in favour of britains participation in the european union johnsons expulsion of 21 mps who voted against no deal removed conservative mps favouring a soft or no brexit none of the rebels who sought re-election as independents or liberal democrats gained a seat in the new house a cautionary warning to re-elected conservative mps the 109 new conservative mps were committed followers johnson had taken the unusual precaution of having every candidate pledge to support a downing street deal with brussels their lack of parliamentary experience makes them particularly dependent on advice from johnsons whips the prime ministers power to make appointments to more than 100 government posts offers an incentive not to question the governments eu policythe formal departure of the uk from the european union is the end of the beginning it also marks the start of negotiations for a political agreement between the uk and the eu that covers what the withdrawal bill leaves out about britains future relationship with the european union paradoxically withdrawal from the eu gives the uk the freedom to negotiate new relations with the rest of the world while simultaneously requiring it reach a mutual agreement with brussels governing its new relationship with the eu as french president emmanuel macron commented on the day britain left the eu you may be leaving the eu but you are not leaving europeeu negotiators have had years of experience of dealing with britain as a member state while the public statements of david cameron theresa may and boris johnson have shown ignorance of how the eu works and ignored informed advice from british officials about how a national government can influence the eus multi-national policy-making process rogers 2019 the disparity in knowledge is most extreme in trade matters since whitehall has had a minimum of trade officials since responsibility for trade was transferred to brussels when the uk joined the eu in 1973 british public opinion agrees with eu negotiators in the evaluation of brexit negotiations whether the prime minister was boris johnson or theresa may in the year leading up to the uks departure from the eu from 70 to 87 of yougov respondents thought the government was handling brexit badlythe symbolism of national sovereignty has been an end in itself for brexit campaigners it gives westminster the power to diverge from eu laws and regulations that affect national policies on trade goods and services working conditions aid to industry and immigration the uk regains the freedom to make new trade deals with the united states china and other countries to replace existing trade agreements that the eu has negotiated with these countries on behalf of britain when it was an eu member state however new trade agreements can only be arrived at by the uk compromising some of its conditions in exchange for the benefits the agreement should bringthe future terms of uk-eu trade are central to the politics of the political agreement for the conservative government maintaining access to eu markets for manufactured goods produced the north of england where the party gained many mps from labour in 2019 is a major priority maintaining eu access for the financial services of the city of london is important because of its disproportionate contribution to the countrys gross domestic product and revenue five continental countries want to maintain their access to offshore uk fishing rights british exports to the eu account for almost half of the uks total exports whereas eu exports to britain account for a small share of the eus global exports brexit is almost certain to reduce trade negotiations will set the rules that determine how large or small that may be the treasury has estimated the conservative governments goal of restricting an agreement to avoid tariffs and quotas on goods could lower economic growth about 5 in 15 years that is about one-quarter of one percent per annum cf chapter 101007978-3-030-44117-39
the eu wants future trade negotiations with britain to maintain a level playing field that is british goods and services should meet the same regulatory standards that the uk met when it was an eu member state since eu regulations are currently evolving in such fields such as environmental protection and data handling british businesses should comply with future regulations too to ensure compliance the british government would need to agree to the eu regulations being judicially enforced from a westminster point of view aligning the british economy with eu regulations and accepting european courts would undermine the purpose of brexit taking back control of british laws
the johnson government wants the eu to accept the mutual equivalence of regulations that would lead to same outcome even if they are not identical in content this would allow gradual divergence between britain and eu economies in ways that westminster believes would increase british competitiveness and that the eu fears would do so by undercutting eu standards it also wants to avoid giving the eu an effective means of enforcing equivalence this would allow the eu to make a unilateral judgement that british regulations were not equivalent to eu standards thereby reducing eu imports from britainin order to prevent the departure of the uk from harming integration the eu does not want to allow a post-brexit britain to cherry-pick that is enjoy the same relationship as it had as a member state while being free of obligations a senior eu policy-maker has described the british position as before they were in the eu with lots of opt-outs now they are out and want a lot of opt-ins quoted in fleming et al 2019 the president of the european commission ursula von der leyen 2019 told the european parliament its the choice of the uk how far they want to align with the eu or divergeboris johnson shortened the time to complete a political agreement that regulates what comes after brexit by making another do-or-die pledge to end the process by 31 december 2020 if this deadline is not extended and no agreement can be reached brexit ends with no deal thereby maximising the effect of breaking links developed in the 47 years in which the uk was a member of the european union in accepting the british deadline eu officials have cautioned that it makes likely a bare-bones political agreement that minimises the extent to which benefits can be secured the coronavirus crisis which has frustrated negotiations gives him reason to seek an extension given johnsons houdini-like skill in dealing with promises he could alter his position to take into account brussels red lines alternatively to meet his self-imposed deadline he could emulate candide and tell parliament that whatever agreement he reaches with brussels will deliver the best of all possible brexits in the best of all possible worlds a third option would be to invoke the spirit of dunkirk and claim that no deal is better than surrender to the demands of a united european unionthe current coronavirus covid-19 outbreak is spreading rapidly first reported in china in december 2019 the virus has indiscriminately infected people all over the country with many dying from the infection the chinese attempt to limit the spread by locking down the entire city of wuhan was initially perceived by the rest of the world as simply a chinese emergency to read about in the news however such a perception could not have been more wrong never before have connections and movements of people between countries been so frequent the idea that this emergency would remain within the boundaries of a chinese drama was a mere fantasyas of 11 march the virus has spread to more than 100 countries1 resulting in thousands of deaths although rigorous restrictions in wuhan contained the spread on 11 march the who declared the covid-19 outbreak to be a pandemic and that europe had become its new epicentre italy especially the northern region of the country has been severely affected and is currently reporting the largest outbreak in europe as of march 15 the protezione civile has confirmed 24 747 total cases since the beginning of the outbreak with 1809 deaths of which 1218 have been in lombardy2
despite the containment measures enforced by the italian government since march 8 to minimise the risk of infected people transmitting the virus to healthy ones limiting the spread is a significant challenge as symptoms associated with the new coronavirus are extremely nuanced and thus hard to identify promptly some people are infectious and contagious without showing any symptoms others may show symptoms similar toand thus misleadingly overlapping withseasonal influenza whose peak is concomitant while the most severe cases develop acute respiratory conditions that require intensive care unit icu admission although only a few of those infected require icu the burden on the italian national healthcare system is unprecedented of approximately 5200 existing icu beds in italy 1028 are already dedicated to patients with covid-19 as of 11 march and the need for more icu beds is likely to further increase rapidly as recent research in the lancet claims3 in this scenario demand for critical care in the northern region of italy currently exceeds its supply raising significant ethical concerns in the processadvances in the medical field have progressively shifted the limits of the possible by providing our society with extremely sophisticated treatments yet this high level of healthcare is expensive and it comes with the unfortunate side effect of scarcity when resources are scarce in relation to potential demand they have to be allocated by following strict prioritisation criteriathat is someone will be left without there are many kinds of scarce resources some of which are life-saving which means those who do not access them will not survivethis is exactly the current italian situation the rampant spread of covid-19 in italy requires in severe cases massive admission of patients with acute respiratory infection to icus icu beds are extremely expensive and thus limited they are scarce resources the more patients require icu assistance the fewer beds are available and some will have no chance of icu admissionthat is with no chance of survival in the northern area of italy where the healthcare system is currently under unprecedented strain intensive care specialists are facing overwhelming decisions about who should be provided with ventilationdecisions that have to be taken in the knowledge that those not admitted to icus will very likely die in allocating resources in these scenarios professionals are considering prioritising those most likely to survive over those with remote chances of survivalthe news that prioritisation criteria were being applied in italian hospitals in relation to the current outbreak sparked widespread controversy aroused great resentment and triggered a debate at both public and institutional levels about the right of every individual to access healthcarethe emergency that italy is currently facing amounts to an unprecedented clinical humanitarian ethical and financial crisis yet ethical concerns related to scarce resources allocation are far from extraordinary which does not make them any less challenging in the current pandemic the recent history of medicine is rife with similar quandaries our society has indeed been confronted with such issues several times in the past including in the very recent pastin 1960 belding scribner a physician at the seattle artificial kidney centre assisted by the engineer wayne quentin invented the shunt to make chronic dialysis feasible4 this changed the lives of many patients yet the success of this operation rapidly showed its negative side the treatment was extremely expensive and had limited funding the nine-bed capacity of seattle center was not able to meet the demands of the numerous patients waiting for dialysis in order to allocate this kind of life-saving scarce resource the board of trustees of the king county medical society envisioned two different committees to select candidates the first committee comprising physicians would select patients by focusing on their medical and psychiatric condition on this basis the second committee composed of various people including a lawyer a businessman a homemaker among others would make the final selection based on a case-by-case evaluation of economic psychological and social factors they evaluated age background education past performance and future potential4 in order to decide who shall live and who shall diesuch prioritisation for scarce resources allocation is not confined to the past although different in many aspects organs are examples of life-saving scarce resources every day patients on waiting lists for transplants experience the unfortunate effects of prioritisation criteria for allocation in italy organs are assigned according to an algorithm that reflects several parameters the state of severity of the pathology for which the transplant is needed compatibility blood type age and waiting time on the list5 against this backdrop of scarce resources younger patients in need might be prioritised over the elderly healthcare professionals have to make a case-by-case evaluation in order to establish whether a patient is more urgently in need of treatment than another one even if the latter patient arrived first waiting patients die because the need for organs does not meet the supply so resources cannot be provided to all those in need and when the demand exceeds the supply imposition of prioritisation criteria inevitably means that some are left withoutthe coronavirus outbreak constitutes a major emergency the implications of scarce resources allocation are devastating to cope with yet it should be kept in mind that their application is not unprecedented the unfamiliarity of the outbreak that europe is currently experiencing should not disorient our historical perspective and the new framework by which prioritisation criteria for scarce resources allocation are currently being enforced should not lead us to perceive them as something new rather prioritisation reflects established practices that have long regulated the distribution of finite resources when demand happens to exceed supply the uniqueness of this outbreak lies in the extraordinarily high number of individuals likely to be impacted by allocation criteria the effects of prioritisation are now being experienced by an entire nation rather than by a finite group of people such as in the case of patients and their families awaiting organ transplantswhat is extraordinary is that high-income countries are not prepared to experience such an intense rationing of resources when it comes to life-saving assistance yet we all logically understand that when resources are not enough for everybodycruel though this isnot everyone can be saved this is something we already knowwe just try to forget about itwhen there is a shortage of resources the formal principle of justice which states that equals should be treated equally and that unequals should be treated unequally is frequently invoked6 this principle raises significant concerns however it seems fair that equals deserve equal treatments but each of us has very different characteristics and these cannot be ignored which traits define equality and which traits do not in other words how far does the meaning of equal extend in italy everyone is equally entitled to the right to access healthcare services this means that on informed consent everyone is offered the best available care yet even in normal practice protocols differ according to different conditions and the different clinical and physiological profiles of patients when patients present the same medical condition factors such as age comorbidity gender and severity of the disease have an impact on the specific protocols that physicians follow since equals should be treated equally it is unequal to treat unequals equally therefore although there is a right for everyone to be treated it is not feasible to ignore contingent medical and biological characteristics that inevitably make one patient different from the other and which have a significant impact on the outcome of care if these differences are relevant in standard clinical practice they acquire an even greater impact in an emergency characterised by a scarcity of resources such as that created by covid-19prioritisation does not mean that one life is more valuable than another as all lives are equally valuable but when resources are not enough to save all those in need prioritisation involves allocating resources such that they are more likely to save the most lives this method allows priority treatment of those who are more likely to benefit from the scarce resourceadmission to an icu in this caseand to recover quickly with a positive outcome which in turn allows the next in line to benefit from the treatment in questiona key concept in healthcare pertains to preventing suffering and harm in such an emergency situation as in other circumstances in which there is a scarcity of resources it is unfortunately not possible to avoid harm at all the effort is to reduce itthe ethical implications of scarce resources allocation are in the spotlight in the current covid-19 pandemic italy is currently facing severe challenges with demand for icu admission far exceeding the capacity of the healthcare system and as the virus spreads globally many other countries are likely to face the same emergency prioritisation criteria enforced by healthcare professionals in italy have exacerbated tensions and triggered intense debates about the principle that everyone has the right to access healthcare yet the reality is that along with reduced availability of resources physicians may be forced to choose whose life to save by deciding who to admit to an icuthe novelty of this emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation which is rife in past and present clinical practice rather it has to do with the extraordinary numbers of peoplecurrently an entire nationwho find themselves personally affected by such implications and who suddenly realise that the principle of equals should be treated equally is rife with controversy but this aspect is not new it is simply something that people have tried to ignorethere is an undeniable and urgent need for a more competent distribution of financial resources within the country in order to adequately sustain and support the healthcare system emergencies like that created by covid-19 underline more than ever the pressing need to increase substantially the resources dedicated to the healthcare system so that as far as possible physicians do not have to make the difficult decision of whose lives to save yet a realistic analysis suggests that for all that necessary funds can be earmarked there will continue to be situations in which extremely difficult choices pertaining scarce resources allocation will have to be made for instance organs are resources whose availability cannot be increased by any additional fundingwithin this scenario an ethical approach to healthcare choices assumes high importance the intersection between ethics and medicine is indisputable and the contribution of an ethical perspective is both relevant and essential healthcare professionals forced to make decisions about resources allocation should not rely solely on their medical background their undergraduate and graduate education should be rigorously implemented with a grounding in medical ethics this implementation should be flanked by the solid presence of medical ethics consultants in healthcare structures to support the evaluations and decisions of healthcare professionals the burden of choicethe implications of which concern us allcan no longer be put on healthcare professionals shoulders now more than ever there has to be a rigorous and adequate implementation of medical ethics in healthcarerabies virus is an example of a virus for which bats are an important reservoir although we think of rabies as being primarily associated with canines such as dogs and other mammals such as skunks and raccoons and these animals do serve as important reservoirs for rabies that enter the human population bats are also an important reservoir in fact in the united states over the last few years the majority of human cases of rabies have been bat-associated rabies in some of these cases of bat rabies in humans exposure to bats is documented and the bite of infected bats is known to have transmitted the virus but in other cases there is no known contact with bats leading to the suggestion that inhaling aspirated droplets containing rabies may be the cause of the infectionin south america vampire bats which feed on the blood of mammals after biting them with their sharp incisors have been an important vector in the spread of rabies to livestock and humans this has resulted in campaigns to indiscriminately slaughter bats using a variety of methods including poison and the destruction of roosts and caves with explosives although these campaigns have resulted in enormous numbers of bats being killed these campaigns have had no effect on the spread of rabies thus reduction of bat numbers is not effective in the control of rabies but does destroy ecologically important animalsthe various bat lyssaviruses which can also cause rabies in humans were described in chapter 4 although only a few human cases are known that arose from infection by these viruses they have the potential to spread more widely further bites or scratches from bats need to be treated as potential exposure to rabies and treated accordingly this is expensive and in effect only available in developed countriesin september of 1994 a number of cases of severe respiratory illness occurred in racehorses near brisbane australia the first horse to become ill was a pregnant mare that was pastured in a field which was then moved into a stable with 23 other thoroughbreds the disease spread among the horses in this stable and to an adjoining stable and ultimately 17 horses became ill of which 13 died of the four horses that survived two were left with mild neurological sequelae three other horses were infected but did not suffer symptoms two humans that nursed the horses became ill with a severe respiratory disease of whom one died of respiratory and kidney failure spread of the disease required close contact and imposition of quarantine measures contained the outbreak a previously unknown virus was isolated from the sick animals that was found to be a paramyxovirus and it was initially named equine morbillivirus sequencing of the genome showed that it was not closely related to the morbilliviruses however and the virus was assigned to a new genus called megamyxovirus because of the large size of the genome subsequent studies established that the virus was a bat virus and widespread in flying foxes in eastern australia the virus was renamed hendra virus after the brisbane suburb where the outbreak occurred and the genus was renamed henipavirus analysis of sera from healthy humans and horses in the area failed to detect the presence of antibody and analysis of more than 5000 sera from a variety of wild animals trapped in the areas also failed to detect antibody in any animal other than flying foxes flying foxes can be readily infected experimentally with the virus but do not suffer illness upon infectiona second outbreak of hendra virus began in august 1994 about 1000km north of brisbane two horses died and the owner of the horses became mildly ill with neurological symptoms from which he appeared to recover however in october of 1995 the owner suffered a relapse and died of encephalitis at this point an investigation showed that hendra virus was to blame for the illness of the horses and the death of the owner in january 1999 a fatal case of hendra infection occurred in a horse near cairns australia and in 2004 a horse died of hendra infection in townsville in the 2004 incident the veterinarian who attended the horse was infected but recovered after a mild illnessextensive studies of flying foxes have shown that hendra virus is present in all four species of flying fox that occur in australia almost half of flying foxes have been found to have antibodies to the virus so it is widespread and common it is only rarely transmitted to other animals however at least to date as shown by the extensive serological studies and the limited occurrence of clinical illness caused by the virus in humans and their horsesa related virus 83 identical to hendra virus at the amino acid level emerged in 1998 that represents a much more serious threat to human health from september 1998 to april 1999 an outbreak of 258 cases of human encephalitis occurred in malaysia and singapore that had a 40 mortality rate clinical symptoms included fever headache myalgia muscle aches drowsiness and disorientation that sometimes progressed to coma within 48 hours the disease was associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs with or without neurological symptoms and humans infected with the disease were pig farmers or others closely associated with pig farming it was first thought that the outbreak was due to infection by japanese encephalitis je virus see chapter 3 on the importance of pigs as amplifying hosts for this virus and the malaysian government vaccinated 24 million pigs against je virus when this did not slow the epidemic 11 million pigs were culled in an attempt to reduce the incidence of disease in march 1999 with the assistance of the centers for disease control and prevention the virus responsible for the epidemic was identified as a hendra-like virus a virus related to but distinct from hendra virus retrospective studies suggested that the virus had been responsible for disease in pigs in malaysia for several years and it seems clear that the human cases were contracted from pigs there is no evidence for human-to-human transmission in this outbreak the virus responsible has been called nipah virus after the village in malaysia where the disease first appeared and it is classified as a second member of the genus henipavirus which gets its name from hendra and nipah viruseslike hendra virus the reservoir of nipah virus is flying foxes and the virus has been isolated from flying foxes in the area it has been suggested that the outbreak occurred in part because the destruction of the natural habitat of the flying foxes caused by deforestation and consequent food shortage led the bats to forage in nearby orchards located very near piggeries there half-eaten fruit or regurgitated fruit that was contaminated with virus-containing saliva from the bats could be eaten by pigs causing them to become infectedmore recent epidemics of nipah virus encephalitis have occurred in southern asia epidemics in bangladesh occurred in 2001 2003 2004 and 2005 no evidence for the intermediate infection of an animal as occurred in the malaysian epidemic has been seen in these epidemics furthermore in the 2004 epidemic evidence was obtained that person-to-person transmission of the virus had occurred it is likely that the disease was transmitted directly from bats to humans possibly by human consumption of partially eaten fruit that was contaminated with bat saliva containing the virus followed by person-to-person transmission it is known in bangladesh for example that during the fruiting season young boys climb trees to pick fruit if this fruit was partially eaten by bats the fruit could be contaminated with the virus from the bat the fatality rate in these epidemics was as high as 75 in nearby india an epidemic of nipah occurred in 2001 flying foxes are widely distributed throughout this area fig 81 and nipah virus has been isolated from them in both malaysia and bangladash the virus has also been isolated from flying foxes in cambodia although human infection has not been documented to datethe very wide distribution of hendra and nipah viruses the possibility of person-to-person transmission and the increasing contacts between humans and their domestic animals with fruit bats carrying the virus suggests that epidemics will continue to occur as indicated for rabies eradication of the bats is neither desirable nor feasible however simple solutions exist to reduce the contacts of humans and their animals with the bats such as not locating fruit orchards near piggeriesrecent studies have shown that the sars virus a coronavirus had to adapt to human receptors in order to cause severe illness infection by the bat virus or the civet virus appears to cause only mild illness as stated before merchants who were infected did not develop illness and some persons who work with wildlife were found to be seropositive for sars but suffered no illness however several changes are present in the virulent sars virus isolated from humans there is a deletion of 29 nucleotides upstream of the start codon for the n protein and there are four amino acid changes in the spike protein it is believed that the crucial changes are two amino acid changes in the spike protein that allow the virus to bind to the human receptor called ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 1000-fold more avidly than does the civet strain or the bat strain this is perhaps the reason why the virus has not to date reappeared in the human population together with extensive culling of animals in the food markets in china if occasional human cases occur they are likely to be mild unless the virus has the opportunity to mutate in humans to form the virulent strain of the virus however this did happen in 2002 and may happen again in the future there is need to develop vaccines or antiviral treatments for the virus as well as to maintain the chinese food markets in a way that does not encourage the spread of the virusthe ace2 protein is highly conserved among mammals and it is perhaps surprising that one of the few amino acid differences in the human form of this protein occurs in the virus-binding site and causes such a change in the ability of sars to utilize ace2 as a receptor in view of the fact that to become virulent the virus must mutate to bind more strongly to the human form of the ace2 protein it is interesting that there is a second receptor for sars virus the protein called cd209l or l-sign why this second receptor cannot compensate for the failure of unmodified sars to infect humans efficiently is unknown it may be significant that another human coronavirus nl63 only recently discovered also uses ace2 as its receptor other coronaviruses use different receptors including aminopeptidase n also called cd13 by the human coronavirus 229e transmissible gastroenteritus virus of swine and feline infectious peritonitis virus and carcinoembryonic antigens by mouse hepatitis virusit is noteworthy that at least one other coronavirus as yet unnamed circulates in bats belonging to the genus miniopterus in miniopterus pusillus more than 60 of the bats were found to be positive for this virus this virus is distinct from the sars virus it belongs to group 1 coronaviruses whereas sars belongs to group 2 coronaviruses this new virus is not known to infect humans or to cause diseasesars is a zoonotic disease of humans caused by a coronavirus it is of interest that human coronavirus hcov oc43 also appears to have a zoonotic source it is very similar to a virus of cattle bovine coronavirus bcov from studies of the rate that mutations have been fixed in these viruses it has been estimated that the virus entered the human population around 1890the filoviruses first came to the attention of science in 1967 when outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever occurred in marburg and frankfurt germany and in belgrade yugoslavia the cause was a virus subsequently named marburg that was present in african green monkeys imported from uganda whose kidneys were being processed for cell culture production for use in preparing poliovirus vaccine twenty-five laboratory workers were infected and six secondary cases resulted of these 31 infected people 7 died the monkeys in the shipment which originated in uganda also died subsequent studies with the virus isolated during the outbreak showed that it caused lethal illness in african green monkeys following experimental infection there were 3 cases of marburg in south africa in 1975 the source of infection was probably zimbabwe with one death 2 cases in kenya in 1980 infection probably in uganda 1 case in kenya in 1987 an outbreak of 149 cases with 123 deaths in zaire now the democratic republic of congo in 19982000 and an outbreak of 374 cases with 329 deaths in northern angola in 2005 the number of cases is surely underreported since many people in remote areas do not seek medical assistance when ill and counting of new graves in such locations indicates that the death toll is higher than officially reported the locations of these outbreaks are shown on the map in fig 83
 the reported fatality rate in the larger outbreaks was 8090ebola virus was first isolated during a 1976 epidemic of severe hemorrhagic fever in zaire and sudan and named for a river in the region during this epidemic the more than 600 cases resulted in 430 deaths and asymptomatic infection appeared to be rare one case of ebola occurred in 1977 and in 1979 there were 34 cases with 22 deaths in the sudan in this latter epidemic an index case was brought to the hospital and the virus spread to four people there who then spread it to their families after this ebola disease in africa disappeared until 1994 in late 1994 a swiss ethologist working in the ivory coast performed necropsies on chimps she contracted ebola but survived and a new strain of ebola was isolated from her blood then in may 1995 there was an epidemic in kikwit zaire that resulted in at least 315 cases with 75 mortality this was followed by several deaths in western africa that resulted from consumption of a monkey that had died of ebola then there was a prolonged series of smaller outbreaks in gabon from 1995 through 1997 in 2000 ebola appeared in uganda for the first time and caused an epidemic of more than 425 cases there have been further outbreaks in 2002 2003 2004 and 2005 in various countries including gabon the democratic republic of congo and sudan a map showing these various filoviral outbreaks is shown in fig 83 three strains or species of african ebola viruses are now recognized which differ in their virulence zaire ebolavirus is the most virulent with a case fatality rate approaching 90 sudan ebolavirus is less virulent and ivory coast ebolavirus is the least virulentthe natural reservoir of ebola virus in africa has recently been shown to be bats three species of fruit bats collected in gabon and the democratic republic of congo close to areas where an epidemic of ebola had devastated local gorilla and chimpanzee populations showed evidence of infection significant numbers of hypsignathus monstrosus 4 of 17 tested epomops franqueti 8 of 117 and myonycteris torquata 4 of 58 were found to have antibodies to ebola virus and viral nucleic acid was detected in liver or spleen of other bats of these three species 4 of 21 5 of 117 and 4 of 41 respectively no viral rna was found in any other animal species tested which included 222 birds and 129 small vertebrates among others the infection of the bats appears to be asymptomatic consistent with the hypothesis that the fruit bat is the reservoir of ebola virus it is probable that bats are also the reservoir of marburg virusit is clear that monkeys can be infected by the virus and spread it to humans but how the monkeys contract it is not known perhaps the monkeys eat fruit that has been partially eaten by the bats there have been serious die-offs of gorillas and chimpanzees in the last decade or so that have severely impacted the populations of these animals in some areas some human epidemics get started when monkeys dying of the disease are butchered for food but in other epidemics monkeys are not implicated and how the epidemic starts is not known again perhaps consumption of partially eaten fruit is to blame the recent large die-offs of apes and chimpanzees in some areas together with the increasing frequency of human infection indicates that the virus is spreading more widely whether this is due to a new strain of virus that is more easily spread to humans and nonhuman primates or to the recent introduction of the virus from a source outside the areas now experiencing epidemics or to human alterations of the environment leading to more contact between humans and nonhuman primates with the bats that carry the virus is not knowna fourth strain of ebola virus originating from the philippines or perhaps another region of asia first appeared as the causative agent of an epidemic of hemorrhagic fever in monkeys imported from the philippines this epidemic occurred in reston virginia near washington dc in 1989 the deaths were at first attributed to simian hemorrhagic fever virus shfv but investigation by the us army medical research institute for infectious diseases and the centers for disease control and prevention found that both shfv and ebola virus were present in the monkeys believing that the community was at risk for ebola made even the more alarming because the epidemic was occurring in the neighborhood of the central government of the united states the army team quickly decided to euthanize the monkeys and decontaminate the facility follow-up studies showed that four animal handlers at the facility had been infected by the virus but had suffered no illness thus the strain of ebola present in the reston monkeys called reston ebolavirus seems to be nonpathogenic for humans although it remains pathogenic for monkeys the story of the reston incident was recounted in a book called the hot zone by richard preston since this first epidemic of reston ebolavirus a new outbreak has occurred in reston two outbreaks have occurred in an animal facility in alice texas and an outbreak took place in sienna italy all outbreaks occurred in monkeys imported from the philippines and it seems probable that the virus is native to the philippines no serious illness in humans has occurred in any of these outbreaks nucleotide sequencing has shown that reston ebolavirus is closely related to the african ebolaviruses the reason it is attenuated in humans is still unexplained and high containment is used for studies of reston ebolavirus in the laboratoryto date the filoviruses have caused only a limited number of human infections however if a filovirus were to adapt to humans such that human-to-human transmission occurred readily it could become a major problem the probability of such an event is unknownin the summer of 1999 west nile virus a mosquito-borne flavivirus chapter 3 appeared in north america for the first time there were 62 human cases of west nile disease in the new york city area of whom 7 died of encephalitis numerous birds also died including exotics in zoos as well as native birds with the end of the mosquito season the epidemic died out but the virus had become established over the next 6 years the virus rapidly spread across the united states and north into canada as well as south into central america northern south america and the caribbean the march of the virus across the united states is illustrated in figs 84
and 85
 the rapid spread of this virus into a new ecological area requiring adaptation to new mosquito vectors as well as new vertebrate hosts is extraordinary in the process more than 20000 americans became ill from wn virus infection and more than 800 died of neurological complications fig 86
 figures 85 and 86 illustrate an interesting and not well understood phenomenon after the front passes through an area there are many fewer human cases of disease in the following years yet only a minority of humans in any area had been infected and are therefore immune to the virus and the virus continues to be present in some way the transmission cycle has been interrupted perhaps by the die-off of the birds that serve as the primary amplifying hostswn virus strains from the united states are 997 identical to strains from israel and the us strain certainly originated in the middle east it presumably arrived in new york on a jet aircraft and there are three possible vectors that could have carried the virus it is conceivable that a viremic human introduced the virus although this seems unlikely because humans are poorly able to pass on the virus as described in chapter 3 a second possibility is that the virus arrived in a viremic bird being imported legally or illegally although there is no evidence for such an event it seems highly unlikely that a migratory bird that was off course introduced the virus because west nile first appeared near a major international airport the favored hypothesis is that the virus arrived in an infected mosquito that came along for the ride in a jet aircraft introduction of the virus was almost certainly a singular eventwest nile virus has had profound and well documented effects on horses and wildlife as it moved across north america many horses died of wn disease and a vaccine has now been introduced in order to protect horses the effect upon bird populations has been particularly dramatic crows jays and raptors hawks and owls are particularly sensitive to the virus almost all crows die after infection for example and in many parts of the country the crow population crashed with the arrival of the virus although there are recent signs that the population is at least partially recovering many raptors prey upon small rodents and are
important in controlling their numbers and a crash in their numbers results in an increase in rodent populations as an example of the sensitivity of some owls to wn virus there was an outbreak of wn disease in north american owls in a rehabilitation facility in ontario in 2002 associated with the die-off of corvids in the area large owls with a northern breeding range were particularly susceptible snowy owls northern hawk owls great gray owls and boreal owls experienced 100 mortality and northern saw-whet owls experienced 92 mortalitywn virus is now well established in the americas and will surely continue to cause sporadic cases of human illness if not sporadic epidemics and sporadic die-offs of birds it is possible that the interruption of its transmission cycle described above is due to extensive die-off of susceptible species of birds that serve as its major amplifying vectors if so the resurgence of the crow population and the populations of other amplifying species could lead to renewed outbreaks similar to those that occurred with the first appearance and spread of the virus one encouraging finding relating to the potential of the virus to cause future epidemics of disease is the appearance of an attenuated variant of wn virus in texas in 2003 in a mouse model this variant is attenuated in neurovirulence the emergence of wn virus was associated with the appearance in europe and the middle east of a more virulent strain of virus perhaps enabling it to spread more easily it seems possible that once the virus becomes endemic attenuated strains may become dominanth5n1 virus was first detected in china in 1996 where it caused the death of a number of geese after undergoing reassortment to obtain new genes it surfaced in hong kong in 1997 where it became widespread in live poultry markets eighteen people were infected by the virus and six died the virus was eradicated by culling all domestic chickens in hong kong different reassortants of h5n1 continued to arise and in 2002 an epidemic of influenza killed most birds domestic and wild in hong kong nature parks two people were infected and one died the virus then spread widely over eastern asia the virus killed wild as well as domestic waterfowl and chickens and together with repeated efforts to stop the spread of the virus by culling of birds the death of more than 140 million birds occurred the virus has a high mortality rate in humans about 50 and as of early 2007 more than 150 people have died as a result of h5n1 infection there is no evidence for human-to-human transmission at the current time all human infections appear to have originated from close contact with infected birdsthe virus has continued to spread westward it has now reached many countries in europe and established a beachhead in africa it is thought that the virus will soon reach north america brought by migratory birds the mechanism of its rapid spread is not completely clear it is thought that transport of domestic birds may be responsible in part for the spread but there is reason to believe that wild waterfowl ducks geese and swans are also spreading the virus these birds undergo seasonal migrations over large distances and episodes of dead and dying migratory birds have been associated with the appearance of the virus in new areas the virus is continuing to evolve unlike most avian influenza viruses it is highly pathogenic in chickens and many strains are also pathogenic in ducks both domestic and wild virulence in wild ducks seems to be moderating as some recent isolates do not kill wild ducks but virulence in chickens continues all isolates contain the multibasic cleavage site in ha that is recognized by furin which is correlated with increased virulencestudies of h5n1 virus in mice and ferrets have shown that many virus isolates are highly virulent for these mammals in one study with ferrets isolates from humans caused a fatal infection characterized by broad tissue tropism including infection of the brain in this same study isolates from birds caused nonlethal infection with virus replication restricted to the upper respiratory tractthere have been three or four pandemics of influenza every century for as long as can be ascertained from historical studies and there is every reason to believe that pandemics will come again in the twenty-first century if h5n1 virus should acquire the ability to spread readily from person to person and if its high lethality for humans should continue unabated it could cause a devastating pandemic efforts are being made to prepare defenses against this virus including vaccines and antiviral drugs supported by the us government and other governments promising vaccines are being developed and tested in clinical trials and plans are to stockpile such a vaccine for possible use if an epidemic of this virus arises this effort is complicated by the fact that h5n1 influenza like all influenzas continues to evolve and stockpiled vaccine might not be completely effective against the strain that ultimately might emerge as a pandemic strain nevertheless there is hope that at least partial immunity might be effected by such a vaccine that could ameliorate the symptoms of the disease and protect against the extreme virulence of the virus as described in chapter 4 new approaches to flu vaccine development are being tried including development of a universal flu vaccine that would work against any influenza a strain but such an approach will clearly require many more years of research before a licensed vaccine for general use could be produced efforts are also being directed toward producing and stockpiling antiviral compounds directed against influenza unfortunately most h5n1 isolates tested are resistant to amantadine and related compounds antiflu agents that have been in use for years and that are readily available it is thought that this is the result of the wide use of amantadine by chinese farmers to protect their chicken flocks from influenza thereby selecting for amantadine-resistant variants of the viruses this effect may be moderating however as some recent isolates are sensitive to amantadine inhibitors of the influenza neuraminidase such as oseltamivir tamiflu and zanamivir appear to be reasonably effective against h5n1 virus but these drugs must be used early in infection if they are to be effective production of these compounds is limiting at present but production is being accelerated in order to stockpile them for possible use if or when a pandemic eruptsan epidemic of h7n7 influenza a erupted in the netherlands in 2003 a total of 89 human infections was recorded of whom 86 were directly involved in handling poultry human-to-human transmission occurred and three family members were also affected the primary disease syndrome was conjunctivitis but there were two cases characterized by mild influenza-like symptoms only and one fatal case characterized by pneumonia followed by respiratory distress syndrome the virus was eradicated by culling of poultry in the countryin 1999 two cases of human infection by h9n2 influenza a occurred in hong kong and five cases in guangdong province china then in 2003 another case occurred in hong kong the disease was characterized by mild influenza-like symptoms and recovery was uneventfuldengue viruses are mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause widespread epidemics in humans chapter 3 forest cycles of dengue have been documented in africa and southeast asia in which the vertebrate reservoir is monkeys and various species of aedes mosquitoes maintain the virus recent sequencing studies have now shown that the sylvatic monkey viruses evolved in monkeys into four serotypes this evolution from a common ancestor occurred in the africansoutheast asian region at some time in the distant past these different dengue viruses then jumped independently into humans to become human dengue viruses a dendrogram of dengue viruses of monkeys sylvatic strains and humans endemicepidemic strains is shown in fig 87
 notice for example that the monkey dengue-4 virus groups with human dengue-4 but forms a distinct lineage from that of the other dengue viruses similarly monkey dengue-1 and dengue-2 group with the respective human viruses but form distinct lineages sequencing of sylvatic dengue-3 has not yet been done but it will presumably group in the same way from the extent of the divergence in sequences between the monkey viruses and the human viruses it is estimated that the jump to humans occurred on the order of 200 years ago for den-1 600 years ago for den-4 and 1000 years ago for den-2 it is further estimated that the african and malaysian sylvatic viruses diverged about 800 years ago such estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty but are probably valid to within a factor of two since human dengue virus is an exclusively human virus that is epidemic in nature and induces lifelong immunity it could not have existed until human populations were large enough to support the continued existence of such a virus this topic is covered in more detail in chapter 4 when discussing measles virus but sufficiently large human populations arose only within the last thousand years or so in the regions in which dengue viruses first arose and flourisheddengue viruses have been continuously active over large areas of asia and the pacific region for many years they have recently dramatically expanded their range in the americas the viruses may have caused large epidemics in the americas including the united states in the 1800s and into the early 1900s however it is impossible to determine with certainty from descriptions of the disease written at the time whether dengue was the causative agent of these epidemics or whether other viruses that cause similar illnesses might have been responsible in any event dengue almost died out in the americas following world war ii because of efforts to control aedes aegypti the urban vector of the virus with the discovery of ddt in the mid 1900s a serious effort was made in the americas to eradicate ae aegypti from large regions in order to control viral diseases spread by these mosquitoes which include not only dengue but also yellow fever and other arboviruses these efforts succeeded in eliminating the mosquito from large areas of central and south america as illustrated in fig 88a
 however in 1970 these efforts were abandoned because of the expense involved and the detrimental effects of ddt on the environment and by 2000 the mosquito had reestablished itself over most of the region fig 88a the reintroduction of multiple dengue strains into the americas from foci in asia after the reestablishment of ae aegypti resulted in the outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever associated with huge epidemics of dengue fever fig 88b the history of the increasing infection rate is illustrated in fig 89
by data from brazil before 1993 epidemics of dengue were sporadic occurring every few years and then dying out after this however epidemics have occurred every year and the total number of cases has increased dramatically notice the difference in scalesprior to the 1980s a native american strain of den-2 circulated and there was very little dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf in the americas a strain of den-3 circulated in the 1960s and 1970s but it then disappeared den-1 was introduced into the americas in 1977 and den-4 in 1981 and these viruses then radiated throughout large regions of the caribbean and northern south america the first epidemic of dhf occurred in 1981 but interestingly it was due to the introduction of a new strain of den-2 from asia this den-2 strain grows more vigorously than the native american strain which is not associated with dhf and led to the dhf epidemic then in 1994 the southeast asian strain of den-3 responsible for the dhf epidemic in sri lanka described in chapter 3 reached the americas the result of all these introductions has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of dhf and dengue shock syndrome dss in the americas whereas in the 1970s there were very few cases of dhf in the americas there were more than 10000 cases in the 1980s and more than 60000 cases in the 1990s cases have continued to increase in number in the last 5 years 20012005 inclusive more than 50000 cases have been reported that resulted in about 700 deathsthe evolution of den-1 in the americas after its introduction in 1977 is illustrated in fig 810
 sequencing of strains isolated in various years after 1977 show that silent nucleotide substitutions ie synonymous substitutions that do not result in a coding change have been fixed at the rate of 02 per year however essentially no coding changes have occurred thus coding changes are not acceptable and viruses containing such changes do not persistuntil recently the extent of sivcpz infection of chimpanzees was not known the chimp is an endangered species limited in numbers difficult to study and only a few isolations of siv from chimps had been made in recent studies to examine the extent of siv infection of wild chimps 1300 stool samples from wild chimps were collected in the field and laboriously tested for the presence of anti-siv antibodies and for siv rna by rtpcr the individual responsible for the stools was identified by examining the host dna in the sample using highly polymorphic microsatellite loci several different chimp populations were included in these studiesthere are four different subspecies of chimpanzee the type subspecies pan troglodytes troglodytes is found in west africa in southern cameroon gabon and congo fig 812
 pan t schweinfurthii is further east primarily in the democratic republic of congo but penetrating northward into the central african republic and eastward into a swath from southern sudan down to tanzania pan t vellerosus is north of the range of troglodytes in northern and western cameroon finally pan t verus is west of the range of vellerosus in a broad zone from senegal to ghana subspeciation has resulted in part because chimps do not swim and large rivers fragment the various populations of these four subspecies only two troglodytes and schweinfurthii are naturally infected by siv rates of infection vary in different populations but average about 20 with some populations exhibiting almost 50 infected individuals thus sivcpz is a naturally occurring widespread virus for which two subspecies of chimps are the reservoir the virus does not appear to cause disease in chimps similar to the case for other sivs that infect african monkeyssurprisingly sivcpz is itself a recombinant virus the 5 half of the genome is derived from siv infecting red-capped mangabeys whereas the 3 half is derived from siv infecting greater spot-nosed or mustached or mona monkeys fig 813
 the recombination probably occurred in a chimp that had been infected by the two sivs chimps eat other monkeys and could have become infected in this process in the same way that humans probably became infected with sivcpz upon slaughtering and eating chimps the fact that only two of the four subspecies of chimps are infected with sivcpz argues that this virus arose after subspeciation of the chimps had taken place the spread of this virus in chimps might in fact be a fairly recent occurrenceafter infection of humans by sivcpz the virus had to adapt to humans and become a human virus in order to be transmitted from person to person and to spread widely it seems probable that humans have become infected with sivcpz repeatedly but in most cases the virus failed to adapt to humans or failed to become epidemic because of the low transmissibility of the virus following a human infection it may have smoldered in a small number of people but then died out when the viruses crossed the species barrier and became firmly established in the human population as hiv-1 is not clear hiv-1 has been isolated from serum collected in 1959 in zaire and antibodies to hiv have been found in serum collected in 1963 in burkina faso so hiv-1 has been in the human population at least that long from sequencing studies of the glycoprotein gene and examination of the rate of divergence one estimate is that the virus might have entered the human population about 70 years ago although estimates of divergence rates are controversial recent changes in human behavior including more extensive travel by truck bus and plane changes in sexual practices and the use of injectable drugs as well as the increase in the human population could have allowed the virus to reach major population centers and spread more extensively than in the past becoming epidemic worldwide the spread of the virus could also have been aided by the appearance of mutants that were more easily transmissible from person to person the large increase in population during the last century has certainly resulted in more opportunities for the introduction and spread of the virus in humans and therefore for the selection of such transmissible mutantshiv-2 represents a distinct lineage that is closely related to siv of sooty mangabey monkeys smm and of macaques mac siv of african green monkeys agm and of mandrills mnd form other lineages that are more closely related to hiv-2 than to hiv-1 it is clear that sivsmm and sivagm are naturally occurring infectious agents that are widespread in africa and have coevolved with their monkey hosts sequence comparisons have shown that different isolates of siv group with their hosts rather than by geography and they are therefore adapted to their hosts they cause no disease in their natural host but sivsmm does cause aids when transferred to asian macaques in captivity hiv-2 is found primarily in western central africa where its distribution is almost coincident with that of mangabey monkeys it seems clear that hiv-2 represents a separate introduction of sivsmm into humansit has been found recently that the multiple introductions of siv into humans that became hiv-1 and -2 do not represent the only human infections by monkey retroviruses studies of bush meat hunters in cameroon showed that at least six retroviruses have crossed from monkeys into humans who were exposed to fresh bush meat these include two previously unknown retroviruses htlv-3 ptlv-3 and htlv-4 ptlv-4 thus infection of humans by simian retroviruses has not been a rare event a book called the river by edward hooper claimed that the hiv epidemic started because an early version of polio vaccine was contaminated by hiv or its progenitor no evidence for such contamination exists and recent analysis of lots of this vaccine that had been stored for 40 years by three different laboratories failed to find any trace of sivhiv in the vaccine further given that monkey viruses have repeatedly entered the human population it is unnecessary to postulate human vaccine activity for the origin of hiv rumors based upon this claim however have led to suspension of vaccination for polio in some african nations resulting in a resurgence of poliomyelitis in africa that has spread to other areas previously free of polio see chapter 3hantaviruses are associated with rodents and infect humans through aerosols containing virus from rodent excreta the first hantavirus to come to medical attention was hantaan virus which caused more than 3000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in us troops during the korean war since then many hantaviruses have been identified in both the old world and in the americas that cause serious human illness they are examples of emerging viruses because as the number of humans increases and as they invade more habitat occupied by rodents carrying hantaviruses the incidence of infection in humans has risen very interesting in this regard was the isolation in may 1993 of a new hantavirus that causes acute respiratory distress in humans that can lead to rapid death a syndrome now called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps and originally called acute respiratory disease syndrome ards the virus was isolated by the cdc in collaboration with local health authorities following an epidemic in the four corners area of the southwestern united states that resulted in approximately 25 deaths the virus is associated with the deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus it is thought that the epidemic may have resulted from an abundance of pine nuts in the area during a good growing year leading the local people to harvest larger amounts of these than usual and store them in their homes when their normal storage areas became full with abundant food available the rodent population exploded and invaded homes to get to the pine nuts and it is thought that this more intimate contact between humans and rodents may have led to the epidemic the hantavirus responsible for this epidemic is now called sin nombre virus which is spanish for without a name early suggestions that it be called four corners virus or muerto canyon virus after a geographical feature in the area drew objections from local residents who did not want this major tourist area identified with a fatal disease eventually the cdc simply named it sin nombre there is a small creek in the area called the sin nombre river that serves as justification for the choice of namewith the discovery of sin nombre virus searches for viruses in other regions of north america resulted in the isolation of many viruses related to sin nombre these viruses are associated with other rodents in the order sigmodontinae and have been given names of local features in order to distinguish them these include new york monongahela bayou and black creek canal viruses all of which have caused hps in the united states see fig 426 related viruses are also found in latin america in fact studies have now shown that hantaviruses are present in virtually all states within the united states and into latin america and that fatalities due to infection by the virus have occurred in most states retrospective studies of stored sera collected from patients who died of ards in the past have identified earlier cases of hps thus these viruses are widespread and have caused many fatal cases of human disease over the yearsas noted in chapter 4 the epidemiology of arenaviruses is similar to that of the hantaviruses several south american arenaviruses have caused increasing numbers of cases of human hemorrhagic fever because of increased contact between humans and the rodent carriers of the viruses the development of the pampas of argentina in particular led to increased incidence of human arenavirus diseasethe middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers is caused by an emerging zoonotic virus that was identified for the first time in september 2012 1 it quickly became a virus of international public health significance due to the high mortality rate around 35 of infected people and its ability to spread rapidly in hospitals over 80 of reported cases have occurred in the arabian peninsula with the largest reported outbreak occurring in a tertiary hospital in jeddah in 2014 2 and led to major political ramifications on the healthcare system in the kingdom of saudi arabia 3mers-cov affects the respiratory system and leads to respiratory failure especially in older people immunocompromised individuals and those suffering from cardiopulmonary illnesses 4 mers-cov belongs to the lineage of the c beta-coronaviruses first identified in bats 5 and is transmitted to humans through an intermediate animal such as the dromedary camel 6 7 however most mers-cov infections are spread from human to human through direct or indirect contact with infected people for example through droplets from coughing or sneezing from shaking hands or from touching contaminated surfaces 8 these infections can be transmitted among close family members in the community and in healthcare facilities from patients to healthcare providerssince its emergence mers has been diagnosed in patients in 25 other countries including jordan kuwait oman qatar yemen tunisia the united arab emirates uae egypt iran lebanon turkey the united kingdom germany france italy algeria austria greece the netherlands the united states malaysia china the philippines the republic of korea and thailand the highest number of cases was reported in saudi arabia 1470 9 the second highest in the republic of korea 165 cases and the third highest in the uae 74 cases 10 more than 9 hospital based outbreaks have been reported by saudi ministry of health authorities 9so preparation for a potential mers outbreak at king abdulaziz medical city in riyadh kamc-r the hospital based outbreak committee assisted by the infection prevention and control department prepared a staged response to mers that was based on the number of mers cases clustering together at any given time this was known as the infectious disease epidemic plan idep 3 11 for this particular outbreak the index case was identified on june 21 2015 and as the number of cases were increased the idep was activated with the widespread of mers in the emergency room level three which is the highest level for the plan called for the closure of the hospital and evacuated wards were being reassigned to cohort confirmed exposed and non infectednone exposed patients this eventually led to the successful control of the outbreak which was declared over on october 12 2015research has identified that such outbreaks do not just have organizational implications outbreaks of severe viruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov can provoke fear emotional ethical and cultural conflicts and tensions for healthcare providers in workplaces and those providing direct patient care to infected patients or those who have survived infection 12 13 in such instances healthcare workers have refused to provide patient care 14this is the first qualitative study to examine the perspectives of health professionals on an mers outbreak it contributes valuable and new insights into the unique challenges faced by health professionals caring for mers during this 2015 outbreak at the kamc-r we believe our findings will provide specific insight into what is needed to enhance the preparation of institutions to support their hcws in this very special scenario of a disasterparticipants were selected using a purposivenon-probabilitysampling strategy 16 participants were frontline healthcare providers who were mers confirmed and were admitted to the hospital due to the infection during the 2015 outbreak and who also met the following criteria 1 they consent to participate in the study and 2 they are fluent in englishafter obtaining ethical approval for this study invitations to participate were sent to health professionals through the hospitals department of infectious disease as they are responsible for the information concerning all mers-cov patients both volunteer and snowball sampling were used with seven participants agreeing to participate data were collected using face-to-face semi-structured interview approach with each participant 17 the duration of each interview was approximately from 45 to 90 minthe sample was composed of an almost equal number of male n  3 and female n  4 participants they represent different age groups four are from 28 to 29 years old one is 51 years and the last two are 61 and 66 years four participants are working as staff nurses and the other three are physicians they have also worked at the study hospital for different lengths of time ranging from 2 to 17 years participants are from different countries three from the philippines two from saudi arabia one from the united states of america and one from koreathe interview data were analyzed using the inductive approach to qualitative data analysis in particular the thematic analysis technique which is a method of identifying and interpreting patterned meaning across the collected data the analysis approach comprised six phases including coding searching reviewing defining and naming themes and then weaving together the analytic narrative data quotes and discussion in light of the existing literature 18 in this study the data analysis was undertaken separately by the first and second authors of this study to strengthen the analysis process by supplementing and contesting each others statements 19 collectively these steps were intended to maintain the rigor of the studyevery participant was given the choice to participate after receiving all the relevant information the acceptance was recorded and documented by signing the informed consentparticipants reported emotions and involvement in care for mers patients were diverse some participants expressed a high level of altruism associated with professionalism by always going the extra mile for their patients and exposing themselves to high levels of risk therefore they believed they caught the virus as a result of prioritizing patient care over their own health which consequently might have led them either consciously or unconsciously to exercise poor self-protection and precautions the motives of feeling obligated to attend to the needs and best interests of those who were infected as well as to maintaining their professionalism were manifested in their reported intentional practice of providing the maximum level of care even in a high risk situation this was primarily how the participants reflected on how they caught the virus in the first place for example a participant explained as followsin the er  we had patients in the hallway and we had patients positive with corona behind curtains and i was examining and seeing every single patient with corona in this hospital by myself and thats the price i paid
 so the one who got positive virus i think was me the survivor i think i was too close to the patient  because i examine the patient more than the junior
another participant described his feelings about surviving the virus and considered his survival to be a reward from god for the hard work he was doing for patients during the outbreaklet me tell you something sometimes i feel that i survived this disease because god knows that i was doing the right thing
in contrast such feelings of obligation and what arguably seems to be altruistic action were not always the case for many healthcare providers other participants expressed how they were anxious about their safety and self-protection apparently the seeming panic of colleagues fear inducing stories that were told of infected patients and perceived severity of clinical presentations of the virus contributed to their increased anxiety level which consequently affected their work performance and willingness to work in such a risky environment despite these fears participants perceived they had an ethical or employment related obligation to provide carei was afraid you know when i have patients that has fever i already get paranoid so when i heard about the outbreak already i wanna go home but theres nothing i can do i have a contract and then i forced myself to stay
its pretty scary but ah as a healthcare provider we cannot say  i dont wanna work  because its our job  thats the main reason how this virus got into my body 
in instances in which health care providers were frightened of catching the virus to the extent some decided to refuse to provide care to their patientsparticipants described their own negative and painful experiences of being seen as carriers and survivors of mers in the community which were perceived to have affected them psychologically emotionally and cognitively apparently peoples desire to avoid the epidemic infection and remain healthy resulted in either in a subtle or unsubtle way behaviours of social rejection and neglect of those who survived the infection participants explained a variety of painful experiences of rejection and avoidance by their colleagues and neighbours even after recoveryi was standing by my window here next to my house there is a park and a lot of people here walk to the bus stop and in the park there is a distance like maybe from here to you i was standing here looking to my window through the curtain and one nurse who i talk to a lot called and i was walking here and i could see her but and i went back i didnt want her to see me and she told yeah im at the hospital and when i have the time i will come to see youi said okay dont worry yeah im sorry its basically very clearly implying that i dont want to be near you
this stigma was perceived to arise from the public suspicion that the survivors still had the virus in their bodies peoples fear and anxiety resulted in intentionally ignoring and excluding survivors from their social life or signalling them for special questionsa lot of people knew about it if i go near them they will ask are you negative were you the one who had corona and then they will cover their nose yeah
i felt badit feels like im the dirtiest person in the world thats why they have to avoid me i cant approach them because they are terrified you know i felt bad 
this conduct led to social isolation and appeared to reduce participants self-esteem sense of meaningful existence and belonging which resulted in social pain and distress on the other hand one participant described the opposite experience with a group of his saudi colleagues during his illness he explained the extent of caring and unconditional emotional support they provided when he was admitted into the hospital and they did not exhibit any intimidation behaviours or rejection the following quotes explain his sentimentsi was born christiani think the islamic teaching of just brotherly love and compassion manifested in the way i was treated by a b and c without question you know and that was the first time i cried and not because i was in pain but because of the showing of caring it touched me so muchi didnt cry because i was in pain no but because of the genuinei mean some people who fake it it was genuine it was real
the diagnoses of participants as mers created intense feelings of fear and anxiety their infection was a traumatic and dreadful experience as they realized that their lives were at risk and they could die at any time being in the hospital and receiving healthcare did not help they reported feeling hopeless and helpless and frightened of the scenarios that could happen to them their despair about their futures was exacerbated by their medical knowledge and the fact that they had witnessed many patients die from this viral infection for example the following participants quote revealed how they perceived the correlation between their infection and deathin the morning they said i was positive of corona so my feeling that time was very terrible and of course when i say corona all our patients died from corona
the participants medical knowledge compounded their fear by adding additional stress they started to imagine the scary and seemingly inevitable scenarios that could happen to them including suffering the disease that would eventually lead to their death for exampleso even i have this kind of thinking oh my god after few days i will die after few days i will get intubated or something like this like thati was really scared if i will survive or if i will be gone that time
contrary to many participants experiences one of the survivors did not realize the serious and fatal consequences of mers-cov even though he was admitted to the icu this could be because he was not physically too sick or he was in the denial phase he only realized the seriousness of the condition when he witnessed deceased patients being taken from the icu to the morgue it was a shifting paradigm and life-changing momentparticipants were traumatized to the point that they dreamt about their ordeals even after recovering they still felt their recovery was not complete and suffered from the intensity of their experiences the description below highlights one of the participants feelings which were echoed by othersim trying to avoid thinking about the incidenti still have dreams especially yesterday i dreamt about being in icu seeing everything inserting all the tubes and needles i saw i think it will be a big part of my life already
denial and lack of understanding of the seriousness of the disease occurred in the early stages of the epidemic at two levels the personal level in which healthcare providers had different perceptions of the aggressiveness of the infection and at the official level in which the official responses to dealing with the situation and containing the virus could not cope with the nature of the infection it is noteworthy that these findings only reflect the perceptions of those who were traumatized by their experience of surviving the virus in this environment which may or may not reflect the complexity of the situation nevertheless the perceived denial and underestimation might have contributed significantly to the outbreak of mers in the hospital for example at a personal level one participant reflected on his experience which was similar to that of other participants saying that he thought that the mers outbreak was under control and it did not occur to him that he would catch the virus he explainedthe thing that comes to mind is that life was going on as usual you know that we had the outbreak in march so we thought we were over it and mafee mushkelah arabic for no problem and everything in life was going on
participants continued reflecting on their experiences and described how suspicious patients who eventually turned out to be mers-cov positive were scattered around the emergency department and in the hallway without applying proper infection control practices therefore the official responses to the outbreak at the early stages were not congruent with the seriousness of the situation one explanation of such a questionable infectious disease prevention response is official denial and underestimation of the outbreak such underestimation of the seriousness of the infection caused a delay in acknowledging the outbreak and then announcing it properly to everyone so they could exercise their highest level of vigilance the participants views on this matter were critical they described how they had to work under the high risk of infection without proper warningcreate a policy where you alert the staff as soon as you have one case or two cases in the er you ie the decision makers should have alerted all the staff
healthcare providers were seen to neglect hand hygiene practice and other infection prevention measures as they believe it will slow down their practice thus from their perspective if healthcare providers were well informed about the chances of getting the infection they would prioritize strict infection control measures even if it would mean slower practice and that fewer patients could be seen in each clinic the concerns about the lack of knowledge and proper education about the outbreak and related infection control measures were echoed by most of the participantsfrom the participants rich and illuminating experiences during the outbreak and of surviving mers four main themes were identified shaping their experiences the first three themes mainly revolve around the extent of care that participants as healthcare professionals provided to patients during the epidemic outbreak their painful experiences of social prejudice and stigmatization and the moments of diagnosing participants as mers-cov positive which provoked an intense feeling of fear anxiety about their fate and then despair about their future the fourth theme refers to the underestimation of the seriousness of the disease as the healthcare providers had different understandings of the aggressiveness of the mers-cov infection which led them to perceive that the organizational responses were not congruent with the nature of the infectionregarding the extent of patient care during the outbreak participants experiences were not uniform some participants prioritized patient care over their own health exposing themselves to risks such behaviours can be better explained through the theoretical lens of altruism which is associated in this situation with a sense of professionalism the notion of altruism which was first coined by auguste comte in the 19th century basically refers to an unselfish act that is undertaken voluntarily and intentionally to promote the welfare of others 20 21 there are two types of altruism normative and autonomous the former refers to the usual acts of helpfulness regulated by social norms with low risk and low cost to the performer whereas the latter refers to intentional acts that are undertaken primarily for the benefit of others and often associated with high risk and high cost 20 therefore those participants who always went the extra mile for their patients believed that they caught the virus as a result of their altruism it seems their eagerness to help their patients led them to either consciously or unconsciously practice poor self-protection and precautions while fear of the infection anxiety panicky responses and scary stories also negatively influenced the performance of some healthcare providers during the epidemicparticipants in this study were traumatized by their experiences as patients with and survivors of mers-cov infection those who survived the infection and were happily looking forward to life reflected on their painful experiences of rejection and neglect by their colleagues and neighbours such findings were not surprising because the fear of the disease and the desire to remain healthy pushed people either consciously or unconsciously to engage in prejudice behaviours against those who were victims of the virus many studies conducted in different settings and with different groups of people such as those with hepatitis c virus infection and those with ebola indicated how patients suffered from social isolation and rejection 22 23 24 25significantly research indicated that social rejection and neglect even when experienced in lesser forms have painful and distressing negative impacts on individuals 26 27 these effects of social injury may last longer than physical injury and affect individuals psychologically affectively and cognitively 27 the findings also revealed that the social injury isolation and rejection experienced by the survivors threatened their fundamental human needs such as self-esteem confidence self-worth and sense of belonging many researchers have argued that being socially valued liked appreciated and included lead to the enhancement of well-being and self-esteem whereas opposite experiences will evoke negative emotions and consequently may lead in some situations to antisocial reactions such as aggression or withdrawal 28 29 30 they may also lead to impairment of individuals self-monitoring and self-regulatory processes which could result in negative behaviours such as unhealthy eating which might be detrimental for some people 31the findings revealed the magnitude of survivors traumatic experiences including near-death experiences feelings of alienation and rejection and social stigmatization which affected them psychologically and emotionally these survivors as well as the healthcare providers who were working in the environment where mers-cov broke out are still vulnerable because of their terrifying experiences of constantly anticipating frightening scenarios and the possibility of death therefore they need support and help at the organizational level in order to reduce their fear and anxiety an educational campaign must be launched immediately after diagnosing the first case in the hospital it should focus on the signs and symptoms transmissibility personal hygiene and protection precautionary practices and help-seeking behaviour educating and increasing healthcare providers awareness will help reduce the incidents of rejection and stigmatization of colleagues who are in contact with mers-cov positive patients it is important that hospitals remain vigilant and proactive when it comes to infection control measures and exhibit a high level of transparency about the nature of the infection with employeesit is noteworthy that this organization developed the infectious diseases epidemiological plan idep prior to the outbreak it was based on recommendations and guidelines from the world health organization who and center for disease control and prevention cdc and was activated during the outbreak 3 32 unfortunately despite these guidelines and plans the outbreak still occurred due to a failure to adhere to the infection control measures therefore healthcare providers should remain vigilant and take emails educational material and warnings about mers-cov more seriously and hospital management should ensure that the healthcare providers abide by all infection control plansmeasuresdespite the fact that participants survived the infection they still suffer from its complications therefore it is important that the hospital dedicate special clinics to helping survivors and their families receive support in the form of psychotherapy geared toward addressing the psychological and emotional effects of the infection and its social consequences such a measure will help survivors overcome their challenges and increase their resilience in order to maintain fairly stable livesin this study we struggled to recruit participants due to the sensitivity of the topic although this qualitative study explored the experiences of only a limited number of survivors it produced rich reliable and trustworthy insights further studies will be useful to investigate the publics perceptions of the nature of the mers-cov infection and their views of and reactions to the survivors another longitudinal study is recommended to investigate the development of survivors resilience over timethis study was funded by king abdullah international medical research centernone declaredethical approval and clearance was obtained from the institutional review board at ministry of national guard-health affairstheories of health protective behaviour offer an appealing framework in which to interpret differences in compliant and non-compliant parents with respect to childhood vaccinations 8 while several models have been developed to account for peoples adoption of health protective behaviour such as the theory of reasoned action 9 the triandis model 10 multi-attribute utility mau theory 11 and the subjective expected utility theory 8 the health belief model is possibly the simplest and the most widely used and tested 1213 the four elements of the health belief model are perceived susceptibility likelihood of getting the disease perceived severity perception of how serious an outcome or consequence is from the disease perceived benefits efficacy of preventive action undertaken and perceived barriers time effort money inconvenience pain side effects of preventive action 1213attempts to assess the association of these elements and childhood immunisation uptake have been inconclusive with some studies reporting expected relationships 14-16 and others contrary to what would be expected 1718 these contradictory findings have led to the conclusion that the health beliefs of mothers are not important contributors to immunisation uptake or completion and are less important than socio-demographic factors that is incomplete immunisation fall behind the immunisation schedule or fail to complete is associated with being poor 17 and being a single parent 1920 low maternal education has usually been found to be a risk factor for not completing immunisation 20 being anti immunisation on the other hand is associated with high education 21while in some instances theories of health protective behaviours have been shown to differentiate between complete incomplete and non-immunisers none of them provides an explanation of how people perceive risks or how their perceptions might influence behaviour indeed these models assume a rational basis for these decisions a simple weighing up of information regarding severity susceptibility benefits and barriers there is not however a simple relationship between mortality or morbidity figures and the perception of risk 22 people do not perceive interpret or act on risk information in the way expected by risk experts in general 22 nor specifically when considering vaccines and diseases 423two domains which have addressed lay rather than expert perceptions of risk and what influences decisions encompassing risk are studies of the subjective perception of risk 24-26 and the study of decision-making under uncertainty also referred to as the psychology of choice2728 both approaches focus on risk as a subjective rather than an objective concept and both involve social and psychological aspects that impact on the individual cognitive structure of risk perceptionresearch into the subjective perception of risk generally involves asking study participants to rate a heterogeneous set of environmental or health risks including risks from individual activities residential or work conditions hazards from technologies substances or products and natural hazards respondents are asked to rate these activities or hazards in terms of perceived magnitude of risk the acceptability of the risk and other aspects such as likelihood of death catastrophic potential avoidability fear familiarity imposed or personal choice time scale of impact benefits of risk source degree of concern personal exposure etcstudies including vaccination otherwise unspecified as a hazard have reported vaccination as low risk 2425 vaccination is generally considered to be a risk that is not dreaded controllable not fatal individual low risk to future generations but is somewhat unknown not observable effect delayed new risk risk unknown to science slovic 25 in a study of risk perception of prescription drugs including vaccines found vaccines were generally considered beneficial by the sample however people associating negative meanings to drugs tended to judge drugs and vaccines as having higher risks and lower benefits than people who associated positive meanings to drugsthis research has consistently found that risks are perceived more negatively if exposure to the hazard is involuntary people perceive they have little personal control over outcomes and there is uncertainty about the consequences of the outcomes the hazard is unfamiliar the effects of the hazard are delayed the hazard has catastrophic potential the benefits are not immediately apparent and the hazard is caused by human rather than natural causes 24 these have been summarised by two factors labelled dread uncontrollable feared involuntary exposure inequitable distribution of risk not easily reduced catastrophic risk increasing fatal consequences risk to future generations and the unknown not observable risk unknown to science delayed effect new risk 29 people make judgements about the persuasiveness and trustworthiness of experts involved in communicating risk and find risks less acceptable if they believe that the communication of the risks between experts and the community is poor 30research into decision-making under uncertainty showed that the rational subjective expected utility models which presumes that a good or rational decision maker will sum the utilities and choose the action with the greatest total utility does not explain how people make decisions 2728 kahneman and tverskys research confirmed findings from the subjective perception of risk and further contributed to an understanding of how information about risks or uncertainties of outcomes influences decisions 2728 using hypothetical scenarios studies have shown that people consistently underestimate risks of familiar and frequent events and overestimate the occurrence of low probability but high consequence risks thus rare events are perceived as more likely to occur than they do and common events are thought to occur less often than they do the classic problems devised by kahneman and tversky involved asking subjects to choose between the certainty of saving 200 out of 600 lives or taking a 1 in 3 chance of saving 600 lives they found that peoples responses to possible negative outcomes are more extreme than their responses to possible positive outcomes people also demonstrate a tendency to believe that their own risks are less than others particularly if they believe that their exposure to risk is in some way under their control 31 the impact of this tendency described as unrealistic optimism andor the illusion of control is to reduce the perceived need to take protective measures 32of particular importance to the decision to immunise are studies describing the operation of omission bias and choices involving ambiguous situations 33 omission bias describes a preference for taking no action if the action might cause harm even if there is a greater risk of harm by doing nothing ambiguity describes the decision-makers feeling that there is missing information relevant to outcome or choice 33 the effect of ambiguity on choice is to reduce peoples willingness to act or to postpone the action until the missing information can be obtained 33 these studies used hypothetical scenarios making decisions about others and participants were generally tertiary students and sometimes parentsas stated above the health belief model by itself has been found wanting in terms of being able to explain parents behaviour with respect to immunising their children conceptual pieces have been written describing how subjective risk perception and risky decision-making theories may be useful in understanding parents behaviour and choices although these have not drawn on primary data 7 using a qualitative design the aim of this study was toexplore the salience of the decision-making and risk perception findings to parents choices to immunise their young childrenexamine the utility of the risk perception and decision-making theories to provide a more detailed explanation of the differences between immunisers and non-immunisers perceptions of severity susceptibility to disease and benefits of vaccines andunderstand how these theories might explain perceptions of risk and reactions to a new strain of flu for themselves and their childrena stratified purposeful sampling strategy 34 was used to identify first time and experienced mothers of infants who were completely immunised for age incompletely immunised behind the recommended immunisation schedule partially immunised parents chose or advised not to have a specific immunisation or who had no immunisations initially mothers of children between 14-16 months were approached this age allowed a range of immunisation experiences to be discussed with participants while minimising the time since the first immunisation to obtain sufficient numbers of non-immunisers and partial immunisers this age range was broadened to include 3 to 30 months it was initially proposed that interviewing approximately 8 mothers from each immunisation category would be sufficient to discern patterns of similarity and difference between these categories if preferred by the mother both parents could participate in the interviewpossible participants were identified by maternal and child health mch nurses in five metropolitan local government areas in melbourne australia nurses were asked to approach mothers fitting the immunisation categories and to include to the best of their knowledge mothers of high and low education  year 11 and high and low income held a health care card parents were identified as fitting these categories from informal information available to the nurses parents from non-english speaking backgrounds whose english was poor were not interviewed the nursing mothers association group for the area also advertised the studyethics approval was granted by the royal childrens hospital ethics in human research committee participation was voluntary with written consent required participants provided informed consent to be interviewed and for the interview to be taped participants were assured that they could stop the interview at any time could choose not to answer any question if they didnt want to and that their responses would be confidential and transcripts anonymised the interviewer did not have a dual relationship with the participants ie she was neither a clinician nor provider of health servicescarerecruiting and interviewing continued until saturation occurred 34 ie no new information was obtained from the interviews for complete incomplete and non-immunisers or until no more new parents fitting the categories could be identified as was the case for partial immunisersover the period of data collection 94 families were identified as possible participants forty-eight interviews were arranged and 45 completed one participant withdrew consent prior to the interview she did not believe she had anything to say two participants were not at home at the time scheduled for the interview and neither returned follow-up phone calls of those not interviewed 17 fitted categories for which a sufficient number of interviews had been conducted complete immunisers 11 were not interviewed due to language difficulties 12 could not be contacted by the nurses and 6 refused interviews were undertaken in 1995-96 for six interviews both mother and father participated in the interviews three of these were non-immunising families all interviews were conducted in the participants homessemi-structured one-on-one interviews were used to collect information from parents about their childrens health the experience of illness in the family their understanding and interpretation of risk and how all of these related to their decision to immunise the method of one-on-one interviews rather than focus groups was chosen as the aim was to explore the parents experiences and path to choosing to immunise or not rather than a group discussion of the pros and cons of immunisation to understand the context of parents decisions to immunise the interviews covered four themes 1 how mothers keep their children healthy 2 experience familiarity and concerns regarding both vaccine preventable diseases and other diseases 3 concepts and influences on risk perception and 4 the decisions experience and outcomes regarding immunisation the interview began with questions about health as a non-threatening introduction and to place the consequent discussions about disease and disease prevention in the framework or context of healthquestions about diseases and the familys experience of them were included to explore the relationship between common illnesses experienced by the family and vaccine preventable diseases what was of interest here was which diseases were familiar which were unfamiliar which were to be avoided if possible and which were just childhood illnesseshealth authorities issued a warning today about a new strain of flu expected this winter the flu affects the airways making breathing difficult and causing repeated bouts of coughing long term effects of pneumonia and brain inflammation have been reported in some cases this strain appears to affect adults between the ages of 20-50 years several deaths occurred last year from the a-strain of this virusdoctors have recommended that all adults should be vaccinated especially those who are overworked stressed and tiredhealth authorities issued a warning today about a new strain of flu expected this winter the flu affects the airways making breathing difficult and causing repeated bouts of coughing long term effects of pneumonia and brain inflammation have been reported in some cases several deaths occurred last year from the a-strain of this virus many of those who died were children under 5 years doctors have recommended all young children should be vaccinatedthe description of symptoms and complications was taken from a description of the complications for pertussis 35 the doctors recommendations were written so that the parents could consider themselves at risk in the 1st instance parents of young children often feeling overworked and tired and in the 2nd scenario their childchildren fitted the at risk groupomission bias was examined in this study by asking parents to respond to the following statementstatement 1 some people say they wont vaccinate because they would feel worse if their child died because of the injection than if the child was not immunised and died from the diseaseparticipants were asked their opinion and were then read a second statementstatement 2 some people say they would vaccinate because they would feel worse if their child got the disease and died or was brain damaged when they could have had an injection to prevent itthese statements were used rather than the more complicated scenarios developed by others eg 33 because it was believed they captured the essential element of omission bias in circumstances with which the parent could identifythe interview concluded with discussions of the process of deciding to immunise or not and included a discussion of structural and non-structural barriersall interviews were conducted in the participants homes at times convenient to them by the first author interviews lasted between 45 to 90 minutes socio-demographic information including family size and type two or one parent family mothers age parental occupations and education levels was collected at the end of the interview for those children who were immunised immunisation status was determined from the immunisation records held by the parent all interviews were audio-taped and fully transcribed the interview focussed on the sole or youngest child in the family previous experience of disease and immunisations for older children was discussed in terms of its effect on decisions for the youngest childinterviews were thematically coded after all interviews had been collected this analysis focussed on determining whether parents descriptions of their experiences and beliefs were congruent or incongruent with theories of health behaviour decision-making and risk perception the coding was undertaken by the first author no formal testing of the reliability of the coding was undertaken although discussions with colleagues about the analysis and the meanings and patterns derived from this were extensively undertakendread was an important determinant of what the participants in this study perceived as high risk what was dreaded however differed between the immunisers and the non-immunisers immunisers dreaded the outcomes of the diseases especially those with which they were unfamiliar this fear motivated them to take the risk of immunisingthe life threatening ones really concerned me like ones i didnt know anything aboutpolio really scared me and the thought of whooping cough those are quite scary sort of concepts meningitis was frightening complete immuniser 11im not sure about whooping cough it just has horrible connotations in my mind but im not quite sure why what can happen yeah its interesting isnt it you know people think its the ones that you dont know about that youre likely to dismiss but it doesnt seem to me that way complete immuniser 13polio diphtheria tetanus and meningitis were unfamiliar to these mothers but they conjured vivid images of severe outcomes of this group immunisers parents considered their children to be at greatest risk from meningitis even though most considered it unlikely that their children would contract these diseases it was easy to imagine that if contracted the worst was likely to happenlb if m hadnt been immunised how likely do you think she would get these diseasesm well i imagine its fairly unlikely that she would get the diseases um but thats a double edged sword isnt it because having said that thats largely because theyve been for immunisation  i imagine it would be very worrying particularly some of the worst ones it would be quite frightening and thats of course the reason that you give them the immunisations complete immuniser 13the risks associated with vaccination were also perceived as being rare but rather than imagining the worst in this instance they believed that one would be unlucky to have severe reactionsthus on balance the risk of not immunising was not worth taking and a common sense approach was necessary they likened vaccination to taking other safety precautions in terms of the theories of risk respondents were perceiving the diseases as less familiar therefore dreaded and unknown and therefore possibly overestimating their risk and perceiving vaccines as more familiar and possibly underestimating their riskin contrast non-immunisers dreaded the unknown or uncertain outcomes of the vaccines with major fears being for invisibleundetectabledistant problems such as the vaccines causing leukaemia sids aids and brain damage for these parents vaccines were not only ineffective but they were actively dangerous to childrens healthbrain damage affecting limbs ive read there are long term effects which we really dont know about there are new diseases coming up polio is no longer life threatening but there are cancers and aids long term effects on the immune system and this is because we are interfering causing genetic changes non-immuniser 26they dont work and they do harm putting these things into their bodies-germs and all the other products-mercury aluminium etc cannot be good it suppressesdisrupts the childs immune system it doesnt work and it is harmful its not just the risk of the side effects but the long term effects that we dont know about now basically so many things which we did in the past we now know better and think were barbaric i would rather not do something to my child when we dont know what the long term effects might be there have been studies which have related these to leukaemia and other cancers asthma eczema and all sorts of things i dont want to do that to my child non-immuniser 19on the other hand severe outcomes of the diseases were believed to be rare or only a problem for children with poor nutrition poor sanitation and compromised immune systems non-immunisers believed it was unlikely that their children would suffer serious complications if they contracted these diseases because they had healthy immune systemsif d did get one of these diseases it wouldnt necessarily be catastrophic some people do get very sick or die but what we dont know what they dont tell us is that those children were probably not well to start with fairly sick children are more likely to get serious long term effects their health before the illness is crucial to how their bodies cope with the disease non-immuniser 19a rejection of the notion that children have to be immunised against these diseases because the disease itself will automatically be worse than the immunisation and a concern that the you know the vaccination itself can have problems non-immuniser 21for one non-immuniser who was not against using conventional medicine she believed her children were protected from disastrous consequences because they had easy access to modern medical interventionwell i just cant see the need if your child catches measles and that develops into anything else were not stuck in the middle of the country without good doctors or hospitals non-immuniser 29as reported previously both pro- and anti- immunisers were concerned about vaccines overloading even healthy but immature immune systems 16i do sort of worry that we are vaccinating too much i just worry about what it does to your immune system to all our immune systems complete immuniser 14hes still very thin but hes past the point of where i sort of see him as very vulnerablelike now im happy to give them to him incomplete immuniser 24i mean i know she is a strong as a horse and i know she could have every shot under the sun and shed be fine i just dont think its a proper thing to do  in only two-month olds non-immuniser 29as would be expected from risk perception theory diseases that were familiar to parents were not dreaded measles mumps and rubella were not considered serious or life threatening by most parents irrespective of immunisation status most mothers were familiar with these diseases they had had personal experience of these and remembered them as mildif she happened to get measles well im not that worriedbecause i had it and it was fine complete immuniser  11the motivation to immunise against these diseases was therefore less than for diseases that were unfamiliarif its a disease like measles mumps chicken pox things like that you can let them get through fine then if you got into meningitis polio well yeah youd have to think again complete immuniser 31see measles and german measles-i know that they brought the immunisation in because there are complications and there have been kids with complications but see like i remember from my generation a lot of us that was just the normal kids had the measles so i am not so sure about those two whether it is important incomplete immuniser 15measles mumps and rubella were perceived as diseases thatevery childs got to get and rather than avoid these diseases it was best to get them out of the way as early as possible especially as it was believed that these diseases were more serious in adults there was no urgency in having their children vaccinated for these diseasesthe idea of control was also used by parents to explain their choice to vaccinate one explanation for immunising given by complete immunisers was that they could not control their childrens exposure to diseases and hence it was safer to vaccinate by doing so they could control to some extent the diseases that their children were at risk of contractingi think the world of her and i thought if i can prevent her getting any of these diseases i will complete immuniser 7incomplete immunisers believed vaccination would contain or reduce the effects of disease rather than prevent it completelykids still get measles and mumps so thats the silly thing isnt it really its only to prevent it it cant cure do you know what i mean ive heard of kids still getting measles incomplete immuniser 30but it doesnt prevent the flu you still get the flu but not a strong dosage incomplete immuniser 44in contrast non-immunisers talked about being able to control their childrens environment and therefore their exposure to disease this non-immunising mother spoke of her reasons for vaccinating the family dogsbecause i cannot control what they the dogs do and what they eat i can control childs name non-immuniser 19the explanatory power of ambiguity outrage omission bias and optimistic control was also examined in these interviewsperceived lack of information or insufficiency of information should either provoke outrage 30 or hesitation from acting 33 participants provided examples of both lack of information about susceptibility to vaccine side effects caused mothers in some instances to refrain from vaccinating their child or to hesitate about immunisation one mother had hesitated to immunise her second child until she could be reassured that he would not have severe side effects from the vaccine she had reason to believe he would be particularly susceptible to such side effects because he was not robust he had many food allergies and his father had collapsed after immunisation as an infant she expressed an equivalent concern about the childs susceptibility to disease especially as he had a school-aged sibling who could expose him to disease the major reason for her hesitation was that no one had seriously considered her questions or considered her sons case on an individual basisi want someone to look at him as an individual and i dont feel that they are the medical communityi dont want people making the decisions for me i want that information available so that i can make an informed choice non- immuniser 18being aware that children could react to the mmr vaccine but not being told what that reaction was or what to expect also caused some hesitation with some mothers some mothers hesitated about immunising against hepatitis b which was at the time of the study recommended for at risk groups it was unclear to these mothers what this phrase meant and if it applied to their childreni believe he should have the hepatitis one cause if he comes in contact with another child thats got it but they say hes not at risk but what makes him not at risk to get it so ive been umming and aahing whether to get that onecomplete immuniser 10the reverse of hesitating to act because of insufficient information was shown by others who figuratively shut their eyes to the information about vaccine risk because it was unsettlingi think honestly speaking this sounds stupid but i think well i dont want to hear it about side effects because it scares me i know it might be stupid because you think well you know theyre sposed to have it but if you start thinking well what if you know if this happens and that happens well then you wont immunise your children so theres a risk i sposeincomplete immuniser 42another response to a perception of insufficient information was anger or outrage during the interview some mothers apologised for not being better informed about diseasesothers were angry at their lack of knowledge about diseases and vaccines this anger was not directed at themselves but at unspecified others anger was more often expressed by non-immunisers who believed that drug companies and doctors knew vaccines were not safe but kept the information from the publicwhether parents choose not to act when action may cause harm was explored this was done with the use of two statements-describing whether 1 it would be worse to have your child die due to your action immunise or 2 it would be worse due to inaction die from disease see methods section for statements both statements presented uncomfortable possibilities to parentsyou cant  i mean as far as im concerned you lose a child you lose it and its painful either way i like to think that ive done the best i can to protect him from it um and if you know its because of the injection well to some degree im fatalistic i mean if its meant to be its meant to be theres not much you can do about it but i would rather know that ive taken every precaution i can instead of you know leaving him open and susceptible to these thingslb some people say they would vaccinate because they would feel worse if their child died from an illness which they could have preventedpossibly i would sit in that category complete immuniser 1most parents irrespective of the immunisation status of their children identified more with the second statement with only a few parents identifying with the firstid have to agree with that i think if youve given birth to a perfect healthy child and then youve introduced foreign substances into their body which has then damaged them in some way ah yeah i dont know i dont think i could live with myself whereas if theyve caught the disease thats kind of cest la vie you know i mean its still awful its still a great tragedy especially if you do lose them but i think thats that if you talk about metaphysics i believe in metaphysics and all the rest of it so id sort of say well theyre meant to be here theyre meant to experience it theyre meant to deal with it or not deal with it depending on what theyre here for so i have to take a philosophical approach itd be devastating non-immuniser 32opposite to what would be predicted many of the non-immunisers disagreed with the first statement and were adamant that this did not form part of their reason not to immunisefather i think you would be foolish to reach that conclusion i mean were not foolish i couldnt possibly say that i would be more comfortable with the you knowmother the child dying or at least you know that he died from the diseasefather yeah a natural thing rather than induced yeah thats where the natural therapy philosophy goes too farthat would never be reason to not immunisemother no for not immunising him yes i cant even relate to it as a distinction non-immunisers 27the main reasons parents gave for not agreeing with the first statement was the perception that this scenario was unlikely to occur and irrespective of immunisation status most parents believed they had done everything they could to prevent disease thus parents used their perceptions of the risks of the outcome of death from vaccine or the risk of getting the disease to explain their choiceno well id feel well i think that thats part of the risk that there is a small risk that your child will have a reaction to the immunisation thats thats minimal compared to the risk of them getting the disease if you dont immunise so id always opt to immunise complete immuniser 5i think youve got more to me i think shes got more of a chance getting something not being vaccinated than shes a healthy little girl isnt she complete immuniser7for those who agreed with statement 1 they based this on their belief that there was a greater risk from vaccines so the first statement was the more likely scenarioparticipants responses to the two hypothetical radio news items was concordant with the theories that perception of risk may be influenced by an unrealistic optimism about ones own risks or unrealistic perception of control over ones life the participants generally did not believe that they would be at risk from the flu they believed themselves to be healthy not susceptible to flu and that they were strong enough to fight it offi tend to think that couldnt happen to me cause im young and healthy and couldnt possibly die of fluits a few cases dying and that happens complete immuniser 13although the scenarios were written specifically so that those being interviewed fitted the at risk group the participants did not identify with this group they believed that the people who suffered serious consequences of flu were different to themselves when they heard similar items on the news they assumed the people who were badly affected were old frail sick had not been eating well had poor immune systems low resistance or were people who did not look after their healthit says doctors recommend all should be vaccinated especially those who are overworked stressed and tired well of course they would be the ones whose immune systems would not cope non-immuniser 19all non-immunisers believed the risk of this hypothetical flu vaccine was higher than the risk of the disease but some immunisers also perceived high risk and little benefit from the vaccine they related incidents of relatives who had bad experiences after receiving a flu injection they believed that there were other ways of reducing the risk of flu such as taking supplements improving lifestyle and avoiding people with the disease those who did believe their family to be at risk of this flu already received annual flu injections with the occurrence of serious illness in these families prompting them to have flu vaccinesparticipants were also asked whether knowing someone who had the illness and had been very ill would affect their decision to immunise against this hypothetical flu again the response was that it would depend on the state of the friends health and their habits whether they were unhealthy or stressed or careless of their health while it would be more concerning to hear of a friend who was ill most did not think it would mean they themselves were more at riskin the second news item the at risk group was children under five all parents stated this item of news would be of greater concern to them their first action however would be to seek more information from their health advisers before immunising the risk of their children becoming ill was more important than the risk to themselves and all believed that their responsibility as parents was to do everything they could to protect their children this responsibility made it stressful to make decisions for children because you cant afford to make the wrong choice and one cant take risks for ones children where one might take risks for oneselfim not prepared to risk them i can control my risks non- immuniser 29youve got to take the risk to prevent them getting sick incomplete immuniser 20take all the risk factors out of it and make sure they have a good life incomplete immuniser 34because i am so much more protective of their health than mine i am concerned that they dont have the option of making choices as easily as i do and that is why i would like to make informed choices and i feel like if i make the wrong choice for yourself and that is something that i wear i am responsible for it if i make the wrong choice for them it is more serious non-immuniser 21there was however a reluctance to immunise many believed there was an over-reliance on immunisations and antibiotics and that they would only immunise if the disease was widespread or local statewide if it were not widespread it was not worth the risk of preventative medicinetable 3 summarises the factors found to influence the decision to immunise and corresponding aspects of the explanatory theories used as a theoretical framework for this study in this table we aim to show how the information from risk perception and decision making under uncertainty allow for a greater explanation or point to more nuanced action for example consideration of unfamiliarity with diseases would be part of the health belief models framework of considering perceived severity however the health belief model does not explain or allow us to understand what people perceive as familiar or unfamiliar one might think that if parents are not familiar with a disease they may not think it is serious whereas subjective perception of risk would indicate that the reverse may be operating unfamiliarity increases peoples perception of risk similarly where parents dont think their child is susceptible to the disease a health belief model construct the idea of having optimistic control helps to explain why they might think thisin considering the news reports respondents were asked how many would several deaths be to cause them to worry about the risks of the disease it was difficult for the participants to respond to this question meaningfully and the production of these numbers was somewhat arbitrary most were not comfortable giving their response and many could not say for instance one couple said they could give an answer if it was needed to meet the research requirements but it would be meaningless the numbers given varied from only one or two deaths five in the state or between one and ten percent others gave figures of more than fifty percent of those who got the disease would have to die for them to be concernedthe question was useful however because it provoked participants to define the type of information they wanted in order to make sense of reports such as those they had just heard for instance they said their response to the number of deaths would depend on how similar to their own circumstances were those who had died did they live in australia victoria or developed countries were those who were dying previously healthy people or those who were sick and thus more susceptible was it a familiar disease flu or rare ebola virus if it was unfamiliar it was frightening if it was familiar flu they wanted to know the details of who it was who had died or suffered complications thus it was not the statistics that were important for deciding on risk but the characteristics of those who had the disease and the familiarity or unfamiliarity of the diseasethis study has used qualitative methods to determine if aspects of theories of risk and decision-making can help to explain parents decisions about immunising their children traditionally qualitative research has been associated with the generation rather than the testing of hypotheses however this denies a major strength of qualitative research which is to examine theories in the light of data as such it is a method suited to producing understanding and to generating solutions to problems 34 we believe this method therefore is appropriate to provide a greater understanding of complexities of decision making and perceptions of disease and vaccines and a depth of information not available from large scale quantitatively based surveys the benefits of using the qualitative method described in this study is the large quantity of detailed information it provides however using a small non-randomly selected sample can present problems in determining the generalisabilty of the ensuing information the results of this study confirm complement and extend the findings of other studies in this area 453637the data that this paper draws on were collected in the late 1990s and some may wonder at their currency we believe that this might be a problem if the focus of the paper was about which diseases or vaccines are an issue with scares and controversies these can change over time the point of this paper however has been to examine the utility of synthesizing theories of health protective behaviours risk perception and decision-making while we recognise that different socio-temporal contexts may create different issues eg the impact of the mmr controversy was substantially greater in the uk than australia we argue that the approach we have taken in this paper provides a framework for us to make sense of peoples reactions to and perceptions of old and new diseases and vaccinations at any time we therefore think this work can contribute to and be of particular importance in informing the public health approaches to new flu epidemics it provides data supporting commentary and critique of the current public health approach to the issues of vaccine risk and immunisation uptake being that continued provision of better risk information is not the answer 7we have found and would argue that the theories of risk perception and aspects of decision-making under uncertainty have been useful for understanding the differences and similarities between pro-immunisers and non-immunisers except for the issue of omission bias parents in this study whether immunisers or not generally did not agree that a negative outcome was preferable or more acceptable from inaction this finding raises some doubts about the methods andor generalisability of findings from studies of this phenomenon which usually involve multiple similar hypothetical situations with limited contextual information presented in mathematical and probabilistic language participants in this study responded to these omission bias statements by generally denying that either contributed to their decision to immunise their childsimilar findings to this study have been reported by others 3-537 and have important implications for how public health addresses the issues of trust and communicates risk information as others have noted there is more to risk communication than providing more facts about risks 34723 to paraphrase hobson-west from these studies and critiques it is clear that education is not the main policy tool and ignorance is not the main enemy for maintaining immunisation uptake p 279 23drawing on the aspects of subjective perceptions of risk and decision-making under uncertainty we believe the following needs to be considered in communicating risk information and health messagesfacts and figures are not interpreted or acted upon rationally dread catastrophic potential and familiarity with the risk influences interpretation and actionpeople act as lay epidemiologists thus providing information about risks as though everyone has the same risk makes the advice unbelievable and can be discountedparents are more willing to take risks about their own health than with their childrens health but this greater caution about their childrens health does not automatically mean they will accept medical interventionfrom the theory of subjective perception of risk people may well be wary of novel vaccines or therapies manmade versus natural risks hence there may be some hesitation in the uptake of such vaccinespeople will discount their risks-the people affected are not like me this may have implications for how people will assess their risk of being badly affected by any outbreak of new strains of influenza such as h1n1clear communication which involves listening to and not dismissing peoples concerns is valuedthis study has shown that there is a need to understand and take into account how people subjectively perceive risks and how that influences their decision-making in order to understand their choices and behaviours theories of risk perception and decision-making can help to explain differences in perceptions of severity and susceptibility of diseases and vaccines importantly this study has found that health messages about the risks of disease which are communicated as though there is equality of risk in the population may be unproductive as these messages are perceived as unbelievable or irrelevant the findings from this study have implications beyond the issue of childhood vaccinations as we grapple with communicating risks of new epidemics using and developing a more complex theoretical approach to public health issues may increase the likelihood we can understand the barriers to action and develop effective methods of communicating risk and delivering acceptable public health interventions and indeed may usefully contribute to the current debates especially in the uk of how these theories of risk and decision-making can be used to nudge other health behaviours 3839lb holds csl ltd shares tn is chair of the australian technical advisory group on immunisation and undertakes

department of wuhan central hospital during the covid-19 epidemic i have been an ordinary front-line doctor since the outbreak of the epidemic my orthopaedic colleagues and i have supported both the intensive isolation unit and the light disease ward of the mobile cabin hospital the team is temporary the ward is new and many difficulties have arisen after weeks of fighting it seemed we had finally settled into a routine if a grim one this changed when i received a call from a young nurse in my department she was crying she had just received word that she had an abnormal ct lung screening i didnt know how to comfort her her coworkers were avoiding her yesterdays colleagues abandoned today i tried to calm her down with a joke it didnt help to avoid infecting her parents at home she planned to stay in a hotel and i helped her find a place to stay upon learning the news her parents were tearful overwrought they wanted to come see her but of course they could not making matters worse she later learned that a close family member caught the virus from her and that family member was even more ill than she was stories like this came in one after the next yesterdays

compostela galicia spaini work at a university hospital in galicia in the northwest of spain and here the last several months have been distressing indeed as the number of patients with covid-19 increased so rapidly in the early weeks of the epidemic and as so many of them required hospitalization and critical careespecially in madrid and cataloniai wondered whether our public health system would have the capacity and the means to care for them my second wave of concern was for the number of health professionals who became infected in the course of their duties and the thought that perhaps this could have been prevented if we had not had such a shortage of personal protective equipment most recently and most poignantly ive been thinking about the many older frail patients who have died from this illness many of them were institutionalized and so perhaps less visible to society more broadly this is a lonely way to die and these deaths whether visible or invisible but always in loneliness reminded me of this cri-de-coeur from a palliative care specialist in my country nunca olviden ustedes que los cuidados que un pueblo suministra a sus ciudadanos ms pobres ms indefensos

decade of life they each came to the hospital with delirium and dehydration and later developed fever id known them both for 12 years writing a condolence card to each family will help provide closure for me but many of my patients who have had covid-19 have already recovered and this keeps me optimistic one a frail older veteran called me right after his symptoms resolved to offer to donate plasma

a surgical patient with lumbar spinal stenosis he had no viral symptoms when he was admitted five days later he had a high fever and was diagnosed with covid-19 but not before five of my colleagues contracted the disease in the course of caring for him i was quarantined at home for 2 weeks because of close contact the number of patients with covid-19 overwhelmed the healthcare system here in wuhan and more than 40000 medical staff from other cities came to here to help us most of my colleagues were also assigned to take care of the patients with coronavirus including the spine surgeons although elective surgery of course is suspended demands on our system have even resulted in delays for urgent surgery in recent days i have done six spinal operations for different conditionscervical

earthquake and nuclear accidents in 2011 but theyre not the same no one knows when an earthquake will happen while we know the peak of the covid-19 surge will hit tokyo in few weeks this gives us time for preparation viruses do not destroy roads rail tracks or buildings and i dont expect a sudden disruption of electricity supplies or distribution networks when the earthquake hit we learned that cts

an infectious diseases specialist responsible for the covid-19 infection-control team at my hospital so i am working on this epidemic full time everything else has stopped the hours are long and the days are challenging because of the many logistical issues involved we cope with new crises every day it is exhausting by the time i get home each night i am spentphysically and emotionally but home life recharges me and is a source of constancy our son is still in high school but my daughter is in college now because of the epidemic she has moved back home with us i love seeing our two kids together again being best friends we are a connected supportive family i make time to eat dinner with them each evening then return to email until the inbox is empty then i fall asleep in 2016 i climbed mt everest and the mountain has haunted my dreams each night since then until now i used to fall asleep listening to the avalanches feeling the glacier move beneath me and waking up expecting to be in my tent at high camp no longer i no longer dream of the mountain or of my beautiful family now there is only one dream covid-19 night after night i bathe in a deep unrelenting fear that my colleagues will become infected if i fail to make the right decisions with our protection plans i must keep them safe people ask how it felt climbing mt everestwas it difficult yes but covid-19 is so much harder more grinding utterly exhausting i know this will pass but now at the crest of the wave that passing still looks to be a long way awayzhen-sheng ma md orthopaedic surgeonxijing hospial xian chinawhen i received the invitation to write this postcard i was taking part in our traditional qingming festival which in english would be called tomb sweeping festival its a time to pay respects to the dead and it is considered a major spring festival based on the chinese lunar calendar it occurred in early april this year around that same time china held a national day of mourning for the martyrshealthcare workers and otherswho have died in the fight against the novel coronavirus as of april 8th in china we have 83162 confirmed patients with covid-19 and 3342 have died as of now it appears that the epidemic in china has been controlled and after 76 days of quarantine wuhan city the epicenter in china has lifted the lockdown all of china is once again running after a 2-month hiatus though it is impossible to know if this will remain the case during the epidemic all citizens of china were ordered to stay home when possible to go outside only when absolutely necessary and to wear masks when in the community compliance with the mask guideline was so good that even now when we go to work or to buy things in the supermarket if we do not wear a mask we feel naked perhaps more importantly we wont be allowed into places like supermarkets without one it appears that as of the time im writing this early april 2020 the cdc has endorsed this approach 3 but from what my friends in france germany and the us tell me mask usage in the community in those countries is inconsistent i dont understand why as an aside though an important one ive also read and heard firsthand stories about asian people in western countries experiencing discrimination even violence perhaps in part for wearing masks i understand that many asian people adopted this practice early in those locations this is wrong and hearing these stories makes me sad the sars-cov-2 virus knows nothing about culture this is a time to work together and to take sensible steps in each of our communities to care for one anothershuichi matsuda md phd orthopaedic surgeonkyoto university kyoto japanas of this writing early april 2020 surgeons here still are performing elective procedures with some restrictions the number of patients confirmed to have covid-19 is increasing though the number remains low compared to those in the us and european countries but we fear that many patients have gone undiagnosed because public access to the pcr test for covid-19 is extremely limited by the policy of the japanese government the government believes that seeing too many patients with covid-19 who have only mild symptoms would overwhelm hospitals and so energy instead is focused on arranging medical staff rooms and medical devices for treating patients with serious symptoms whose numbers will rapidly increase in the near future in daily life we are advised to avoid nonessential outings but the city is not under lockdown or quarantine as of now its fair to say no one knows what the best approach is well only be able to tell the people in the future what we learned japan has a very sad past in 2011 we lost more than 18000 people in one day to a huge earthquake and the tsunami that followed one small village however lost fewer lives because the townspeople obeyed directions written on a local stone monument do not build any homes below this point 1 the waves stopped just below the stone this monument was built at the time of a previous huge tsunami in 1933 hundreds of such tsunami stones some more than six centuries old dot the northeastern coast of japan some places heeded these lessons of the past but many were too confident about advanced technology and higher seawalls and forgot the old warnings in 2020 it appears that we have been overconfident in our belief that advanced medical technology is the only or best answer instead it seems that older approachesmaintaining social distance and handwashingwill be a big part of any solution here someday perhaps we will build a monument saying how we survived the covid-19 pandemicmegan e anderson md orthopaedic surgeonbeth israel deaconess medical center and boston childrens hospital boston usawhat strikes me about life now amidst the pandemic is a dichotomy of existences with reversed experiences on the one hand is my virtual life using online connections where i meet with patients to evaluate their tumors and guide their rehabilitation and with colleagues and staff to stay current on policies and safe practices but instead of being cold and impersonal i find that i can look at my patients their caregivers and my colleagues directly in the eye via the video camera indeed i am looking so much more at their faces that i seem to pick up more of their stresses and concerns than when i would see them in person when i might have been distracted by other things surprisingly at least to me these virtual encounters are welcoming and friendly with happy safe patients at home grateful for continued medical care and happy safe staff who can achieve more distance than we thought possible while still sharing warm exchanges contrast to this my actual life non-covid care continues during the crisis but it has changed halls at the hospital are empty and the few coworkers i see are in masks and rarely even nod hello patients with cancer from all the services are gathered together on one floor as there are no elective patients in the hospital anymore wards have been converted to care for patients with coronavirus people seem stressed and raw and the hospitals seem dark and cold even at home roles are different and more stressful ive changed from working mother someone who could savor every delightful nonwork moment with my family to home-school home-organization dictator my hope is that going forward in life after covid-19 if that does become a reality i can pull the best parts from both of these existences into some sort of new melded reality to become a better doctor surgeon mother

few patients had yet been diagnosed with covid-19 here in lombardy italy bad feelings were in the air on march 11th all of italy was placed under lockdown it was a shock within days my institute was transformed into a covid-19 hospital with more than 250 patients hospitalized and military medical tents placed at the entrance of our emergency department what should an orthopaedic surgeon do in such a situation the answer actually wasnt difficult it is pretty clear that our category is almost useless as we fight this war against an invisible agent i had to rethink my role and try to help to those who were and are really fighting on the front line internists and anestesiologists both on the wards and in the intensive care unit icu i had to recall old knowledge going all the way back to medical school this helped me to rediscover a true sense of collaboration among physicians nurses and medical personnel in a setting where each of us came in with different backgrounds now on the

surgeonhospital universitario la paz universidad autnoma de madrid madrid spaini work in a large tertiary-care hospital in madrid spain despite the available information from italy which appeared to be 1 week ahead in terms of pandemic-related suffering nobody in madrid imagined we would be so seriously hit then everything changed the orthopaedic department abruptly transformed as the hospital had to admit more and more patients with covid-19 on march 17th we had 269 inpatients with covid-19 and 57 in the emergency room by march 28th those numbers were 803 with covid-19 in the hospital 103 of whom were in the icu and 198 in the er half the faculty and residents of the orthopaedic department were serving in the er or on wards to support the internists by providing care or meeting with families we established a rotating team to take care of trauma in the er and the operating rooms and urgentemergent surgery continued as needed though elective surgery has long since stopped still there were hard decisions admitting older patients with hip fractures risked nosocomial covid-19 infections and soon patients with covid-19 dominated the surgical list the good news as of today april 3rd is that the numbers seem to be improving while we now have 140 patients with covid-19 in the icu the hospital has doubled its capacity by blocking the operating rooms to host patients needing ventilators there are only 73 patients with covid-19 awaiting admission from in the er all the same the orthopaedic team felt the pressure as several surgeons and residents in our department tested covid  and now are quarantined so many questions remain when will we be able to return to delivering full care how many patients will deteriorate or die between now and then will there be as-yet undiscovered musculoskeletal complications but one lesson we learned in the recent past is that orthopaedic surgeons as physicians and human beings must adapt together during crises if we are to have any hope of sharing a futurechoon chiet hong mbbs frcsedorth orthopaedic surgeonnational university hospital of singaporeit has been an eventful 12 weeks since the first patient with covid-19 was diagnosed in singapore on january 23rd 2020 disease outbreak control measures were introduced quickly by the government and we put in place containment measures early and avoided sustained community transmission however in the past 1 to 2 weeks there has been a second wave of covid-19 among singaporeans returning from overseas resulting in increased local transmission the government responded with this by activating a circuit breaker with stricter measures to reduce risks of a larger outbreak as of today we have 1375 patients who have been diagnosed with covid-19 and six deaths colleagues have been quarantined after being exposed and orthopaedic surgeons have been called to help out in busier departments including the emergency department infectious diseases and icus those left in the department have covered their colleagues duties in managing patients with orthopaedic emergencies trauma infections and tumors surgical procedures are being triaged based on their urgency and more outpatient surgery is being performed to reduce the hospital census because hospital beds are needed for patients with covid-19 doctors nurses cleaners porters contact tracing teams and many others are working hard together to combat the virus but healthcare workers alone cannot stop the virus transmission community members making good choices are the first line of defense against this invisible

call to serve and it may come my exposure to the virus has thus far been limited those who answer the call to duty in trying times are not to be forgotten i agree with arthur ashe true heroism is remarkably sober very undramatic it is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost but the urge to serve others at whatever costnicol martinelli md orthopaedic surgeongaleazzi orthopedic institute milan italymy hospital is located 40 kilometers from bergamo the epicenter of the italian epidemic other than trauma and cancer most orthopaedic surgery was suspended early before long hospitals in this area were overcrowded with patients symptomatic from covid-19 and many patients on the trauma service who needed fracture surgery likewise were covid  although our specialty had been fragmented by subspecialization before all this surgeons quickly rediscovered strong community bonds subspecialists like myself volunteered for shifts in the first aid department to decrease the pressure on trauma surgeons who bore a tremendous burden of care to those patients with covid-19 who presented with surgical injuries several of my colleagues caught the virus and although we want to help patients we all bear the fear of getting sick as well as of transmitting the disease to our families this is a source of great distress in terms of the care we deliver it is sometimes necessarily below the normal level this is particularly true for diseases requiring a multidisciplinary approach such as with patients who have orthopaedic infections our colleagues in infectious diseases are stretched very thin we depend on the empathy and support from family members and friends these bonds encourage me to stay positive and persist with my job we dont know what will happen but we as surgeons and caregivers must remain focused on our dutiesthis manuscript represents the transcript of a webinar-virtual summit1 originally presented on march 31 2020 to an audience of over 1000 many listeners world-wide requested the written transcript this represents an edited version of the presentationsthe panel was comprised of the following disaster experts from italy and the united states 1 luca ragazzoni md phd - emergency and disaster medicine physician and faculty at the research center for emergency and disaster medicine in novara italy very close to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 epicenter 2 james phillips md facep - emergency and disaster medicine physician section chief and fellowship director of disaster and operational medicine at the george washington university school of medicine and health sciences washington dc usa also a medical analyst on the cable news network cnn atlanta georgia usa 3 greg burel - public health administrator and former director of the us strategic national stockpile office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response aspr washington dc usa now president and principal consultant at hamilton grace llc consulting group 4 frederick skip burkle jr md - retired professor and now senior fellow and scientist at the harvard humanitarian initiative th chan school of public health boston massachusetts usa and global scholar at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars washington dc usathe four panelists were asked three questions regarding the current pandemic as follows1what do you see as a particular issue of concern during the current pandemic2what do you see as a particular strength during the current pandemic3if you could change one thing about the way that the pandemic response is occurring what would you change
panelists responses were collected transcribed and minimally edited for grammatical flow not content this is a manuscript of that transcription the summit was moderated by dr mark keim ceo disasterdoc llc and adjunct assistant professor emory university rollins school of public health atlanta georgia usacovid-19 is now a pandemic that has reached over 100 countries in a matter of weeks italy despite having an advanced health care system is almost at point break the situation here is very critical patients are being treated in hospital corridors hospital departments have been converted to treat only covid-19 patients many doctors and nurses are working outside of their field of expertise and we are not able to provide the same quality of care as we usually do of course now we know that the intensive care unit icu is one of the most stressed hospital units however what is concerning me is that there is not enough attention on the prehospital setting primary health care family doctors and emergency medical services ems have key roles to alleviate the burden at the hospital before the admission additionally so many doctors and nurses are working outside of their field of expertise that we are not able to provide the same quality of care as we usually dowe cannot expect that africa would respond like china us and europe we cannot ask all the countries to buy ventilators where there are no icus and there are a maximum two intensivists in the whole country we need to differentiate the response and allocate the right resources according to the countrywhat we do after we discharge patients from hospitals is really important in italy we need to increase the importance of the role of the prehospital setting how do we continue care unfortunately currently there is little known about how long the patients need assistance and for how long they remain covid-19 positive we need to plan in advance for home care for the patients or at least create a new health facility to admit patients that are not able to stay at home alone and of course what is concerning me apart from the specific issue of the prehospital setting is the global lack of personal protective equipment ppe in italy were having issues trying to find enough ppe for the family physicians for the prehospital setting and the hospital staff everyday there is a critical lack of ppe as well as a misunderstanding of the importance of this issue these are in my opinion my concerns currentlythere are several things that i see as particular concerns right now ppe is a critical one not only in the united states where its talked about constantly on every major network but around the world we talk about europe and china and the united states ad nauseam but lets not forget africa lets not forget south america these are places where some of this equipment doesnt even exist i saw somewhere today that theres an african country liberia that has only three ventilators so equipment represents a major concern globally but in particular ppe is key in the united states where we are rationing it in every hospital also i must emphasize that we are using ppe in a manner that is not consistent with the standard of care what this means is not that patient treatment is suffering necessarily but that provider protection is suffering i go into work and i put on a mask and i wear it for eight hours i take it off halfway through one time to have an energy drink to keep going it smells bad after you eat or drink something and after hours it becomes hard to breathe through it makes you very fatigued and it sometimes makes you breathless to have a conversation with your patient you cant understand what anybody is saying in your work area which has been problematic during critical interventionswe have seen an outpouring from people who are trying to make ppe for us but i dont even know how to begin to advise them as we cannot wear most of it i get emails daily from people trying to manufacture cloth masks for us some are using 3d printers and girl scout troops to make face shields for us its incredible and heartwarming and is one of the small bits of hope that we have right now as health care providers especially when theres so much disappointing and disheartening news i do not understand how we can assemble all the power and wealth of the united states to go to the moon or to develop the manhattan project yet we havent even considered doing the same thing to manufacture ppe and ventilators there are a lot of people working hard on this pandemic but i still think that we havent pulled out all the stops the defense production act is a useful tool but i think if i were in charge i would be a little less worried about the economy in the short term id be more worried about immediately cranking out millions of masks from every textile manufacturer in the united states we need to raise the curve on ppe production while we try to flatten the curve on the spread of this infection and if we end up with surplus thats what makes us great - because then we can share it with other countrieswhile the production process for ppe and ventilators is obviously a concern for us we are additionally concerned about the ethical decisions that we as physicians may be facing as resources run short - when we start talking about rationing italy has certainly started that conversation its anesthesiology society published its concerns and guidelines and that has generated talk here in the united states i think it was new york university nyu new york usa hospital whose rationing policy was leaked to the media raising publicly the potential need for us choosing who gets a ventilatorthis distressing issue is why we as physicians need to have our professional societies medical organizations and perhaps even the centers for disease control and prevention cdc atlanta georgia usa weigh in and provide us ethical guidelines so my colleagues and i are not making ad hoc decisions in the heat of the battle we may be forced to decide which one of three patients needs the last remaining ventilator a policeman a mother or the priest  how do we decide as it stands now i alone must choose who gets that ventilator we need help so that were not burdened the rest of our lives by having to make those terrible decisionscrisis leadership matters once you lie you lose your credibility and its hard to get it back i turn to my television to watch the president and the task force every single day and i am disappointed our incident commander the president is failing in his ability to communicate the issues at hand instead i find myself simply waiting to hear from dr fauci every day so that way i at least hear something i can believe we need better crisis leadership at the very top and so i think that one of the lessons we learn from this is the importance that at the highest levels it cannot be about politics its about crisis leadershipwe also need to address and include all-cause mortality theres a lot of people who are going to die from covid-19 who are never infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov-2 virus instead they will die as a result of the burden on our health care systems the implications of delayed ambulances and reduced resources could mean dying of a disease or trauma process that when in non-pandemic times they would otherwise have been saved heroin overdoses that didnt get narcan in time severe pediatric allergic reactions that dont get epinephrine trauma in general all those events may happen and were not including those victims right now in the death rate from this pandemic but they should be counted these are my biggest concerns that i wish we could addressi echo the concerns about the availability of ppe today i remain concerned about the availability of other material we will need as we move forward in this event for example if there is a vaccine that becomes available or if there are therapeutics that become available were going to need additional needles and syringes - far more than we normally need during the seasonal flu campaign there are limitations on all products but let me go back to the ppe i agree that the fact that we have limited ppe available for our front-line personnel trying to deal with this problem is just unconscionable the reason i see behind this dilemma is that the medical supply chain is very fragile and people dont really understand that its fragile within all links of the supply chain what we know about that supply chain is evident for most products such as chronic disease medications and ppe  from the point of dispensing all the way back to the manufacturer there is never more than about 30 days of projected need for the entire market available its a very cost-effective system i think its great when you do that for auto parts i think its great when you do that for other materials that are not essential to protect and save lives but when we talk about the medical supply chain we begin to recognize that problem number one is there is no safety stock there is no back stock there is no margin for error in that just-in-time delivery of product at any link in the supply chain - all the way from the point-of-care to a distributor or to a manufacturer that has caused a lot of the problems we have today about getting this vital materiel coming out of this on the other side were going to have to really rethink the entire health care supply chain do we need to optimize so much for cost or do we need to consider optimizing the costs so that we dont ever have this kind of a problem in the future but there are other problems with that supply chain we are reliant on so many products that are made offshore that are no longer available for manufacturers or have very limited manufacturer availability in the united states and this is something that many of us have been discussing for years theres been congressional testimony around this problem as well as at the national academy of sciences washington dc usa and many other fora weve got to find a way to get more of this materiel made in the united states maybe not all of it but weve got to find a way to protect ourselves better from that supply chain perspective i think another particular issue of concern goes back to misinformation there is misinformation and confusion about what the government is doing and not doing what the strategic national stockpile can and cant do and a variety of other issues too weve got to get better about controlling information so that people see the right thing up first and credibleone there was and remains a distinct difference in how countries ruled by authoritarian regimes initially managed the early evidence of the pandemic versus democratically ruled countries and as one further investigates this it becomes obvious that in great part this is a symptom of how both define public healthin democracies public health is defined by priorities to improve protect and provide services public health infrastructure and programs in authoritarian regimes public health services prevention preparedness and response are inextricably seen and practiced through political and economic imperatives always leading to compromises in health and public health security currently the world has the fewest democracies ever recorded and the united states is currently defined as a flawed democracy and is becoming more authoritarian every daywith this pandemic i believe it is fair to say that there is a general lack of confidence among health care providers world-wide because for most this is their first experience in population-based care for the most part they never studied them in medical or nursing schools in past decades with lower population densities infectious disease outbreaks epidemics and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by large natural disasters predatory animals and war mine was in 1968 vietnam with an epidemic of bubonic plague that not only stopped the war on both sides it emptied the city and village streets of people for many weeks while it was the worst plague epidemic of the 20th century it was politically kept quiet once rare zoonotic spread that is between animal reservoirs and human animals through outbreaks epidemics and pandemics now make up 71 or more of new diseases globally they have grown because of massive growth in population numbers and density which are accelerated further by rapid unsustainable urbanization biodiversity loss and climate change and for the first time we have an increasing number of vulnerable populations that are suffering from chronic deficiencies in food water and energy we have never seen those numbers beforeand lastly which i will introduce you to in more depth in discussing the next question the loss of the world health organization who geneva switzerland and the international health regulations treatys independent leadership established under the united nations has been devastating what they were initially organized to do decades ago globally is now absent they have given their previous leadership role over to political powerhouses across the world because they are monetarily dependent on them to me in the long term this is the most telling issue of concern for us as practitioners and for the future of global public healththis current webinar is an example of what i see as a particular strength during the current pandemic we are sharing knowledge we are sharing experience and we can teach others and explain to others how to prepare in advance ill give you an example when we had the first cases here in novara we started to prepare and to convert the hospital to assist covid-19 patients we were treating the first patients in icu and expecting the waves and we had a discussion with colleagues everywhere in the world for example from sweden we had a long talk with johan von schreeb - karolinska institutet solna sweden and health officers there and according to our suggestions they prepared in advance few days ago i received a message from johan saying thanks a lot luca and professor della corte to help us in preparing ourselves and to increase the icu capacity and we had other webinars like this one to help others i think to share knowledge is a real strength right nowand of course the science we need to remember everyone disaster medicine is a science and we need to follow the sciences that are now available in the literature and in my opinion now there is real added value for everyone and of course i have to echo what james said the willingness of the health care professionals to respond is amazing right now here in italy it is spectacular we had a call for physicians for nurses to help in hospitals we called 300 physicians and nurses and we received 9000 responses the willingness to help is unbelievablei have to start with the front-line providers - the doctors and nurses at the local level are stepping up and showing their courage you know as we say in the disaster medicine world all disasters are local - and while i emphasize the fact that were lacking in leadership at the federal level the good news is locally thats not the case i know that every hospital is different theres nothing even remotely one-size-fits-all about this pandemic there are differences between academic hospitals non-academic hospitals and critical access hospitals but where i work at george washington university hospital we have a robust disaster medicine program that was in place long before i joined a faculty team including anthony mcintyre bruno petinaux dan hanfling and joe barbera - so our hospital is very well-versed in preparing for these crises im able to watch our emergency manager our local leader provide great leadership getting our hospital prepared both behind the scenes and in public im able to interact with our nurses and technicians both in the emergency department and the icu who are all preparing however as is being shown in the media we see courage knowing that many have been told to wear ppe in a way that is not consistent with the standard of care yet they do not hesitate to go in to treat the most ill of patients but it is taking toll on us i received an email a few minutes ago saying that we need coverage for tonight at one of our hospitals because one of my colleagues is now sick with covid-19 symptomswe are just at the tip of what were going to see here in washington dc evident when we see the incredible evidence of whats taking place in new york but i am encouraged witnessing planeloads full of medical workers flying into new york to volunteer to work its absolutely incredible i also appreciate governor cuomo displaying what i think is very good crisis leadership and this will be proved true when we look back through the long list of after-action reportsfollowing this pandemic i think one of the things were going to see as a silver lining is the expertise provided through telemedicine i think that the world will never be the same in relation to the telehealth system allowing doctors to provide care remotely and in a more efficient manner  and now without a financial loss which is critical also reducing associated regulations has been keyas the former director of the strategic national stockpile i guess somewhat selfishly that the first thing i see that we do have is the strategic national stockpile in the united states while currently theres a lot of criticism that it doesnt have enough of everything the strategic national stockpile is the most-ready of any global stockpile that were aware of its one of the crown jewels in our preparedness system no its not perfect but every other country looks at us and asks us what we do and how to create their own however admittedly the problem that is facing us right now is that the strategic national stockpile has been chronically underfunded for years and we hope we see that improve i think another particular strength that were seeing and its been alluded to before is the way that people all across the united states and in other countries as well are coming together to try to help solve some of these problems there are limitations to what you can do but the fact that people are willing to step up and try is a major strengthi think were seeing more people trying to abide by the remain in place and isolate yourself policy to a certain extent than what we might have thought we would weve got people doing some crazy things out there but youre always going to have that a final strength i see right now is the decision that the federal emergency management agency fema washington dc usa can respond to biological events in 2009 when we responded to h1n1 they didnt have that capability so i think fema leading the national response framework and bringing together the whole of government to try to address this problem puts us in a better position than we would have been otherwise we must remember its their first experience there are going to be hiccups and theyre going to be things that we need to go back and look at as many of us know as these after-action hot washes go well beat ourselves to death for several years over it but i think that this is good i think its brought new capability to a table that might not have been there before this whole of government response i think is going to be important to us moving aheadfirst i guess would be to see the health care providers speaking up first against chinas delays and inexcusable political decisions that violate public health dictums and similar concerns raised by health care providers in other countries remember the virus was known as early as last october not the december date the chinese first claimed the delay was inexcusablesecond clearly the manner in which health care providers volunteered and had to quickly learn the nuances of population-based care my one published study on triage categories in pandemics was the first and only triage structure that had a category for the non-survivable i believe italy was the first compelled in population-based care to use this category this has been listed as the most difficult of decisions and the first ever except in war that health care providers have had to makelastly i would offer that the pandemic and all its management deficiencies gives global public health some needed recognition it cannot turn back but the changes that must take place globally will be resisted in draconian ways by authoritarian regimes this pandemic will of course challenge globalization which is totally failing because it only focused on economics - never public health - and it should fail but we must ensure that this pandemic will strengthen what we now know as global public healthi would say three main aspects stronger containment measures stronger coordination between health sectors and more just-in-time training no health care system can sustain an uncontrolled outbreak and stronger containment measures are now the only realistic option to avoid the total collapse of any health care system all governments must act now implementing traditional public health response tactics isolation quarantine social distancing community containment and aggressive lockdown also all people must know the basics of infection prevention and control measures and all precautionary measures aimed at avoiding the collapse of your health care system and an unnecessary loss of livesalso from my perspective in italy we need more and stronger coordination between the different health sectors from the prehospital to the hospital more coordination between family doctors between ems and hospitals to contain the admission of patients in-hospital and to continue the care at home after the discharge and i would like to spend a little bit more time on training since its my field of expertise i would say we need more training more just-in-time training not only on donning and doffing ppe so i echo what skip said we are lacking of education in training in the medical schools in the nurses schools at any level so right now we need to act and to improve what we didnt implement before we need to increase the knowledge about triage about ethical dilemmas in this difficult situation its not just about donning and doffing ppe and also on basic principles of infection prevention and control again its not only because youre wearing a mask that youre protected so we need to teach everyone we need to educate health professionals on how to protect themselves and then also on how to react and to respond to difficult situations for example again how to expand the hospital how to triage patients at the admission and how to triage patients to decide which one needs icu needs intubation and which one not i think these are principles that are extremely important right nowi mentioned ppe before and you know on an individual level as a physician on the front lines that is our major need but to think in terms of population health and a crisis management framework we can change the ppe issue and we can change ventilators those are things that we can improve and improve quickly but we talked about crisis leadership - and thats not something we are able to change right now we are getting messaging from the president that is very difficult to hear as a front-line health care provider i dont feel like he has my back and thats unfortunatethis is not a political issue the coronavirus is neither a democrat nor republican and neither am i but we look to the president as the incident commander in a time of crisis like this the president has a choice of two ways to lead one can either lead by inspiration and rally the troops into battle or you can confuse them via mixed messaging even accusing us of stealing masks and selling them out the back door like what happened recently it is completely demoralizing we have to rely on our governors and our local experts we know we need containment and that the president has the power to enact national containment but wont our governors are going to finally have to reach a decisional critical mass before the president would ever decide to make a national decree if he will at all as the number of states where we have lockdown procedures grows like maryland and my home of virginia declared yesterday only then will we possibly see a federal changemore personally crisis communication is one of the things that inspired me into disaster medicine i was 16 when the oklahoma city bombing occurred 1995 oklahoma usa - it rattled my window i heard the boom my father was one of the first firefighters in the building going straight into the nursery minutes after detonation since that time i knew this is what i was supposed to do as a career i recall that every night we would come home and there on tv was the excellent oklahoma city fire department public information officer pio named jon hanson jon was on every single night at the same time telling us what they knew what they didnt know and how they were going to find out when he was on the air we all felt that things were going to be okay because the people in charge were honest and informed thats what america needs now and because were americans the world looks to us i dont mean to be an american exceptionalist but i think we have missed a critical opportunity to provide global leadership at that highest level so if i could change one thing it would be the quality of our national leadershipi would say crisis leadership again and i look at that from a couple of different lenses the first is we learned a long time ago that you must be first and you must be credible and im afraid that weve missed that boat to a certain extent i think back to 2009 and h1n1 we had a late-night phone call when we were beginning to see these cases and we began to understand what it might mean to the united states the cdc director was on camera the next morning first thing talking about what we knew talking credibly about what needed to be our concerns and we didnt see that here and that bothers me another issue we need to think about from a crisis leadership perspective is beyond just whether were going to send these things out or are we going to award some contracts or whatever we need to be taking better control at the federal level of these supply chain problems i was horrified to hear the comment that states should just go out and try to get their own things all at the same time the federal government is trying to do the same weve set up a competitive environment between the states and the federal government there is no room for that kind of competitiveness when we all need to be pulling together to respond to this event nation-wide i have never been a strong proponent of rapidly running out the door and placing orders under the defense production act because that puts the federal government first in line but in this particular case with some of these particular commodities like ppe that it is absolutely harming our response i believe that the government must order under the defense production act  put itself first in line bring in other capabilities to bear that are not normally engaged in this production field and then make those allocations as difficult as that might be across the country versus having every health care facility in every state and every locality and the federal government all competing with each other for these scarce products its creating an issue across this entire supply chain including placing equipment that is not needed as of this writing supplies are going where it is not needed and not going to where it is desperately needed now so back to the crisis leadership whereas i wanted to give you something different i think this is the most important issue we need to see changing and need to see immediate improvement i trust dr tony faucifirst we need to change the medical and public health curriculum globally to include zoonotic diseases or those that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals currently this has not been a priority in education and health delivery medical efforts must not be directed at response phase alone but across the entire disaster cycle prevention preparedness response recovery and rehabilitation health must take ownership this applies to all health populations as well as being supported by the societies and the governments they live inthe who and its international health regulation treaty organized to manage population-based diseases such as influenza sars h1n1 mers hiv and ebola have failed to meet population-based expectations in part this is due to influence from powerful political donors which the who is totally dependent on for their existence and which has become most painfully evident in the current covid-19 pandemic the who must exist solely as a treaty-based organization sanctioned and totally funded by the united nations and all its members it cannot be dependent on outside financial assistance to do its workthe global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the who and expect to do in the future in a highly integrated globalized world both the who and its treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty a return of the whos singular global authority and support a highly coordinated population-based management as sir william osler who was the father of zoonotic diseases recognized his concept of one medicine one health first written in the early 1900s defines what global public health is striving for todaypublic health and public health infrastructure and systems in developing countries must be seen as strategic and security issues that deserve international public health resource monitoring again this must cover the entire disaster cycle from prevention preparedness response recovery and rehabilitation also all six who regional offices must have similar multidisciplinary professional assets in support of zoonotic sciences which of course would be further resourced from who global assets during any epidemic or pandemic the goal is to identify and begin the containment process as early as possiblei must say that america is going to do poorly the 50 states are performing as 50 different countries - it is insane the individual states departments of health are all run by political appointees and differ greatly in capability capacity and containment decisions some departments are excellent models of efficiency while others do not even have a department building to call their ownlastly collectively we must begin now to think and plan for a new generation in every country of the credentials of health care managers and scientists who are trained across the entire disaster cycle to anticipate and manage population-based crises epidemics and pandemics are not the only entities that have the potential to devastate societies nuclear war climate change and biodiversity loss alone can lead to global devastation however i am aware that my italian colleagues before this pandemic occurred have seriously addressed and requested funding for a phd-level training program for professional health care managers and scientists within the european union this must be supported to fuel the expertise of a future who and international health regulation globally as well as in individual countries there is no excusethe three questions posed to the expert panel moderated and summarized by dr keim in real-time are summarized here in totoparticular concerns the members of the panel expressed focused on the scarcity of ppe and the fragility of the supply chain for our health care system as well as the strategic national stockpile two members felt the defense production act was being under-utilized in regard to emergency manufacturing of resources and there is concern this could force physicians to make life or death resource rationing decisions without guidance the italian system is currently stressed in terms of space staff and equipment and more focus should be placed on the outside of the hospital setting including ems primary care and post-discharge care disaster response is certainly made more complicated by the type of government philosophy and attitude in different countries deficiencies in medical education in global health are also being seenthe second question prompted answers that uniformly praised the response of the individual health care worker and the general public response across western countries similarly knowledge sharing between countries has been a strength the strategic national stockpile has been used to address shortages and has saved lives however its limitations have been now made apparent fema has been granted the authority to respond to pandemic events which is new and is also seen as a positive global public health is also having its moment in the sun and showing its valuethe final question generated enthusiastic answers in regard to failures in leadership at the highest levels it was stated or implied that the president and the who have extremely valuable roles during times of crisis such as this and it was universally believed among the american panelists that there has been a failure by both in regard to crisis leadership and communication better pandemic response education and communication within hospitals was also highlightedit is important to determine how these new views of microbial evolutionlateral gene transfer and mutualistic symbiosismight be integrated into public health initiatives it seems that present initiatives ignore or marginalize these phenomenon and that public health might be served better if they were made more central two pertinent public health paradigms that have received much publicity in recent years are the precision public health pph paradigm and the one health oh paradigm neither of these appear to take seriously our new appreciation of microbial evolutionprecision public health pph is the application of genomics technology for population health benefits 3435 and it is the attempt to make public health into a genomic science pph began in 1997 when the office of public health genomics of the cdc was formed to transform population health care into a genomic science by identifying evaluating and implementing evidence-based genomics practices to prevent and control the countrys leading chronic infectious environmental and occupational diseases 36 pph claims that it would be able to analyze ones genome and then prescribe the appropriate drugs and dietary regimenshowever the original promises that genomic science would find common alleles for common diseases were not fulfilled 3738 genome-wide association studies gwas for cardiovascular disease showed that that genes played a negligible role in predicting heart attacks and that human genetic variation accounted for roughly 3 of the variation in blood pressure 39 moreover the prediction that a patient would have a heart attack was better made by the number of pushups a patient could do than by genomic analyses 40 the genes thought to be associated with depression were lost when large trials were done 41 and deficiencies of the gut microbiome may provide a better account of causation 42worse for any genomic model of public health was when the genome of the founder of the human genome project james watson was analyzed his dna sequences predicted him to be deaf blind growth retarded and mentally deficient 4344 genes work differently in different people phenotypic heterogeneity wherein the same mutant allele causes different phenotypes in different individuals carrying it is a well-known phenomenon in medical genetics 4546 and a gene that is normal in one generation can cause disease in another 474849nevertheless the pph got a shot in the arm to use an old public health metaphor by the all of us project begun at the usas national institutes of health 50 its website proclaims this to be a big genome big data approach to public health whereby taking into account individual differences in lifestyle environment and biology researchers will uncover paths toward delivering precision medicine pph is getting a shot in the other arm from pharmacogenomics the study of how responses to drugs are influenced by the genetic makeup of the person receiving the drug according to kapoor et al 51 pharmacogenomics is one of the cornerstones of precision medicine and furthermore is a significant innovation in health care that possesses the potential to change the paradigm in the practice of medicine not solely in the way drugs are prescribed but also in the way drugs are discovered and developed indeed precision pharmacogenetics is being touted as a paradigm for third-world health care 52however this population-centered model of genomic healthcare delivery has been criticized 37 as being a salvage attempt to rescue something of value from the numerous extremely expensive genome projects that had been the scientific rage of the late 20th and early 21st centuries reardon and others 375354 claim pph is most likely dangerous fantasy exacerbating global economic differences taking the public out of public health and shifting responsibility for health onto the individual citizen 5556 pph has also been criticized for not recognizing the contributions of the symbiotic microbial genomes 38 symbiotic relationships with microbes as will be discussed below provide essential metabolic pathways for phenotype production including those for drug metabolism and over ten-fold the number of different genes than the zygote-derived genomewhereas precision public health works from one privileged levelthe genomeup to humans and human communities the one health paradigm is consciously interdisciplinary and multi-speciesit attempts to envision people animals and environments as partners in each others health on several levels 5758 as gibbs 59 p 49 notes one health is the collaborative effort of multiple disciplinesworking locally nationally and globallyto attain optimal health for people animals and our environment the one health paradigm according to friese and nuyts provides a theoretical basis for research involving nonhumans in public health and used to re-organize relationships between human medicine and animal veterinary medicine so that these two fields communicate in both knowledge and practice 60with contributions from such disciplines as ecosystem services and soil microbiology one health approach also recognizes the role of environments and ecologies in how human and animal health is shaped these contributions see ecosystems including symbiotic microbiomes as providing economic infrastructure benefits that can be calculated as part of any managed change to the environment 616263 however overall the implementation of one health is still fixed on protecting humans from zoonotic infections 60 indeed the cdc who ama and avma websites stress zoonoses and the fact that most infectious diseases are spread by animals the environment gets short shrift in these sites and this deficiency has not gone unnoticed numerous investigators have documented that the environment does not receive attention or funding in most one health networks 64656667thus the three components of the one health model are not equal and the framework is still used to prioritize protection of humans from zoonotic diseases while the importance of this goal is made obvious in this coronavirus-infused decade the anthropogenic deterioration of the environment by humanssuch as mountain-top coal removal anthropogenic deforestation soil microbial deterioration and reef depletion are crucial in and of themselves as well as can have enormous effects on public health and do not appear on the one health agenda only recently have there been calls to put microbes and global climate change under the one health umbrella 6869 some of these initiatives have come under the planetary health 70 which emphasizes how critical such ecological perspectives are for human health the planetary health perspective however concentrates on the important issues of politics and economics of global health care in the anthropocene but it does not address the issues the changes in how we perceive microbesin contrast to the precision public health and one health paradigms a recently proposed theory holds that microbes such as bacteria are primarily beneficial symbionts of the human body and their presence is both expected and necessary for normal human health while pathogenic microbes can cause enormous damage they are a distinct minority and public health needs to recognize the other arm of symbiosismutualism this approach which could revitalize the community-based one health perspective to public health by using the techniques of the molecularly based pph model is based on the hologenome theory 71 this model has recently received support by private funding most notably from the bill and melinda gates foundation 7273the hologenome theory 7475 recasts the individual animal or plant and other multicellular organisms as a consortium holobiontthe host plus all its symbiotic microbes during the past two decades advances in microbiome research have clearly shown that most animals cannot normally develop function or reproduce without the vast numbers of microorganisms that inhabit their bodies 2876 microbes are essential for normal animal development and physiological functioning for instance bacteria acquired at birth from the female reproductive tract are critical to the construction of the gut capillaries and epithelia in several vertebrates 7778798081 as well as being critical for the normal development of the vertebrate enteric and cerebral nervous systems 828384pediatric geneticist barton childs 85 postulated that each persons genetic endowment constitutes a biochemical individuality conferred upon us by our genes patterson and turnbaugh 86 have used the same term to designate the properties of the hologenomethe genes we inherit from our parents and our microbes our germ cells and our germs while we inherit some 22000 genes from our parents we inherit about 8 million different genes from our parents bacteria 87 indeed in some instances the gut microbiome appears to be critical in drug metabolism digoxin cyclophosphamide and numerous other drugs are each metabolized differently by different populations of microorganisms 888990 giving each person an assortment of genes and drug-metabolizing phenotypes that can change with each meal 91 even the human immune system so critical in public health is a holobiont property and not merely the agency of the host 9293949596 microbes enter into the body at birth prior to the maturation of the immune system and they induce the formation of lymphoid tissues 979899 moreover these lifelong immune activities are well-regulated only in the continuous presence of microbes which in turn constantly regulate the microbes that can stay with the animal 100101102103104105106 the immune system is a continuously co-constructed property of the holobiont holobiont public health recognizes that microbes may be pathogenic or beneficial and that deficiencies in bacteria can cause developmental immunological cognitive and physiological ailments for instance kwashiokor long seen as a protein deficiency disease manifests as a wasting and anorexic pathology only when certain bacteria are absent 107 asthma and allergies are also seen to be due to the absence of protective bacteria which normally are present to be induce anti-inflammatory regulators 108109 in these studies hanski and colleagues 110 explicitly link environmental health microbial diversity and human health indeed a new field of dysbiosis is now emerging including not only infection but also other conditions that may be caused by deficient or aberrant microbiomes here the normal symbiotic relationships that maintain physiological or developmental continuity have been abrogated in recent years science has traced these networks from associations to specific causal changes that can be tested while many of these experiments have been performed in mice the same pathways are known to be present in humans these non-contagious diseases include asthma and allergy 111 kwashiorkor 107112 obesity 113114 diabetes 115 ulcerative colitis 116 depression 42117 and parkinsons disease 118119 these microbial deficiency diseases constitute a new and possibly important category of illness this is not to say that dysbiosis is the only cause of these conditions but that it is a public health concern that should be investigatedan important conceptual barrier was recently crossed when the gut microbiomes of pregnant mice were demonstrated to be critical for the intrauterine development of the fetus short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate and propionate are products of the gut microbiomes digestion of cellulose as no mammalian genome contains genes for cellulose digestion the breakdown of plant material is almost totally accomplished by enzymes produced by microbes kimura and colleagues 120 demonstrated that propionic acid derived from the breakdown of fiber by maternal gut microbes was critical for the normal development of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells the sympathetic neurons that project to the heart and the gut enteroendocrine cells without the microbe-derived propionic acid the adult offspring developed a metabolic syndrome characterized by glucose intolerance obesity and insulin resistance since diet can control the prevalence of microbes the holobiont model can explain the mechanism whereby eating low-fiber high-calorie diets during pregnancy predisposes offspring to have metabolic syndrome later in life 121to understand the importance of a symbiotic approach to public health one has to first appreciate the new biological notion of the human body each of us is a functional entity that includes our zygote-derived cells as well as hundreds of species of microbes the body is both an organism and a biome containing several ecosystems 2876101 once the amnion breaks and the fetus passes through the birth canal the newborn becomes colonized by their mothers bacteria 87 furthermore mothers milk contains a special set of nutrients to promote the survival and growth of those bacteria that are important for symbiosis 122123124 these symbiotic bacteria will produce short-chain fatty acids and sphingolipids necessary for intestinal peristalsis and homeostasis peptidoglycans necessary for normal neuron function lipopolysaccharides necessary for the actions of the immune system the tripeptides necessary for cardiac physiology and the digestive enzymes necessary to metabolize plants 28 remarkably a third of the small metabolites in the blood are produced or induced by bacteria 125 nearly all of our peripheral serotonin is induced by gut microbes where it regulates the maturation of the enteric nervous system and regulates peristalsis 83126even more remarkable is that such critical symbioses are not only present within humans rather the development of most organisms appears to be predicated on interactions between hosts and their symbionts as mentioned in the above section 1 without microbial symbionts mice do not form their gut capillaries their gut-associated lymphoid tissues their t- and b- cell repertoires or the proper synaptic connections in their guts and brains moreover no vertebrate contains genes that make the enzymes necessary for digesting plant material such as cellulose hemicellulose and pectins 127 these genes are provided by symbiotic microbes in our guts in mammalian evolution the entire family of ruminants is made evolutionarily possible by the ability of gut bacteria acquired at birth to build the rumen of the stomach and then to ferment grass and grains 128129130131 thus symbiosis is a paradigm-changing idea in physiology we are no longer seen as being individuals we are holobionts and our anatomy development immunity and physiology are intimately linked with that of our microbial componentsthe importance of the holobiont perspective for public health is that absences of particular microbes may cause dysbioses throughout a population martin blaser and colleagues 6132 have warned that we may need particular microbes for particular functions and that our obsession with exterminating microbes may be inadvertently killing those bacteria that we need to survive their data indicate that microbes that used to be prevalent those for instance in barnyards and horse stalls are becoming rarer if these microbes are necessary for normal organ immune or cognitive development we will be impaired rhesus macaques that are bottle-fed rather than breast-fed acquire a different population of gut microbes and this population is not as adequate to develop a functioning immune system that can repel opportunistic infections 133 in zebrafish a relatively rare species of bacteria is essential for permitting the expansion of insulin-producing pancreatic cells thereby protecting these fish against diabetes 134 this absence of specific bacteria or their genes may be crucially important for explaining the increases in allergies and asthma since world war i and especially after world war ii throughout human history we had constant exposure to barnyard microbes it was only in the 20th century that they were displaced the barnyard was not just an attribute of farms the nineteenth century city according to raulff 135 p 36 consisted of rows and rows of urban stables mid 19th c boston had some 367 stables each having around eight horses in contemporary america only 6 of amish children whose homes are often adjacent to their barns have allergy and asthma about 20 of the genetically similar hutterites whose farms are not located close to their homes have allergies roughly the same as the american population in general 136 similarly finnish studies have shown that proximity to the barn is a factor in combatting allergies a recent study shows that children living in urban homes with barnyard bacteria have much less asthma and allergies than those children living in urban homes with urban bacteria 109 indeed two of the bacterial types found in the rural homes and missing in urban homes were brevibacterium and ruminococaceae bacteria found in horses and cattle although the severity of microbiome diversity loss might be most discernable in urban populations 137 the importance of soil microbiomes for the maintenance of healthy human intestinal microbiomes has recently been emphasized in studies 138 showing that even in rural areas farming techniques have severely reduced soil microbiome biodiversitybacterial displacement due to urban living and the absence of animals is only one of the ways that anthropogenic microbial displacement can affect public health caesarian sections disrupt one of the pathways of maternal kinship babies receive a protective set of symbiotic microbes from mothers when they pass through the birth canal in caesarean sections this transmission is abrogated babies delivered by c-section were found to be deprived of those microbes that otherwise colonize the infant gut instead there were the hospital dwelling microbes that included a substantial number of opportunistic pathogens moreover a substantial set of these microbes contained genes associated with antimicrobial resistance 139 not only were the species of microbes different but so were their functions the caesarean-delivered infants had less ability to mount immune responses to common antigens 140 this may have strong public health implications concerning elective c-sectionsthe microbes of our gut are critical for basic neurogenerative processes such as the formation of the blood-brain barrier myelination neurogenesis and microglia maturation 141 if this is indeed true then could microbes also be critical for mental health what if in addition to protection against allergies and asthma bacteria were protecting us against mental health conditions such as schizophrenia bipolar disease and autism several studies now indicate that gut microbes appear to be critical for normal brain development and behaviors in mice 82142143144145146147148 first mice born from germ-free mothers and who are themselves without microbes have a syndrome that includes obsessive self-grooming and asocial behavior 149 this behavior is possibly due to the failure of oxytocin-releasing signals from the vagus nerve and it can be reversed by providing the germ-free mice with lactobacillus reuteri or with microbes from normal mice or from normal humans 141150 germ-free mice given microbes from autistic humans do not show improvement of their symptoms although human cognitive and affective behaviors cannot be extrapolated for those of mice a pilot uncontrolled fecal transplant study in humans showed that after two years the acquisition of normal bowel microbes by autism patients significantly improved their symptoms from 83 severe autism to 17 severe autism 146 similar studies in mice and humans have shown that the gut microbiome may be critical in protecting humans from depression 42151152153 there is therefore reason to test the hypothesis that removal or depletion of normal environmental microbes may be responsible for the increasing percentage of the population diagnosed with cognitive dysfunction while studies of the effects of microbes on mental health lag behind those studies of microbial involvement in physical health the relationship of symbiotic microbes to cognitive and affective health and disorder is an area that cannot be ignoredpublic health must acknowledge that we are not monogenomic individuals we are consortia of dozens of species per person integrated together in a complex and dynamically changing network that forms who we are at any given moment this network is altered by the food we eat by the food our mother ate the toxins and medications we are exposed to and by our daily interactions with other holobionts our health depends upon other species making the one health perspective more than metaphorthe symbiotic networks of the human holobiont are enmeshed in larger symbiotic networks that sustain the planet public health would be severely affected if any of the many life support systems on which we dependincluding pollinators soils and bacteriafail indeed symbiosis is the signature of life on earth the nitrogen in our soil and atmosphere is made available for protein synthesis by symbioses between rhizobacteria and legumes the interactions of plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi are critical for plant growth while endophytic fungi are often necessary to protect the plants against dessication 154155156 the coral reef ecosystem is dependent on the symbiosis of algae and the ectoderm of corals while the marine seagrass ecosystems are sustained by symbioses involving clams and their bacteria reef-building corals survive through the photosynthesis of their algal symbiont which enters into the ectoderm of its host and transports over 90 of its photosynthetically derived carbon compounds to the host cells 157however these symbioses the very symbioses that define the planet are at risk these are the analogues of the microbial displacement and extinction that affect human health although public health is mainly concerned about human public health one readily finds that we cannot separate ourselves from our ecosystems socially politically economically or biologically coral reefs for instance are thought to support 500 million people across 50 nations and contribute nearly a trillion dollars to the worlds economy 158 the great barrier reef alone brings 7 billion dollars annually to australian commerce healthy coral reefs absorb over 95 of a waves energy thus protecting the shoreline preventing nearly a hundred million dollars worth of flood damage each year however the coral that form the critical structure of these reefs must be seen as a holobiont that exists only in a fragile symbiosis between the coral animal and single-celled zooxanthellae algae the coral animal provides a sunlit safe and nutrient-containing environment for the algae and the algae living within the animal cells provide the coral with the sugars it produces by photosynthesis the coral holobiont can survive only when its symbionts are present to provide the food resources 157159 under stress conditions such as high temperatures the symbionts are expelled from the corals leaving the corals bleached and undernourished these corals usually die as a result of global warming massive bleaching events and coral die-offs have occurred 160161 we are writing this essay not only in the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 but in the great barrier reef bleaching event of 2020 162 over half the corals in the great barrier reef have perished and some entire reefs have collapsed the mechanisms for the expulsion of the algal symbiont from its coral host are under investigation and it appears to be a mutual breakdown of the symbiotic relationship 163 one hypothesis is that heat disrupts the photosynthetic apparatus of the algae causing them to produce dangerous hydrogen peroxide radicals the coral cells defend themselves by expelling the algae or destroying them another hypothesis is that warmer temperatures permit algae to get the organic nitrogen that allows them to metabolize their sugars without needing the coral thereby forcing the coral to rely on their own meager carbon reserves 164165in addition to anthropogenic heating humans are also affecting symbiosis through domestication mycorrhizal symbiosis is critical to plant nutrition and therefore a necessity for sustainable agriculture however artificial fertilization of soil diminishes the mycorrhizal fungi and root symbiosis martin-robles and colleagues 166 have linked the loss of symbiotic colonization with plant domestication indeed failure to colonize is common making domesticated strains addicted to artificial fertilization 167168 moreover the lack of myccorhizal fungus may make the domesticated plants more susceptible to pathogenic fungi 169we are integrated into these webs where our nutrition oxygen and environmental temperature depend on global symbioses and microbes are at the base of each of them the anthropocene has put these relationships in peril as deborah bird rose 170 wrote relationships unravel mutualities falter dependence becomes a peril rather than a blessing and whole worlds of knowledge and practice diminish we are looking at worlds of loss that are much greater than the species extinction numbers suggest the vectors of disease are following the sun and following airplane and sea lanes wastewater tourism and trade are circulating microorganisms around the world in a scale never before seen 171 moreover global warming is predicted to introduce new microbes from melting permafrost as well as bringing many insect-borne diseases dengue fever malaria lyme disease etc into new regions 69 here the vector spreads a pre-existing symbiont these will undoubtedly cause major public health concernshowever another mechanism of disease can be predicted when organisms reach new lands they are capable of finding new symbiotic partners there is a new anthropogenic mingling going on as an example consider the red turpentine beetle dendroctonus valens a minor pest species that routinely infects pine trees that have been damaged by weather or fire like other bark beetles it is covered by fungi these fungi digest tree bark allowing the beetle to have a home and mate the fungus associated with d valens is usually leptographium procerum however this beetle was introduced from the pacific northwest of america to shanxi province of china in the 1980s in china it met other fungi which are much more potent at digesting wood than the american fungi 172173 these newly acquired fungi can degrade a major host defensive chemical 174 as a result over ten million pine trees have been killed by this fungus in china american officials are worried about a boomerang effect 175 the version of the beetle with its chinese fungi may have been re-imported into the usa however the public health services of the various states that might be affected claim they do not have the revenue to test whether this is soorganisms are holobionts and public health must recognize the webs of symbioses uniting different species of organisms into a collective individual and uniting these different individual teams into complex ecosystemssymbiosis takes two major formsmutualism cooperative and parasitism pathogenic the emergence of antibiotic drug resistance is the anthropocene effect on parasitic symbiosis just as anthropogenic changes in the environment have changed the populations of microbes involved in mutualistic interactions with humans so other anthropogenic changes have increased the prevalence and virulence of parasitic microbesuntil the early 20 century the leading cause of death world over was infectious disease crucial to turning this around were sanitation of water and the discovery of antibiotics since their discovery in the 1920s antibiotics have become the key tool against infections caused by microbes used across different forms of medicine by this definition microbes are understood as pathogenic and parasitic dangerous dirty and damaging the host that they reside in bodies are seen to be at war against harmful outside invaders and entire disciplines have been hinged on this notionimmunology clinical medicine and public health just to mention a few antibiotics have been the miracle weapon that have been used to tackle the looming threats of bacteria and have been said to have developed contemporary medicine to be the success story that it is today 24antibiotics have magnificent power to alleviate symptoms and ensure sterile conditions they play central roles in basic surgeries cancer cesarean birth and in treating basic infections they are prescribed against infections by doctors nurses pharmacists dentists and traditional healers depending on the contexts all across the world there are very few communities left that have not incorporated the use of antibiotics into their basic methods of healing and research on those communities is tapping to their untouched microbiomes microbiome as an oasis 176177178179 literature about antibiotic prescription describes how requests for antibiotics reside on all sides of the patienthealth care practitioner dyad patients say that health care practitioners hand out antibiotics liberally and health care practitioners argue that patients demand them 180181182 in addition antibiotics are bought over the counter from pharmacies and informal markets 183 antibiotic use is a matter of concern as excessive or unregulated use of antibiotics is connected to the development of drug resistance and while there are few new antibiotics in the pipeline there is a need to ensure the utility of existing ones 184185antibiotic use patterns offer insights into how central antibiotics are to public health as well as the specific practices and contexts that rely on the use of antibiotics understanding these dynamics also illuminates the effects of pathogenic thinking as well as the myriad ways in which reliance on antibiotics would need to change in order to make space for a holobiont practice of public healthglobal statistics about antibiotic use show differences between countries that often follow the guidelines of health system efficiency and general national income since the 2000s antibiotic use in low- and middle-income countries has considerably increased while in high-income countries particularly with those that rely on public rather than private health care antibiotic use has been reduced india pakistan and china are among those countries where use has increased most 186 while data is unavailable in most african countries 187188 that said despite the reduction in the high-income countries antibiotic use in many european countries and the us is still considerably higher per capita than across many african nations 186188the increase of antibiotic use in low-income countries underscores the utility of antibiotics within lagging health care systems andor in places where people cannot afford health care especially in countries where health care access is precarious due to lack of access poverty or poorly operating health systems antibiotics have come to play a central role in how short-term health goals are achieved for example work by denyer willis and chandler 189 shows how antibiotics function as a quick fix for well-being this fix operates on multiple domains to ensure productivity of humans animals and crops hygiene in settings of minimized resources marked by lack of infrastructures and good health in landscapes scarred by political and economic violence in short antibiotic use has come to stand for development and well-beingwhile use of antibiotics has played a crucial role in helping to increase life expectancy implementing invasive surgical procedures and stand in for health care systems where they are otherwise unavailable the use of antibiotics has accelerated embodied and ecological havoc a narrow characterization of microbes solely as parasitic and pathogenic enemies rather than as needed and helpful partners contributes to excessive use of antibiotics for humans and animals where microbes refuse to remain contained in bodies but shift their form by evolving resistance to antibiotics the heroic narrative of antibiotics is beginning to crumble as microbes push back mass scale attempts to eradicate bacteria with antibiotics in humans and animals has led to increase of antimicrobial resistance amr making it a quintessential anthropocene problem indeed the mass scale of antibiotic production beginning in the 1940s quickly became infrastructural to the production of many other things at scale more health more meat more fruit more surgery less death more fertility in everything from in vitro embryos cultured in antibiotics to fish farming the scale of production is also the scale of resistance 24 the higher-than-expected levels of amr put western medicine in its current formwhere antibiotics play central rolesat risk with antimicrobial resistance global health literature continues to frame microbes as a threat now an incurable threat the most comprehensive report about amr and its future impacts the so-called oneill report commissioned by the uk government and the wellcome trust indicated that 7 million people will die due to complications associated with amr 190this report has evoked a flurry of research efforts systemic interventions stewardship programmes and funding to tackle amr health risks for humans have been extensively documented with resistance spreading owing to both excessive use of antibiotics for human consumption and the use of antibiotics as part of animal feeding and in husbandry a key route by which amr spreads is via environmental bacteria that serve as vectors for the resistant geneslateral gene transferwhich is seen to become a problem when otherwise benign environmental bacteria contribute to the spread of resistance in pathogens 24191192 robinson et al state that this otherwise natural quality of environmental bacteria is exacerbated for example by the influx of antibiotic residues from human and animal faeces and run-offs from hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturing 193194a global comparison of socio-economic determinants correlated with amr prevalence offers insights into the crucial roles that developmental and social inequalities play in anthropocene ecology factors predicting high amr rates are not antibiotic consumption but rather differential access to sanitation education and public investment in health care services as well as the level of corruption in society 195 the focus therefore cannot be simply on clinical bodies but must broaden to encompass environments including animals and infrastructures on the one hand and social practices and power on the otherwe posit that the notion of plantationocene captures this complexity that transcends the humanmore-than-human bodily boundary while taking power structures into consideration as defined above the plantationocene constitutes the coercive labor structures and extractive and hierarchical management of planetary resources to feed an ever-growing population 1718 the plantationocene acts here both an analytical and a descriptive term analytically plantationocene points to transnational circulations of goods domination and dominion of people over other people and people over nature hegemonic colonial legacies systematisation of farming haraway et al 196 point to the historical origins of the term and how relocations of the substances of living and dying around the earth as a necessary prerequisite to their extraction the logic of the plantation system makes it more efficient to destroy the local labor and import labor from elsewhere the plantation system is built on the relocation and control of any generative unit whether plant animal microbe or person 196 indeed plantations were the result of one of the most catastrophic public health events in world historythe columbia exchange a major part of this exchange resulted in the elimination of a majority perhaps 90 of indigenous american people by the microbesrubeola variola influenza rubulavirus rickettsia salmonella and bordetellabrought across the atlantic ocean by the european settlers the great migration of people and crops took place to bring workers to areas whose native populations had perished especially in the caribbean where the death rate of indigenous people was probably close to 99 197198199 intensive labour was needed to produce crops in north and south america and the workers at plantations were slaves shipped from west and central africanow sites that have the least infrastructure to surveil and control amr but have the most troubling evidence of amr prevalence 187200 these were also sites of resource extraction as well as subjected to structural adjustments in the 80s by the world trade organisation to privatize health care and social welfare resulting in poor health care and sanitation infrastructures and overall poverty that now are known to be key factors for the development of amr the industrial agriculture of the plantationocene may also contribute to the spread of drug resistant microbes the recent increase in resistant fungicides such as candida auris that has caused tremendous concern among health practitioners and ecologists alike is a resistant yeast that has contaminated entire hospitals 201202 its spread has environmental vectorsresistance has developed in connection to the use of fungicides in monocropping 203 environmental and agricultural practices are thus directly connected to public health concernsamr with plantationocene underscores that public health needs to re-think its relationships with bacteria and antibioticsit cannot bracket out environmental extraction socio-economic injustices and the on-going need for health systems strengthening as factors that create the conditions for why excessive antibiotics are used that lead to antimicrobial resistance amr by this definition is not an exemplary threat by microbes as is framed in global public health but should be seen as a result of the modernist eradication approach towards microbes that requires rethinkinghealth is a negotiation between microbes and hosts holobiont public health would do well to recognize both the parasitic and the mutualistic branches of symbiosis 204 it would also recognize the two major changes in our scientific knowledge of microbial evolution that have occurred in this century 1 organisms are holobionts composed of several species wherein microbes help maintain healthy physiology and resilience and 2 bacteria can pass genes through horizontal genetic transmission thereby facilitating the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance through numerous bacterial speciessymbionts must be seen as partners and respected as agents with their own agendas three recent examples of holobiont management for public health should be mentioned in this regard the first concerns the public health against mosquito-transmitted diseases such as dengue zika and chikungunya by using wolbachia bacterium to infect aedes egypti mosquitos wolbachia infects numerous insects but not these species of mosquitos however wolbachia can become a symbiont in these insects preventing the acquisition or replication of viruses inside their cells scientists have been able to get wolbachia to grow inside aedes cells and wolbachia-infected mosquitoes have been released into the wild where this has happened there has been significant drops up to 76 in reported cases of the vector-transmitted diseases 204205206the second holobiont-informed type of public health involves seeking alternatives to antibiotics and partnering with microbes capable of keeping pathogens in check if symbionts help protect hosts from pathogenic bacterial infections then symbiotic microbes would be a good place to start looking for new antibiotics this is especially true of antibiotics for gram-negative bacteria the antibiotics currently in use were developed in the 1960s and several bacterial species have successfully been evolving resistance to them certain nematode worms are susceptible to the same types of gram-negative bacteria as humans so imai and colleagues 207 sought out the antibiotics made by the symbiotic strains of bacteria found in the nematode guts by screening chemicals made by these symbionts they have isolated darobactin a modified and crosslinked 7-amino acid peptide this antibiotic acts by disrupting the cell envelope of the gram-positive pathogens and is largely non-effective in destroying human gut commensals the experiments further show that this new antibiotic is effective at protecting infected mice given potentially lethal infections of gram-negative bacteriathe third approach recognizes the importance of microbes to the life cycles of parasites and seeks to kill the parasite by killing its symbionts this approach has worked in eliminating schistosoma mansoni a filariasis worm that has become resistant to the drugs traditionally used to kill these parasites a newer treatment strategy has been to use antibiotics such as doxycyline against its symbiotic bacteria 208209 once the antibiotic destroys the symbiont the worms cells undergo apoptosis and the worms die 210 a similar strategy is being considered to eradicate the plague locusts that are now devastating east africa here a locust-specific fungus might be sprayed on the juvenile locusts as they develop their wings this fungus would grow inside the maturing insect and consume it from within 211we need to be in symbiosis with bacteria on a social as well as on a corporal level like the body we need to be able to distinguish mutualistic from pathogenic microbes and treat them differently humanity has been given notice a paper by the alliance of world scientists 212 puts humanity on notice that the impact of climate change will depend heavily on the responses of microorganisms which are essential for achieving an environmentally sustainable future public health must take note that we humans are never independent of nature and therefore must be expanded to preserve environmental health as well as human and animal healthresilience to perturbations is increased by plasticity and the inputs of symbiotic microbes each human is a biome of many ecosystems asthma allergies and amrs must not be considered the revenge of nature rather they are expected consequences of lower resilience to perturbations public health must see the life on this planet as biology now sees itas a rich mixture of cooperative and antagonistic interactions with our bodies in dynamic relations with its hundreds of microbial partnerswe

transparency among indigenous groups related to previous pandemics and other health outcomes is lacking further perpetuating the lack of indigenous voice and increasing the health disparity gap babyar 2019 failure to recognise the differences in morbidity and mortality among indigenous peoples contributes to inequities there is not only a lack of information sharing but the delay in funding to support nations and the growing jurisdictional disputes over who will provide these services has once again been intensified in the response to covid pandemic planning if ever there was a time to acknowledge the need to collect accurate ethnicity data and disseminate adequate resources to address health disparities among indigenous people globally now is that time the needs of indigenous peoples must be made visible and not subsumed instead in generalised universal response strategiesin this editorial we have drawn attention to the existing health and social justice inequities stemming from colonisation we have discussed the devastating effects pandemics have on our health and capacity to practice culture which is our medicine we have asked the reader to consider the desperate situation our peoples face but recognise the indigenousled solutions that are being enacted we demand our governments recognise that the harm and hurt and drastically increased morbidity and mortality in our communities during this pandemic are their legacies of failing to address historical and ongoing inequities the cultural determinants of health must be recognised as the remedy and be built into health policy practice and research going forward data need to meticulously document the damage naming us by our countries our communities our clans and our tribes so that the next time disease sweeps our planet we know our weaknesses we know our strengths and if more informed and empowered we will prevail against the next neo colonial wavefrom time immemorial infectious diseases have ravaged mankind only 100 years ago tb was still one of the top three leading causes of death in the usa 1 fortunately science advanced dramatically during the 20th century changing the ways in which our society treats infectious diseases current preventative vaccines and drugs are catered to treat long-lasting andor chronic infections or infectious diseases that recur annually or on a regular basis such as hiv tb hepatitis c influenza and so on however the major viral disease outbreaks that have plagued society over the past two decades do not follow this pattern in fact they have shown that the scientific community is not adequately prepared to offer or rapidly develop effective treatments when an outbreak happens 2 as a consequence all countries have to adopt nontherapeutics measures to slow the progression of the epidemic and flatten the curve to limit the burden of the disease on the healthcare system and allow better support to severely ill patients 3a recent study in the new england journal of medicine
4 estimated that the yearly cost of a pandemic could amount to us60 billion dollars being spent worldwide on treatment control and prevention efforts as seen in the current outbreak of the sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this cost might be even higher because of restrictions on international trade and travel closing of businesses prohibition of large gatherings of people and other social-distancing strategies 5 although these measures do help curb the spread of the disease they have potentially devastating consequences it was initially predicted that a large volume of cases over a short period of time would result in the usa having barely enough masks to last even 2 weeks into the pandemic 6 there might also be other social and political ramifications from a quick glance at the google trends data 7 one can see that on super tuesday in the usa in 2020 the popularity of google searches for coronavirus was nearly three times that for super tuesday also because of prohibitions on gatherings of more than 2550 people in many cities and states people might have stayed away from the polls out of fear of contracting the virus and might continue to do so in the future possibly influencing the outcome of the 2020 us election 8 9the democratization of access to the internet has also facilitated the access of the general public to information through mediums such as major media outlets and even formal and informal data analytics 10 11 for instance johns hopkins university hosts a popular regularly updated map of the reported cases of covid-19 around the world 12 using data from the chinese centers for disease control and who situation reports the new mantra flatten the curve is also representative of the newfound exposure of the public to data science and analysis in response to the covid-19 pandemic 13 likewise the rapid growth of global communications systems has allowed media government and scientists alike to quickly access and share a large amount of data this real-time sharing of information has been unprecedented although it permits governments to respond rapidly to epidemics through the dissemination of prevention and control methods it can also facilitate public panic by stoking existing fears about an epidemic 14 15this rapid exchange of information applies to scientific data and publications as well with increased access to the internet the response of the scientific community has been enriched we have observed an increasing number of articles being published for successive outbreaks in both peer-reviewed journals and various arxiv see glossary preprint servers over the past 20 years over the past few months both peer-reviewed journals 16 17 and arxiv preprint 18 19 servers have been overpopulated with reports on known drugs or clinical candidates with possible anti-sars-cov-2 activity identified by computational approaches however despite many experimental and clinical studies no effective drugs or treatments have emerged to treat the previous six epidemics of bird flu sars swine flu mers ebola and zika as well as thus far covid-19 this observation begs the question of whether the rapidity and bulk of immediate responses to epidemics are sufficient to enable the development of effective treatmentsin this study we investigated historical data for seven major disease outbreaks of the past two decades bird flu h5n1 sars swine flu h1n1 mers ebola fever zika fever and covid-19 we assessed the response of the scientific community to these outbreaks over time in addition to how effective that response was in producing vaccines and small-molecule antiviral drugs to this end we analyzed the number of publications clinical trials funding levels and google trends data from the start of these epidemics until the present day we observed that there has been little success in combatting outbreaks effectively while they were occurring let alone after they have passed by contrast we also observed that these trends were different for hivaids which has received continuous and uninterrupted attention from researchers around the world and for which multiple targeted therapies have indeed emerged we expect this analysis to provide insights as to how to better mobilize both federal agencies and scientists to find treatments for covid-19 as well as other future outbreakswe evaluated the number of publications in both peer-reviewed journals and arxiv preprint servers and the number of clinical trials performed over the course of the epidemic to estimate the engagement and success of the scientific community in response to the seven major outbreaks of the past two decades bird flu sars swine flu mers ebola zika and covid-19 these metrics indicate the velocity with which the scientific community mobilizes to seek solutions to remedy an outbreak as well as how this velocity correlates with other metrics such as the number of confirmed cases and the number of people who have died from the disease in addition we evaluated the number of unique molecules andor treatments being tested in clinical trials because many were replicates of each otherfirst we looked at the response of the scientific community on weekly timescale figure 1 figure 2
 we examined the number of clinical trials fig 1 and publications fig 2 over the first 24 weeks of each outbreak with week 0 corresponding to the time point when the federal authorities or the who first started reporting the data on the epidemic for covid-19 december 31 2019 is considered the start date on this standardized timescale the number of clinical trials launched for covid-19 greatly outnumbered that of any of the previous epidemics the growth rate of publications on covid-19 was also the highest one can also see that for more recent epidemics such as ebola and zika more clinical trials were launched during the first 24 weeks of the epidemic than had been the case for previous epidemics such as bird flu and mers fig 1 the only exception to this general observation was swine flu which is an anomaly because h1n1 flu strains had been researched extensively before the start of the outbreak in 2009 as a result of the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and other past h1n1 epidemics 20 21 this is in stark contrast to ebola virus and zika virus which had caused smaller-scale outbreaks previously yet had little to no information available on how to treat them 22 23equally valuable is to compare the rate of response of the scientific community to the rate of epidemic growth as a case study we chose to compare data on sars to that of sars-cov-2 covid-19 interestingly the number of total publications for sars over time roughly followed the same trend as the number of cases with an offset by a short time period of less than a month fig 3
 likewise rapid spikes in the number of cases correspond to slightly offset spikes in the number of publications on sars by around the same period 16 daysin comparison to sars covid-19 does not show clear spikes in the number of publications or clinical trials corresponding to peaks and dips in the number of new cases or deaths fig 4
 instead the trends in the number of publications and clinical trials appear to follow the trends in the number of cases andor deaths indeed there is a correlation r  098 between the rate at which the virus spreads throughout the population and intensity of research on covid-19 as measured by the number of publications although looking for causality in these relationships is non-sensical the number of new peer-reviewed publications appears to follow roughly the same logarithmic curve as the number of new cases recorded for covid-19 whereas the rate of new publications in nonpeer-reviewed arxiv preprints appears to exceed even that of new covid-19 cases fig 4 the number of covid-19 preprints in arxiv servers surpassed the number of covid-19 papers in peer-reviewed journals in early march highlighting the rise of online journals and preprint servers as well as reflecting the shrinking period of time between the original observations and respective publications this is also in direct contrast to sars more papers were published at a faster rate during this pandemic than in the sars epidemic beginning in 2003 for example eight peer-reviewed papers on covid-19 had been published by the time there were 555 cases of the disease january 22 2020 whereas sars only had one paper published by the time there were 1804 total cases april 3 2003 however it is necessary to contextualize these observations in terms of the scientific output not just by the rate of response in this regard we observed that the large number of studies conducted on sars notwithstanding no us food and drug administration fda-approved drug or vaccine to treat the disease has been developed in the 17-year period since the outbreak began in 2003it is of particular interest to look at the evolution of both the number of publications and the amount of research funding from the beginning of each outbreak to-date fig 5
 this analysis shows perhaps not unexpectedly that following the spike of the research interest in the initial phases of each epidemic progressively fewer research papers were published for previous outbreaks after they ended this trend probably reflects the lack of special funding for such research and consequently the lack of successful therapeutic development against the respective diseases indeed fluctuations in research funding for each epidemic appear to follow the same spike-like trend as research publications fig 5 this lack of research interest andor funding outside of periods when these outbreaks are occurring is probably partially responsible for the current situation no approved anticoronaviral medications exist and as such the world is frantically looking to repurpose existing drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which is premature and according to at least some reports could be potentially harmful to patients 24 25in addition to quantifying the response of the scientific community to these epidemics we also collected google trends data on the principal search terms representing each of these diseases google trends data do not represent the number of google searches during a given time period but rather anonymized aggregated and normalized information about the relative proportion of searches on google for a given search term region and time period 7 this normalization protects against places with larger populations being weighted more heavily a value of 100 corresponds to the maximum search interest in a topic for the given time and location whereas a value of 50 corresponds to the search term being half as popular as it was at its peak google trends as a whole serves as a fairly representative data source for the public perception of different news topics indicating how interested people appear to be in a given topic over a specific period of time with rapid peaks in search interest indicating a sudden increase in interest in a topicfirst we gathered and standardized google trends data for each of the epidemics based on their start dates and relative time periods no google trends data are available before january 2004 thus some timepoints for bird flu and sars were not available when observing the first 30 months of the outbreaks the response of the public to the epidemic appeared to peak during the first 8 months fig 6
 for diseases that had been previously studied such as swine flu and ebola hemorrhagic fever there was already some search interest before the start date of the epidemic and thus the relative search interest in these diseases was higher during the earlier months of the epidemic these outbreaks were shorter lived than some of the other diseases such as mers infection continues today although cases peaked in early 2014 26 the relative search interest in which peaked an anomalous 20 months into the outbreakcovid-19 is interesting in that although representing a novel virus the number of relative searches peaked relatively close to those for all the previously studied illnesses mentioned earlier and is following an increasing exponential trend fig 6 the number of cases of covid-19 worldwide is increasing in a nearly exponential fashion with more people infected worldwide than in any of these previous epidemics besides h1n1 swine flu additionally for all diseases previously mentioned their respective search interests peaked during the years when the epidemic was most severe fig 6 so we should expect that the search interest for covid-19 will steadily decrease when the pandemic begins to die down however as noted earlier although we should expect such evolution of the general public interest research into understanding this disease and developing powerful therapeutics should continue unabatedbefore the outbreak of sars-cov-2 previous studies had forecasted the re-emergence of a sars-like betacoronavirus
27 the potential for sustained transmission of sars-cov-2 or for the emergence of another novel betacoronavirus is alarming but has not been sufficient previously to garner any substantial drug discovery or vaccine efforts these transmission dynamics and this potential for wide-scale future pandemics makes covid-19 distinct from the six previous epidemics examined earlier thus the response to the hiv pandemic which began in 1981 is also a worthwhile comparison to the current covid-19 responsethe change in the number of cases clinical trials and publications for hiv is shown in fig 7
 with marked time points delineating when novel anti-hiv drugs were approved by the fda it is generally agreed that hiv can now be managed thanks to the powerful pharmacotherapies developed since the pandemic began during the early 1980s this success is predicated on the significant and constant increase in federal funding for hiv over the course of the epidemic rising from just a few hundred thousand dollars in financial year fy 1982 to more than us348 billion in fy 2019 28 this support has allowed the research community to continue to study the disease accounting for an average of 6000 papers published per year over the past 5 years as annotated in pubmed box 1

trials and approved for use in patients in 1987 6 years after the pandemic began 29 azt was originally synthesized for use as an anticancer agent 29 and was then repurposed against hiv given the toxicity of azt and the rapid evolution of drug resistance 30 new compounds targeting various aspects of viral replication were eventually designed encompassing different classes of antiretroviral drug such as non-nucleosidenucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors protease inhibitors integrase inhibitors and fusion inhibitors 30 currently combinations of these different classes of antiretroviral drug are used in what is known as antiretroviral therapy art to prevent the development of drug resistance to date 22 distinct medications and 22 combination therapies have been approved by the fda most during the early 2000s 30 the first nonrepurposed drugs approved by the fda were lamivudine a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and saquinavir a protease inhibitor both approved in 1995 nearly 15 years after the start of the pandemic 31 later during the pandemic new drugs were developed in a streamlined process where lead compounds active against hiv in vitro were structurally modified to improve their efficacy and lower their cytotoxicity 32 high-throughput screening hts campaigns have also proven useful in identifying existing compounds with promise against hiv 33 34 35hiv serves as a prime example of how scientists in academia government and industry can combine efforts to combat a common threat even though it took 5 years to name the virus that caused the disease and 6 years to approve the first medication cumulative scientific efforts ultimately paid off in the form of a diversity of treatment regimens available and a major improvement in life expectancy in most parts of the world 36 although sars-cov-2 might continue to circulate in humans for some time it differs from hiv in that it has an airborne transmission route and a lower mutation rate because of polymerase proofreading abilities 27 37 the latter is especially important to consider when developing therapies vaccines and antiviral medications a lower mutation rate means that there is a higher probability of new treatments working for lengthier periods of time it is also important to consider whether an infection is chronic or if recovered individuals can become sick again examples being hiv and influenza respectively epidemics last longer or can recur if the pathogen at hand meets these criteria thus allowing more time for drug discovery to have a tangible output such as art for hiv and annual vaccines for influenza infection with sars-cov-2 is not known to be chronic and neither is it known definitively whether secondary infection can occur 38 but this or a similar virus is predicted to eventually re-emerge meaning that drugs developed and tested now will be useful for future epidemics 23the sustained transmission of hiv within the human population coupled with its extraordinary evolutionary rate has provided a lasting incentive for pharmaceutical companies to continue identifying new antiviral medications to treat hiv 30 similarly the expectation of another covid-19 pandemic motivates rapid drug discovery efforts now for sars-cov-2 there are multiple efforts to identify existing drugs that could be repurposed to combat sars-cov-2 39 additionally modern computational techniques such as quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar modeling molecular docking and machine-learning approaches are being used now in covid-19 drug discovery efforts 17 40 41 it should be expected that achieving success in developing covid-19 therapies and preparing for future epidemics will require a substantial lasting and well-funded research effort the sheer amount of resources at our disposal and the velocity of response of the scientific community so far compared with the successful response to hiv suggests that the development of drugs to treat covid-19 in the coming years is attainablein recent years there has been a noticeable uptick in the response of the scientific community to outbreaks we have observed that the ebola 20142016 and zika 20152016 outbreaks had more publications and clinical trials performed in a shorter time period than for previous outbreaks figure 1 figure 2 however the response of the scientific community to the covid-19 outbreak represents the most rapid response yet with an unprecedented number of clinical trials and publications both in peer-reviewed journals and preprint servers however clinical and research efforts in response to past epidemics have failed to yield therapies during or after epidemic period traditionally it has taken years for effective drugs and vaccines to be developed and approved much past the point at which they could be clinically useful andor could be tested in clinical trialsthe speed of the response of the scientific community to major outbreaks has increased over the past two decades matching the increasing accessibility of information via the internet but the outcome of this response has not changed despite the presence of various intergovernmental agencies such as the who and the united nations individual nations have traditionally responded to large-scale epidemics in a disjointed fashion and they desperately lack a pre-established adequate continuous and centralized effort even within their own countries let alone internationally 23 42 in the usa in particular initial measures to predict or surveil disease outbreaks have been alarmingly either defunded or downsized over this same period in which the output of publications and clinical trials has increased 43 44 as seen in the data presented in this study the viruses that had already been studied before their respective epidemics garnered more publications and clinical trials in a shorter period of time than those that were understudied previously zika virus and ebola virus had both been discovered long before they caused significant morbidity and mortality around the world yet they were not studied extensively and thus the correlated response of the scientific community was inefficient 23 had the scientific community had a consistent stream of funding to conduct research on coronaviruses that have hit humankind twice before the current pandemic there might have been the prospect of pharmacotherapy on the near horizon 23when preparing for possible future epidemics it is better to be safe than sorry for example the us government has a stockpile of tecovirimat a drug used to treat smallpox in the event of an act of bioterrorism 45 this drug was developed solely to prevent a future outbreak given that smallpox was eradicated decades ago because of global vaccination efforts similar prescient efforts are underway to prevent the next pandemic such as the rapidly emerging antiviral drug discovery initiative readdi this initiative is aiming to create and stockpile a novel broad-spectrum antiviral drug in preparation for the next pandemic 46 the history of hiv and aids shows clearly that steady interest and robust investment in the study of the disease have yielded the desired fruits although the speed of response to covid-19 by both the research community and the public is unprecedented the world needs to pay more attention to infectious diseases before they have the opportunity to cause lasting economic social and physical damage to people around the globe 47we hope that the data and their analyses presented in this article will stimulate both the funding agencies governmental private etc and the scientific community to maintain their interest in searching for an efficient treatment for covid-19 given the comparison with previous large-scale epidemics given the unprecedented increase in clinical trials and publications the growing public interest in the disease and the looming threat of a future outbreak it is unlikely that these trends will die down in the coming months and years vaccine development for covid-19 is occurring at an unprecedented pace on average vaccine development takes 10 years but there is a hope to have a vaccine available for emergency use by early 2021 48 however global research efforts need to become more focused if we are to combat this pandemic effectivelywe believe that the ongoing research and clinical trials should be a product of international and intergovernmental collaboration driven by knowledge discovery and artificial intelligence approaches as applied to data from both past and present epidemics finally substantial funding on the part of federal and state agencies along with private foundations is necessary to support massive research efforts to find a cure or a vaccine more quickly than in the past and to stay prepared for future outbreaks of viral diseases it is not enough to say that there are more resources available at our disposal now than ever it is a matter of using these resources effectively the historical response to hiv sets a precedent for success in the fight against emerging infectious diseases we shall use this historical precedent and past failings as a guide for the current battle against covid-19 and all future battles against other imminent outbreaksto the best of our knowledge the most recent published evaluation of austrian covid-19 death data by age and sex is based on the 112 registered covid-19 deaths that were available in the epidemiological reporting system of the federal ministry of social affairs health care and consumer protection in the following abbreviated as ministry of health by 1500 on 31 march 2020 of the total 128 deaths by that time 1 in addition the current marginal age distribution and marginal gender distribution but not the gender distribution per age group of deaths is continuously published on the dashboard of the ministry of health 2 for this analysis we used both the data set from march 31 as well as data from the dashboard including 439 deaths reported by 1100 on 21 april 2020 in both data sets the majority of the deceased are men 61 men by 31 march and 58 by 21 april most of the deceased are over 60 and 55 years of age respectively fig 1a and b when comparing the graphs the different age categories and total number of deaths should be taken into account however the absolute figures must be related to the size of the population in each age group then they can be interpreted as current covid-19 mortality per 10000 people in each age group in austria fig 1c and d accounting for all cases reported to the epidemiological reporting system by 31 march and 21 april respectively this illustration shows a clear age trend and the gender difference is even more pronounced since women are in the majority in the upper age groups of the population it should be noted that the graphs do not show the infection fatality rate defined as the proportion of fatalities among infected persons but the proportion of registered covid-19 deaths in relation to the general populationthe age dependency of mortality rates is not unusual also the normal mortality risk depends strongly on age the mortality tables show for each age and sex the number of people who die in the next year of life fig 2a red and blue lines per 10000 people in that age and sex group the risk of mortality is high at birth but then drops below 001 by age 7 after that it increases again especially among the more risk-taking young men the risk of men remains higher than that of women until old age and only approaches that of women at the end of the curve if we compare this normal mortality risk with the covid-19 mortality until 31 march or 21 april respectively fig 2a and b we see a similar increase although the number of covid-19 deaths registered by the respective survey date scaled to the population size is orders of magnitude lower than the annual mortality rates the proportion of austrians who die from covid-19 by a given date depends on how many people are infected and the risk of death among those infected the so-called infection fatality rate however estimating infection fatality rates is complex 4 5 a simple but not very reliable estimator is the proportion of observed deaths among those who tested positive however the positively tested are only a part of all infected persons and it is difficult to quantify the dark figure of undetected infections that are mild or even without symptoms it is difficult to determine the number of undetected cases of infected persons as it depends heavily on the number of tests and the testing strategy only representative antibody tests will provide reliable estimates therefore instead of infection fatality rates case fatality rates the number of deaths per registered cases are often considered instead but these are also difficult to estimate during an outbreak of an epidemic because many of those who test positive are still ill when the data is collected and may die within the next few daysthe case fatality rates however depend sensitively on the number of undetected cases which explains part of the differences between the numbers reported in different countries an indication for the infection fatality rate is provided by the cases on the diamond princess the cruise ship on which all passengers were tested and a mortality rate of 15 11 out of 712 tested positive was observed however the risk of death is strongly age dependent scientists at imperial college london 3 used a model-based approach to estimate the age-dependent risk for infected persons to die from covid-19 sir david spiegelhalter professor of risk communication at the university of cambridge observed that these estimated infection fatality rates were roughly similar to the normal annual mortality risk in the united kingdom 6 7 comparing the infection fatality rate estimates reported in 3 with the normal annual mortality rates for austria we see parallels as well  the estimated risk of death with covid-19 is for the majority of age groups roughly as high as the normal risk of dying within 12 years fig 3 black dots however the risk is not spread over the entire period but concentrated on a much shorter interval we also observe that the number of those who have died in austria with covid-19 per population size in the respective age and sex group have a similar exponential age dependency as the estimated infection fatality rates fig 2a b and 3 on closer inspection one sees that the increase of the former is somewhat steeper this could still be consistent with the infection fatality rate estimates if infection rates are higher in the upper age groups in fact if the number of people who tested positive are put in relation to the population size the current data of the ministry of health show that the group of people over 85 years of age is overrepresenteda misinterpretation would be to conclude from these considerations that the risk of death is not increased on the contrary it follows from the structure and magnitude of infection fatality rate that it is substantial especially for higher age groups although it is unclear how many people would have died in the course of the year even without covid-19 disease it can be assumed that the risk of dying from covid-19 is to a substantial extent an additional risk it is not yet known however how many years of life on average one loses through a sars-cov2 infection since many seriously ill patients with already shortened life expectancy are affected the additional effect on the general life expectancy could be less than it would be derived from mortality alone although in the long run the loss of years of life may be a more relevant figure than mortality itself in the short run especially to assess the social impact mortality is of greater importancesuch risk comparisons put the danger of covid-19 disease into perspective but it is doubtful whether this pandemic can be perceived as less drastic these mortality estimates do not take into account the possible overloading of the healthcare system and the associated indirect effects on mortality of other diseases such as heart attacks strokes or cancer which can no longer be treated appropriately according to estimates by imperial college london 3 5 of infected 40- to 50-year-old people need hospital treatment a figure that rises to over 25 for those over 80 of those treated in hospital about 6 of 40- to 50-year-old people need intensive care and over 70 of those over 80 in order to comprehensively evaluate the effects of the disease it is also necessary to consider in which state of health for example older patients who did not die leave the hospital after intensive care treatment the long-term consequences of the disease are also not yet known therefore comprehensive measures to control the spread of the epidemic are essential to prevent the collapse of the health system it is difficult to include the social and economic consequences of the measures which can also have medical consequenceseven if deaths are easier to collect than the number of people infected these figures are not without controversy firstly it is often difficult to determine whether a patient dies from covid-19 ie the virus is the cause of death or dies with the virus ie is infected but the cause of death is different two figures are currently reported by the ministry of health those of the deceased who tested positive regardless of the actual cause of death and those who died from covid-19 on the other hand there may also be an unrecorded number since covid-19 deaths may not always be recognized as such more reliable than the number of deaths due to covid-19 is the total number of deaths reports from several countries with stronger outbreaks of the epidemic indicate that the death figures in recent weeks are significantly higher than the long-term averages but also in austria increased death rates especially among the elderly have been reported recently 8 the extent to which the deaths affect people who would have died this year even without covid-19 may become apparent in the annual statisticswith the covid-19 pandemic threatening millions of lives changing our behaviours to prevent the spread of the disease is crucial and timely action mainly practising social distancing compared to the seasonal flu this deadly virus exhibits nearly twice as contagious because the double in the median reproductive index r0 seasonal flu was 128 while this r0 for coronavirus is 22 biggerstaff et al 2014 li et al 2020 it implies that the average person with flu virus will cause the infection to one other person whereas having coronavirus he could infect about two different people in addition the covid-19 also has a longer incubation therefore people could affect to the other without their intentions to be more detail the seasonal flu takes two days to have apparent symptoms however the extant medical evidence shows that the incubation period for covid-19 is up to two weeks li et al 2020 therefore this challenges the health policies to contain this virus the outbreak of coronavirus is causing the worst health crisis because the heavy pressure on the healthcare system exists which was potentially predicted that tens of millions people might die ferguson et al 2020 therefore the recent study of anderson et al 2020 emphasized that the only thing that human can do to stop the covid-19 outbreak is to change their behaviours once again individual behavior will be crucial to control the spread of covid-19 anderson et al 2020 accordingly many suggestions are raised such as washing hands more frequently and for longer avoiding public gatherings cancelling travel plans and keeping a distance from others although the efficiency of these actions is not well examined from academic and scientific evidence until now these recommendations tend to be applicable for many countries to execute at presenteven this is the global pandemic each country has its response for example vietnam japan taiwan and the other asian countries chose to lock down the national economy as well as applied the strict quarantine at the beginning of the outbreak stage in contrast the united states is likely to overlook this pandemic severity
1 one of the potential concerns might arise from cultural differences across these countries because people might have different perception and viewpoint regarding the covid-19 outbreaksthis paper is the first study to examine the global scope data from google covid-19 community mobility reports which allows seeing the changes in the percentage of people gathering in different areas such as retail and recreation grocery and pharmacy parks transit stations workplaces in comparison with the median value of baseline day 16 february 2020 in addition using the cultural dimension from hofstede 2001 study is our main predictive factor to examine the differences in human behaviours across the world our main contribution is to indicate the role of cultural factor in driving the global social distancing activities under the covid-19 pandemicwe find that only one factor matters most this is the uncertainty avoidance index uai the higher avoidance in uncertainty the lower gathering in public our results are robust by different regression models as well as the control of wealth status however we do not find any supporting evidence that cultural factors would predict the proportion of people who are staying in the home to practice social distancing our results will suggest several health implications to the authorities by framing people about uncertainty avoidance feature to encourage people mitigating social gatheringthe remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 will acknowledge the related literature about how social distancing works and the role of cultural factors in human behaviours under pandemic section 3 describes our data collection data processing and descriptive statistics before giving our conclusions and discussion in section 5 section 4 summarizes our main findings and resultsto begin with mahtani et al 2020 provided a rapid summary of the evidence for social distancing during global pandemics this systematic study also emphasizes that the timing and duration of such measures are quite essential to contain the disease outbreaks also the strategy in staggering and implementing cumulative interventions might prove most effective in the previous pandemic such as influenza pandemics therefore what people did in the previous outbreaks might be helpful in the covid-19 tough time fong et al 2020 rashid et al 2015 indicated the effectiveness of six measures to reduce community influenza transmission through a policy review of social distancing practices such as isolating ill people tracing contacts quarantine of exposed persons school dismissals or closures changes in the workplace and avoiding crowds and restricting movement at present many countries are following to shut down the educational system performing the national lockdown and forcing their citizens to stay at homethe empirical studies have indicated the efficiency of social distancing in particular remuzzi and remuzzi 2020 alerted that the european countries should avoid close contact at the individual level and social meetings in each country this is the only effective way to contain the spread of this virus in the same vein there might be 176 million people who would be saved their lives if the united states practicing social distancing greenstone and nigam 2020 however greenstone and nigam 2020 also concerned the cost-benefit analysis of social distancing when applying in the enforced ways however in reality each country has its own way to implement social distancing for instance the russian is using the financial penalty for those who do not follow the instructions the philippines and india are the typical examples to arrest those who violate the social distancing practices instead of using strict regulation some countries are using the media tools to disseminate their policies to nudge people to perform social distancinginterestingly lunn et al 2020 used the experiments to investigate how to motivate social distancing in ireland this study found that the thought of infecting vulnerable people or large numbers of people could encourage social distancing by using a sample of 500 respondents this is one of the critical findings to indicate that human behaviour can change if we understand the participants judgements about this deadly virus meanwhile lerner et al 2015 asserted that the rational information process not emotional responses despite the evidence mainly drives human behaviours however the understandings of this virus as well as risk perception about the current pandemic are quite ambiguous and not the same to every country thus the actions by the government are quite different over the foremost period it implies that this might be cultural differences in their decision-making across countries which we would like to examine this studywhen it comes to the theoretical framework for culture and social distancing we would like to acknowledge the cultural psychology which identifies the likelihood of human behaviors on the societal values under the covid-19 pandemic it is undeniable that humans behaviors are mainly based on what they perceive others in the community are doing or approvedisapprove of cialdini et al 2004 therefore the roles of culture as well as social norms heterogeneously drive human behaviors for instance while the asian countries have applied the strict and punishable rules on social distancing as the tight cultures the european countries are likely to be loose culture in recommending people to stay at home gelfand et al 2011 the previous studies such as harrington and gelfand 2014 gelfand et al 2011 indicate that the tight culture is associated with natural disasters invasions population density and pathogen outbreaks therefore these countries will form the group to coordinate as well as collaborate to keep people together during a crisis in contrast the loose culture will prioritize the privacy as well as freedom of each individualism from this perspective this has a partial connection with the cultural dimension in hofstede 2001 that people coming from individualism countries are not likely to commit the social distancing as the governmental suggestions to sum up people have to tradeoffs between their freedom and constraints from the different viewpoints across societies when doing social distancing gelfand 2019one cultural aspect influencing the human behavior is political polarization some countries might think that the popularization of information seems to cause lower political trust hetherington and weiler 2009 therefore people in these societies might believe in the misleading information which induces the wrong decision-making in the pandemic period van bavel and pereira 2018 thus the political opinion will gradually transmit to the human behavior through one of cultural dimensions particularly as masculinity versus femininity and in power distancing index of the hofstede measurementslastly the human decision-making during a pandemic involves uncertainty because people tend to avoid the uncertainties if they perceived higher risk huynh 2020 in addition those who are risk-adverse might commit to social distancing furthermore the extant literature shows that human behaviors might be affected by the others by comparing to themselves for example atanasov et al 2013 garcia-retamero and galesic 2012 hence looking at the uncertainty dimension might offer us how people react in terms of the uncertain situations regarding the covid-19 outbreaksrecently the study of caria et al 2020 indicated that there is heterogeneous behaviors among 51 countries in terms of social distancing according to this study peru is the country which exhibits the highest number of people choosing i stayed at home for the past week interestingly our dataset from google also confirms that peru ranked the second in the countries who have the highest percentage increase in residential the caria 2020 study is one of the international surveys to investigate the human behaviors as well as their belief in terms of following the social distancing under the covid-19 outbreaks in the light of how people behave the social distancing broniec et al 2020 explain that social distancing can keep flattening the infected curve which helps to remain the number of infection cases within the range of the healthcare capacity thus using the cultural factors to examine their roles on encouraging the social distancing is crucial at that time therefore we acknowledged the theoretical background that how cultures and social norms might matter to social distancing however this is the first empirical study which investigates this relationship in-deepwe used the data provided by google to observe the level of social distancing taking place in various locations such as retail and recreation grocery and pharmacy parks transit stations workplaces and residential these data are the anonymous locations to trackback several weeks over the changes across 131 countries and individual counties across the world this data represents the aggregation numbers instead of individual-level therefore it does not show the absolute values of how many people are staying in specific areas however these data exhibit the percentage changes implying the potential surges in attendance compared to the median value of baseline time specifically february 16 2020 our data were retrieved on march 29 2020 hence these numbers explain how the trends vary over 13 days in different countries for instance if the number of retail and recreation means -52 it means that vietnam has seen a 52 drop in retail and recreation moreover the positive value implies the opposite direction for example the residential in italy is 24 referring to a 24 increase in residential population over the period from february 16 to 29 march 2020the following data that we use in our estimates are cultural dimensions from the extended version of hofstede 2001 in 2015 therefore we have three main dimensions to capture the social distancing of people across the world in particular we use four main cultural dimensions that are relevant to social distancing
power distancing index pdi
 this index demonstrates the measurement of how acceptable that society has the hierarchy of power and wealth among the general population of a nation cultural or business the higher value stands for a strong hierarchy
individualism versus collectivism idv this index captures the degree to which the community reinforces individual or collective achievement people in the individualism society are expected to be different as individual as compared to loyal affiliation to a life-long in-group for example extended family friend etc the opposite side is collectivism
uncertainty avoidance index uai
 this element represents that society is afraid of uncertain unknown and unstructured situations hence this proxy can capture cultural perception in an ambiguous context in decision-making

table 1
presents a summary of descriptive statistics among our variables overall people around the world tend to reduce their gathering in the transit stations for example the airport and the retail area over the last 13 days to our great surprise the workplace is the place where people are less likely to reduce their working gathering although many governments are calling for working from home parks and grocery places have similar patterns in mitigating human interactions noticeably there is one country which experiences an increase in gathering people in parks and grocery it is the south of korea when this authority is performing the mass testing in the public community in addition the south korea is the typical example that flattened its coronavirus curve and people tend to come back their normal lives with keeping the distance at least two meters interesting the lowest value in staying a residential place is taiwan at present taiwan is likely to control the current situation see table 2
as the beginning we have 131 countries and regions observations in the google social distancing indices which is illustrated in figure 1
 after matching with hofstede indices we have the total 58 observations for further estimations in addition to compare the differences across the continents we also match each country with each region such as the asian europe latin america as well as oceania and australia to examine the differences across the continents to consider whether we should put as a control variable or not
figure 2
represents the correlation matrix among our main variables first it is very intuitive to observe that the numbers of social distancing proxies highly correlated meanwhile the lower gathering percent in workplace the higher percent in residential areas it implies that the work from home might be effective because people can increase their likelihood to stay at home second when looking at the cultural dimensions uncertainty avoidance index exhibits the negative correlation with the majority of social distancing index except residential it means that people coming from the countries with risk-adverse tend to reduce their frequency to go the public negative values and stay more at home 017 noticeably citizens from high individualism country are likely to come to the parks more frequency 017 instead of having a decrease in this percentage numbersbecause the five factor such as in retail grocery parks stations workplaces stand for the decrease in percentage compared to the median value of baseline this number also represents the human behaviors in the outdoor activities thus we perform the explanatory factor analysis to construct one proxy from these data which is representative to the outdoor social distancing
table 1 demonstrates the number of factor that satisfies the eigen value accordingly there should have one factor generated with the explanatory of variance is 8219 table 3
summarizes the proportion that each variable contributing to the social distancing variableby checking correlation with residential - the increasing percentage of people who stay at home the correlated value is -07587 p  001 if people are not likely to gather in the public implying the decrease in the percentage of social distancing the proportion in residential areas would rise accordinglybefore performing the regression to examine the relationship between the cultural dimensions and the efficiency of social distancing we executed the one-way analysis of variance and covariance anova to see whether the difference in social distancing across the continents our results suggest that significant at the 10 level differences among the four continents with f-statistics 228 df  3 in addition the anova test for residential effect has f-statistics 214 df  3 is insignificant thus it implies that the geographical effect does not apply in the social distancing we decided to not add this factor as our control variable however the use of gdp per capita as control variable is applied in many cultural economics studies including getzner 2002 dieckmann 1996 hence in our regression we performed two estimates including with-and-without the natural logarithm of gdp per capita to assure the robust of our conclusions
table 4
summarizes our main findings how the cultural factors can influence the efficiency of social distancing captured by the changing proportion of people in the outdoor activities over the period from february 16 to 29 march 2020 the robust coefficients appear in the proxy of uncertainty avoidance index across four regression models the negative coefficients are consistent to our expectations it means that people coming from higher uncertainty avoidance index would decrease their likelihood in joining in the outdoor activities in this period our finding also confirms the theoretical framework that risk-adverse citizens would do social distancing by not going to grocery pharmacy workplace or parks kappes et al 2018 emphasized that human behaviors will change when they perceive the possibility to transmit risk to others for instance when co-workers think that their decision to go to work might risk infecting the elderly colleagues suffering a serious illness they might stay at home concomitantly andreoni and bernheim 2009 offer another perspective that the british and american are unlikely to stay at home to work if they think that the risk of illness transmission is uncertain these theoretical frameworks also explain why people coming from the higher uncertainty avoidance index tend to avoid the activities in the public in our study the sole explanatory of uncertainty avoidance index on social distancing is 114 while the combination with the other determinants improve the explanation up to 1991
table 5
chronologically presents the different regressions how the cultural dimensions could predict the proportion of people staying at residential area to our great surprise three cultural factors could not predict the changes in residential areas over last 13 days it means that cultural factors could not explain why people choose to stay at home however the uncertainty avoidance index plays a predictive role on explain why citizens coming from high risk-adverse countries avoid gathering our results are robust when controlling the wealth status
figure 3
demonstrates the relationship between the uncertainty avoidance index and changes in proportion of social distancing at the public overall the european countries have the higher uncertainty avoidance in addition over last 13 days the government well applied the lockdown to compulsorily request people to stay at home as social distancing interestingly the northern european such as finland sweden and norway are unlikely to commit social distancing since these countries have lower uncertainty avoidance indicescurrently the best advice from public health authorities are sending the prominent messages that in order to contain the coronavirus pandemic people must take their actions to change their behavior one of the important behaviors is social distancing this is the first country-level research to examine the role of cultural factors on driving the efficiency of social distancing by using two dataset such as the google trackback and the extended hofstede 2001 in reality the human behaviors about social distancing are heterogeneous across the countries currently the world needs to obtain the systematic actions from many countries and regions to ask people to perform the social distancing as the forced legitimation however people are allowed to go to grocery pharmacy transit stations or parks and so forth as their necessity needs this also has the potential risks to infect and to be infected thus this study found that the country with higher uncertainty avoidance index from the hofstede 2001 dimension has less proportion in gathering at these abovementioned public areas however we do not find any evidence to explain the changes in the proportion of people staying at residential placesour study also confirms the finding from borg 2014 gaygsz et al 2017 that the cultural determinants play an important role in controlling infection behavior our suggestions are to embed core cultural values relevant to potential threats when going to the public to nudge people to avoid the social gathering under the covid-19 pandemics this is understandable to let people understand that they might have potential incubation period to infect to the others in addition this should be taken into account when interacting with the strangers in the public might increase the risky likelihood to get the coronavirus our study provides an evidence that public health strategies and interventions should be immediately taken actions to reduce the social gathering by uncertainty avoidance factorour study has been analyzed much more rapidly from preliminary evaluation than would be standard for research of this type therefore the further research about the cultural factors and the efficiency of social distancing need to be examined to draw more conclusions to the health authorities to the pandemicsthis study was funded by university of economics ho chi minh city vietnamthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperin late 2019 the chinese government notified the world health organization that it had detected a hitherto unrecognized coronavirus now named sars-cov-2 in people with respiratory distress some had died and the disease was reported to be spreading httpswwwwhointcsrdon05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-chinaen of course the disease was not spreading it was the virus that causes the disease that was spreading  and frighteningly fast and far it was obvious then that this might become a global problem and it has become just that a pandemic the government of china and in particular the chinese investigators studying this problem deserve recognition and praise for the courageous work they did in the early days of this extraordinary eventalthough sars-cov-2 is related to sars-cov the causative agent of sars it differs sufficiently in many ways enough to give it a different name and to consider it a very different virus its rapid spread essentially world-wide now threatens to cause thousands if not millions of fatalities globally at the time of this writing we cannot see over the horizon to its end perhaps some plant extract existing or newly formulated anti-viral drug or other developed substance will be found to be effective in treating the disease caused by sars-cov-2 more likely it will take an effective and safe vaccine to end this horror that will not be simple and straightforwardearly observations of patients suffering from infection with this virus suggested that young people were not sickened by it old people were killed by it and those in between became sick but recovered relatively quickly from infection with it it was not long before this supposed relatively simple clinical picture was seen to be incorrect now the epidemiologic observations regarding a larger number of patients indicate that the death rate in males is greater than the death rate in females that older people with co-morbidities are more likely to die than are otherwise healthy people also young people can be infected with sars-cov-2 albeit with a lower case-fatality rate but also shed virus and older patients can become ill and shed virus for how long and by what routes critically people in all age groups may become infected with the virus but some of them may shed virus yet do not become ill it is important to recognize that all people not infected with sars-cov-2 themselves comprise a susceptible population a harbinger of the next round of illnesses caused by this virus this is a frightening potential situation and one suggesting that total elimination of sars-cov-2 is unlikely thus what will occur when the personal controls we humans have self-applied are considered no longer necessary will the populace simply be relieved and wander out of their houses to resume life as before it is likely that life as we knew it will not be as it was before this disease was recognized there will be no miracle that occurs to make all surfaces safe on day onein summary sars-cov-2 has led to a disastrous situation and one with which the medical community of each nation must manage in some way perhaps through world health organization protocols perhaps by a novel approach because humans infected with sars-cov-2 may shed virus before they become ill or even if they never become ill they may serve as reservoirs of the virus this is a principal reason for patients and non-patients alike not to contact anyone other than a house-mate spouse children and anyone else sharing living quarters for two weeks or longer this is called social distancing but it is actually physical distancing because computers telephones the mail system and many other tools allow us to socialize at a distance rumors in the popular press have not helped the public understand the situation and statements by politicians as always bend the truth either intentionally or because they do not understand what the truth isthe spike proteins of coronaviruses mediate viral entry into cells by binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes 5 however preliminary evidence suggests that in some instances igg-virus complexes may make possible the entry of viruses to cells and infection of those cells by what has been called antibody-dependent enhancement in so doing increasing severity of infection 67this phenomenon has been shown to occur in infections with feline coronavirus sars-cov mers coronavirus influenzaviruses zika virus human immunodeficiency virus and dengue viruses and probably occurs with other viral infections or after certain vaccinations more relevant to the current pandemic it may be that older patients produce high affinity igg antibody and younger patients do not thus older patients might very well not respond as desired to a vaccine treatment with monoclonal antibody or immune serum transfer as older patients are the ones at higher risk of deadly outcome vaccination might not be suitable in this instance i hope i am wrong about thisso was the sars experience just the disease of the week or month or year it was discovered in 2003 and disappeared after 2004 after it had spread from asia to north america south america and europe as is typical funding to support research on this disease declined precipitously that is also typically unfortunate as it is only research that can maintain and defend preparedness huge amounts of money have been spent to gather information we hoped would lead to the prediction of outbreaks obviously we have accomplished little in this regard a lesson in itself but have we learned nothing perhaps each country wealthy or poor should consider putting some proportion of its income into a fund put aside as a contingency in the event of an inevitable emergency that such a fund might have to come from additional taxes is no reason to ignore this possibility pay it now or pay it later  or pay the consequences governments that do not protect their citizens from diseases are simply criminal enterprisesas humans continue to plunder the natural world by using such extractive sources such as coal oil and other forms of non-renewable energy we scavenge in unexplored areas containing wildlife that likely are infected with presently unrecognized viruses that are potential pathogens for humans andor livestock andor other wildlife recent cross-species transmission events particularly those jumping from wildlife infected with genetically malleable rna viruses have been shown to be the primary source of recently recognized human pathogens 8how many more potential human pathogens are there still and thankfully unrecognized what do we do with the possibly predictive information we gather when a previously unknown virus is recognized do we continue to repeat over and over again our discoveries and our errors are we as a species committing suicidenote at the time this opinionated column was written at least 1 000 000 people have been infected with sars-cov-2 and nearly 50 000 have died china italy spain and the usa have suffered most the end is not in sight and the devastation this virus has caused will undoubtedly lead not only to human physical misery and great sadness but to economic turmoilin italy the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 developed with extreme virulence presenting by march an official number of infected and deceased individuals higher than that of china where the pandemic first appeared as of 26 april the united states of america has the largest number of infected people followed by spain whose infected count now exceeds the number of infected people in italy by a few thousand it is worth mentioning that these figures are based only on people who tested positive to the swab and do not reflect the real impact of the infection on the general population which remains unknown furthermore testing modalities and cultural factors could explain at least some of the observed differences between countries however italy is the second countryafter the usin terms of mortality with 26977 deaths 1 the vast majority of these deaths come from individuals aged 70 years more than 84 with approximately 9500 deceased individuals aged 83 years 2 for more than fifty days coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the sars-cov-2 has forced 60 million italians into their homes schools are closed only 30 of all commercial and industrial activities are functioning the pandemic is severely testing the entire italian system in particular its welfare structures the northern regions were the hardest hit with lombardy emilia-romagna piedmont and veneto leading the ranking to cope with the emergency intensive care units were built in record time and entire hospitals were converted into covid-19 care however the pandemic found the country largely unprepared failing to provide on time the necessary protection even to its health workers with serious shortcomings regarding the supply of eyeglasses masks gloves and gowns many health professionals lacked the necessary disaster preparedness so far this has resulted in the loss of 151 doctors and 39 nurses 2 difficulties in assisting critical situations combined with the scarcity of places suitable for the reception of patients in serious conditions and lack of a sufficient number of ventilators have given rise to very painful ethical choices for health professionals on how to prioritize patients for care with the available equipment 3 the authors of this report are the vice-president ddl and the president mt respectively of the italian psychogeriatric association during the pandemic they maintained close contact with many colleagues mostly geriatricians neurologists and general practitioners in total 52 physicians operating in different contexts in italyhospitals nursing homes and their patients homes this article is not written in the form of an original research article but it is intended to be a commentary of what is happening in italy the contents of this report condense the narratives that describe the experiences of those front-line medical doctors with their senior patients during the tragic spread of sars-cov-2 the original narratives of 48 of those physicians were included in a special issue of the journal of the italian psychogeriatric association 4older adults with chronic poly-pathologies were and still are the subjects who have suffered the most from the reaction difficulties of the italian health system before the pandemic even those living in senior housing communities designed to reduce social isolation reported significant levels of loneliness 5 undoubtedly these are now exacerbated by the rules imposed in quarantine and social isolation in a journal of american medical association viewpoint steinman et al 6 eloquently described the general condition of older adults isolated at home as a consequence of the pandemic here we intend to add some considerations on the peculiar conditions suffered by italian eldersin italy in cities of lombardy such as bergamo and brescia the deaths occurred at an impressive rate giving rise to the sad televisions images of long lines of military trucks carrying coffins to incinerators often very far from the place of origin of the deceased there was no way to celebrate funeral rites nor burial in the cemeteries of the place of residence one of the most heartbreaking aspects of the loss of life associated with this pandemic was the inability to accompany loved ones in their last moments of life the isolation imposed by the pandemic means that thousands of subsequently deceased subjects were last seen when an ambulance took them to be hospitalizednursing homes neglected for too long by government administrations have paid a very high price due to the lack of protective measures and the social distancing that covid-19 has imposed in the province of bergamo lombardy in just twenty daysfrom 7 march to 26 marchover 600 deaths occurred in nursing homes with a total accommodation capacity of 6400 beds 7 to date it has been calculated that almost a quarter of all residents in nursing homes in northern italy have died due to covid-19 and that the average age of italians who lost their life with the virus was 79 years 2older people have been specifically advised to stay home given their particular vulnerability to covid-19 but also to reduce the burden on health services and limit the spread of the disease the negative effects of isolation could be particularly insidious for older adults and people with pre-existing mental illness 8 regular checks by doctors and regular intake of drug therapies can become problematic alcohol intake and smoking can increase frequently eating properly and maintaining personal hygiene can become quite difficult these aspects can increase the sense of demoralization and despair in people forced to live alone and easily suffering from loneliness and social isolation well-known risk factors for suicide in late life 9 indeed self-killing cases have been repeatedly reported in the national press 10 and can be expected as one of the most feared outcomes of the pandemic 11nursing homes have become like castles under siege where old guests can no longer leave and new guests can no longer enter given the spread of the infection within these institutions 6 healthcare professionals who work there report some peculiar elements of the behavior of the guests of those institutions residents face fear of the disease and anguish for its threatening consequences with mixed attitudes these attitudes range from continuous prayer a rosary to pray has become a frequent request from residents to a nihilistic form of fatalism there is nothing i can do i can only hope death will come without too much suffering episodes of psychomotor agitation that require drug sedation are also quite frequent residents are often seen crying constantly they have lost their roommate or people they have made friends with in the nursing home health workers wearing protections frighten them because this reminds them that the virus is highly contagious therefore getting infected and having the symptoms of the disease would just be a matter of hourswhen health conditions actually deteriorate many residents express the wish of avoiding hospitalization this is because they do not believe in a favorable treatment outcome and because they think they would only encounter unnecessary pain in complete detachment from the surrounding world they believe that there are no effective therapies and that none of the protocols operating in hospitals would have a positive outcome given that residents usually watch television for most of the time they are now aware that the vast majority of deaths are concentrated among elderly people especially those who suffer from chronic conditions as they know they are if they were to get covid-19 they do not want to be intubated but hope to be treated by someone they already know possibly the same doctors of the nursing home and overall to have the possibility to stay in touch with family members and loved ones 12 by this they mean physical contact in fact many reject the tablet offered for video communications by health workers for people living in their homes the situation is not very different from that in rest institutions italian elders have become accustomed to days sadly marked by the 600 pm television bulletin of the civil protection which communicates the number of infected people andabove allnumber of people who died in the eyes of older adults of italy those bulletins never miss the opportunity to point out that the greatest number of deaths occurs in the most-advanced age groups with a lethality index number of subjects positive to swab testsnumber of deceased subjects that reaches 30 among those who are 8089 years old the group that comprises most residents of italian nursing homesonce again according to data from istituto superiore di sanit 607 of deceased subjects suffered from at least three pre-existing pathologies eg cardiovascular disorders diabetes kidney problems etc they died on average ten days after the clinical onset of symptoms especially fever dyspnea cough etc and five days after hospitalization which in turn occurred five days after the onset of symptoms 2senior citizens living with family members often refuse to wear mask and gloves at home although they are told that the virus could spread easily among cohabiting people especially in small apartments it would be the will of god they often say similarly to the case of nursing home residents they say if i get sick do not take me to the hospital treatments are useless there and in any case im too old so it would be ok for me to pass away i just want to die in my bed these days many elders are dictating their last will while the say to their children not to worry too much for them they often ask for the presence of a doctor certifying that they are compos mentis in this way their will would have legal validity another concern is the fear of being buried in mass graves these elders are aware that nobody can hold a funeral in present times considering this they hope to be cremated with their ashes arranged in an identifiable cinerary urn most elderly people live alone many have limited or no internet knowledge and are poorly connected with other family or community members 13 quite frequently some elderly people die in complete isolation their corpses can be discovered many days after death 14 as said older adults did not grow up in an internet-connected environment using a laptop or a tablet can be a challenge to call their children and grandchildrenif ever in their livesmost of them still use an old telephone not a smartphone often television is the only company they have as well as their most efficient time killer can i survive it is the big question coming from them the more time passes the more likely they are to survive they think however the long wait is unnervingespecially in industrious regions of northern italy the unusual silence that looms in cities contributes to making the atmosphere particularly surreal many elders wonder why this pandemic arose what caused it some elderly people think that covid-19 is the consequence of divine punishment for a society that has lost any moral value despite being completely isolated from the rest of the world other elders do not feel safe inside their homes they believe that the virus is in the air it could enter through the windows or from any possible crack or gap in the walls of the house hence contagion would be inevitable and only a matter of time in these cases anxiety levels are at the top and ringing the general practitioner gp becomes an urgent need if the gp does not answer the next calls are to the police or the emergency services or to one of the numerous helplines activated in recent times to meet peoples psychological needs in italy covid-19 has violently struck a country that was insufficiently prepared to face it the pandemic has overcharged a healthcare system particularly its acute care wards and confined millions of citizens at home or in nursing homes especially in northern italy healthcare professionals were overworked and operated on the edge of their forces and energies and fatigue poor disaster preparedness and precarious availability of protective equipment also contributed to the level of stress of doctors and nurses it seems quite obvious to emphasize that adequate responses to dealing with disasters would require both specific training and appropriate equipment these appear as mandatory recommendations for future challengeslike never before peoples mental health must be supported in every possible way forced isolation loneliness and fear of contracting the disease are tough challenges for all people especially for frail elderly people 8 in the current situation promoting self-help and positive coping and reducing isolation also through technology appear imperative active outreach seems a necessity especially for older adults 15 this would help to counteract the feelings of abandonment and disempowerment that covid-19 is imposing on all members of the community with older adults being the most exposed onespeople with disabilities pwds represent a large and diverse group with about 1 in 4 adult americans reporting some type of disability1 while disability is not inherently linked to increased risk of getting covid-19 infection or in experiencing more severe disease factors or circumstances associated with disabilities may increase these risks specifically pwds are more likely to have an underlying health problem2

3 and are more likely to live in congregate care settings than those without disabilities4 both of these factors have been shown to increased risk for covid-19 infections5

6 additionally because of the nature of some disabilities individuals may have difficulty practicing routine preventive measures for example people who rely on assistance with personal care will be unable to maintain physical distancing while others may have difficulty communicating symptoms of illness resulting in delays in diagnosis and additional virus spreadthere is little doubt now that the covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented in our lifetime we will continue to learn how to contain and control the spread of the virus in the months and even years to come with this rapidly changing landscape assuring pwds are not disproportionately impacted is a global public health priority7 in this commentary we identify three areas of pressing scientific need and offer possible strategies for each a what are the types of data that would help clarify risks for pwds and assure the right types of health protection efforts prevention treatment and mitigation are in place b what can be done to improve the health protection measures for pwds through the duration of the outbreak and c how can we address the evolving issues of equity in access to and quality of medical care for pwds these three areas of need for pwds are not new or unique to the covid-19 pandemic they have been identified from prior emergencies and are integrated into the framework we discuss below for covid-197

8
with every emergency addressing the needs of high-risk populations requires scientific data to highlight who is at greatest risk so we can target intervention strategies and subsequently to monitor the effectiveness of interventions the critical nature of data on who becomes infected with the sars-cov-2 virus and who is more likely to die has been highlighted by the cdc showing that older adults racial and ethnic minority groups and those with underlying chronic health conditions are more likely to be severely impacted9

10 unfortunately there is little information that allow public health experts to break out the impact on pwds instead we mostly rely upon circumstantial information such as reports of covid-19 outbreaks among pwds living in residential care facilities11 or inferences we can make about the risk of severe health outcomes in pwds given their higher rates of chronic health conditions9 it is uncertain whether children with disabilities are at higher risk of serious complications from covid-19 infection httpsemergencycdcgovhan2020han00432asp we do know that children with underlying neurologic conditions are more likely to die from seasonal influenza also a respiratory-based illness12 a focus on children with disabilities as a vulnerable group must be a priority in future data collection effortsincorporating disability identifiers into new or revised surveillance or other data collection systems for monitoring the covid-19 outbreak is essential disability is a critical demographic identifier similar to age raceethnicity and gender with a standardized set of survey questions13 using this standard set provides information about disability type eg mobility vision hearing cognition self-care or independent living helping us pinpoint groups of pwds who are at higher risk leading to more effective mitigation measures cdc recently updated the covid-19 case report form to include a disability identifier httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovphpreporting-puihtml the challenge will be to convey the importance of reporting these vulnerability factors to the health care and public health workers on the front lines who are completing these formsalthough most people with disabilities will be identified using the standard disability screening tool this approach is likely to overlook people with intellectual disabilities intellectual disability represents a small proportion of people with disabilities yet one at high risk for severe health outcomes from covid-19 infections a recent analysis of national mortality data for deaths attributed to pneumonia prior to the covid-19 outbreak indicated a 2 to 6 times higher death rate due to pneumonia in people with intellectual and developmental disabilities compared to without these disabilities14 these findings suggest that this population might be particularly vulnerable to dying from covid-19 infections given that the virus can cause lung complications including pneumoniain addition to new surveillance or data collection systems national state and local mortality data may be used to examine people with different types of disability even while acknowledging challenges in accuracy of death certificate capturing and coding information on specific type of disability15 linking service system data with mortality data that is now available in more real-time16 at the state and local level may provide a more accurate picture of the consequence of the pandemic on segments of the disability population and help target prevention efforts beyond mortality information using existing secondary data sources such as state medicaid data or health system specific electronic health records may allow for selective snapshots that can have important healthcare and policy implications17

the spread of the virus and the public health response to contain it has evolved quickly over recent months the response strategy moving forward will involve a combination of routine virus testing with a focus on high risk settings and populations isolating and caring for those with newly identified infection and tracing and following up on anyone who has come into close contact with newly diagnosed caseswith the goal of stopping virus spread19 incorporating the needs of pwds as they relate to these basic public health functions is important to making this strategy a success and protecting this high risk group with each of these strategies access barriers for pwds will need to be addressed such as how someone who is blind will access a drive through testing center especially when ride services are not recommendeda key component to continuing to protect pwds is to have accurate and accessible health information on the virus and ways to continue to protect oneself there are many audiences for this type of information in addition to the pwds they include health care providers service providers who assist pwds and family members and other caregivers because the information on the virus and the public health response is changing rapidly it is important that we update the materials often and continue to look for creative ways to get the information out to individuals and communities communication materials need to be accessible eg braille sign language and easily understood by all audiences advocacy organizations with a direct line to pwds should be engaged throughout the process of developing disseminating and evaluating the impact of the communication materialswe already know from recent epidemiologic investigations of virus spread and containment strategies with other high-risk populations or settings specifically residents of nursing homes and homeless shelters that improved infection control guidelines have relevance to pwds who live in congregate care settings6

20 the recommendations resulting from these investigations mirror the broader response strategy referenced above of testing isolating and tracing but also include some specifics such as limiting familyvisitor access screening staff before entry for temperature and symptom checks reinforcing adherence to standard infection control strategies and ensuring that facilities have adequate supplies of masks gloves and other personal protective equipmentan emerging issue that will undoubtedly impact our public health protection response for pwds for the longer term is addressing the social and emotional needs of those living under isolated conditions following hurricane katrina it was found that pwds already had meaningful support networks in place that allowed them to be more resilient through the disaster compared to many without disabilities21 enhancing that resiliency through targeted strategies may be beneficial given that the need to self-isolate may go on for some time these strategies may include easing of restrictions on visits by family members in residential or group home settings by offering routine virus and symptom testing working with advocacy groups to create virtual and setting-specific ways to engage with those socially isolated virtual gatherings social chat rooms online exercise and movie or game nights and working with local businesses to provide easier ways to address essential needs and services specialized grocery delivery services including extending curbside pickups ride share services that target pwds and exclusive hours of service for health care or hygiene services  dental hair appointments7
some pwds worry that they may not get the best healthcare because of their disability this fear was intensified early on in the global covid-19 outbreak discussions of the need to ration lifesaving medical equipment pwds are disadvantaged because of the pervasive negative biases and inaccurate assumptions about their quality of life when quality of life quality-adjusted life years or disability-adjusted life years are considered in medical rationing decisions pwds are unfairly disadvantaged not because they have lower quality of life but because they are wrongly assumed to have lower quality of life22 in fact several states adopted crisis standards of care guidelines that categorically excluded people with intellectual disability from accessing scarce medical resources23
while the shortage of critical care and medical equipment is lessening a recent new yorker article featured several adults who are deaf and blind who expressed concerns about the inherent biases they may face in receiving equitable treatment24 to communicate with doctors or other health care providers a person who is deaf and blind needs an interpreter because of infection control requirements the lack of this essential help in the icu or other hospital settings leaves a person with communication needs especially vulnerable the no visitor policies adopted by hospitals to protect patients hospital personnel and visitors is particularly problematic for patients with disabilities who rely on assistance with activities of daily living exceptions to the no visitor policy are needed to ensure that known and acknowledged support persons such as designated family member direct support professionals or other designated caregivers are permitted to be with the patient starting with admission and through to the caretreatment process such an exception would likely be considered a reasonable accommodation under the americans with disabilities act and would improve communication between the hospital staff and pwds and allow for informed and shared decision making25 hospitals may consider adopting protocols for providing infection control briefings and providing appropriate ppes to support personsas we move further along in the pandemics trajectory we can anticipate the need for prioritizing new treatments on the horizon are potential antivirals or other pharmaceuticals for the early treatment of infections and ultimately a vaccine for prevention initial supplies may be limited particularly for a vaccine pwds should be included among those prioritized for receiving these potential life-saving treatments given the risk for contracting the disease they experiencelastly many pwds have complex medical issues that required ongoing care26 as we move into the next phases of virus containment we need to think through how to safely address routine health care issues and assure that pwds receive needed carepwds represent a diverse group with varying needs in responding to covid-19 pandemic data on who is at greatest risk of infection will help us better anticipate and meet the needs of pwds at high risk from what we know about other respiratory infections people with intellectual disabilities and children with neurologic disabilities may be at higher risk of severe outcomes from covid-19 disease and we can act now to ensure they have information and supports to mitigate this potential risk we can also anticipate that many pwds will shelter-in-place for long periods of time to reduce their risk of infection we can plan services and supports to meet the need for meaningful social interactions to maintain mental health and well-being while self-isolating because of the rapid nature of the public health response it is critical to periodically reassess and readjust our approach to best address the needs of pwds in the months and years to come and to incorporate these new practices into future emergency preparedness responsescoleen boyle no

conflicts of interest or outside fundingfor a long time popular geopolitics was not taken too seriously it was certainly seen as a relative of other forms of geopolitics but perhaps a sort of distant cousin who just gathered the low-hanging fruit to an extent this idea remains there is research in the sphere of popular geopolitics which is a little less serious than we might expect of other academic research and many respectable geographers avoid popular geopolitics because to study it would require studying popular culture but on 7 january 2015 when the brothers sad and chrif kouachi stormed the offices of the french satirical weekly charlie hebdo murdering 12 people it became clear that the study of popular geopolitics would have to be taken more seriously how did we arrive at a situation where two men decided to commit mass murder for a cartoonthere is so much that we do not know about the relationship between elites media and the general public when it comes to factors like the formation of foreign policy multiculturalism identity interstate relations soft power and the relationship between religion and the state popular geopolitics can give us a forum at which to start drawing together theories and research from many different areas to try to better understand these areasat the time of writing the charlie hebdo
case has not made it into the popular geopolitics academic press as journal review cycles are long but an earlier case has the drawings of the prophet mohammed in the danish newspaper jyllands-posten
in 2005 which led to attacks on danish
and indeed norwegian and austrian embassies and christian churches around the world ridanp 2009 sees this stemming directly from popular geopolitics in the case of the danish cartoon crisis it is crucial to stress that this time the impetus for the political conflict came from the world of popular geopolitics which has conventionally been perceived as a more or less passive reflector of geopolitical processes ridanp 2009 732 we can no longer afford to simply view popular geopolitics as a passive reflector of geopolitical processes as our daily interactions with media increase that relationship between popular geopolitics and other forms of geopolitics will become every more complex but this presents an opportunity as more data become available we have more opportunities to research and better understand the phenomenon of popular geopolitics as dittmer 2005 626 argues if we want to understand national identity and global order we need to understand popular geopoliticsdiscussions of popular geopolitics generally start with the work of  tuathail but we can wind the clock back a little further takeuchi 1980 15 discusses how geopolitics has always been of popular appeal because it gives novel explanations of political reality which conventional means have not been able to explain however this comes at a price geographys scientific basis is lost for the sake of demagogy takeuchi 1980 is very seldom referred to in the literature which is unfortunate as this analysis remains nuanced and usefulbut we are indebted to  tuathail for his work in advancing the field of popular geopolitics drawing on michael herrs herr 1977 account of the vietnam war referred to as americas first rock-n-roll war  tuathail argues that the influence of vietnam remains with us  tuathail 1996 171  chuck norris oliver stone rambo wannabes are shooting up wild zones across the globe while a remasculinisation imperativeovercoming the lack and impotence that is the vietnam syndromeunderwrote the picture-perfect slaughter of the gulf warat the time of  tuathails article it was bosnia again referring back to herr 1977  tuathail states bosnia bosnia bosnia is now everywhere it is an ongoing series in our newspapers a sound-bite on our television sets that occasionally splashes us with spectacular violence captured on videotape for our viewing pleasure we can be there now by going to a u2 concert clicking on a computer screen  tuathail 1996 171 here then we can see the start of the formal analysis of popular geopolitics while some of the events are now dated it set the stage from moving away from just analysis elite texts
prior to this analysing elite texts had been the norm and while there was a recognition that popular culture had been feeding on geopolitical events popular culture itself was seen as a bit of a waste of time dittmer 2010 1 there was recognition that popular culture could provide easy access to the events of the geopolitical world in a simplified form but for many geographers this was a little too easy ridanp 2009 730 accordingly there was a reluctance among geographers to look at popular materials in a formal way but after  tuathail 1996 geographers realised that they would have to start looking at popular culture in their analysis geographers and other academics in the classical fields of study have to their chagrin been forced to accept popular cultures increasing importance in shaping reality particularly via motion pictures television programmes comics serialised fiction blogs and user-generated content on the web saunders 2012 83one of the earliest attempts to move away from the elite focus was the analysis of the readers digest in sharp 1993 in a sense so much has changed in the world since the publication of this piece yet sharp 1993 remains a model of how to do a structured empirical analysis of popular geopolitics and serves as a reminder to us that we need to apply such methods now that social media have arrivedsharp 1993 was very conscious of the fact that critical geopolitics had been depending on elite texts the belief had been that these were the fonts of wisdom and that popular media would naturally follow their lead accordingly we only needed to read the texts at the source rather than the second-hand stuff sharp 1993 disagreed an over-concentration on the understandings of elites tends to collapse the sociology of knowledge production into the internal dynamics of the geopolitical text geopolitics does not simply trickle down from elite texts to popular ones it is thus not sufficient only to interpret elite texts sharp 1993 493 this allowed her to develop the notion of geopolitics and you popular participation in the creation of a geopolitical enemy sharp 1993 495 
for the actual analysis sharp 1993 looked at all articles in the period 19801990 the second cold war referring to the soviet union of the 89 articles in that period only one was sympathetic to the soviet union and that was a piece on the december 1988 armenian earthquake in the other 88 articles she found there is a constant set of themes running through all soviet storieswhether ethnographic sociological religious and so onwhich provide a consistent characterisation allowing the credible creation of a soviet geopolitics by the digest thus every representation of the ussr is a political action it fits into the discursive structuring of the usa and ussr as polar opposites a structure centered upon irresolvable difference sharp 1993 501
debrix 2007 looks at the ways in which television news in the usa feeds back to elites the usa has an especially aggressive type of tabloid geopolitics in which viewers are constantly told of the dangers facing the usa see the discussion of the oreilly factor in dittmer and dodds 2008 439 because of the volume of talk shows and news programmes presented in sensationalist ways debrix 2007 argues that the intellectuals of statecraft in the usa start to present geopolitics in the same way as eye-catching fear-inducing spectacular shocking scandalising and overtly simplistic debrix 2007 as such international relations ir scholars start presenting their work in terms of danger national security terror and war again this presents opportunities for new research is this the case in other countries have ir scholars always framed their narratives in these ways for instance during the cold war or has something changed have social media changed the dynamicdebrix 2007 923 refers to
tabloid geopolitics as something which entertains shocks sensationalises and simplifies it does this by giving common sense explanations and fancy maps to create a sense of fear and inevitable danger in an earlier piece debrix argued that tabloid geopolitics works from the assumption that americans do not want to hear about their everyday life americans do not want to read or hear that they are underpaid overworked bullied at work in the home when serving their country in foreign lands they want glamorous stories scandals exceptional events news they can build dreams on or develop a sense of anger from in short they want to be entertained debrix 2003 152 glynn 2000 argues that this creates an environment in which people are constantly seeking new bits of exciting news before the first bit has even finished a mix of exhaustion and desire for the next media event long before the present one has even reached its culmination glynn 2000 1819 glynn was writing with reference to the oj simpson case and the death of princess diana his argument applies even more in the age of social mediaone of the most powerful parts of the tabloid geopolitical discourse is the map some of the tricks of the cartographic trade harley 1989 7 were discussed in chap 101007978-1-137-52217-72 but tabloid realism takes these to the next level tabloid realist maps are no longer the binary simplistic red versus blue cartographical representations of the cold war era they are now fluid multi-dimensional almost holographic projections of this geopolitical discourse this does not mean though that these different-looking maps are necessarily less artificial delimiting and reality producing than the older maps debrix 2003 162 consider the map presented in fig 41 when cartoonist edward linley sambourne drew his cartoon of the rhodes colossus striding from cape town to cairo in punch magazine in 1892 it was intended as a piece of satire yet in daily news broadcasts today there is no satire people standing on maps and surveying the world beneath their feet are the new normal thankfully news anchors have experts fig 42 to explain these maps and their geopolitical reality to us which is the subject of the next sectionif the link between experts and policy is an area we do not quite understand the link between celebrities and policy is an even more understudied area as benwell et al 2012 points out celebrities can issue official and policy-prescriptive statements endorsed by others such as the academic economist jeffrey sachs benwell et al 2012 1there is a long history of celebrity involvement in geopolitics for instance benwell et al 2012 look at jane fonda and muhammad alis criticism of the us involvement in vietnam in the 1960s more recently they look at george clooney being arrested outside the sudanese embassy in the usa in 2012 as he protested against the sudanese governments actions in darfur additionally they look at bono and bob geldofs campaign over the famine in ethiopia richard geres campaign on tibetan independence oprah winfrey on education in south africa madonna on health care in malawi and the involvement in the
falklandsmalvinas by sean penn and pink floyds roger waters benwell et al 2012 these celebrity geopoliticians can be given impressive titles such as un goodwill ambassador cline dion or un messenger of peace michael douglas yet again they are mostly understudied in formal analyses of popular geopoliticsas the discussion of the 
charlie hebdo murders at the start of the chapter shows the impact of cartoons on geopolitics can hardly be overstated ridanp 2009 explores how the publication of cartoons of the muhammed in the danish newspaper
jyllands-posten became a geopolitical conflict which caused unexpected reactions at various levels of the social and political bureaucracy ridanp 2009 730
cartoonists have long faced violence from state and non-state actors dodds 2007 158 looks at how cartoonists have faced violence intimidation and death because their work ridicules the powerful and contributes to stereotypes3 as far back as 1831 french cartoonist honor daumier was given a six-month prison sentence for drawing king louis philippe as a monster tun 2002 48 more recently uruguayan cartoonist francisco laurenzo pons was arrested and tortured in 1978 lebanese cartoonist naji salim-al-ali was shot dead in london in the 1980s iranian cartoonist manouchehr karimzadeh was put in prison by the islamic revolutionary court and yugoslavian cartoonist predrag koraksic corax was taken to court for offending politicians in 1993 tun 2002 49
nevertheless there has been a belief that cartoonists are somehow inferior to other journalists and as a result they become outsiders in the journalistic community this outsider status however allows them to use satire in a way in which their journalistic colleagues cannot ridanp 2009 732
the study of cartoons is useful as it shows us clearly the importance of not just focusing on elites see dodds 2010 ridanp 2009 looks at reactions to the cartoons in
jyllands-posten the reactions were worldwide drastically intensive and occurred at several administrative levels there were political meetings all over the world public protests boycotts of danish products public criticism in the media official statements and apologies issued by various international organisations and national governments serious threats closures of embassies and armed conflicts ridanp 2009 736clearly non-elites can have profound influences on popular geopolitics we need to pay attention to themparallels between the james bond films and contemporary geopolitics have been drawn dodds 2006 links osama bin laden with the blofeld character and al qaeda with the criminal organisation spectre similarly saunders 2012 sees zombie films as being reflective of geopolitics the films 28 days later and 28 weeks later are contextualised in terms of britain as a declining island nation with links made between foot and mouth disease severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and avian fluyet ultimately such accounts are unsatisfying yes we can see geopolitics on the silver screen but in these analyses that is where it stops as researchers of geography and conflict we want to see cinema feeding back we want to find evidence of it influencing policymore interesting is when hollywood feeds back when cinematic representation starts influencing reality the saving private lynch case is particularly informative private jessica lynch was rescued from an iraqi hospital in nasiriyah where she was being held prisoner according to an iraqi doctor at the hospital anmar uday it was like a hollywood film they cried go go go with guns and blanks and the sound of explosions they made a show  an action movie like sylvester stallone or jackie chan with jumping and shouting breaking down the doors kampfner 2003 the pentagon claimed she had suffered bullet and stab wounds torture and interrogation according to the bbcs correspondent programme however she did not receive any bullet or stab wounds and indeed had received the best medical treatment available including blood donated by hospital staff and the rescue was from a hospital long deserted by the iraqi army the film of saving private jessica it was suggested included us forces firing blanks to liven up the action crampton and power 2005 257
dittmer 2005 628 argues that comics are important to geopolitics as they appeal to a young audience exactly when they are starting to form their socio-spatial frameworks dittmer looks to that most patriotic of us cartoons captain america dittmer 2005 629 looks back the very first issue in which the comic takes part in constructing a geopolitical reality in which there is a war-mongering europe and a peace-loving americadittmer argues that captain america presents us foreign policy as being defensive not offensive to make this case he focuses on captain americas weapon a shield which is unusual for american comic characters most have a rather more dramatic offensive weapon dittmer 2005 630 argues that this is important means through which to create the idea that american foreign policy interests are purely defensiveagain though it is hard to see how this research could be used to look at how comics feed back to the policy community or how seriously people take them also non-american cases need to be considered such as manga in japan consider for instance the hadashi no gen series by hiroshima survivor keiji nakazawa
conspiracies also need to be considered as part of popular geopolitics for jones 2012 45 conspiracies are not just beliefs held on the fringes of society they are common-place they cross the spheres of politics science and popular culture and should be seen as important to mainstream public debatein the case of conspiracy we can see instances of feedback to overseas elites jones 2012 cites the case in 2010 of the then iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad addressing the un general assembly in which he claimed that the majority of americans believed that parts of the us government organised the 911 attacks to stimulate the us economyjones 2012 45 goes on to conclude that there is an imperative for geographers to critically interrogate the discourses of conspiracy which circulate across and between actors networks scales and territories and which have the capacity to shape how people understand the world around them and thus how they choose to act within it it is especially important that this research includes countries other than the usadiseases do not respect borders and diseases have been subject to the earliest forms of geo-spatial analysis see snow 1855 in october 2014 the ebola virus started to trend on twitter revealing the fears of many people about the disease it is hard to determine exactly how many tweets were sent on the subject of ebola however in preparing this case study a census day was set 16 october 2014 during which at some points over 40 tweets with the word ebola in them were being sent every second we can determine the geographic coordinates of approximately two per cent of these and of them the overwhelming majority came from the usa as is shown in fig 436
by analysing these tweets we can learn something about the fears people have in us society and how these fears far transcend a virus we can reduce the us-based tweets to 15 categories many of which overlap fig 44 interestingly one of the biggest areas of overlap is anti-democratanti-obama which overlaps with schools racism religion conspiracy theorists and conflating other issues

clearly the trends found in these tweets intersect well with the themes which have emerged in this chapter on popular geopolitics also as twitter gives us the ability to geocode tweets we can start to do serious analyses with them both cross-nationally and sub-nationally as these new popular data are available we should start using them but perhaps most interestingly as twitter is used by people from a diverse cross section of society it starts to break down the elitenon-elite distinction discussed at the start of this chapter political geographers have been reluctant to engage with popular media it is time to start engagingstudies of popular geopolitics have proceeded in a rather fitful way one of the reasons for this is that the people involved keep changing researchers have engaged with popular geopolitics for a while and then moved on to other things few people have stayed with the field for a number of years dittmer 2010 xviiiin order to move the field forward we need to start filling the gaps in the literature one gap is that of audience research dittmer and dodds 2008 445 point out that there has been an acknowledgement that popular geopolitical studies have still to demonstrate in detail how and in what manner certain films magazines and the internet are indeed consumed but we need to know more about how they are consumed we need to know how they feed back into the formation of foreign policy and perhaps most interestingly how public opinion in one country affects foreign policy in anotherwhile many researchers talk about the relationship between elite and pluralist models of foreign policy few actually do any empirical research on it there is a good reason for this it is difficult woon 2014 cites two reasons for this difficulty first audience interpretations are multitudinal and hard to pin down comparing peoples popular geopolitical imaginations thus becomes an exercise in futility rendering it highly difficult to make generalised conclusions about the entire audience second audiences are often deluged with mediated messages from a variety of popular sources and it is in the aggregate that they have an impact it thus becomes a fruitless task to identify one cultural artifact as having an effect on people in all but the most unusual circumstances woon 2014 660 but thankfully researchers are finding creative ways to overcome these obstacles and move popular geopolitics in new policy-relevant ways as has been discussed earlier tagos research illustrates this trend with research which has been presented to the japanese ministry of foreign affairs tago 2010 ikeda and tago 2014 tago and ikeda 2015 pilster et al 2015 kohama et al 2016 similarly woon 2014 is another notable exception woon carries out semi-structured interviews in the philippines looks at representations of life in mindanao and studies how the philippines daily inquirer the newspaper with the highest readership and circulation in the philippines covers conflict there in so doing not only is this work actually doing empirical research in popular geopolitics but it is also moving beyond the us bias although geographers have been pivotal in elucidating how wars against terrorism waged in different parts of the world have to be constructed as just in order to gain moral legitimacy there seems to be an overwhelming focus on critiquing the uss justifications of its war on terror policies in foreign sovereign territories this paper however departs from these above works insofar as it casts attention on the philippines governments internal war against its own dissident citizenry woon 2014 659finally dittmer and dodds 2008 highlight another area in which popular geopolitics needs to move new media associated with the internet deserve greater scrutiny and need to be tied to the popular geopolitical corpus in the light of the growing importance of activities such as blurbs blogging and threads using online platforms and other sites such as the internet movie database imdb around the world dittmer and dodds 2008 445 since dittmer and dodds 2008 the number of people using social media on a daily basis has increased enormously and this includes people from many parts of society as researchers of popular geopolitics trying to understand how decisions are made about human conflict we absolutely need to research these new media as they are breaking apart the old distinctions between elites and non-elites which popular geopolitics was built ona recent who declaration1 reports that over 95 of covid-19 related deaths in the european region currently the epicentre of the pandemic alongside with north america occurred in people older than 60 years elaborating on these figures we want to make a clear statement to reinforce the protection of each nations older adults and to promote intergenerational equity and solidarity this message deserves to be fully understood in light of the potential discrimination against older people in the current public debate regarding the allocation of scarce medical resources during the present pandemicpriority setting in healthcare ie the task of determining the priority to be assigned to a service a service development or an individual patient at a given point in time 1 is unavoidable because the demand for healthcare exceeds resource availability particularly in pandemic circumstances however even under conditions of resource scarcity priority setting processes should not compromise the basic human rights to health and wellbeing of any stratum of the population especially that of older people and other vulnerable groups yet there is a real risk that the immense pressure on resources exerted by the covid-19 pandemic may result in the prioritisation of key services across different age groups based on actual or future contribution to society or on other utilitarian criteriain this context older people may be seen as a particularly large and vulnerable group and one which plays a less active role in society especially from an economic point of view therefore in an attempt to optimise resources older people might be considered as having a priori less rights to high-quality healthcare than younger generations who tend to be seen as less vulnerable and more active members of society on the contrary we want to emphasise that resource scarcity and utilitarian calculus should not undermine older peoples rights to receive high-quality healthcare societies have a moral imperative to protect and respect the dignity and autonomy of older people 2 moreover in line with philosophical accounts which regard vulnerability as valuable 3 we also wish to highlight that older people can enrich societieswe are not claiming that age parameters should not be considered while facing the allocation of scarce sources our aim is to strongly oppose the idea of setting an a priori age cut-offs to decide who should get access to healthcare as such ideas discriminate against older people we believe that especially during the covid-19 pandemic there is the need to focus on this issue since there are some initial signs of such discrimination thus we wish to show how these discriminatory phenomena can cause severe negative outcomes not only from the moral standpoint of respect for dignity and autonomy of older people but also from the utilitarian perspective of achieving the greatest good for the greatest amount of peoplein italy  one of the first european countries hit by the pandemic and one among those with a significant proportion of older individuals siaarti2 guidelines on admission to intensive care units icu envisage or at least do not exclude the possibility of a priori age cut-offs the main argument is that elderly patients may need longer intubation time and have less chance of survival than younger patients the argument is also underpinned by the utilitarian calculus of maximisation of benefit for the greatest amount of people 4
an age limit for the admission to the icu may ultimately need to be set the underlying principle would be to save limited resources which may become extremely scarce for those who have a much greater probability of survival and life expectancy in order to maximize the benefits for the largest number of people in the worst-case scenario of complete saturation of icu resources keeping a first come first served criterion would ultimately result in withholding icu care by limiting icu admission for any subsequently presenting patient recommendation 3 their emphasis
this discrimination against older people seems to have spread to other countries which are dealing with the covid-19 tsunami in the us  where there are triage frameworks which do not categorically exclude large groups of patients therefore also older people 5 opinion-leader bioethicist a caplan interviewed by a major national newspaper makes similar age cut-off claims which are also underpinned by utilitarian calculus
although a patients age is not the only consideration it is one it would be dishonest if we didnt say age is a driver age is correlated with resilience because younger patients in general get better faster they may free up a ventilator more quickly for the next patient3
moreover in the us social distancing measures have been implemented rather late andor sporadically across different states including states with populations older than the national average4 effectively putting older people and other vulnerable groups at risk a common argument for such inconsistent implementation was the decision to assign more importance to the economy than to the health of the population  alongside the false myth that younger people could not develop serious complications from covid-195these initial signs of age discrimination in time of covid-19 seem to go in parallel with a contemporary dangerous trend there are indeed some scholars supporting the idea both of a priori age-based cut-offs for access to certain kinds of medical intervention and preaching that older people should sacrifice themselves for the good of younger generations before the emergence of covid-19 an american oncologist and bioethicist e emanuel sparked some controversy 6 after writing about his plan to self-impose a cut-off of 75 years for access to any curative treatment and accepting only palliative treatment6 such proposals echoed the previous 65 year cut-off advocated by d callahan 7 and even arguments about the existence of a duty to die 8the common denominators of these positions include the utilitarian idea that continuing to live after a certain age can impose significant financial burdens to healthcare systems as well as financial and emotional burdens to family andor caregivers younger generations and society as a whole another denominator is the critique of the hype around biomedical innovation and the tendency to overmedicalize death which may foster illusions of immortality finally these positions share the idea that living too long can also be a loss for the old persons in terms of their own quality of lifethe same arguments used by those who sustain those a priori age-based cut-offs have previously featured in literature for example they are not too dissimilar from the ones used by trollope in his 1882 satirical dystopian novel the fixed period 9 here he depicts a society that has progressed beyond the limits of civilisation and has agreed upon euthanasia a decent and comfortable departure for the elderly when they reach the age of 67 and a halfunfortunately the abstract and fictional positions sketched above are currently being actualised for example in texas lieutenant governor dan patrick said he would be willing to die to preserve the us economy from covid-19 public health measures as someone who turns 70 next week he was in the high-risk group but    he was willing to give up his life for his six grandchildren7 in italy father giuseppe berardelli 72 died after choosing to give his respirator to a younger coronavirus patient8an important argument against potential age-related euthanasia or suicide and against the dangerous and immoral stigmatisation of aging is the fact that older people should have the same rights as others to receive high-quality health care and the rights not to be spurred  especially by key opinion leaders - to consider their own death as something good moreover not all older individuals have the same clinical psychosocial and other contextual features and expectations that is what could be good for emanuel callahan patrick and berardelli may not be good for others a 70-year-old patient may have a better chance of survival and benefit more from intensive or other forms of medical treatment than a 30-year-old one notably there are studies showing how the so called oldest old  ie patients 90 years old or older  with early stage lung cancer can benefit from surgery 10 even in the context of the current pandemic there is revealing news eg in italy a 101-year-old man9 and a 102- year-old woman10 have recovered from covid-19these examples are also in line with the who active aging policy framework that is the process of optimizing opportunities for health participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age 11moral imperative of respect for the autonomy and dignity of old people notwithstanding discriminatory positions are problematic also from a utilitarian and economic point of view for example us citizens aged 50 and older represent the 35 of the entire population account for 40 of the national gross domestic product and contribute 43 of us taxes 12 while it is important to honour those who have survived into their later years for their contributions to family and society it is also important to understand the practical and objective contributions that older adults still make to their communities and their families and occasionally even to the worldit seems that there is a contradictory attitude towards the older population on the one hand older people are cajoled especially for business reasons the silver economy on the other hand as soon as the younger generation is under pressure older people run the risk of being stigmatised or discriminated 13 it is also important to highlight that such forms of discrimination can pit one generation against the other seriously impoverishing the whole fabric of societiesexceptional and austere situations like the current and previous pandemics can elicit the best and the worst of humanity despite the current covid-19 circumstances or possibly even more so it is key to shape the public sphere in ways that allow to recognise both the vulnerabilities and potentialities of all generations one way to do so is to respect the individual person going beyond categories such as age or age groups and to promote intergenerational equity and solidarity by fostering connectedness across different generationscaring and protecting older people is not only about respecting their dignity and autonomy it opens up invaluable possibilities for all generations to engage with collective memories and traditions  promoting the exchange of skills knowledge and understandingfirst multi-level governance of this global pandemic is fundamental at the outset we challenge political and public scepticism illustrated by the incapacity of politicians and laypeople to listen and learn from scientific knowledge and professional know-how in the context of uncertainty and vulnerability governance denotes the way that governments public administrations private enterprises and community associations interpret the pandemic and how they decide collectively to respond to it in order to reduce known unknowns about this beta-type coronavirus with species jump the coordinated synthesis of interdisciplinary information and knowledge professional know-how and individual and social perceptions and understandings are necessary then this broad understanding can be applied to define the appropriate allocation of many types of resources eg administrative financial human material medical pharmaceutical and scientific necessary to implement effective responses see fig 1 in contrast to south korea and taiwan many european countries have reacted by following the propagation of this coronavirus rather than being proactive to prevent it despite the warnings made by scientists from 2004 1 the contrasting responses of federalnational stateregional and citylocal authorities between and within countries since january 2020 illustrate how differently this real-world challenge has been interpreted for example comparisons between cities in the lombardy and veneto regions in northern italy highlight successes and shortcomings that can be interpreted as lessons learned 2several types of resources coexist for coordinated action and systemic responses to this extraordinary situation administrative behavioural financial health care legal and medical resources and have been used at different geo-political levels sometimes in an uncoordinated fashion of winner takes all notably some actions have been endorsed by the world health organization eg confinement quarantine distancing testing washing hands whereas others have not eg wearing masks in public spaces the diverse interpretations and responses of governments and public administrations confirm that evidence-based policy is a theoretical concept that is often not applied in current circumstances like many others including ambient air pollution and passive tobacco smoking notably some local authorities in american and european cities have not introduced systematic testing and proactive tracing or legally binding measures to protect population healththe second prerequisite condition is the importance of specialised data information knowledge and professional know-how required to understand and counteract a new virus for which there is still no proven medical or pharmaceutical remedy the known unknowns about this coronavirus can be identified and studied using principles of one health ecological public health and planetary health during transdisciplinary research and practice in community settings to collect facts on the ground beyond the walls of laboratories 3 the non-linear uncertain and unpredictable characteristics of this coronavirus are derived from the evolving interfaces between natural ecosystems and human-made environments that accommodate people and all other living organisms that may be vectors of zoonoses including this coronavirus these novel situations created by rapid urbanisation in cities and mega-urban regions can be analysed by interdisciplinary case studies of the multiple consequences of rapid urbanisation these transdisciplinary case studies should combine biological epidemiological medical and veterinary research together with methods of behavioural and social science researchin addition to knowledge and know-how acquired from biological ecological health medical and veterinary sciences this pandemic confirms the crucial function and contribution of access to many types of resources when they are needed in particular sufficient stocks of medical equipment hospital wards with specialised infrastructure replenished supplies of pharmaceutical products adequate numbers of trained and qualified medical doctors nursing staff and auxiliary personnel in hospitals medical centres and nursing homes for elderly persons and coordinated uses of all these resources when the virus is first diagnosed in specific localities we now know from experience in asian countries and italy that the timing of responses to the first diagnosis of this virus in specific cities and mega-urban regions is crucial for the effectiveness of counter-measures the comparison and stark contrast between interventions and resources in asian cities including seoul taipei and singapore compared with london and new york is a timely reminder that anticipation by proactive thinking and preemptive measures by prospective planning vary considerably between countries and cities irrespective of their gdp or political regime the asian cities learned important lessons from the coronavirus sars-cov-1 in 20022003 which impacted more than 28 countries highlighting the fundamental contribution of preemptive measures founded on empirical knowledge also national and city comparisons confirm the vital contribution of strategic public health policies after a global shift towards the privatisation of medical and health care services in the last three decades in many countries ironically many advocates of laissez-faire and neo-liberal economics now expect governments to intervene to support private enterprises that are financially fragile or bankrupt including those that failed to provide much needed medical and pharmaceutical equipment currently imported from foreign countries 4the third prerequisite condition that influences effective national city and communal responses to counteract the transmission of coronavirus concern individual household and community adherence to behavioural norms and new regulations introduced by national and local governments some interventions by governments and public administrations concern regulating personal behaviour and interpersonal contacts for example norms and rules include different degrees of confinement controlled access to outdoor public spaces markets and shops social distancing wearing masks and washing hands public adherence to these norms and rules cannot be assumed owing to cultural social and psychological reasons including religious customs spiritual beliefs group identity and the notion of individual liberty diverse individual and group perceptions of health risks attributed to coronavirus coexist in societies that have endorsed the supremacy of individualism at the expense of collectivism the authority of divine providence and rights of humans above all other living organisms on earth in this context of heterogeneous lifestyles values and worldviews appropriate data and information should be effectively communicated to target groups in order to create responsible behaviour not only for individual health or social well-being but also for the common good we now know there are crucial compromises and trade-offs between individual liberty and personal responsibility as well as fundamental collective choices about how to respond to economic health and social threats in the context of uncertainty and vulnerabilitywe also know that a patient-centred strategy that targets highly vulnerable individuals and groups should be complemented by a community-centred approach the negative impacts of this pandemic confirm a well-known correlation between socioeconomic inequalities and mortality rates of populations at national regional and city levels 5 while targeting populations should identify and respond to the needs of vulnerable groups this pandemic confirms that an area-based approach in countries and cities is also pertinent eg wuhan in the province of hubei china bergamo and lodi in the province of lombardy italy this dual approach often used in environmental health interventions underlines the importance of working with an in-depth understanding of the contextual conditions in which the coronavirus has been diagnosed normative behavioural codes and rules should not ignore the societal context including inter- and intra-urban differences notably a who recommendation to wash hands repeatedly is unrealistic for all those people an estimated 790 million people 11 of the worlds population who do not have access to a supply of affordable clean and safe water 6this brief commentary confirms that our livelihood and our health are strongly influenced by the biological ecological financial political and cultural milieu in which we live this milieu our habitat and our livelihoods are founded on fundamental monetary and non-monetary values the extraordinary situation of the current pandemic should be a catalyst for rethinking the hierarchy of priorities and values used implicitly and explicitly to sustain our societies the capacity of public authorities private enterprises scientists practitioners and community associations to respond effectively to major public health threats such as this coronavirus should be founded on in-depth understanding of the medical veterinary and societal variables that influence health and quality of life in specific cities there are significant differences between health impacts in geneva and zurich switzerland or between adelaide and sydney in australia or between boston and new york city in the usa and these differences need deciphering in each city a dual temporal perspective should be used to understand its particularities initially short-term responses should respond to patients and curtailing the transmission of the virus within and between cities and countries this immediate response should be supplemented by mid- and long-term responses founded on strategic actions initiatives that reduce health and economic vulnerabilitythe growing number of accounts of the impacts of coronavirus in countries and cities north and south of the equator presented by the mass media in recent weeks highlights the shortcomings of neo-liberal economics and the fragility of human life in a world that has been transformed by rapid globalisation and urbanisation these ongoing processes around the globe have reduced the resilience of many countries and cities to counteract global threats because they have lost their capacity to act autonomously after becoming subservient to global production processes and trade with foreign countries in international markets eg dependent on imported face masks pharmaceutical products and ventilators from abroad to meet national demand some wealthy countries including switzerland rely heavily on foreign medical and nursing staff to efficiently operate public and private hospitals surprisingly some national governments have reacted by reintroducing controls at national borders which has been ineffective in limiting the propagation of the pandemic to over 210 countries and the transmission of the virus-provoking excess mortality in countries global governance is not possible if some countries do not comply with international agreements 7 these expressions of nationalism and sovereignty ignore that a global pandemic cannot be contained by closing national bordersthe main focus of discussion in european and other countries about the impacts of this pandemic on national economies has concentrated on lower production and consumption gdp in 2020 the need for public financial support to maintain private enterprises affected by the pandemic and grants for employees in the formal sector who have become unemployed the absence of attention to the impacts of this coronavirus on people working in the informal sector reinforces the lack of concern about health impacts of workers in all sectors including formal health services and personal care and welfare 8 it is unrealistic for workers to respect behavioural codes and rules that ignore that person-to-person contact is the basis on which daily work and income depend media reports indicate that many workers including doctors and nurses in hospitals and nursing homes do not have the personal equipment necessary to protect themfinally public anxiety about this situation supported by mass media and social networking should raise major concerns about the quality of life and resilience of all peoples that can be influenced by major ecological threats eg climate change and extreme weather events economic instability since 2008 in many countries technological accidents eg fukushima in 2011 and ongoing civil unrest and warfare in several continents we need to rethink the real interconnected nature of our lives and the livelihoods of others on earth in contrast to the false claims for nationalism and protectionism in some countries notably we recall the plight of many victims of hunger and malnutrition that can be avoided by concerted action we underline here that about 9 million people die of hunger and malnutrition each year and 3 million of these are children who starve to death while about a third of all food produced is disposed as waste likewise the absurdity of the request for social by staying at home given that not less than 150 million people are declared homeless and 16 billion are estimated to live in inadequate housing 9 the fundamental issue is whether the current pandemic will be a catalyst for collective radical rethinking about the future of us and others in a world that should become more ecologically responsible more economically just and more socially equitable for the common good or a shared quest for returning to business as usualdiseases have probably existed since soon after the first life evolved all organisms known today have diseases these infections harm bacteria fungi protozoa plants and animals many of our diseases have their own diseases disease is an inescapable feature of human life humans can contract communicable diseases from bacteria fungi helminthes protozoa viruses and prions a little biology my favorite subject is required to understand how they cause disease how novel diseases can arise and why some of them are so difficult to controlhelminthes are simple animals little microscopic worms these animals often lack digestive systems as they take nutrition directly from their hosts they have complex life cycles and can inhabit several hosts evolution has stripped these animals down to only the basics required for living off others schistosomiasis is the most common helminth disease causing widespread suffering initial infection can cause fever chills and liver and spleen enlargement chronic infections can lead to liver or kidney failure bladder cancer heart failure and other symptoms this disease is difficult to treat and causes major suffering in the world at any one time over 200 million people are infected mostly in africa this disease is a major cause of suffering but we dont know enough to eradicate it we have studied most tropical diseases far less than those influencing populations in wealthier temperate countries worldwide cooperation in study of all major diseases is required to decrease the amount of suffering related to helminth diseasesfungal diseases are becoming more dominant as sources of mortality they are particularly problematic for immune-compromised patients but some of the diseases are endemic in environments around the world they cause less mortality than many other diseasesprotozoa are single-celled microbes that are tremendously diverse and play both positive and negative roles for humans protozoa cause a variety of nasty diseases including african sleeping sickness giardia and cryptosporidium two major causes of diarrhea these diseases are difficult to control because protozoa are more like us than bacteria and chemicals that kill them tend to harm humansof the diseases caused by protozoa malaria is one of the top diseases causing death and suffering in the world mosquitoes carry this disease and it is common in tropical areas worldwide as global warming increases temperatures mosquitoes will move into formerly colder climates spreading malaria to new areas there are over 200 million cases and a half million deaths each year from malaria this is one of the major scourges of humanity and it is a difficult disease to prevent and cure more research is essential to control this diseaseprions are strange disease agents that arise from proteins that cause other proteins to change shape and become ineffective the mad cow disease is probably the best known of these diseases this prion-caused disease arose when meat producers in europe fed animals neural material brain and spinal tissues from other cattle cannibalism is not natural for cattle but the practice arose because it stimulated growth when animals consumed waste by-products from other slaughtered cattle some of the sick animals had a protein in their brains that was defective and could infect the brains of other cattle when ingested if people unknowingly eat beef contaminated with some of this infected neural tissue they also become infected the defective protein causes human neural proteins to lose their function slowly over time people have died from this and related prion diseases however this number is small relative to other diseases and i will not consider it furthersome of the worst diseases of humankind are bacterial including the black death  plague tuberculosis cholera salmonella and coliform diseases while antibiotics allow treatments for many of these diseases they still infect and kill millions of people each year bacteria are very simple cells and can completely replicate themselves if provided the basic vitamins and compounds they require the vast majority of bacteria are harmless to humans and even beneficial for instance if we did not have bacteria that decompose dead animals and plants the earth would rapidly fill with these and there would be no resources left for the livinga very small number of bacteria relative to the total millions of species on earth can cause significant disease in humans of these some do so incidentally and can live indefinitely in the environment without ever interacting with a human in any way however a few can only live in animals and can lead to debilitating if not fatal diseases intermediate between these two strategies are the bacteria that opportunistically cause disease in humans but can live freely without an animal hostviruses like prions are not individual life forms they are more like information parasites that completely rely on their hosts for reproduction viruses take advantage of the fact that we use dna as the blueprint containing the information we use to make all cellular components and rna to translate that information from dna into the structure and machinery of the cells proteins viruses subvert the cells reproductive machinery for their own nefarious purposes the reproduction and dispersal of more viruses all viruses unlike bacteria must take advantage of living cells with dna to reproduce viral diseases include hiv smallpox polio hepatitis influenza ebola and rabies viral diseases also infect and kill millions of people per yearour bodies and our species are engaged in ongoing arms races against our diseases just as all other species are in a biological arms race with their diseases in the short-term our immune systems learn to recognize and fight diseases in the long-term humans have evolved defenses against the diseases for each defense humanity has evolved the diseases have evolved ways to get around the defensethe red queen hypothesis describes this arms race the red queen from lewis carrols alice in wonderland needs to run as fast as she can just to stay in place this hypothesis suggests that organisms need to evolve as fast as they can to keep up with the organisms with which they interact because they are evolving as well this is a case of feedback as both members of the interaction need to keep evolving to survivein the case of human diseases this arms race leads to a situation where humans are constantly adapting to their diseases and the diseases are constantly evolving to take advantage of their hosts more effectively to make things more complex a disease that can jump from host to host such as the flu that can move from pigs to humans can escape the evolved defenses of one host by moving into another we will consider this more completely when considering diseases arising from other animals sometimes these crossover diseases are too successful in this case the disease can completely kill off its new host leading to extinction of the disease itself it is certainly a worst-case scenario that such a disease would arise in humanshumans have an immune system that can protect against most invasive diseases but once an invader evolves a mechanism to skirt the human immune system it can infect people everywhere infections will occur as long as humans do not evolve a way to keep the disease from reproducing or find a way to avoid exposure to the disease evolution to evade human immune defense is why viruses that cause colds move though human populations so readily the group of cold viruses has evolved a way to swap genetic information continuously creating new viruses there are around 100 strains of cold virus and each person gets a cold roughly twice a year thus it would take you 50 years to go through all the cold viruses and in that time new viruses could evolvethe process of evolution is not nice because the very basis of natural selection is that some organisms die and others that are better adapted survive when a novel deadly disease arises it may not kill all the people that it infects but could kill most and only the lucky few who survive can reproduce and pass their offspring resistance to the disease likewise if humans become very resistant to a disease either through evolution or by technology eg an effective vaccine it might die outthe ideas of humans evolving resistance to diseases and of diseases becoming more effective at infecting people lead to some of the major points in jared diamonds book guns germs and steel 25 he suggests that successful invading cultures are those that have evolved to be resistant to a larger array of diseases and as they evolve this resistance the diseases become more virulent infective in order to spread this evolution can lead to a situation where people are no longer killed by a disease and some of them become disease carriers such a group of people will bring these diseases with them upon colonizing a new area the disease that is not lethal to the colonists could be quite lethal to the colonized people that have no evolutionary experience with iteuropean colonization of the americas is a prime example of this form of migration and conquering other groups of people agriculture and technology made possible the large populations and cities in europe and asia people living in dense urban environments and trade routes connecting those groups of people across vast areas created the perfect breeding grounds for new diseases to develop living in close proximity to domestic animals further stimulated the emergence of new diseases the huge land mass of these two connected continents and a modest connection to africa as well meant that there were many locations for diseases to develop then spread across the continents exposure to repeated waves of diseases allowed europeans to develop immunity to those diseases while still chronically harboring many of themwhen europeans encountered the indigenous peoples of the americas they gave them their diseases these diseases probably moved across the american continents faster than the europeans invaders did the resulting wave of diseases could have killed even more people than the black death of europe we will never know exactly because there are no written records and no accurate methods to estimate the exact causes of death of the pre-european human population in the americas however archeologists have found evidence for a large crash in american indian populations across both north and south america after first contact with europeans the estimates are 57 mortality these estimates are based on genetic methods that can be used to indicate drastic population reductions from all causes in the past 26 thus the european colonists entered a land with relatively low population density that was poorly defended with a huge amount of exploitable resourcesthe endless cycle of disease massive death development of resistance and resurgence of disease was the hallmark of human history until we developed the technology to control many of our diseases cultural evolution moved ahead of biological evolution and protected us by changing our behaviors and ultimately by allowing us to develop the tools to manipulate the biochemistry of our own cells to fight off diseases inoculation with vaccineswhile many animals have adaptations that help them avoid disease one of the earliest unique signs of human cultural technological developments to avoid disease and make food more digestible is the act of cooking food additional steps to avoid diseases included cultural changes such as dietary restrictions of religions as well as guidance in matters of personal hygiene in ancient cultures and religionsby the mid-1800s john snow used statistical methods to link a cholera outbreak in london to a particular well on broad street the authorities shut down the well probably helping end the outbreak this understanding of the source of disease was the first case of using epidemiology the science of incidence distribution and possible control of diseases to help understand how to control disease 27at about this time louis pasteur developed the idea that bacteria spread disease once people had microscopes they could see bacteria and assign them as potentially causative agents of disease these observations by pasteur and his contemporaries led to a rapid succession of ways to control diseases including purification of drinking water preservation of food pasteurization and sterilization or sanitization during surgeriesit was not until the discovery of antibiotics and vaccinations that humans really started to free themselves of some of the worst diseases in history at least temporarily people started looking for chemical agents to destroy bacteria once science confirmed that they caused diseases alexander fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 and in 1942 howard florey and ernst chain developed the drug penicillin in an easily produced and administered form yet humans still did not win the evolutionary battle between bacterial disease and humankind when fleming gave his nobel acceptance speech in 1945 he noted that bacteria could develop that were resistant to penicillin if exposed to less than lethal concentrations within 2 years of the advent of clinical use of penicillin clinicians had noted antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in human patientsantibiotic resistance is a classic case of evolution a very low proportion of bacteria in a population have the ability to survive exposure to the antibiotic there is a low level of mutation leading to very small differences in the dna in each bacterium by chance one or a few have a mutation that allows them to escape death from the antibiotic these bacteria reproduce and soon take over the entire populationbacteria are particularly well suited to rapid evolution because their populations are so huge and grow so quickly that the chance that one cell has a mutation that makes it resistant is high even though the chance that each individual cell is resistant is extremely low there are about 100000000000000 a hundred trillion bacteria associated with each human this is about 1000 times as many as there are stars in our galaxy or 100000 times as many as all the people on earththere is an even more interesting and insidious twist to this story bacteria have special little bits of dna called plasmids since bacteria are not sexual organisms they cannot exchange genetic material through sex like we other animals and many plants do instead they trade these little plasmids they can trade this genetic material within or among species thus antibiotic resistance can move among different species of bacteriaa recent spread of antibiotic resistance illustrates the problem 28 the antibiotic colistin represents a last-ditch compound used to treat infections that are resistant to multiple antibiotics the gene mcr-1 started showing up in bacterial infections in hospitals around the world and this gene makes bacterial infections resistant to colistin the antibiotic colistin had seen limited use in humans because it has bad side effects however swine farmers use it researchers sequenced isolates of colistin-resistant bacteria from 31 countries and the genetic data suggested the gene arose in a pig farm in china in 2006 it took less than 12 years for disease-causing bacteria containing the gene to move from livestock to humans globallynumerous plasmids for antibiotic resistance have spread readily around the world now microbiologists can take a sample from the center of the ocean and isolate bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics only synthesized by humans thousands of miles away thus in the evolutionary battle we cannot easily vanquish disease-causing bacteriacontrolling the expansion of resistance to new and existing antibiotics requires an understanding of evolution taking a full course of antibiotics to be certain the drug completely clears the infection only using antibiotics when they are necessary and not allowing livestock producers to use antibiotics added to feed solely to increase growth rates of healthy animals are all necessary to decrease the probability that bacteria will become resistant to antibiotics cooperation not to overuse antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance is necessary to control this threat this cooperation needs to be worldwide given the propensity of diseases and antibiotic resistance to spread rapidly around the world this is an evolutionary arms race with bacteria rapidly evolving ways to resist antibiotics and humans developing new weapons against bacteria we need science to win the arms race by coming up with novel antibiotics to stop diseases resistant to the current antibiotics otherwise we end up back where humanity has been for most of its history at the mercy of bacterial infectionwe live in a world where millions of people die each year from preventable diseases these diseases often only cause temporary illness to people in developed countries for example in developed countries we do not generally consider diarrhea a fatal disease and we successfully treat most severe cases with hydration and chemical therapy in bad cases intravenous fluids can prevent dehydration likewise many cases of pneumonia can be treated particularly bacterial-caused cases that are treatable with antibiotics however pneumonia is the top cause of death diarrhea the second and malaria and problems with childbirth are the next two top killers of children when considered worldwidediarrhea causes 15 of global deaths in children under 5 years of age even though it is treatable with access to basic medical care and many cases are preventable with clean food and water pneumonia causes even more childhood deaths 18 essentially all of these deaths occur in developing countries vaccines against some bacteria that cause pneumonia can help and access to antibiotics for bacterial cases can help cure the disease inoculations against measles and whooping cough pertussis can also help reduce mortality as these diseases can lead to pneumonia malnourished children are more susceptible as well as those are that are exposed to indoor air pollution smoke from cooking fires  only about 15 of the children with bacterial pneumonia even have access to antibiotics solutions are obvious and not tremendously expensive still the solutions to these diseases require global cooperation and a concerted effortthere is good news child mortality rates continue to fall and diseases are decreasing worldwide 29 however in undeveloped countries rates are still high and not declining rapidly enough the following interventions could reduce childhood disease in parentheses by over 40 1 breastfeeding diarrhea pneumonia neonatal sepsis 2 insecticide-treated nets malaria 3 additional food for infants 612 months old diarrhea pneumonia measles malaria 4 zinc supplements diarrhea pneumonia 5 sanitary delivery childbirth deaths 6 hib vaccine pneumonia and 7 clean water diarrhea pneumonia oral rehydration therapy antibiotics and antimalarial therapy could reduce deaths by another 31 none of these steps seems that difficultglobally including adults and children the world health organization estimates that millions of people are afflicted by treatable diseases these include in millions diarrheal disease 4620 lower respiratory infections 429 malaria 241 measles 27 pertussis 18 dengue 9 tuberculosis 8 and hiv 28 many of these diseases are disproportionately harming people in less developed countriesthe study of epidemics is essential to understanding how diseases spread from one organism to another diseases can be passed from person to person from animals to people or from the environment to people a firm set of general principles of the conditions under which harmful diseases will emerge some of them already referred to here are now widely agreed upon by epidemiologists these general principles in addition to a number of unique behaviors in humans lead to the conclusion that the probability of global disease is increasing drasticallydensity of hosts is important in proliferation of disease in diseases that move from person to person the greater the frequency of contact between people the more quickly disease can increase we now live in a world where over half the people live in cities the total number of people on earth is still increasing leading to ever-greater population densitypeople move from city to city and around the globe more quickly and more frequently than ever many diseases have an incubation time of days to a week historically long-distance travel across oceans took months if somebody with a deadly disease boarded a boat it could kill all the people on the boat or they would be over the disease and no longer infective before they reached their destination thus conditions are more conducive than ever for the spread of a new deadly disease around the worldnew diseases are more likely to arise when there is opportunity for them to take hold stressed or unhealthy people are more likely to contract and transmit diseases than healthy individuals we now have a greater absolute number of disease-prone malnourished people on earth than at any time in history people who live in cities particularly the poor are under constant stress from crowded living conditions unhealthy environments and the pressure to survive a greater proportion of people live in cities now than any time in history and the total number of people living in cities is also greaternovel diseases arise when humans come in contact with animals that can transmit diseases to humans zoonotic diseases 30 we already have dozens of diseases that come from animals we grow ever more animals to feed people as increasing population and standard of living increases demand for meat we grow these animals under crowded conditions oftentimes we breed the animals for maximum growth and they are genetically similar conditions that can lead to greater disease susceptibility we raise many pigs and birds in huge numbers in close proximity most diseases that arise in birds are not transmissible to people however they are more transmissible to pigs once the bird diseases establish in pigs they are more likely to evolve ways to be infectious to humansbush meat refers to wild animals killed by people for protein as people move into more remote areas they hunt wildlife to satisfy their protein needs there is a particularly high chance of disease transmission from animals to humans when people butcher wild animals and make contact with fresh blood and organs from these animals human populations are growing and moving into more wild areas particularly in the tropicsmost new human diseases come from wild animals as people stress natural ecosystems the probability for such transmission could increase because we displace other animals from their natural habitats causing them to move longer distances and they are more susceptible to disease because of the stress induced by human pressure there is also a demand for live exotic meat in some asian countries in particular in this case merchants bring caged animals into dense markets in close contact with other animals and many people these are perfect conditions for a novel disease to spread from infected animals to livestock and peoplemore people in the world are now immune compromised than ever offering another reservoir for diseases around 40 million people are hiv positive and may become immune compromised in areas where medical care is available these people are receiving quite a few antibiotics leading to increased antibiotic resistance evolving in bacterial diseases in addition recipients of transplanted organs are generally immune compromised because drugs given to them to avoid rejection of the transplants also halt immunity to diseasehumans have also developed some novel behaviors that further increase the probability of transmission of diseases particularly those that require blood-to-blood contact intravenous use of illegal drugs leads to sharing of needles and has resulted in transmission of hiv and hepatitis b and c this behavior could also lead to transmission of novel diseases in the future blood transfusions and organ transplants can also lead to movement of diseases people receiving blood products were some of the first victims of the hiv pandemicorgan transplants from other species into humans could also lead to transmission of novel diseases the most common species considered for organ transplants into humans are apes and pigs both these groups of animals carry viruses that may be harmless to them but cause extreme disease in humans such transplants are very rare currently but given that the majority of people on organ transplant lists are not able to obtain an organ before they die it is likely such transplants will increase as research progresses on ways to accomplish such transplants successfullythe field of epidemiology tells us that it is becoming more probable that new diseases will develop existing diseases could evolve into more deadly and virulent forms all diseases will multiply more quickly and they will continue to become resistant to human efforts to control them these findings have ramifications for both chronic diseases and new diseasesone of the worst worldwide pandemics was the spanish flu that started in 1918 it killed about 3 of the world population and infected about 16 of all people the bubonic plague in the 1300s infected about 14 of the earths human population and killed an estimated 13 the swine flu h1n1 started in 2009 and infected about 14 of humanity but killed less than a hundredth of 1 of our population scientists have traced the first widespread series of cases of hivaids to 1981 but the disease probably jumped into humans in the early 1900s since then about 1 of people on earth are living with hiv and about 15 million people per year die because of aids about 2 of the human population deaths each year is from aids-related causes worldwide waves of disease are a regular occurrence throughout human history and becoming more commonrecently the world has been concerned terrified about ebola symptoms include fever severe headache muscle pain weakness fatigue diarrhea vomiting abdominal stomach pain unexplained hemorrhage bleeding or bruising and death this disease has been simmering in africa for decades outbreaks have occurred in sub-saharan africa regularly since 1976 in 2014 an outbreak started in guinea and jumped to other african countries in weeks and then to countries around the world killing over 10000 people in 2019 almost 2000 people died in the democratic republic of the congo and stopping the disease there has been difficult because of warfare this outbreak has spread to uganda the ease of global movement and increased travel continue to increase the potential for spread of the disease what if this disease evolves to an even more easily transmitted form there is no treatment or vaccine although some promising vaccines are being developeddisease epidemics that do not kill a large proportion of the human population are common in the 1700s there were 13 epidemics and in the 1800s 12 with 5 pandemic influenza epidemics in the 1900s the data suggest that roughly every 1020 years there are epidemics with some mortality that infect a quarter to a third of the worlds populationyou could argue that disease has not wiped out humans yet so it will not in the future unfortunately science has documented cases where diseases cause the extinction of an entire species for example people have inadvertently moved a fungal disease around the world that kills amphibians frogs and salamanders this disease is leading to numerous species extinctions globally i have seen the effects of this disease first hand in panamawe studied the consequences of the fungal disease killing all adult frogs leading to loss of all the tadpoles in panamanian mountain streams scientists had already documented that the disease was moving through north america to south america through central america the disease kills frogs in high-elevation areas and moves through lower-elevation areas without killing most animals we knew that the area we were working in was going in the direct path of the disease so we set up a before-after experiment to understand the effectson our first visit to the mountain stream there were frogs everywhere we needed to be careful not to step on them as we walked the trails each square yard of stream bottom had up to a hundred tadpoles twenty frog species used the streams for reproduction and many of these species were entirely restricted to cooler areas with high altitude on this particular volcanic mountain from sunset to sunrise the jungle was a riot of frog choruses there were fantastically colored adult frogs including the stunning black and white panamanian golden frog a species that has special meaning for panamanians we made our measurements on the stream and enjoyed the frogstwo years later the disease had swept through as it progressed through the country from costa rica when we drove up to the stream for the after disease infection experiment it was immediately clear that it was different hoping against hope i went down to the stream but there were no tadpoles and no adult frogs on the banks it was very quiet and sad the stream had dense growths of algae because no tadpoles were eating it and the absence of the tadpoles fundamentally changed the way the stream functioned in the end maybe 100 species will go extinct from this diseasethrough this and other examples we know that some diseases have driven animals and plants to extinction 31 in hawaii 16 cases of bird extinctions have come about at least in part because of diseases numerous mammals and birds have gone extinct from diseases alone or in combination with other factors such as habitat loss 32 thus it is not impossible that humans could suffer the same fate the conditions that could lead to such a tragedy are making it more likely that such a disease could infect the human populationthroughout human history new nasty diseases have arisen many of them have jumped into humans from other species whenever a particularly virulent disease has infected a human and killed most of the people exposed to it the population of people infected was small and disconnected from the rest of humanity epidemiology tells us that the incidents that were formerly isolated now have the potential to sweep across the globe and cause massive death and sufferingwe are increasing the conditions under which such diseases can arise and transmit to people ever more intimate contact with wildlife dense livestock production losses of biodiversity caused by humans also are predicted to increase the transmission of infectious human diseases 33 it is no wonder that new diseases like avian flu h1n1  ebola and sars are popping up with alarming regularity adding to the worry viral evolution is unpredictable and a new deadly strain of virus could arise from laboratories working on viruses that are presumably safe and contained in this case a newly virulent strain could arise escape and become a pandemic 34at the same time new diseases challenge the safety of people and the ability to treat such diseases increases we can develop vaccines rapidly antiviral drugs are available that work at least well enough to decrease mortality however only those people in developed countries are able to afford or even have access to methods to protect from sickness and death from these infections as usual the poorer people of the world will suffer the worst of globalization increased population greater chance of new diseases and unequal distribution of basic health carein late 2011 and early 2012 two laboratories one at the university of wisconsin-madison usa and the other at erasmus mc in rotterdam the netherlands found out how to make avian flu h5n1 transmissible in ferrets this research ignited a firestorm of controversy because the deadly virus could also spread among humans much more easily the researchers submitted the work for publication but journals held up the release of the papers because of fears that people with bad intent bioterrorists or countries willing to employ biological warfare could use the information to transform this and other viruses to more deadly forms ultimately the journals published the work as eventually the information would get out this is the way science works once the general concept for an important idea is out somebody else is certain to replicate the experiment thus information on how to create a deadly disease is ever more availableaccidental release from existing research facilities is also a concern the deadliest diseases known to humanity are stored and researched in containment facilities found around the world smallpox has killed people for at least 3000 years and following vaccination it was completely eradicated from human populations in the 1970s a number of laboratories still keep cultures in 1978 one person died from exposure to the virus in a british laboratory after that scientists transferred all cultures to two laboratories one in russia and one in the united states entire generations have reached adulthood with no exposure to the disease if smallpox was ever released by accident or on purpose a scientist with phd-level training could potentially re-create it from the known genetic sequence it could cause massive mortalityin 1979 the sverdlovsk military facility accidentally released anthrax causing 100 human deaths soviet researchers probably isolated this highly virulent strain of anthrax from rodents in the soviet city of kirov the facility had likely accidentally released the bacterium at least once previously anthrax is able to survive as dry spores and soviets were presumably producing it to arm biological weaponswhile research on diseases is necessary to learn about causes and cures of the diseases that influence humans such research comes with a cost the ability to contain these diseases in research settings is plagued with the problem of potential human error in addition the possibility of terrorist attacks on such facilities is perhaps remote but realin 1984 followers of bhagwan shree rajneesh in oregon released salmonella into 10 restaurant salad bars sickening 751 people in an attempt to keep them from voting in a local election in which the cult had candidates luckily nobody died in this incident but it does illustrate that people can be capable of bioterrorismin june of 1993 members of the aum shinrikyo cult sprayed anthrax from the top of an eight-story building in the heart of tokyo fortunately the disease did not take hold the strain they used was not very deadly and they had problems with a sprayer so the dispersion of the disease was not as effective as they had hoped this group had previously set up multiple laboratories and had experimented with the toxin for botulism cholera and q fever a dangerous bacterial disease carried by livestock they also previously sponsored a trip to the democratic republic of congo that was an attempt to bring back an isolate of ebola this apocalyptic cult eventually released the chemical weapon sarin in the tokyo subway killing 12 people and sickening thousandswhile both these examples are unusual cases we are entering a world where a few crazy people or one crazy country could do tremendous damage to humanity if they had access to the right materials and knowledge such knowledge is becoming commonplace every year academia cranks out numerous phds around the world with the technical expertise to build a deadly virus with the right equipment chemicals reagents and knowledge of the sequence at the same time technology to work with dna sequences is getting cheaper easier to use and more broadly available with a million dollars and proper training it is now possible to create designer diseaseswe should consider motives in this discussion as well a terrorist who wanted to kill many people but wanted to discriminate victims would not only need to create a disease but also vaccinate or protect all the people they did not want to die while a few doses of a disease placed appropriately could quickly spread around the world creating many doses of vaccine is a far more daunting and expensive task thus it seems unlikely that any of the major terrorist groups would be able to create a disease and vaccinate large numbers of people before releasing the disease without being detected first such a task is not completely out of the question for a small country such as north koreathere are insane people who just might try to take down the entire human race the mass shooting in a movie theater in denver in 2012 was carried out by a neuroscience phd student this individual could have had the technical ability to create a novel disease a scenario where such a person creates and releases a deadly virus is conceivable quite a bit of preparation and disaster training would be necessary to stop transmission of an infectious agent once it was released 35active surveillance of disease outbreaks is necessary to react to a pandemic in time currently the world health organization keeps track of disease outbreaks but we need new methods to detect pandemics in time to respond an effort called global viral 30 is also helping move the international community toward predicting viral outbreaks by promoting science and education about viral outbreaksresponses could include rapid development of vaccines to protect a population antiviral drugs to decrease the probability of mortality and increased capacity to produce these treatments public health officials are developing novel methods using social media and networks of cell phones to create an early warning system of disease outbreaks from remote areas additional improvements are possible in safety of livestock production safer practices in killing and butchering wild animals and education on behaviors that discourage the transmission of diseasesthere are several things that we can do to thwart bioterrorism the easiest way to obtain a disease would be for a terrorist to attack one of highest-level containment facilities in the world that has cultures of the deadliest diseases known to humankind these laboratories should be resistant to attack and have established procedures to quickly destroy all the diseases in them if they are compromisedseveral historic agreements are present to stop the use of biological and chemical warfare and terrorism the 1925 geneva protocol the 1972 biological weapons convention the 1976 environmental modification convention and the 1993 chemical convention all strove to have all countries agree to not develop or use chemical or biological weapons 36 the obama administration was involved in international efforts to stop the spread of biological weapons to terrorists the united nations is developing other treaties measures might include careful accounting of the reagents that molecular biologists can use to produce diseases and barring companies from providing dna or rna synthesis for particular sequences known to be associated with disease organisms careful international monitoring of biological laboratories capable of handling pathogenic microbes is also necessary as well as protecting the laboratories that hold the deadliest human diseases all of these require modest cost but a substantial degree of international cooperation  for example if even one country allows synthesis of dangerous virus sequences and will sell those to individuals control elsewhere is pointlesswhile we are writing this commentary from italy april 10th it appears that the number of people tested positive to the virus in the united states has almost quadrupled the number of people found positive in our country however italy counts a disproportionately high number of deaths china  the country where everything reportedly originated  has now smaller figures than those of the us italy spain and germany these countries together make more than one million people detected as infected worldometers 2020 not much can be said about the reliability of these figures or their comparability it is good to say that the numbers are based on subjects who tested positive to the swab unfortunately italy has lost the opportunity to keep reliable records of those subjects so it is not known what is the percentage of those who repeated the test several times but are represented as different individuals equally unknown because not standardized are the criteria for which the tests were performed if to patients with initial symptoms fever fever and coughing fever coughing and dyspnea what with full-blown clinical syndromes severe symptomatology to individuals potentially exposed by contiguity or direct contact living in the same environment does not necessarily imply proximity or contact etc in essence it is not known in which of these situations the swabs have been made in this way  we believe  a big opportunity to study contagion modalities has been lost each region of italy has run autonomous strategies to protect its citizens and counteract the disease this has applied also to test-related policies thus aggregating data from regions looks like a problematic though unreliable processwe were expecting tests to be performed to all health personnel of common health settings from general medicine surgeries to protected residences including those for older adults to emergency departments and to general hospitals unfortunately this elementary strategy to guarantee that health professionals were sufficiently protected toward the virus was not applied with due care and up to date the number of doctors who died from the infection during their professional activity is unbearable 109 victims at the time of writing the number of other health workers who have lost their life is also tragically unbearable 28 it has been reported that the costs involved in performing the tests in appropriate numbers at least to all health professionals and people presenting with light symptoms are too heavy and the availability of skilled technicians and reagents for carrying out the tests is scarcein italy and probably elsewhere nothing is and will be like before the pandemic for the moment we must overcome the crisis but there could be a lot to say on a clinical level on that of the organization of services and on how to protect the life of our older adults the latter have been too affected by imprudent and superficial colleagues to feel accepted by the community again in a few days in deciding if the death was by coronavirus or with coronavirus we have undone decades of geriatric education but above all we have destroyed a fundamental relationship of trust how will we approach patients if they are now convinced that today we ask for their age to make critical decisions intubation and maybe tomorrow the administration of expensive drugs a discrepancy between the gift of a long life and public acceptance of older adults is increasingly noticeable and clearly expressed by the deprecated document on damages caused by longevity which christine lagarde now the president of the european central bank spoke about a few years ago 2012 old people live too long and this is a risk for the global economy we must do something urgentlythe scenario we are witnessing today is characterized by different situations in which people affected by covid-19 are forced to live the main ones are schematically summarized below even if there are significant differences related to the different organization of services in the regionsa older adults who remain at home even when the first symptoms appear are entrusted in most cases to themselves and to the care of their loved ones family doctors are afraid they tend to block visits and families do not call emergency services because they fear seeing the family member get on the ambulance and not being able to greet himher before they die so they keep the sick  especially if a senior  in their homes assist them with fear and affection until the negative or positive resolution of the clinical picture there is no mention of swabs or blood chemistry analyses let alone ct or other scans our fellow citizens risk ending their lives without even being told what is happening to them many seniors live alone many have limited or no familiarity with the internet and are poorly connected with other family or community members newman and zainal 2020 some die in complete isolation and their corpses are discovered many days after death gazzettino 2020b in the last couple of months the people who live in nursing homes have been completely forgotten by administrative powers frail older adults are certainly the subjects who have suffered the most from the difficulties of the italian health system in cities of lombardy such as bergamo and brescia the deaths have followed at an impressive rate giving rise to sad images in the televisions of the italians of long lines of military trucks carrying coffins to incinerators often very far from the place of origin of the deceased as reported elsewhere trabucchi and de leo in press in just 20 days in the nursing homes of the province of bergamo lombardy which have a total accommodation capacity of 6400 beds there were more than 600 deaths which is a hecatomb the real dimensions of the phenomenon will only be known after some time it is probable that the number of infected people is far greater than that officially reported it is also likely that the number of deaths is far greater than that officially attributed to covid-19 no attention was paid to those who manage the residences no support in terms of means of protection the possibility of making swabs or even economic support in the face of damage caused by the release of beds caused by the death of guests the access of new guests has been blocked but the residences are increasingly pressed to admit elderly people discharged from hospitals the staff is exhausted as a consequence of heroic commitment in small communities the warmth that stirs around the residences compensates for the solitude of guests and operators but this is not the case in large centers where the bigger turnover of personnel makes the atmosphere more impersonal in any case since doctors and other operators get sick in rapid progression  and despite the extreme commitment of those on duty  guests feel progressively more fearful and abandonedc in italy hospitals are at the center of the covid-19 cyclone the attention of the media and the whole nation is focused on them schematically the hospital system moves according to this model a the emergency department where patients arrive after days spent at home sometimes already exhausted by the disease it is rarely possible to send them back home in most cases they are kept under observation waiting for a bed b resuscitation units where patients are intubated and followed mainly by doctors specialized in anesthesia and resuscitation and c departments where patients are treated with oxygen therapy with different levels of intensity and checked for overall health conditions including psychological problems at this point in time all remaining wards for the management of the diseases that normally refer to hospitals are in progressive reduction to cope with the emergency resuscitation units were built in record time and entire hospitals were reconverted into the care of covid-19 unfortunately the pandemic has found the country largely unprepared and unable to provide the necessary protection in time even to its health workers resulting in serious shortcomings regarding the supply of eyeglasses masks gloves and gowns as said this has resulted in the loss of far too many health professionals lives the very serious difficulties in assisting critical situations combined with the scarcity of places suitable for the reception of patients in severe conditions and the lack of a sufficient number of ventilators have given rise to very painful ethical choices for health professionals on whom to privilege in the care with available equipment rosenbaum 2020d from hospitals patients are discharged when they achieve clinical recovery they can return home or to low-intensity hotels where they can manage themselves in isolation the problem of older adults remains unsolved often after reaching clinical recovery they show such a degree of disability that returning home is not possible and it is difficult to resort to rehabilitation or long-term care facilitiesthe described picture seems to apply to many northern territories of italy any criticism must be postponed however we seriously doubt that transferring people discharged from hospitals to rest homes may represent an appropriate choice and certainly we should find a way to respond to those families that cannot accompany their loved ones to intensive care units and are left without any information and prognostic indication this often means that the patients were kept too long at home without effective tools to catch the signs of aggravation in time which is frequently sudden and characterized by the discrepancy between symptoms and objectivity eg oxygen saturation or temperaturethe south of italy is generally less equipped than the north of the country and grave concerns rest on a possible dramatic evolution of the next few days over there social distancing and isolation remain at the moment the only strategies available to citizens however the latter need to feel supported by governments mental health should soon regain a very high status on the agenda of all nations especially if confinement at home expects to be very long and financial family and relationship problems risk to aggravate a future now seen with serious concerns and deep anxietiesthere are too many unanswered questions regarding the disease and even the duration and quality of immunity post-infection remain a big question mark while waiting for a vaccine to be ready several protocols and drugs are being proposed by clinicians none  at the moment  appears as particularly promising however we remain confident that a serious and open collaboration among researchers institutions and countries across the globe will offer concrete hope for our futurefor the time being the mental health of people needs to be supported in any possible way social distancing loneliness forced isolation and fear of contracting the illness are all big challenges for the general population facing the expansion of the epidemic but the risk of psychological consequences can be greater for the frail senior armitage and nellums 2020 we need to activate all possible opportunities to offer help at least in the form of tele-assistance to our patients krysinska and de leo 2007 psychological support should be made available to all via ngos and public services with contact with psychiatrists and other physicians actively established as much as possible health professionals should contact their patients and make the continuity of care a reality as soon as possible active outreach seems to be imperative especially for older adults de leo et al 2002 in order to counteract feelings of abandonment and disempowerment that covid-19 is imposing on all community members especially to the most fragile onesacute crises cause unstable or dangerous conditions suddenly and for the most part unexpectedly which demand timely intervention to alleviate the situation1 these include cataclysmic natural events and potential pandemics as well as human-caused horrors such as wars and genocidetypically when we imagine a humanitarian catastrophe our minds first picture the devastation that natural disasters produce thousands of people die and millions of lives are devastated annually as the result of hurricanes typhoons tsunamis wildfires tornados earthquakes floods volcanic eruptions landslidesavalanches heat waves and blizzardsafter natural disasters personal emotion and media coverage play a large role in whether and how much assistance is provided as social beings the suddenness of natural disasters triggers profound feelings of empathy which may prompt impulsive actions such as monetary donations our response to natural disasters strongly relates to how extensive and for how long the media cover the story the media play to peoples skewed risk perception reacting more to death clusters in sudden catastrophes than to scattered deaths from more routine causes such as occur with cancer attributable to cigarette smoking equivalent to three 747 jumbo jet crashes daily2 or traffic deaths equivalent to a daily 100-passenger regional jet crash34 eventually even after the most devastating natural disasters media and donor fatigue set in and the response dwindles as occurred after the 2010 earthquake in haitian epidemic exists when there are more cases of disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time5 an infectious disease becomes pandemic when it affects large numbers of people across a very wide area such as on multiple continents6 endemic diseases with a stable prevalence are not pandemics pandemics may stem from natural causes or from the accidental or intentional release of biological warfare agents78human immunodeficiency virus hivaquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids is the only current pandemic however unless they are recognized and stopped early future pandemics will inevitably result from novel influenza strains as they have over the past centuries they may also stem from viral hemorrhagic fevers eg ebola lassa hanta bas-congo hemorrhagic fever antibiotic-resistant bacteria eg methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa enterococcus extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis other viral diseases eg severe acute respiratory syndrome 2012 sars-like coronavirus prion diseases eg creutzfeldt-jakob disease or diseases caused by as-yet-unrecognized agentsself-preservation motivates interventions to prevent pandemics these diseases pose the risk of worldwide devastation affecting all populations regardless of their geography economic status or ethnicity this awareness has resulted in greater international cooperation than any other disaster mitigation effort despite occasional failures as when countries hide evidence of potentially pandemic diseases the international community has repeatedly seen the benefits of such cooperationwar is an organized intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities a form of political violence war is intended as prussian military general and theoretician carl von clausewitz wrote to compel our enemy to do our will910 this form of politically motivated violence has occurred in every societys history its characteristics include extreme aggression social disruption and usually high mortality11genocide often closely linked to war is an attempt to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group 12 genocidal acts include killing members of the group and causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group 12 they also include deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about a groups physical destruction in whole or in part imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group12decisions to use military interventions or threats to intervene to stop or prevent wars or genocide would seem to depend primarily on treaty obligations as with natural disasters however intervention may also depend on the slant and intensity with which media cover the violence and a potential intervening nations emotional investment and perceived ethnic ties to those involved more pragmatically the chance of intervention occurring also may depend on national and international political gamesmanship the economic hardship due to supplying troops and whether appropriate types and numbers of troops are availablechronic or cyclical disasters occur over decades and generations with little change for large portions of the worlds populations these conditions produce water and food insecurity debilitating and life-threatening endemic diseases and the subset of neglected tropical diseases and displacement from countries or homes making them refugees or internally displaced persons idps we intervene in all these situations for similar reasonsa water crisis occurs when the available potable unpolluted water within a region is less than needed about 56 billion people 2011 or 80 of the worlds population live in areas with threats to water security13 there is still inadequate access to safe drinking water for about 884 million people and for sanitation and waste disposal for 25 billion peoplemostly in poor and conflict prone countries 1415 diarrhea due to contaminated water is the biggest killer of children in sub-saharan africakilling more than aids tuberculosis tb and malaria combined16food insecurity means that over time people have insufficient quantities of food on a consistent basis food availability and insufficient resources to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious diet food access and use their food optimally with adequate water and sanitation food use1718 undernourished or chronic hunger means food intake that is insufficient to meet dietary energy requirements continuously19the united nations food and agriculture organization fao estimates that 33 of 193 countries have critically inadequate food supplies worldwide at the beginning of 2009 around 963 million people were undernourished or chronically hungry due to extreme poverty while up to 2 billion people lacked food security intermittently due to varying degrees of poverty most undernourished people live in developing countries about 65 live in india china democratic republic of congo bangladesh indonesia pakistan or ethiopia the highest proportion of undernourished people is in sub-saharan africa where 1 in 3 people are considered chronically hungry20endemic infectious diseases are those that remain prevalent in a particular locality region or population without the need for external inputs the best-known examples are tb and malaria both of which run rampant in the most-impoverished countries both diseases now receive worldwide attention with extremely drug-resistant tb potentially becoming pandemicthe world community has for the most part ignored many lesser known neglected tropical diseases ntds because climate vectors and reservoir hosts restrict them primarily to tropical regions21 even though ntds cause millions of years worth of disability table 1 the world has largely ignored the world health organization who-recommended strategic interventions that could control prevent and even eliminate various ntds these measures include preventive chemotherapy intensified case management vector control provision of safe water sanitation and hygiene and veterinary public health 21a refugee is a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country22 a 1967 united nations un protocol expanded this definition to include persons who have fled war or other violence in their home country 23displaced persons generally refers to refugees who have left their home countries because of war rather than a fear of persecution or have been forced to migrate within their home countries internally displaced persons idps the convention governing the specific aspects of refugee problems in africa also includes people who have left their countries of origin due to acts of external aggression occupation domination by foreign powers or serious disturbances of public order24interventions in chronic crises are both altruistic and highly political and they generally focus on the uns 8 millennium development goals mdgs25 all 193 un-member states and more than 23 international organizations have agreed to work toward achieving the mdgs by 2015 these goals arethose mdgs directly related to what have been categorized as chronic humanitarian crises include 1 food insecurity 6 endemic diseasesas well as to hivaids the one current acute pandemic disease and 7 which includes water insecuritythe mdgs originated with the organisation sic for economic co-operation and development oecd a group of the most-developed democratic countries devoted to a free-market economy primarily tasked with stimulating economic progress and world trade the oecd formulated a strategic development framework for the entire world based on resolutions of international conferences and summit meetings further refining the resolutions at international meetings the un general assembly approved most of their recommendations as mdgs in 200026while world pressure and an obligation to fulfill international promises have played a role in trying to meet the mdg objectives the major impetus has been the availability of a large amount of money generally non-governmental organizations ngos are the boots on the ground that can make progress toward meeting the mdg objectives and most ngos follow the moneythe un for example now provides funds through its various arms to advance these goals as do individual governments not only has specific aid been supplied by various countries but affected countries have also been able to make more internal funding available with backing from the g8 finance ministers in 2005 most of the worlds major financial giants eg world bank international monetary fund and african development bank cancelled up to 55 billion in debt owed by heavily indebted countries so that they could put the money into programs aligned with the mdgscrisis intervention should have the same goals in acute and chronic situations although they will often differ in their speed scope and techniques responders whether they be from ngos or governments ideally assist local governments and agencies by providing short- and long-term planning for and an initial supply of water sanitation food and nutrition agriculture shelter healthcare government infrastructure economy and safetysecurity while accomplishing this mission responding agencies have a duty to ensure both quality maintaining a minimum standard of service and accountability being answerable to those who receive the assistance and those who finance itsoliciting funds constitutes an inevitable part of ngos response to both acute and chronic humanitarian catastrophes these organizations often raise funds using pictures of starving babies and bloated corpses coupled with wildly overblown statistics as charny wrote repeated use of these images has dulled the public to real suffering while encouraging the public to view people as unable to solve their own problems27 the public now recognizes these appeals as sordid hype that results in donor fatigue if not disgust unfortunately it then becomes easier to ignore reports that accurately depict dire situations in subsequent disasters while ethical guidelines exist for fundraising even the most reputable organizations still use these unsavory methods and few regulatory agencies spend much time policing the plethora of fraudulent disaster-related fundraising2829many items provided to affected areas from both the private and public sectors are often inappropriate for the circumstances such items include outdated or unneeded medications used clothing that local people will not wear and unsuitable tools or shelters although they may have the best motivations many relief workers lack even the most rudimentary knowledge about the country in which they are working including the basic language cultural political and technical skills required in that situation in addition they often have no logistical support and thus must consume resources that the local population desperately needs30according to whos global outbreak alert and response network goarn today there is growing recognition that an outbreak anywhere can potentially represent an emergency of international public health concern31 response to these threats is coordinated through goarn and the us centers for disease control and preventions global disease detection and emergency response gdder goarn combats the international spread of infectious outbreaks and helps build capacity to prepare for epidemics from known and emerging diseases through a collaboration of existing international institutions and networks32 gdder uses non-traditional surveillance methods to provide early warning about international disease threats and provides experts for a rapid worldwide response33legally termed humanitarian interventions military force may include a variety of actions often designated with these murky and overlapping terms peacemaking support mediation and military actions to achieve a cease-fire peacekeeping maintain implement and monitor agreements to prevent further hostilities and peace-building help with final implementation of agreements and rebuilding the society the lack of clarity in defining these roles may make all sides in the conflict mistrust these multinational forcesin addition these roles may be compromised since military culture assumes a certain independence and superiority of mission over that of longer established disaster managementhumanitarian assistance efforts that may cause displacement marginalization and increased tensions with local partners 34the underlying ethos of disasterhumanitarian relief activities is to do well rather than simply to do good in other words because these situations are so complex and often involve so many organizations with different resources expertise and agendas beneficial motivations are insufficient instead the aim is to achieve constructive long-lasting solutionsideally there would be ethical and legal standards to guide various aspects of our response to humanitarian catastrophes including when and why we should intervene and how to act when we do unfortunately few unambiguous standards existthe most problematic area concerns the criteria for when and why we intervene whether it is a civilian or military or an acute or chronic disaster disaster interventions optimally protect people and safeguard livestock shelter and other essential property thus the ideal criteria for intervention are needs driven interventions should occur when an infusion of resources will prevent human suffering or at least help suffering populations regain stability yet experience shows that media coverage political expediency and non-governmental humanitarian agencies ngha pre-set agendas and available resources actually guide our interventionshow we act once we decide to respond has more easily identifiable guidelines although these too can be vagueresearch on all aspects of human catastrophes has languished especially that dealing with the optimal criteria for and efficacy of different types of disaster response in part this has been due to inadequate resources however it also stems from researchers queasiness about intruding in the midst of crisisand from the responders negative reactions to their efforts however the lack of evidence-based criteria for many disaster interventions raises ethical concerns about when why and how we should respond to humanitarian catastrophesethical issues also pervade any disaster-related research project current thought which is based on us national institute of mental health guidelines is that such research must undergo the same rigorous ethical tests that guide all other research this includes the assumption that those affected by a disaster retain the capacity to provide informed consent although capacity assessment may need to be part of the protocol they also imply that while disaster-affected populations and responders if they are being studied are not vulnerable researchers should still assess a studys risk-benefit and its effect on the subjects as in other research investigators should maintain confidentiality and privacy subjects should receive study results and redundant research should be minimized39refugee law determines which groups are eligible for special assistance through the un or other governmental bodies related to but distinct from international human rights law refugee law comprises both the un convention and more limited instruments from various regional bodieshuman rights law derives from a series of advisory non-binding declarations and binding conventions most frequently cited is the so-called international bill of human rights which includes the uns universal declaration of human rights 1948 and two conventions treaties passed by the general assembly in 1966 the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights both went into force when sufficient members signed and ratified it in 1976 numerous advisory declarations from the un and other international bodies as well as global and regional conventions treaties make up the balance of international human rights lawthe nature of and actions taken during governmentalsupragovernmental un nato etc interventions follow international humanitarian law or the law of armed conflict table 4 rules and principles that seek to save lives and alleviate suffering during armed conflict 41 these include the law of the hague once referred to as the law of war proper the geneva conventions and subsequent treaties and protocols 1864 to 200542 although not all were initially legally binding they have in many cases evolved into enforceable customary international lawwhen considering how effective our responses and their results are to humanitarian crises we can best judge them through our success in achieving the relevant mdgs or the general results of our interventions in most acute crises most of the mdgs 21 targets and 60 official indicators have a deadline of 2015 with 1990 as the baseline year25 subsequent sections will review the progress toward the mdgs related to food and water insecurity and to preventing and treating debilitating endemic and pandemic infectious diseases the numbers in parenthesis are the official designators for that mdg target the data are official government-supplied statistics supplemented by information from international agencies 43after large natural disasters civilian and governmental relief agencies generally provide excellent and rapid immediate relief the many natural disasters each year bear that out yet in cases where recurrence is likely these agencies have had little effect on mitigating similar future devastation or damage or destruction through long-term planningglobal pandemics have largely been prevented or other than hiv quickly contained when international cooperation has been functional chinas denial of sars allowed it to spread wider than it might have otherwise44 who and the cdc have not only provided experts to help identify and contain potential outbreaks but also trained and equipped many laboratories and clinicians around the world to assist in these effortsfewer people have becoming infected with hiv in recent years with 27 million people being newly diagnosed in 2010 21 lower than the 1997 peak45 yet the international community did not meet the target of universal coverage of the 137 million infected individuals46 access to treatment did increase in all regions so that at the end of 2010 65 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy for hiv or aids in developing regions eastern asia had the largest gain in coverage 38 while sub-saharan africa where more than 50 of eligible people do not receive antiretroviral therapy had a 20 increase 47the efforts to prevent or stop genocide have not been successful this requires humanitarian military interventions and the legal basis for these interventions remains sufficiently nebulous so that long delays and many deaths commonly occur before supragovernmental bodies take any action as a result the 1994 rwanda genocide left 800000 tutsis dead the serbian genocide in srebrenica resulted in about 8000 bosniak deaths and genocide is ongoing in darfur sudanthe international community has had even less success in preventing armed conflicts while overt global warfare has not occurred since world war ii a nearly constant succession of at least 44 civil and regional wars have resulted in approximately 6 million deaths the most easily measurable statistic and have caused large-scale disabilities social disruption economic hardship population dislocation and long-term emotional damage current conflicts that cause at least 1000 deathsyear are taking place in columbia afghanistan somaliasomaliland pakistan mexico south sudansudan syria and iraq48 other than iraq sub-saharan africa countries account for all those with more than 20 battle deaths100000 population annually49most chronic humanitarian crises can be assessed using the relevant mdgs another assessment factor not included in the mdgs is the number of refugees and idpsrefugees and idps have been increasing in number despite a recent increase in repatriation at the end of 2011 about 425 million people worldwide were refugees due to conflict or persecution developing countries that can ill afford it host 4 out of 5 of these refugees in december 2011 the largest refugee populations under the uns care were from afghanistan 27 million and iraq 14 million about 264 million people are idps and remain within their countrys borders 50the world seems to have met this target the proportion of people using an improved water source rose from 76 in 1990 to 89 in 2010 with more than 2 billion people gaining access to improved drinking water sources such as piped supplies and protected wells however not only do rural areas disproportionately lack improved water sources 19 compared to urban areas 4 but also all figures may be overestimates since they do not reflect the reliability and sustainability of a safe water source46 more troubling the un estimates that by 2025 18 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity51falling short of the target recent estimates show that about 850 million people 155 of the worlds population live in hunger even though incomes have increased 46 six million children die of hunger every year17000 every day52 a key marker for hunger is the prevalence of underweight children less than 5 years old slow progress although insufficient to reach the global target by 2015 has nevertheless resulted in a decline in underweight children less than 5 years old in the developing world from 29 in 1990 to 18 in 201053 yet progress has been spotty with nearly one-third of children in southern asia being underweight in 2010 46 the prevalence of child stunting a key marker for hunger undernourishment defined as low height for age fell from an estimated 44 in 1990 to 29 in 2010 which still leaves millions of children at risk for diminished cognitive and physical development resulting from long-term under-nutrition53reported malaria cases fell by 17 since 2000 and by more than 50 between 2000 and 2010 in 43 of the 99 countries with endemic malaria 46 yet the momentum in addressing this devastating disease is slowing largely due to inadequate resources and increasing plasmodium resistance even at its 2011 peak of 19 billion international funding was well short of the 5 to 6 billion required for universal access to malaria prevention and control measures simultaneously p falciparum resistance to the main treatment component artemisinins is increasing and anopheles mosquitoes have increasing resistance to the pyrethroids used to treat clothing and insecticide-treated mosquito nets itns possibly more important in preventing insect-borne diseases other than malaria itns were used by 39 of children in sub-saharan africa in 2010 compared to 2 in 200054 however there is no data on another mdg indicator the proportion of febrile children less than 5-years old who were treated with appropriate antimalarial drugsaccording to the uns 2012 millennium development goals report the world is on track to achieve the target of halting and is beginning to reverse the spread of tuberculosis while the estimated 2015 global mortality from tuberculosis will have decreased 50 from that in 1990 more than one third of new cases still go unreported and are not treated in a who-recommended directly observed therapy short-course dots program 46 of most concern to global health personnel 84 of the estimated 290000 cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis are not being diagnosed or treated appropriately 55little data exist on the other diseases addressed in the mdgs however progress is being made to prevent many of them one of the greatest successes has been with trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness an epidemic in africa that mobile teams arrested by systematically screening millions of at-risk people56 another mdg indicator 43 is to immunize 1-year-old children against measles since that frequently lethal disease causes epidemics in many poor populations according to the report through increased routine immunization coverage and large-scale immunization campaigns sub-saharan africa has made the most progress with an 85 per cent drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2010   yet recent complacency and declines in political and financial commitments to measles control have resulted in large measles outbreaks globally57although they are mdg indicators the un has failed to report any progress either in providing access to affordable essential drugs in developing countries or in increasing the proportion of people with access to affordable essential drugs on a sustainable basis58the data documenting the worlds response to humanitarian disasters suggest that we can do better specifically improvements should includeinfectious disease outbreaks epidemics and pandemics are increasing in frequency and severity1

3 many if not most of these bioevents have been caused by emerging pathogens which are described as newly appearing or reappearing in the population or rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range4

5 in the past few decades alone more than 85 emerging pathogens have been identified including hiv multidrug resistant tuberculosis mdr-tb west nile virus hanta virus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars h1ni influenza middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers chikungunya virus and most recently ebola and zika viruses3

8 the risk factors for the increasing incidence of bioevents worldwide include human population growth inadequate health care and public health infrastructure increased globalization land-use that facilitates zoonotic transmission climate change declining vaccination rates and overuse of antibiotics9
potentially lethal bioevents present significant risk of morbidity and mortality to exposed populations and to health care workers who may come into direct contact with infected patients or their specimens the risk of exposure and infection is especially of concern in the early stages of outbreaks as information regarding transmissibility may be limited while at the same time effective vaccines or other pharmaceuticals may not yet be availablewhen bioevents occur in countries with limited health care resources the international community is generally highly responsive in providing much needed support to these hot zones this type of assistance was especially important during the 2014-2015 west africa ebola epidemic within a week of the initial case report in april 2014 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc sent an expert team to guinea within the following months over 2000 other cdc employees deployed in response to outbreaks in guinea liberia and sierra leone with many more working on the public health response from the cdc headquarters in atlanta georgia10 other governmental agencies eg united states agency for international development from the united states us and many other countries and more than 65 non-governmental agencies most prominently mdecins sans frontires msf doctors without borders and partners in health also sent health care volunteers on medical missions to west africa to respond to the epidemic and to provide care to patients with ebola virus disease evd11 it is estimated that ultimately thousands of health care workers from throughout the world voluntarily deployed to the west africa ebola epidemiceven though the health care response was substantial there was some concern within the international public health community that a more rapid and robust response was warranted12 local west african health care systems were quickly overwhelmed and the result was deadly as of may 2016 over 11000 deaths were reported among the estimated 28000 suspected probable or confirmed cases of ebola average case fatality rate 3913 according to a 2015 world health organization who report infected health care providers had an even greater risk of mortality during the epidemic over 50 418814 of ebola infected health care workers died with the highest case fatality rates 68 observed among nurses 19328514 the impact on the health care workforce in affected countries was sizeable according to a lancet report published in july 2015 guinea lost 145 of their healthcare workforce while liberia and sierra leone lost 807 and 685 respectively15 it is important to note that in some of the areas severely affected by the ebola epidemic health care access was already severely limited with roughly only one or two doctors per 100000 people16
the us health care response to the ebola epidemic exemplifies the countrys long tradition of humanitarian health care volunteerism although there is no mechanism currently in place to track this an estimated 200000 health care personnel from the us are believed to volunteer each year to underserved or disaster-affected areas around the world17 many volunteer through the more than 1000 non-governmental sponsor organizations which may be faith-based university-based or sponsored by educational or corporate entities these organizations recruit through their internet presence word-of-mouth or through targeted advertising a recent survey of 177 voluntary health care organizations found that more than half accepted 75 or more of all health care applicants into their volunteer programs17 the same survey also found a wide range of preparation provided to volunteers ranging from simply providing an orientation packet of materials to extensive in-person training for ebola deployments the cdc developed an intensive experiential training course for us health care workers deploying to west africa over 600 us workers eventually received this training18 similar courses were developed by msf and who19

20 even with this extensive training in place some experts including leadership at numerous us academic medical centers urged caution to staff and fellows considering voluntary deployment this was due to concerns regarding the effectiveness and implementation of safety precautions the high fatality rate and the lack of effective treatments at that time21
in general most us humanitarian health volunteers report very positive deployment experiences anecdotally some us volunteers to the west africa ebola epidemic similarly had positive experiences and reported feeling privileged and grateful for having had the opportunity to serve22

23

24

25 however research on the experiences and especially the emotional impact of deployment to the ebola epidemic among us health care professionals is very limited adverse psychosocial impact of deployment on disaster volunteers has been well documented even among highly trained and well prepared volunteers26

27 this study was designed to improve our understanding of the impact of health care deployment to high risk outbreaks strategies suggested here for reducing risk of adverse effects in volunteers may be applicable to other deployments to international hot zone disasters
study design
semi-structured interviews were conducted with us health care workers who had recently returned from voluntary deployment to the west africa ebv outbreak data were analyzed using qualitative techniques
study participants
potential participants were identified using a snowball sampling strategy and contacted via email in this initial contact the purpose of the study was explained as well as the study methods the human subjects protections in place and the eligibility criteria for participation which included recent deployment to west africa ebola epidemic liberia sierra leone andor guinea and current employment as a health care worker in the us this study had prior approval from the office of the committee on human research at ucsf study  15-15914 participant characteristics are shown in table 1


data collection
drawing upon available information on humanitarian health care a semi-structured interview guide was developed sixteen interviews lasted an average of 45 minutes in length and were conducted from may to july 2015 via phone skype or in-person all interviews were audiotaped with prior knowledge and approval of the interviewee participants were informed that the tapes would be destroyed upon completion of the study each participant was assigned a unique code number and no personal identifiers of any kind were noted in the tapes or transcriptions all study materials were stored in password-protected files on an encrypted computer only available to the research team all study materials are available by contacting the corresponding author
data analysis
qualitative thematic analysis was used as the analytic framework for identifying themes relevant to the experiences of the participants before pre during peri and after post their deployment two research team members reviewed the first three transcripts to develop a list of codes and a coding manual that defined the common terminology to describe the themes identified the remaining transcripts were then inductively open-coded by two independent reviewers followed by thematic analysis using the constant comparison methodology28 to help ensure that the coding was both valid ie well grounded in the data and supportable and reliable consistent in meaning the criteria for assigning a specific code to a block of text was well documented the coding scheme and codebook was refined and expanded upon to reflect and incorporate emerging insights throughout the coding process discrepancies in coding were discussed and mutually resolved
pre-deployment

motivation to volunteer
the most frequently cited motivation for volunteering was the belief that the participants skills were needed and therefore there was a perceived ethical obligation to volunteer as noted by one participant for me it was just the right thing to do i felt like i had something that i could do to help and i wanted to do itseveral participants noted a commitment to social justice and health equity and were thus drawn to serve people in need experiences with other humanitarian health crises usually in the aftermath of disasters such as the 2010 haiti earthquake or past experience on medical missions in other parts of africa were also motivators one participant stated having worked there previously having had very close west african doctor friends die you cant just stand there and bear witness
fear for self and fear and concern of family and friends
even though participants were highly motivated to volunteer early unfolding reports29

30 led many participants to question their decision to volunteer instead of backing out several said that they just resigned themselves to going even though they had a sense of foreboding and fatalism about the deployment the week that i was going to go the cdc said 14 million people could be infected i saw that and thought im not coming out of thisfamily members especially parents did not want them to go this led some participants to avoid telling anyone about their decision in some cases secrecy was extreme as recounted by one participant i didnt tell my parents until i was in the airport leaving another participant similarly did not want to tell people about her upcoming deployment i didnt really talk to anyone about it when i left i had a very morbid feeling you know i was so scaredi dont know it felt too morbid and that it would be like  oh we better say goodbye in case she doesnt come back instead of reassurances from family and friends negative reactions like these were common as one participant recalled there was so much hysteriapeople thought i was going to die so it felt like you were jumping off a cliff
training
the length and quality of training varied in the very early stages of the epidemic participants already working in other parts of africa reported that they received their training in other non-affected countries typically provided by their sponsoring agencies others received training at cdc with additional hands-on training at the deployment site some participants especially those who had deployed early in the epidemic felt that they had not received adequate training and thus felt unprepared as reported by one participant they the sponsoring agency handed me a viral hemorrhagic fever guide i read it on the plane showed up but i had no real idea of what i was doingas the outbreak progressed cdc began offering extensive training at a facility in anniston alabama and all of the subjects who took this training spoke very highly of it especially with respect to their confidence in using the required personal protective equipment ppe training on the complex process of donning and doffing ppe was universally regarded as critical in keeping them safe as was the simulated practice of working while wearing the ppeseveral study participants thought that their training did not address their perceived lack of cultural competency as reported by one participant theres a lot beyond the training on infection control practices that i felt completely unprepared for there could have definitely been a lot more preparation on a cultural levelin terms of cultural norms and acceptances language and perceptions of westerners that would have been extremely helpful
peri-deployment

first impressions
by any measure and at multiple levels the early humanitarian response to the ebola epidemic was extraordinarily challenging health care facilities and systems already severely under- resourced in the affected areas were strained to the limit us health care workers even those with prior humanitarian deployments were shocked by the local conditions one participant who deployed very early in the epidemic august 2014 described his first impression of the ebola treatment unit etu where he was assigned as a real horror showliving conditions were unexpectedly austere even for those who had previously volunteered in other resource-limited countries most participants said they had been provided with a bed and a mosquito net but that running water potable water electricity working toilets and showers were scarce making it difficult to maintain personal hygiene
lack of organization and role clarity
lack of organizational management of the medical mission was reported some noted that the people in charge were making poor decisions especially regarding scheduling and assignments these problems were compounded by a lack of communication clear policies and procedures were lacking as one participant noted it seemed like policies were being formed by whoever was in charge the person in charge changed every three hours because of severe staff shortages participants had to perform new types of tasks one physician noted i hadnt put in an iv in probably 10 years i had to mix all of the drugs myself that is not typically part of my daily workload that was certainly stressful others reported feeling underutilized one nurse stated i felt like i wasnt a very effectively used resource in the sense that i spent like 2 weeks of my time there doing kind of menial tasks because they didnt have another role for us to play
lack of resources
before international teams arrived to help set up functioning etus the delivery of care was extremely constrained not only by a lack of staff but also by a lack of basic resources medical supplies and equipment infrastructure facilities lacking beds running water sanitation electricity etc and systems management protocols for care delivery as one participant noted it was an absolutely resource limited setting in some etus patients were not housed based on their health status but by the availability of beds or in some cases cots or mattresses on the floor family members were placed in the same room regardless of their health status as recalled one participant seeing the horror of a person who had ebola yet still alert sharing the same room as family members succumbing to evd was just a terrible terrible thing to see because it was not feasible to have health care workers continuously monitoring the patients housed in the etus sometimes patients were in the same room for extended periods with others who had died from ebola many patient deaths including deaths unrelated to evd were thought to be directly linked to a lack of resources as retold by one participanti remember one baby who was about four months old suspected of evd as the mother had died of it at that time because we were minimal staff and because of the lack of electricity and concerns for safety we did not have a night shift this baby was lying on a mattress by itself obviously really dehydrated and soiled we cleaned the baby tried to feed the baby and we didnt have any diapers any baby bottles we didnt have small enough ivs to even attempt an ivwe went in several more times that day fed the baby with a syringe gave it some acetaminophen the next morning we went in and the baby was dead in my mind the baby basically starved to death because the baby wasnt symptomatic for ebola
feelings of depersonalization
these types of extreme experiences led some participants to feel emotionally withdrawn from their patients one participant noted i felt like this was the only way to protect myself and continue to be productive its really hard to desensitize yourself like that but you have to as a protective measure
fear of contagion and illnesses suggestive of evd
thoughts of getting infected were the uppermost concern for most especially during the beginning of the deployment when they were still becoming acclimated to the etu and whenever there was a breach in infection control protocol and practice for some fear was constant one participant recalled constantly thinking dont let me get ebola dont let me get ebolamany reported getting sick during their deployment with symptoms that were suggestive of ebola infection fortunately none of the participants in this study became infected with ebola there have been nine cases of evd reported among us health care volunteers with one death31

32 most of the illnesses experienced during deployment were believed to be related to contaminated food andor water
difficulties with the personal protective equipment and infection control protocols
the donning and doffing procedures for ppe were time consuming taking about 20-25 minutes before and after working in the etu the ppe was also reported to be uncomfortable and claustrophobic in spite of the limitations of the ppe strict adherence to infection control measures within the etus was strongly encouraged as one participant noted when youre getting ready to go in all the nurses would do a huddle and make a plan decide who was going to do whatand then we would say a prayer as a group before going inbasically for a safe return and see you on the other side several noted that by the time they actually entered the etu they were already sweating profusely and their goggles had fogged up high heat and humidity made it impossible for most to work in the etus any longer than 2-3 hours the ppe was also seen as a barrier to patient care one participant summarized her experience with ppe you do the best that you can with body language and voiceyoure always in a hurry after an hour you were really putting yourself at risk for passing out because of the heat always being rushed by that clock ticking and i think we all felt guilty about rushing out but there was just no way around it
altered standards of care and ethical conflict
many of the participants remarked that the hardest part of delivering patient care in the etus was the adjustment to altered standards of care in the us we adhere to basic and fundamental ethical principles of patient care which include respect for persons and their autonomy the concepts of beneficence non-maleficence do no harm justice and fairness to all patients while we recognize that emergency situations may require alterations to usual practices due to resource limitations many of the participants reported that nothing could have prepared them for the constraints that they now faced the inability to provide the quality and level of care that participants were used to delivering was an important source of stress and frustration as noted by one participant even ivs were considered to be a very invasive procedurethere was a ward where people could go to get themnot very many people got to go to that wardeven if they were critically ill they still had to be healthy enough that we could justify taking them to the iv ward they didnt qualify for iv because theyre probably going to die anyway nevertheless some participants manage to adapt one nurse reported that she was able to keep going by constantly reminding herself im doing the best that i can with what i have and thats all i can dowitnessing unnecessary patient suffering due to shortages of drugs and other resources was extremely disturbing to all participants lack of pain medications was especially concerning as reported by one participant we didnt have any narcotics so pain control was really challenging we didnt have fentanol we didnt have morphine we didnt have anything like that others recalled wishing they could give their patients any small measure of comfort as one nurse said even little things could mean a lot like to get a cold coke would be an amazing treat but we didnt have these little things that would have made them feel so happy and maybe even help them a little bit that was hardanother key source of concern for many participants was witnessing undignified death as noted one participant its one thing to die alone and then its another thing to die in an environment where its hot and dark and theres plastic tarps and chlorine smell and youre on a cot as people come in wearing these big suits and leaving and to die that way after suffering for days by yourself i remember that very vividlywhile all the participants had prior experience with patients dying none had previously experienced mortality rates this high as one participant recalled literally the bodies were stacking up outside the wardi mean there were many days when there were six to eight occupied body bags lying outside the ward we just had too many bodies one physician recalled that 50 of the patients on the 60-90 patient etu died every day
safety and security
in our sample of 16 participants over 80 reported a breach in ppe while working in an etu although the etu was the most common place that subjects felt at risk of exposure there was also the potential for exposure out in the community as one participant recalled upon reporting to a local community health center i walked in on a local doctor caring for a patient who clearly had ebola he had decided to treat the patient there because there were no beds available in the etu i didnt touch anything but still i walked in i could imagine all kinds of ways that i would have had no idea that ebola was right there under my nosethe prevention of ebola exposure while a common cause of concern for participants was not the only concern maintaining personal security was also a source of worry one participant was the victim of a violent mugging i got jumped and mugged and had everything stolenpassport credit cards everything there were some bruises and what not but it was more mentally what it did to me i actually thought i was going to die i couldnt trust anyone anymoreseveral participants mentioned feeling threatened by community members who were angry and afraid of the etus and the health care personnel working there family members of etu patients also sometimes threatened violence driving from one location to another was an additional cause for concern as recalled one participant there was definitely a sense of hostility in some of the deployment areas even though we had the ebola team sign on the car there were some checkpoints where we had to get out of the car and hand over our passports there was anxiety about what would happen
fatigue
the workload was very taxing as staffing was limited and patient load extremely heavy at least two participants said they started their deployment working 12 hour shifts six days a week one participant reported that in his etu which had over 70 patients each day even though it was originally designed for 14 people - there were only two staff members because of the staff shortages participants said they felt guilty if they took a day off to rest as noted by one participant the one day off a week policy was there but it was on an honor system that many didnt abide by because its the guilt you feel obviously the local health care workers arent taking that day off patients arent taking that day off soit was initially recommended and eventually required as the strain became more apparent there were a couple of times where participants felt so overwhelmed and exhausted that they had considered leaving as one noted we had discussions about whether or not we should stay in the end we always decided to stay
post-deployment

quarantine and sense of isolation
most participants reported that their reentry experiences were very stressful as illustrated by the following recollection the airport was just awful they sent you back into this little office  i coughed one time that led to me being put into a room that was the equivalent of a jail cell metal bench metal toilet without a lid and a camera two doctors in full ppe came in and questioned mein our sample once participants returned home they were placed in home quarantine this was also reported as an extremely stressful time as one participant noted i had to do a 21-day mandatory quarantine and observation period i actually oddly found this to be the most traumatic part of the whole thing i come from a very small town and everyone kind of knows everyone elses business my family was basically convinced that i was going to die of ebola at any moment i did my quarantine at my parents but i had to have my own room my own utensils and plates my own bathroom i wasnt allowed to touch anyone i had to maintain a three foot radius at all times i wasnt even able to have a very close conversation another participant mentioned that she lost a lot of friends during quarantine because nobody would even pick up the phone it was just awfullack of physical contact during the quarantine was problematic for some many had not had any physical contact for many months one participant reported that she had not touched a single person from early november until the end of january and then suddenly 21 days was over my public health nurse came to my house on day 21 and we realized it was overand i dont have ebola and she gives me a hug and i was likeoh my godyoure the first person that has touched me in 3 months and nowlike im terrified i miss my 3 foot bubble just because i felt very secure now when someone reaches out for a handshake or a hug  im like are you sure you know what youre doingeven after the quarantine period was over some wanted to be alone as recalled one participant as soon as the quarantine was over everyone wanted things to go back to normal as if nothing had happenedbut i didnt want to see anyone i was so used to being alone still at least one participant reported more positive experiences upon their return most people were great the problem was the 5 who were freaks about it
stigmatization lack of appreciation
participants reported that they felt anger and resentment from their family members and friends upon their return they felt unprepared for the reactions of those around them as expressed by one participant no one wants to be around you- even after the quarantine is over i was like oh my gosh people dont want to be around me i felt very nave and stupid for not foreseeing it like i was making plans like nothing was wrong but nobody wants to deal with yousome wanted validation of the risks they had taken by volunteering they wanted the public to know what they had been through and how they had put their own lives at risk to help protect others participants felt that their efforts not only helped people in west africa who were directly affected but that they also helped to prevent the spread of ebola to other countries including the us they wanted the authorities to confirm that the volunteers were not reckless but rather that they were selfless they felt like heroes and wanted to be appreciated for their volunteer efforts but instead some reported feeling stigmatized upon their return because as one participant stated people were being selfish and only worried about their own health and not how the ebola response effort was about the health and well-being of total populations another participant felt that the attitude in the us was im in the us and this doesnt involve me so why should i careseveral participants experienced stigmatization as did their family members as reported by one participant not only was there fear and stigmatization against me but against my family as well my mom volunteers at a school they told her not to come in
grief depression and guilt about leaving
participants reported feelings of grief mourning sadness depression remorse and regret upon their return as one participant said oh we could have done much much more others reported feeling as if they were on an emotional roller coaster as one participant noted i felt disappointed and defeated other times i felt ok i did everything i could this is good so up and down it was a nightmare another participant described how he had felt upon return i was a total mess because it was right back to work everyone wanted to tell me how amazing i was but i felt just horrible inside it was hard to dialogue with people about it difficulty sleeping was also reported to be a problem for several participants once they returned homeseveral mentioned that they had been offered mental health services upon return although most did not utilize it the reasons for not using varied from i didnt think i needed it at the time to it was too impersonal by phone by skype those that did use the offered services found them to be very useful one participant was particularly grateful to an occupational medicine physician who called and checked on her well-being for days and weeks after she returned home but in general most participants did not feel that they had received adequate counseling resourcessome expressed remorse about leaving their ebola deployment when their assignment was completed as noted one participant i did not want to leave after 9 weeks there it was really hard to leave there were still so many people needing care still so many cases and so much to do i felt like i was abandoning the people there including the nationals still working there
self-doubt disillusionment re-entry stress symptoms of ptsd reflections
upon return several participants started doubting the meaningfulness of their deployment one participant reported i had this whole questioning of myself and my role in humanitarian responseand then just the stigmatization following all of it you know i kind of came to the fact that all of this is dirty and humanitarian response is going to have some of its dirtiness nothing is as altruistic clean and fair as you think it is everything is complicated and not everybody is in it for the purpose of helping each other out another participant noted the deployment really was an eye opener it showed me where the deficits are within all these international humanitarian organizations many were dismayed by the inequalities they saw between the us health care workers and local health care workers especially in terms of treatment when a worker became ill they also were upset by the fact that local health care workers sometimes did not receive their promised paytransitioning back to everyday lives was difficult for many as one participant recalled when you come back you dont have that grieving time you dont work through any of the emotions and everything you just put everything on hold at that time there just wasnt any time for debriefing- to help reacclimatize returning to your homes in hindsight i think it would have really been good to have had debriefing others mentioned feeling isolated because the only people that they felt they could really talk to and who understood what they were feeling were the people who had deployed with them as noted by one participant you breathe you eat you sleep it for 24 hours of every day its not like you can come back home and relax with your family your heart is just not into it another participant similarly found his reentry disquieting reentry was really really rough i spent a lot of time just sitting in my office staring out of the office i mostly internalized it i drank a lotseveral doubted they would do another deployment like this and if they did certain conditions would have to be in place as one said id have to know that what i was doing was making such a huge difference that it was worth it to be freaking miserable for 21 days sadly others reported a loss of sense of purpose in life once they returned as one physician reported simply put ive just lost my way when i got back the problems were still there but it felt like i was just finished with the way i had been living no worriesyoure gonna die anyway in this outbreak reforming a new life has been tough i guess you could call it ptsd im proud of what i did but in my personal life ive paid a heavy price
positive reflections
despite these predominantly negative findings some positive experiences and feelings were noted as well for instance almost all participants reported a very strong sense of comradery and teamwork within their group there were also many reports of feeling a great deal of respect admiration and appreciation for the skills commitment and hard work of the nationals and other team members that they worked with in spite of the personal toll of the deployment several said were inspired to continue to volunteer as reported by one participant it renewed my commitment to health justice and health equity for everyone and as noted by another i would volunteer again now that i have a better understanding of what needs to be done in an outbreak both in terms of preparedness and responsein this study we found important gaps in preparedness at each stage of deployment with perhaps the most important deficiencies noted in the pre-deployment phase one of the difficulties in making recommendations for improvement is determining who the recommendations should target is it the sponsoring agency is it the person wanting to volunteer is it the professional organization representing these us health care workers it seems reasonable to assume that the responsibility for ensuring a safe and effective high risk deployment should be shared among all key stakeholdersmost importantly the international community specifically who has a responsibility for ensuring efficient and rapid response to future outbreaks in particular the who department of pandemic and epidemic diseases provides strategic leadership in support of affected countries with limited resources the who working in concert with their international partners should develop preparedness recommendations that aim to protect the health and well-being of all health care volunteers recommendations should target the pre-deployment stage starting with the provision of clear accurate and realistic information about the mission the conditions in the field and the steps that will be taken to help protect the health and safety of volunteerssponsors of medical missions are responsible for providing high quality training such as the training developed and provided by the cdc and other organizations in response to ebola hands-on simulated training is essential for complex infection control practices that may be unfamiliar to most health care volunteers this training should be mandatory and verified preferably by high level us public health agencies prior to any high risk deployment specialized counseling at the pre-deployment stage should be targeted towards both volunteers and their families in order to help reduce fear anxiety and resentment of family members pre-deployment counseling might also help volunteers cope with other types of stressors they may commonly face during the deployment fear work-related problems mental and physical exhaustion as well as after the deployment quarantine challenges shunning stigmatization and sense of isolation volunteers must be provided with full disclosure of the procedures that will have to be followed upon return in terms of quarantine this is especially important because the us does not have extensive experience or uniformity with regards to quarantine policies or procedures and there was and remains a lack of standardized management of health care volunteers returning from highly contagious and lethal infectious disease deployments33

34 volunteers to hot zone missions need to know what to expect upon initial reentry into the us and upon return to their particular home state and local jurisdiction as quarantine laws vary considerably around the country35 for large scale events the cdc has an important role to play to help reduce stigmatization of returning volunteers and their families by launching general public information campaigns these types of campaigns might better prepare communities to both send and receive returning volunteers sponsoring organizations also have a responsibility in assuring that there are support systems in place for volunteers and their families if needed upon their repatriation back homehealth care workers interested in volunteer work similarly have important preparedness responsibilities first it may be prudent to consider volunteering locally or nationally before agreeing to overseas missions because the us is one of the top five nations worldwide36 in terms of natural disaster occurrences there are many opportunities for health care workers interested in volunteering for disaster response for example the national disaster response system ndms which include the disaster medical assistance team and the national nurse response team are excellent volunteer options to explore36 another good option is the medical reserve corps mrc37 a national network of volunteers that are organized locally to improve the health and safety of their communities health professionals can also volunteer through the american red cross38
before considering an overseas medical mission potential volunteers should review as much information provided by the sponsoring organization as possible as well as more general published information39 volunteers need to assure themselves and their families of the capabilities of the sponsor organizations a list of non-governmental organizations that meet certain criteria is maintained by the national voluntary organization active in disaster nvoad40 sponsors should have proven track records of effective humanitarian medical response missions in resource-poor countries including their ability to maintain an adequate supply chain of necessary ppe21 they must also provide a clear understanding of what the volunteers roles and responsibilities are likely to be in order to limit misunderstandings on-site volunteers can pre-register with sponsor organizations in order to obtain advanced verification of credentials and licensure which can then facilitate rapid deployment41
potential volunteers should also avail themselves and their families of the many excellent no-cost training basic disaster preparedness programs so that they are better prepared to serve as a disaster volunteer information on these programs is noted in table 2 training programs that address cultural competency and cross-cultural job performance may also of value to volunteers with information provided by the sponsor on the prevailing cultural norms of the host country volunteers can become more competent in this regard a good review of this is provided in a 2009 rand publication42


the responsibility of the sponsor should not end when the volunteers tour of duty ends if volunteers have to be quarantined upon their return home the sponsor should ensure they have policies and protocols in place to support the volunteer during quarantine the sponsor should also ensure that the volunteers have mental health care resources available at all stages of deployment a good resource for additional information on the maintenance of psychological well-being of volunteers is provided by the substance abuse and mental health services administration samsha43 they urge disaster responders to take advantage of their extensive resource list to help them maintain their psychological well-being before during and after a disaster deployment participation in support groups comprised of volunteers may also be advantageousmental health aspects of deployment are of particular concern we noted a striking similarity between post-deployment feelings reported in this study with those reported by returning war veterans recent scholarship on a relatively new phenomenon referred to as moral injury may have some relevance here moral injury is believed to result when military personnel are confronted with ethical and moral challenges that transgress deeply held beliefs and morals44

45 in our study participants frequently witnessed suffering undignified death and limited ability to provide quality of careand these exposures may have resulted in moral injury as the symptoms commonly associated with moral injury shame guilt remorse and demoralization45 were frequently reported by our study participants while moral injury is different from post-deployment mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd co-morbidities with this and other mental health disorders are not unusual45 since the short and long term mental health impact of hazardous medical mission deployments has not been well characterized in volunteers additional studies on this are warranteddespite the potential study limitations which include small sample and self-report selection recall and social desirability response biases important in-depth information was obtained that can inform our understanding of the potential adverse impacts of high risk medical deployments additional studies are warranted to develop and evaluate best practices preparedness programs for high risk medical missions there is also a need to assess pre-deployment counseling on health and mental health outcomes in medical volunteersthe urge to do something to help in an international medical crisis is understandable and admirable but the adverse impacts reported by participants here  at every stage of deployment suggest that preparedness for these missions needs improvement and at the very least high risk missions should be limited to more seasoned and well trained for conditions in the field personnel while volunteering for a medical mission during a health crisis can be very rewarding both professionally and personally it can also be very disruptive and impactful all volunteers for high risk missions must be made fully aware of the risks they are going to face and the potential consequences which may include illness quarantine and even death the challenges of delivering care under extremely constrained conditions may be overwhelming for some people and it is imperative that volunteers have realistic expectations of conditions in the field as well as a good understanding of how this deployment may affect their lives  before during and after deploymentorganizations sponsoring medical missions have a great responsibility to protect the safety and security of their volunteers by providing them with adequate training and ensuring that the medical missions are well managed they also must ensure that their volunteers have appropriate counseling and mental health care resources available at every stage of their deployment support for a national us program that can provide oversight of high risk medical missions is advisable especially since it is inevitable that there will be future outbreaks because the health and safety of volunteers for these types of missions may be at risk preparedness of all key stakeholders is essential the heroism of ebola mission volunteers was appropriately honored by the 2014 times person of the year award and we can further honor their bravery and sacrifice by ensuring that future volunteers to high risk missions will be as well prepared as possible such efforts will serve to protect the volunteer as well as the international community including the uscorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to robyn r m gershon mhs drph institute for health policy studies university of california san francisco tel 415 476-1890 email robyngershonucsfeduthe authors declare that they have no competing interestsall relevant data are within the paper and its supporting information files

following the emergence of the novel respiratory virus sars-cov-2 covid-19 many environmental health experts quickly identified the potentially disastrous public health ramifications of concurrent infectious and air pollution-mediated disease 1 however much of this discussion has focused on the outdoors annually 38 million people worldwide prematurely die from illnesses attributable to household air pollution 2 in the united states radon a major indoor air pollutant is the second leading cause of lung cancer and is responsible for 1500020000 deaths each year 3 although stay-at-home orders and remote workinglearning have increased the relevance of home indoor exposures to all persons there are still certain vulnerable populations that bear a disparate burden of avoiding the virus outdoors and being exposed to nontrivial pollutants indoors these populations include children the elderly individuals with preexisting conditions native american tribal nations and households of low socioeconomic statusparticularly those in multifamily buildings 47 to be explicit this is not a call for ignoring social distancing and other public health orders rather similar to efforts drawing attention to increases in domestic abuse and the mental health consequences of isolation 8 9 it is an opportunity to name poor household indoor air quality as a long-standing public health issue with increased relevance during the present pandemicone common misconception is that the indoor air environment is simply a reflection of the outdoor milieu however this is not always the case outdoor air pollution penetrates indoors and because americans spend a majority of their times indoors 90 the majority of exposure to outdoor air pollution occurs indoors nevertheless there are distinct important sources of indoor air pollution 10 fireplaces kitchens furniture wall insulation and personal care products are just some noteworthy sources of indoor pollutants household cleaning products are a particularly relevant source of indoor pollution at this juncture in time given that many people may be cleaning more frequently and with stronger disinfectants to reduce rates of viral infection furthermore efforts to make homes airtight to improve energy efficiency have created buildings with reduced outdoor ventilation rates resulting in the buildup of indoor pollutants to harmful levels that would be otherwise unacceptable outdoors 11 12 importantly the toxicity of indoor air extends beyond the health effects of individual pollutants the reactive chemistry of pollutants can be an additional source of harmful indoor chemicals including secondary ozonides oxygenated volatile organic compounds and hydroxyl radicals 13 finally the microbiota of the indoor environment is becoming an ever-more appreciated contributor to indoor air quality 14 15 existing studies demonstrate that indoor air microbiomes are quite diverse and can have meaningful impacts on human health 16 although individuals are primarily concerned with the burden of covid-19 in their indoor air aerosolized covid-19 does not exist in isolation hence recognition of all airborne microorganisms and how the indoor air microbiome may interact with many of the aforementioned chemical exposures is important for building a more comprehensive understanding of indoor air qualityin contrast to the outdoors where federal mandates like the clean air act of 1970 have been passed to maintain air quality direct top-level legislation for indoor air quality has been lacking the environmental protection agency epa indoor air quality program was slated to be cut in the 2019 federal budget and at present the epa does not regulate indoor air 17 some may point to the us housing act 1937 the safe water drinking act 1974 the residential lead hazard reduction act 1992 and the updated toxic substances control act tsca 2016 as examples of legislation addressing the indoor environment however these measures are indirect in that they limit the introduction of harmful substances that are brought indoors but do not regulate the indoor environment itself they have also demonstrated weaknesses in effectiveness for instance despite the tsca the epa still identified the need to offer a final ruling that any discontinued uses of asbestos cannot reenter the marketplace without epa review in april of 2019 18 this ruling is particularly concerning as it opens the door for the epa to reconsider uses of asbestos and could result in the reintroduction of asbestos to the marketplace in lieu of federal indoor air mandates some states have offered legislation to control the air in schools and other buildings still efforts directed at private homes remain limited moreover these state-level policies leave a patchwork of national coverage 19the existing discrepancy in the frameworks for regulating outdoor and indoor air can be partially explained by the perception of outdoor air as a shared public good but indoor air as a discrete personal resource with non-communal impacts 20 yet covid-19 demonstrates how this logic easily falls apart the main premise for social distancing and stay-at-home orders is to safeguard the individual and society at-large from peaks in infection that would overwhelm the nations healthcare system nevertheless one can imagine a young boy already living with severe asthma who now has to spend all of his day in a dilapidated urban project apartment after being exposed to mold and secondhand smoke from his neighbors he too finds himself rushed to a hospital in this common scenario society fails to gain the full benefits of stay-at-home orders because the healthcare system is utilized regardless and those most at-risk for covid-19 complications are also placed at greater risk of exposurestill as we push for broader pieces of legislation to protect our indoor air what can that young boy do to potentially mitigate the impacts of harmful indoor air on his health what can other individuals do to protect themselves and their loved ones during these times of home isolation and beyond when entering the home remove shoes at the door to avoid tracking harmful particles inside if someone in your household has covid-19 or is a healthcare worker consider using a high-efficiency particulate air hepa purifier in the home even though these purifiers are not completely protective against the virus hepa filters remove particles of 03 m and a coronavirus is 01 m they can help remove other pollutants and larger viralmicrobiome agglomerates from the air if it is safe to do so opening up windows can improve indoor air circulation and dilute indoor contaminants if cooking make sure the kitchen remains well-ventilated to avoid harmful exposures to fumes and particulate matter finally when cleaning avoid the overuse of chemicals and air fresheners that may simply be contributing additional hazardous substances to the air although there will be limits eg financial logistical safety to the extent to which individuals can fully implement these and similar protective measures in their personal lives we hope for these suggestions to be a helpful starting place by continuing to raise awarenesstogetherwe can help actualize a future where fewer people succumb to indoor air-related diseasewhen pandemics manifest novel and sometimes unscientific ideas proliferate as to how they can be prevented treated and cured conspiracy theories can proliferate uscinski and enders 30 april 2020 anderson et al 1 may 2020 as douglas has observed people have

associated with a score of  psychosocial stressors including health threats to oneself and loved ones there may be severe disruptions of routines separation from family and friends shortages of food and medicine wage loss social isolation due to quarantine or other social distancing programs and school closure in addition hospital and medical facilities can break down under the pressure of

pandemic arises from virulent pathogens shah 2016 206 and exposure in significant part is involuntary it can be fatal for any given person it is not visible and it is hard to prevent and problematic

nothing is more punitive than to give a disease a meaning  that meaning being invariably a moralistic one any important disease whose causality is murky and for which treatment is ineffectual tends to be awash in significance first the subjects of deepest dread corruption decay pollution anomie weakness are identified with the disease then in the name of the disease that is using it as a metaphor that horror is imposed on other things the disease becomes adjectival
pandemic fear creates black humour brig 24 march 2020 but it also makes people hyper-vigilant it impels them to notice things they might not otherwise have noticed to pay attention to certain associations and ignore others to remember prophecies they might previously have dismissed as absurd spinney 2017 75 mediaeval chroniclers relate how bizarre sightings of unnatural phenomena occurred in the period leading up to the onset of the black death giving a fillip to public panic and the miasma theory of pandemics - that a miasma bad air unleashed by god was the cause of the diseasescapegoating and discrimination too are a common response in face of a pandemic mcneil jr 2009 cooke 2009 during the antonine plague of 166 ce for instance there was an eruption of persecution of christians who were blamed for the plague by reason of their rejection of local gods their blasphemies and their indulgence in black magic seaman 2018 between 1347 and 1352 during the black death there were multiple attacks on members of social minorities including those suffering from leprosy mental illness and foreigners colet santiveri ventura saula  galdacano 2014 they were an example of a

of a combination of genetic psychological biological educational and situational factors in face of the pressures of a pandemic we are all vulnerable but some amongst us have especial psychological frailties as a result of rigidities of personality particular levels of fearfulness or a propensity to anxiety that can be exploited this is the more pronounced in an era in which all forms of media including social media make information including alarmist and stress-inducing information the more accessible and ubiquitous it has been suggested that the speed of social media creates an echo chamber of skepticism and conspiracy theories gorter 2020 those who are less educated who have disabilities see kavanagh 2020 or who are socially isolated by reason of limited linguistic facility in their country of residence have additional vulnerabilities in terms of their ability to understand and process government-issued information this can leave them with impairments of health literacy at least in respect of the pandemic paakkan  okan 2020 emotionally and informationally isolated and prone to make decisions based upon fear and rumourthe diathesis stress model is useful in this context it postulates that if the combination of predisposition and stressor exceed a threshold this can result in the development of pathology lazarus 1993 however at a subclinical level vulnerabilities can render people at risk for poor decision-making and inhibiting their capacity for clear thinking and the analysis of available information about how they should respond to risk pandemics generate high levels of anxiety paranoia stigmatisation and xenophobia taylor 2019 with the potential for maladaptive decision-making such responses can be exacerbated by cultural educational and religiose overlays that are apt to engender confusion guilt and anxiety as well as by emotive tropes encountered in a variety of contexts religion literature films and board and online games are a significant part of our shared cultural experience that frame our expectations and influence our responses to reality dehority 2020for instance in the old testament of the bible plagues and pestilences which also ravaged the ancient world are depicted as a punishment by an often merciless god as a retribution for the commission of sins see eg exodus 9 14 numbers 11 33 1 samuel 4 8 psalms 8923 isaiah 9 13 as huremovic 2019 7 has observed throughout the biblical context pandemic outbreaks are the bookends of human existence considered both a part of nascent human societies and a part of the very ending of humanity the bhagavad purana pragmatically warned villagers to flee their dwellings as soon as dead rats were seen as dead rats were a harbinger of death in humans blaser 1998 liston 1924 in islamic tradition there are multiple exhortations as to how a person must respond in face of the danger of contagion  for instance the holy prophet recognised the urgency of preventative responses and preached the importance of travel bans and quarantine in places contaminated with disease in order to mitigate the spread of illness if you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land do not enter it and if the plague breaks out in a place while you are in it do not leave that place sahih al-bukharisimilar depictions are found in literature it was homer who first used the term epidemios to describe those returning to greece while hippocrates employed it in a medical sense to refer to that which circulates or propagates in a country this paved the way for awareness of the potential for an infection to spread uncontrolled from one community to another thucydides recounted the fearfulness of the plague in athens between 429 and 426 bce and the breakdown of law and order
there was no previous record of so great a pestilence and destruction of human life the doctors were unable to cope since they were treating the disease for the first time and in ignorance indeed the more they came into contact with sufferers the more liable they were to lose their own lives no other device of men was any help moreover supplication at sanctuaries resort to divination and the like were all unavailing in the end people were overwhelmed by the disaster and abandoned efforts against it history of the peloponnesian war ii viii512
the better part of a millennium later procopius in his account of the justinian plague in 543 ce history of the wars ii 22 which the emperor himself termed gods education and john of ephesus called the chastisement pearce 2017 commented that the whole human race came near to being annihilatedthe accounts of both chaucer 13431400 in the canterbury tales ther cam a privee thief men clepeth deeth that in this contree al the peple sleeth and boccaccio 13131375 in the decameron in this sore affliction and misery of our city the reverend authority of the laws both human and divine was all in a manner dissolved and fallen into decay for lack of the ministers and executors thereof who like other men were all either dead or sick or else left so destitute of followers that they were unable to exercise any office wherefore everyone had license to do whatever pleased him postulated amongst other things that fear of contagion increases vices such as avarice lust and corruption both alessandro manzoni 17851873 in the betrothed i promessi sposi 1827 revised 1842 and history of the column of infamy storia della colonna infame and daniel defoe 16591731 in the diary of a plague year catalogued reactions of anxiety and desperation within milan and london respectively during pandemics manzoni described the fears of poisoning arising from scaffolding carried by workers in a cathedral in the betrothed and in a history of the column of infamy the belief that the plague had been caused by the actions of the evil the untori who were possessed by the devil resulting in the execution of the innocent and erection of a column in milan to commemorate the imposition of death on two greasersin the last man mary shelley 17971851 portrayed the need of the central character to stay away from others for fear of being infected and edgar allan poe 18091849 meditated on the role of the plague in being a purveyor of death similarly in the scarlet plague published in 1912 jack london 18761916 portrayed a post-apocalyptic scenario in 2073 following the spread of the red death in which an uncontrollable pandemic had depopulated the world 60 years before albert camus la peste 1947 in which the plague was posting sentries at the gates and turning away ships was a critique of repugnant materialism as well as disturbing account of cohabitation with death he described reactions of complacency that placed all at risk many continued hoping that the epidemic would soon die out and they and their families be spared thus they felt under no obligation to make any change in their habits as yet plague was an unwelcome visitant bound to take its leave one day as unexpectedly as it had come and anxious fears about the threat to come a pestilence isnt a thing made to mans measure therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind a bad dream that will pass away but it doesnt always pass away and from one bad dream to another it is men who pass awaymultiple films have portrayed the catastrophic impact of epidemics and in particular pandemics as a genre they have been described as reel bio-horror films sutton 2014 the andromeda strain 1971 based on the novel by michael crichton for instance depicts the spread of a deadly organism of extraterrestrial origin death in venice morte a venezia 1971 relates the story of a composer who travels to venice for health reasons but the city becomes stricken by cholera and the health authorities do not inform holiday-makers of what is happening for fear of the consequences in outbreak 1995 the setting is a fictional ebola-form of motaba virus in zaire which then spreads to a california coastal village via a capuchin monkey which is host to the virus the plot focuses on strategies including sinister military interventions and conspiracies to conceal the virus so it can be used as a biological weapon fatal contact 2006 portrays an american businessman who becomes infected with a mutated bird flu

international waves of panic contagion 2011 portrays the medico-scientific quest for a cure to a virus transmitted by respiratory droplets and fmites it includes a sub-plot in which the jude law character a blogger spreads rumors about forsythia wang xia liu et al 2018 a herbal treatment he claims works to cure the virus the last days los ltimos das 2013 centres around a trend of agoraphobia and the panic where people die if they leave shelter extinction 2015 goes a step further portraying a post-apocalyptic world in which a virus has turned the populace into zombies the series of resident evil horror films starting in 2002 and followed by sequels in 2004 2007 2010 2012 and 2016 is based on attempts to control the spread of the t-virus that has escaped from a secret underground genetic research facility in 2015 containment set in a southampton apartment block explores a world patrolled by figures in hazmat suits keeping people within their apartments which no longer have electricity water or contact with the outside world repeating the refrain please remain calm the situation is under controlthere are many other popular exposures to pandemics which generate associations of fear panic and the imminence of human annihilation for instance the popular board game pandemic 2008 was based on the premise that four diseases had broken out in the world each threatening to wipe out a region the game accommodates two to four players each playing one of seven possible specialists dispatcher medic scientist researcher operations expert contingency planner and quarantine specialist through the combined effort of all the players the goal is to discover all four cures before any of several game-losing conditions global catastrophe are reachedcomputer games about viral outbreaks are also prevalent and a potentially significant influence on the generation of gamers for instance in deus ex 2000 a lethal pandemic the gray death has ravaged the population there is no cure but a synthetic vaccine ambrosia can nullify the effects of the virus but is in short supply because of its scarcity ambrosia is available only to those deemed vital to the social order  and finds its way primarily to government officials military personnel the rich and influential scientists and the intellectual elite with no hope for the common people of the world

in a near-future washington dc in the aftermath of a potent strain of a smallpox pandemic engineered in new york city by an environmental terroristin christian tradition world literature film board games and computer games pandemics have been vividly and emotively portrayed in diverse ways requiring urgent prophylactic or avoidance responses all of which are redolent with fear and paranoid ideation thoughts of the reader the viewer and the gamer are turned toward the potential for dire outcomes sometimes offence caused to the godhead is mooted as a cause for the threat frequently doubts are ventilated around the bona fides and effectiveness of the measures taken by government and public health authorities to contain and eradicate viruses and bacteria helplessness is a prominent trope and catastrophising can find expression in the form of both eschatological and apocalyptic ruminations about the consequences of the pandemic for oneself all whom one knows and even the future of humanity in all contexts global disaster is at hand armageddon is close this creates a fertile field for opportunists and charlatans as porter 1989 26 observed in the face of invasions of epidemic sickness there is desperation which in turn creates a voracious demand for a multiplicity of healers amongst whom are quacksthus a variety of influences can combine to generate high levels of fear and anxiety all of which can exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities and militate against calm and informed decision-making during a pandemicthe russian flu is often described as the first modern influenza pandemic it took place between 1889 and 1892 and is believed to have killed more one million people honigsbaum 2020 including queen victorias grandson the duke of clarence honigsbaum 2011 mcginnis 1988 123124 newspaper advertisements touted many cures for the russian flu including castor oil bronchial inhalers and an electric battery quinine too was offered mcginnis 1988 doctors even promoted the idea that drinking brandy and eating oysters were a key to staving off infection knapp 2020the best known questionable remedy proposed for the russian flu though was the carbolic smoke ball which consisted of a rubber ball filled with powdered carbolic acid snell 2001 the patient squeezed the ball sending a puff of acidic smoke up a tube inserted into the nostrils it was advertised with testimonials by well known personalities as was common at the time in the pall mall gazette offering a 100 reward to anyone using it correctly who then contracted influenza mcginnis 1988 124 the purveyor of the smoke ball deposited 1000 in the alliance bank in regent street to show the money was there coleman 2009the carbolic smoke ball prophylaxis had a notorious legal outcome louisa elizabeth carlill purchased a ball from a chemist in oxford street london and used it as directed three times a day for nearly two months however she contracted the flu she claimed her reward but was rebuffed by the carbolic smoke ball company which replied to correspondence from her husband who had trained as a solicitor saying that if used properly it had total confidence in its product it failed to return her money this resulted in her suing the carbolic smoke ball company in the high court for breach of contract she succeeded carlill v carbolic smoke ball company 1892 but the company appealed to the court of appeal arguing that their advertisement was mere puff however this argument was rejected on the basis that the company had deposited 1000 to show its seriousness as mcginness 1988 127128 has observeda legal decision supporting that type of argument would only serve to encourage the telling of even more outrageous untruths advertisers could attempt with impunity to trap consumers with progressively bigger lies and then avoid liability by laughing at the gullibility of the gulled instead the court said that it was going to look at the contract as printed and to interpret it according to its plain meaning on the sensible assumption that what is exactly what mrs carlill and other buyers like her would have done
secondly the company maintained that it had no way of ascertaining whether mrs carlill had followed its instructions correctly this contention was rejected by the court of appeal out-of-hand carlill v carbolic smoke ball company 1893 thirdly the company argued that an offer such as it had made could not be understood to have been made to the whole world this argument too failed with the court of appeal finding that the offer was clear and to a group of consumers and anyone fulfilling its terms could be deemed to have accepted the offer finally the company argued that the requisite consideration for a contract did not exist however the court of appeal rejected this too concluding that any use of the smoke ball would be likely to promote sales and thus be of value to the company thus mrs carlills use of the smoke ball constituted valuable considerationthe outcome of the decision was an emphatic endorsement of contract law as a means by which the vulnerable could be protected against false representations which were not honoured during a pandemicthe editors of the lancet exulted
we are glad to learn that in spite of the ingenuity of their legal advisers the defendants have been held liable to make good their promise people who are silly enough to adopt a medicine simply because a tradesman is reckless enough to make extravagant promises and wild representations as to its efficacy may thank themselves chiefly for any disappointment that ensues still for this folly which is only foolish and nothing worse it is possible to feel sympathy when the disappointment comes it is a pleasant alternative to learn that the dupe has been able as in the present instance to enforce a sharp penalty and that the process of reaping a harvest from the simplicity of ones neighbours is attended with dangers of miscarriage which must materially diminish its attractiveness in the eyes of those people who supply the popular demand for quack medicines editorial 1892 see too simpson 1985

another body fined by the tga on this occasion a63000 was oxymed australia pty ltd this arose from alleged contraventions relating to the advertising of hyperbaric oxygen chambers not included in the australian register of therapeutic goods the advertisements made therapeutic claims to treat a range of serious ailments including covid-19 therapeutic goods administration 27 march 2020for several years the genesis ii church of health and healing promoted a product known as miracle mineral solution mms which was marketed as containing a miracle mineral supplement it contained 28 sodium chlorite a chemical used as a textile bleaching agent and disinfectantin 2014 media reported that ten victorians had been poisoned by mms in the previous five years minear 2014 it reported that victorian poisons information centre specialist dr dawson macleod said that people had reported symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea after using mms with four having to be hospitalised he said it could cause potentially life-threatening illnesses and that the long-term consequences of using mms were not known the president of the australian medical association victorian branch dr tony bartone castigated snake oil salesmen for preying upon vulnerable people with magic potions theres no evidence whatsoever and certainly no clinical trials to suggest this is anything more than bleach it certainly should be banned minear 2014 this prompted the tga to publish an advisory stating that products containing this concentration of sodium chlorite pose a serious health risk if consumed by humans and should be labelled with warnings and the word poison mms is not approved by the tga for any therapeutic use in australia products that are used in the purification or treatment of drinking water and which do not make therapeutic claims are not considered therapeutic goods however based on the media reports the tga is concerned that some people may be using mms to treat illnesses or for other therapeutic purposes using mms in this way will not have any therapeutic benefit and may have toxic effects therapeutic goods administration 13 november 2014on 13 may 2020 the tga issued twelve infringement notices totalling a151200 for allegedly unlawful advertising of mms and other medicines by southern cross directories pty ltd trading as mms australia stating that there is no clinical scientifically-accepted evidence showing that mms can cure or alleviate any disease the use of mms presents serious health risks and can result in nausea vomiting diarrhoea and severe dehydration which in some cases can result in hospitalisation it stated that its reason for action was alleged contravention of the therapeutic goods act 1989 cth and the therapeutic goods advertising code no 2 2018 in relation to advertisements therapeutic goods administration 13 may 2020 it also issued an advisory to consumers to be alert to misleading claims about mms for the treatment cure prevention or alleviation of disease in humans including covid-19
mms is often marketed as water purification drops and may be offered under different names including miracle mineral supplement it contains a high concentration of sodium chlorite which is a chemical used as a textile bleaching agent and disinfectant products containing high concentrations of sodium chlorite pose a serious health risk if consumed by humans and should be labelled with the appropriate warnings mms has not been approved by the tga for use to treat cure prevent or alleviate any disease or condition therapeutic goods administration 8 may 2020
the body fined was associated with the genesis ii church of health and healing its leader mark grenon had written to donald trump the united states president telling him that that chlorine dioxide is a wonderful detox that can kill 99 of the pathogens in the body he added that it can rid the body of covid-19 a few days later at his daily coronavirus briefing at the white house president trump promoted the idea that disinfectant could be used as a treatment for the virus stating that disinfectant knocks it out in a minute one minute he went on to ask a public health official is there a way we can do something by an injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so itd be interesting to check that pilkington 25 april 2020in a number of countries concern has been expressed about the propagation of a diverse array of forms of false information online in relation to covid-19 in russia for instance investigators were announced to be considering whether to bring a criminal prosecution as a result of a youtube video falsely alleging that organs were being harvested from coronavirus patients for medical treatment of covid-19 prosecutors demand probe into fake news about harvesting of covid-19 patients organs 23 april 2020 in israel a rishon letzion resident allegedly sent a message in the name of the health ministry to his girlfriend who had returned from miami in an effort to get her to self-quarantine he was conveyed for investigation at the cybercrimes unit of the lahav 433 police anti-corruption unit for four crimes including publishing false information to cause fear and panic and transmitting false information he had used software to make his messages look as though they came from the health ministry he sent a message to the woman to quarantine herself and another to her friend telling her to keep her distance beiner 6 april 2020perhaps the extreme end of repression of fake coronavirus news though raising the risk for government action to constitute an unreasonable contravention of human rights mcdonald 23 march 2020 occurred in cambodia a 14 year-old girl in kampot was detained and compelled to apologise publicly for writing in a message on facebook that there were three people ill with covid-19 at her school and that others had died from the disease vicheika  tum 14 march 2020a number of factors can create a conducive environment for the making of false claims and communications online in the context of a pandemic anxieties and fears engendered by the pandemic can render people vulnerable especially in an online environment dread of contracting and being harmed by a disease such as covid-19 can be exacerbated by religious associations with pestilences and plagues literary traditions film portrayals and computer game tropes as well as factors such as personality issues educational deficits language limitations social isolation and disabilities alone and in combination such vulnerabilities are apt to be fanned by chronically anxiety-inducing media coverage an outcome is the potential for predatory opportunities to exploit those vulnerable to credulity and the suspension of faculties of discernmentthe reality of pandemic vulnerability raises the question of how most constructively public health authorities can respond in the context of the covid-19 pandemic to meet both conspiracy theories and therapeutic misrepresentations recent responses by some governments have provided a useful perspectivefirstly health messaging needs to be communicated in a calm and straightforward tone which does not exacerbate anxieties and irrational fears but rather encourages prudent care-taking conduct secondly there needs to be a continuing flow of medico-scientifically evidence-based education which works toward disabusing members of the community of misunderstandings fears and fallacies which otherwise may gain popular traction and exacerbate paranoid and anxiety pathologies as well as render people more prone to be victimisedthirdly there is a need for governments to be assertive in taking preventative and deterrent action against those who are misusing the covid-19 era to enrich themselves opportunistically or to take advantage of those who lack the capacity to be discerning about false claims of capacity to prevent treat or cure the disease for good reason the traditional public health approach to such misrepresentations is to provide a clear warning initially to those responsible for such misinformation in the form of what in the united states are called cease and desist orders however where there is non-compliance in face of such governmental communications robust legal action needs to be initiated with condign imposition of penalties to deter and punish unethical quackery during a pandemic

to outline the ethical issues that may arise during disasters at both the policy and clinical levelsframeworks and values will be discussed including the limitations of ethical analysisthere will be a focus on allocation of resources psychological reactions of both patients and providers and practical implications for policymakers and practitioners
disasters frequently create demands that outstrip available existing medical and societal resources this may be particularly problematic for giving medical care because disasters may destroy the infrastructures necessary to both provide patients care and keep new health problems from emerging disaster may for example not only strike care providers and hospital facilities directly they may decimate communities capacities to provide food to the population and carry out critical waste disposal services all these effects may be most important to policymakers and care providers deciding triage priorities during disasters referring to just these two examples food and waste disposal services for instance care providers should treat first not only other care providers who can then take care of others but food preparers and waste disposal personnel likewise to save the most lives these two examples are just a few among many that warrant priority for this same reasonthis ethical question whom care providers should first treat is perhaps the most profound and controversial ethical question that disasters may pose disasters vary of course widely they include pandemics natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods and nuclear accidents each kind of disaster raises different ethical issues yet many remain common to allthis discussion will focus on these common ethical issues it will use infectious disease as the principal paradigm representing other disasters the use of this disaster as a paradigm may be particularly useful because with infectious diseases new ethical problems may arise at different stages over time for instance during pandemics a first task may be to identify people already infected or possibly infected and to then isolate them so that they do not pass on their virus to others next contacts must be reached all such patients must of course also be treated but the numbers infected may increase and indeed multiply every weekthe discussion that follows will outline ethical issues that can arise during disasters at both the policy and clinical levels initially conflicting frameworks and values will be discussed the limitations of ethical analysis in resolving these conflicts will then be presentedsince the facts are a first step in ethical analysis possible psychological reactions of both patients and care providers during disasters will next be enumerated these reactions may vary and be quite uncertain both of these considerations may profoundly affect and indeed alter what policymakers and care providers should best do one plan may be best on paper if though in practice this plan is impossible to implement due to particularly peoples emotional reactions the best-laid plans may prove suboptimalethical concerns involving the allocation of limited resources this most pressing of ethical issues then for all of the reasons stated previously will be the focus of the following discussion specific issues addressed will include also the practice known as tiering which occurs when more patients than are expected continue to arrive over time a scheme based especially on respecting peoples relations with each other posed in new zealand and finally international obligationspractical implications for policymakers and clinicians finally will be discussed it will be suggested that although several ethical considerations that arise during disasters remain controversial other ethical guidelines now developed can be quite helpfuldue to these peoples greater dependency they require more resources thus if they are treated equally in theory fewer lives could be saved from a utilitarian standpoint treating these people equally may then not be warranted yet the principle of justice in the sense of all peoples lives being equal might require that these patients be treated equally even though this end result would most likely be nonutilitarian in its ultimate net effect the ethical principles of utility and justice may then here be in conflictas this example exemplifies however this use of justice is only one of the ways in which justice can be viewed and applied other equally valid meanings of justice are to help most those who are worst off and giving all an equal opportunity to live a full life as will be discussed this last application may support rather than conflict with the principle of utility ethical analysis may then serve to clarify the different ways justice can be applied during disasters this may in turn help clarify what should be doneanother value preventing harm may mean giving some resources during disasters to relieving patients suffering here justice for those worst off might require providing some care to people greatly suffering even though this might mean that some other patients as a result may die when otherwise they might have lived people unduly subject to suffering might be for example those who are bedridden and thus cant be moved during disasters but require ongoing analgesics for severe painanother most difficult issue is how if at all treatment criteria should change if and when the number of people needing life-saving treatment greatly increases this issue is the one referred to this as tieringother additionally more problematic issues involve finding ways to communicate optimal advice and available resources as equally as possible among poorer persons who may not have the same access to radios and televisions in some contexts andor live in extremely rural settings still others involve limiting individuals freedoms such as by restricting their freedom due to quarantines contact tracing and requiring the reporting of possible transmission of diseasea particularly heartfelt additional ethical framework does not involve principles at all instead it primarily involves giving moral weight to people having and maintaining close caring relationships with one another 1 this perspective may be seen as including during disasters keeping people close to one another as in the same family together criteria for who is treated first during triage could however favour treating one family member on utilitarian grounds over another then particularly one family member may survive when another may notthis most excruciating ethical dilemma arose in one hospital for example after hurricane katrina due to the flooding that occurred around this hospital only a few patients at a time could be rescued there by rescue boatshere then this other moral framework the care perspective might apply thus these frameworks themselves in addition to different moral principles within the traditional framework using ethical principles such as justice and utility may conflict this other framework known as the ethics of care may give greater moral weight to maintaining the relationships between these people by giving a parent and child or husband and wife together greater priority thus in regard to the question who at a hospital stranded by a flood should be the first ones rescued this different framework might give more priority to saving all ones family members over applying usual more abstract ethical principlesthis second moral framework the care perspective also may apply more when care providers or others must decide when if ever they should put limited resources into relieving patients pain as opposed to saving patients lives here it is important to find some means of relieving patients pain but as just one example sufficient numbers of care providers may no longer be available to both provide pain relief and give life-saving careas another example further supplies of analgesics may no longer exist then some care providers might though be willing to stay behind as when others are being evacuated during a flood they may then devote themselves to relieving the pain of these patients as best they can shalev has said for instance when little can be done it is wise to reduce survivors loneliness 2a related ethical question which ethical analysis may be unable to resolve is what care providers should do if a patient has severe pain they cant relieve he or she is expected to die no matter what is or isnt done and he or she asks for active euthanasia 3 4 what also should they do if these patients have unbearable pain but they arent competent or are children and what if in this last case the childs parents are present and plead with the care provider to relieve their childs pain by ending the childs lives should the parents requesting this make any differencesome of the strongest arguments here are self-evident one value in regard to incompetent patients in extreme pain is for example justice they should have equal access to obtaining pain relief this application of justice may apply even or perhaps especially if they are children 5 children may not understand what they are going through for example and may as a result suffer more moral arguments against these are that life is sacred and in regard to competent adults versus other patients that the former should have at least some autonomy to die as they wanta consideration particularly complex is how much moral weight if any should be placed on these patients not understanding why they are in andor being left in extreme pain this lack of understanding could on one hand perhaps be beneficial because these patients wouldnt know that their pain short of death might not be soon resolved this same lack could on the other hand though as already said deprive them of the gains they could have from knowing why care providers cant give them greater relief than they arehow these many most difficult questions should be decided is itself of course also a critical question a conventional approach and answer is that these decisions should be made by legislators since they represent the majoritys rule yet ethically this approach may itself be unacceptably problematic this majority may be insufficiently aware of andor responsive to the needs of the few they may therefore be insufficiently sensitive to the needs of the worst off during disasters these people may include those emotionally or physically ill or bedridden as previously consideredit may be that in regard to how these decisions are made then in making these prior decisions other approaches more likely to offset this risk should also or instead be carried out these approaches may include for example convening focus groups and other outreach efforts these endeavours should be designed particularly to acquire greater input from those likely to be andor know those who would or might be more disadvantaged during disasters than those closer to the average person among the greater populationit is critical for policymakers and clinicians to know when asking these questions what ethical analysis can and cant be expected to offerethical analysis can show the relative strengths and weaknesses of different arguments and this may help provide better answers but it often cant provide best answers this is because reasonable persons may reasonably differ on which among sound but mutually exclusive core values should prevailan example involving rationing is illustrative as indicated previously an ethical conflict may exist between the principles of justice and utility a most difficult question exemplifying this conflict involves age justice might for example support all persons lives being valued equally whereas utility might give priority not to saving the greatest number of lives but to maximizing the number of years in net effect those persons saved would live this value then might give greater priority to people who are youngerthe moral weight if any that age should have may then also differ and depend on which meaning of justice is applied that is people could be treated equally but not just in regard to their being able to continue to live they could instead be given equal opportunity to live to an older age according to this use of equity treating a 30-year-old and 80-year-old equally might mean giving priority to the 30-year-old since this would give the 30-year-old more equal access to living to be 80this second use of justice would accord more with the principle of utility and accordingly add stronger support to the ethical argument for deciding in favour of utility this other second conception of justice has been referred to as the fair innings approach 6this example of ones considering different possible applications of the principle of justice illustrates how ethical analysis may increase ones capacity to arrive at a better argument and thus how this analysis may make the end result better even though this analysis may not give a right answera first significant behaviour people may have prior to and during a pandemic is to hoard medications here as in other such situations it could be hoped that people would not hoard treatments this expectation may however not be met as gostin states this altruistic consensus is comforting but may not reflect real behavior in a time of crisiswhich may include hoarding stockpiling and black marketeering 6 if hoarding occurs of course less treatment supplies will be availablea second psychological possibility involves family members quarantined in their homes here as gostin declares home quarantines can only be morally justified in contexts where residential units permit asymptomatic individuals to remain confined without imposing risks on those with whom they live 7family members already exposed may be instructed to remain separate from others not exposed even if family members know the importance of staying apart they may though engage in denial wanting to be with their loved ones they may not complysome people also may all live together in only one room then for them this desired separation may not be feasible if other living arrangements arent possible but they remain together those families who live in just one room may be treated unequally as again gostin says home quarantine can create divisions based on social class because the poor may not have homes adequate to protect the unexposed 7as both these examples illustrate people may respond during disasters based on their feelings for others this is what of course the ethics of care approach to ethics takes most into accountsome people during disasters care so much for loved ones that they choose to stay with them even at much greater risk to themselves during floods as those caused by hurricanes for example people may be stranded with family members who are bedridden in their homes then those who could leave may later refuse to they may refuse to enter rescue boats for example because they could not take these family members with them some have even refused to leave petsparents even if adequately informed may also not take appropriate steps during disasters to vaccinate their children they may for instance fear that vaccinations would pose unnecessary risksfurther when persons are first exposed to an infectious agent they must be identified as potentially contagious one means of early identification may be by detecting a rise in peoples temperature people must not come in for this temperature testing this testing could be involuntary yet if it is not they may due to fear or denial not come inonce identified there may be a need for contact tracing to locate and isolate all other persons exposed to a person who is infected as lo states public health investigations require cooperation to identify contactsvoluntary measures generally promote cooperation more than do mandatory ones 8 again it might be hoped that people infected would identify these other people but they may not here they may fear stigma or feel shameperhaps the greatest psychological concern that should be taken into account by policymakers and care providers before and during disasters is that people may panic 9 in 1995 in the democratic republic of the congo in response to ebola for example neighbours feared that even care providers and their families might be infected these neighbours reportedly then burned their homes 9 449all these possible psychological responses suggest the need for appropriate preventive antidotes to the degree that these can be implemented in an effort to prevent panic for example due attention must be put in advance to achieving optimal true but reassuring communication 10 emphasis should be placed on informing the public as fully as possible what is being done for example to reduce this panicthere is a tendency for people not faced with a crisis on the other hand to at this time overlook its importance to them resources should be allocated in advance therefore also to try to help overcome this source of resistance so that the public can respond in the most effective as well as calmest way possible if and as a pandemic occursthose responsible for having and making key resources available during a pandemic should do what is necessary then to be adequately prepared this preparation includes stockpiling medications having plans for delivering them and anticipating how this can be best accomplished so that those more disadvantaged such as groups in outlying areas can be adequately reacheda gain from the practice of carrying out mock preparations for a disaster such as a hurricane drill is that institutions may find out that their plan is workable this knowledge may have the desirable secondary effects of increasing both care providers and the publics confidence that such a disaster can be survivedat this same time that there is this need to plan and perhaps also carry out mock measures there is a need when disasters such as again hurricanes threaten to not implement these plans prematurely an example here is when the real likelihood of a hurricanes striking a precise area is extremely remote it would be possible in all such instances to institute full evacuation procedures at once this could save lives but also effect extraordinary costs reasonable criteria regarding when these responses should be triggered must be established beforehand on the basis of the best evidence availableethically though there is no place here for high-stake gambling it is better here to be safe than sorryduring disasters care providers should be able to offer emotional support to their patients to the degree that they can even and especially when their patients are having most severe reactions when for example patients were feeling the panic previously described due to fear that they would acquire ebola in the belgian congo care providers should have when possible sought to continue to see that these reactions are misguided but self-protective behaviours so that with this accurate understanding of these patients these care providers would remain most able to help them 9still care providers may of course be beset by feelings beyond their control in the democratic republic of the congo at this time for instance care providers felt fear fifty-five percent feared having pain and suffering 53  feared a horrible death 41  feared being separated from their loved ones and 23  feared being abandoned 9during the sars outbreaks that occurred throughout the world between november 2002 and july 2003 as another example care providers feared that they too might also acquire sars and that they too could inadvertently spread sars to their families sars could be acquired from patients through respiratory droplets when they were within 6 ft of patients with sars in one sars ward in toronto 90  of the ward nursing staff became infected in a hospital in china 17 medical students acquired sars after doing physical exams on sars-infected patients 11care providers detecting and treating patients with sars also had to try to determine whether a patients fever was or wasnt due to sars they knew that if they were wrong this could result in several peoples lives possibly being lost due to sars this one instance of undetected sars then could also continue to not be identified and go on to spread the infection care providers had to screen numerous people likely to have been exposed so that they could separate those who might have sars from othersthese fears in addition to those for themselves and for their families are obviously most distressful care providers during disasters also may find it highly stressful to not be able to treat patients as they would under normal circumstances 12 even when resources are available care providers may not be able to obtain adequate follow-up for patients 13another source of stress for care providers during disasters is that their role or roles may be unclear although ideally an experienced triage officer is designated it may fall to the individual clinician to make allocation decisions until order is restored 14their roles may conflict if they serve both the roles of triaging and treating patients for example as indicated in this statement when triaging they may be the one deciding to treat or not to treat a patient only later in a treatment role to be responsible for providing the same patient carebursztajn and brodsky two psychiatrists sought to study how care providers cope in what they hoped was a sufficiently analogous situation a conflicting triage context to be generalizable to their behaviour during disasters they studied care providers having such conflicting duties in a managed care settingthey found not surprisingly that care providers feel conflicted care providers may regard their primary allegiance to be to the patient but may as a result of this inadvertently abandon their fiduciary duties this may in turn undermine the doctor-patient alliance this alliance they speculate is a protective factor in care providers being able to better bearing their feelings of uncertainty and grief 15care providers may alternatively be so committed to their alliance with individual patients that they do not fully support allocation policies they may even choose out of loyalty to patients they have known and seen for years to store meds for them even when this might mean that they would not be able to distribute them more equally as public policies might require to others latertheir doing this would be seen as unconscionable from a traditional principled point of view since they would be violating justice in order to favour the interests of their own patients over those of others as lo states physicians who urge an exception for a particular patient should also be willing to support an exception for other similar patients 8from an ethics of care perspective however this might not be at least so self-evidently or unequivocally ethically wrong care providers doing this could be viewed as even if violating more important values at least fulfilling their traditional commitment and an implicit promise to their patients to continue to put their interests first some of their patients might in fact expect thisthis dilemma of whether to treat all patients according to objective criteria to the degree that this is plausible during a disaster is best illustrated perhaps in regard to children this is also presently still controversialthere is first here a question of whether care providers more subjective medical judgments should play any role here and if so how much these subjective medical judgments may be more potentially problematic in regard to children it is argued since children tend to evoke exceptional empathy thus some report that in general during triage children may be overly triaged or placed into groups such that care providers will treat them with greater priority than they should based solely on the severity of condition 16 17there is also present controversy on an altogether different theoretical level people disagree on whether care providers should in general give children greater priority over others less or the same priority from a utilitarian perspective they will live longer yet if they are treated equally this will further more the principle of justice or equity if applied in this way some argue even that only children of a given age such as teenagers should be prioritized they assert that the death of an adolescent is a greater loss than that of a toddler or infant 18children clearly have unique needs their body surface area-to-mass ratio and decreased subcutaneous tissue make them for example medically more vulnerable to hypothermia they also may be less able to communicate their needs and wantsan additional problem involving children and more particularly their parents exceptional feelings for them noted previously is how care providers can determine accurately such answers as how long a child  much less any patient  has been infected when these answers may determine whether they will be treated and thus possibly whether this patient lives or diesone means of determining the duration of a patients infection is for example to ask when did you or your child first have this cougha care provider asking a patient this question might choose not to divulge why he or she is asking this question this ethically may be regarded rightfully as implicit deception by omissioncare providers may want to view this in other ways but the validity of any other view is open to question some ethical choices such as this one unfortunately involve extreme and painful ethical and emotional coststhis situation may be then highly problematic for some care providers for both this reason and because the stakes here for patients are so high how patients answer may determine in triage situations as ive said whether they live or dieif indeed care providers ask this same question to many patients andor parents over time these patients and parents may come to know prior to these care providers asking them what the consequences of their different answers likely will be thus care providers may for this reason feel that they should lie they may believe rightly that from the standpoint of utility if they do lie more patients will fare better this may of course make this situation more problematic for care providers who dont lie as wellfor these kinds of reasons then also it may be preferable for care providers to treat patients only on the basis of objective findings to the degree of course that this is possible these bases might not include then parents statements of how long their children have been stricken patients also then would not be placed in the position of having to decide whether to lie as parents might especially feel that they should and must to try to most help their childrenanother psychological concern regarding care providers is the extent if any to which they will sacrifice the needs of their families for the public good they as others might want greatly to put their loved ones needs first this may mean to some that they should stay with them as opposed to going to work to help far larger numbers of patientsa question posed regarding this is what if any sanctions should be brought against care providers who during disasters place their own families interests above patients by not coming in to work at their hospitals but instead remaining at their homes one view is that care providers being care providers should be trusted to put their patients first another view is that care providers not coming in should lose their medical licence to practicein light of these stresses some physicians who have treated patients with sars afterwards formulated ten lessons for future doctors treating patients during pandemics to share what they had learned one lesson was this during disasters mental health resources should be made available to both patients and staff 19the primary ethical issue here is who among many should have greater priority for receiving limited medical supplies clearly to enhance a populations overall survival it is necessary to treat first those who serve most critical functions they must remain healthy to be able to help othersthus the paradigmatic example of whom care providers should treat first is other care providers who provide direct care but those who serve essential functions include many more groups these people include for example other first responders such as ambulance fire and humanitarian assistance personnel security persons such as police national guard and i would argue now especially after 911 military personnel those who provide essential products and services involving water food and pharmaceutical supplies those maintaining critical infrastructures such as transportation utilities and communication and those maintaining sanitation such as undertakers cemetery workers and waste removal personnel among others 6this group includes also those responsible for continuing government functions these people include key persons in executive legislative and judicial systems and those who support them 6beyond those in these groups however the questions of priority become more taxing one approach is here for example to protect most more vulnerable groups such as the very old and very young as already in part mentioned since this in some regard most respects all peoples dignity though this at the same time violates utility factually though these groups may actually not be those most vulnerable seasonal influenza disproportionately burdens infants and the elderly but highly pathogenic strains may affect young adults as occurred with spanish flu 6the elderly are more vulnerable but they also will benefit less as said because they will not have as long to live still even though this statement is valid peoples age may not of course reflect their actual health thus making cut-offs on the basis of age alone is ethically significantly problematicjustice as stated here also may be applied in different ways an 80-year-old could have the same access to treatment as someone 30 based on justice but the fair innings principle might favour care providers treating younger adults children and pregnant women firstanother more vulnerable group is the poor the poor may be disadvantaged relative to other groups for many reasons as said for example they may relative to other people better off lack the same access to the media which may inform the public where they should go and when if poorer people receive less information or receive it in a less timely manner they will be disadvantaged accordinglyas stated the poor may also be disadvantaged if they live in smaller homesthey may in addition suffer more also for other reasons if quarantined for example they may have a greater need for lost income they also may not be in positions in which they can as easily take time off and still get paida final example of a disadvantage the poor may experience may occur if they must travel to be at the front of a queue of people getting treatment policies may follow a first-come first-served principle if and when this is the case poor persons may lack equal access to transportation they may for example have to make several bus transfers to travel across a city this may take more time than others take this may allow others to arrive first and thus be before them in a queueperhaps the most troubling more specific ethical problem raised at least in theory by a pandemic is the question alluded to previously what if the number of patients stricken increases over time and is more than was initially expectedsuppose respirators are initiated on a small number of patients at first should this treatment be stopped after it has begun if the lives of more patients could be saved as a result of freeing-up these same resources if so how many more patients likely to be saved would this require three times as many ten times as manystopping these respirators to save more patients lives is known as the tiering approach under this approach the criterion for deciding who can receive treatment may become stricter over time as the number of patients infected becomes greater moreover ethically saving the most lives then may mean having to withdraw resources from patients who are stable or even improving 21 should this be donea first question here is as always practical would patients their loved ones andor society accept this if the public receives prior information and education regarding the rationales for this approach it may be that people could more readily accept this if it becomes necessary at some points however people may find such rationing schemes unacceptable even if they previously have been informedit may be though that this need for respirators wouldnt in some circumstances have to come about it may be that volunteers could manually squeeze airbags to breathe for these patients it may take just two volunteers taking turns to accomplish this 22this possibility raises again in this different context the possible relevance of the ethics of carethe national ethics advisory committee neac in new zealand recently in 2006 put forth a document stating its basic ethical aspirations during a pandemic for the publics response 23this document stressed the importance of giving exceptional priority to peoples relationships the neac there in general puts the community first 24the neac would for example send volunteers to rural people to rescue them when necessary it would also send volunteers to peoples houses when they couldnt be reached by phonesit would also seek to make up for past wrongs to a group there called the mori that occurred in a prior pandemic in 1918 it would give this group priority during disasters the ethical principle it would enact here is compensatory justice 26here a support team would also help staff cope with its many demands further since staff would take on greater risks as risking their contracting influenza due to caring for patients treatments for staff would have priority if this occurredpeople would also in this event contact and specially support these care providers families and express their exceptional appreciation of staff taking on this additional risk 2the public would be informed of all this this priority is not however without bounds if other patients needs are significantly greater than those of staff members these other patients needs will prevail 2how finally here would the neac resolve triage conflicts when some can receive medical care but others cant this determination would be made on the basis of who would most benefit and if this cant be determined decided on a random basis those making these decisions would not however discriminate against people with disabilities rather extra support would be provided to those who take on exceptional responsibility for others 2this document states explicitly that policies that are constructed with able people in mind potentially disadvantage those with disabilities thus this document recognizes and acknowledges that especially during a pandemic people with disabilities may be particularly vulnerable to being further disadvantaged by policies unless special consideration is given to avoiding this outcome 2in a pandemic all persons are at risk but those living in more remote areas may have less direct access to treatment as stated they may also though be at less risk of exposure than others thus even though these persons may in this first way be at greater risk their greater relative safety from becoming infected may offset thisthe same amount of resources may then ideally perhaps be initially provided to different places in the same city that have similar population densities one approach to dividing resources after a pandemic begins then is to determine subsequently all these same areas needs on an ongoing regular basis such that if and when there are disparities resources can be shifted from places doing better to those places not doing as wellethically analogously better-off countries should consider other nations that have greater needs these countries may also lack the same means to help themselves as gostin states this really can have devastating consequences for resource-poor countries that cannot compete economically for expensive countermeasures 6the ethically highest road any country can take may be to help other nations even though this is to some degree to the detriment of ones own citizens here the practical limiting factor may be of course what the people in the better-off country will toleratepeople may though be more willing to make such sacrifices if they are better informed here though as with mock hurricane drills there is again a real factor regarding what risks can be anticipated by other countries and what is their likelihood here again the facts and in this case the uncertainty of these facts may be even in theory as important in determining what a better-off country should do as any other factorthere are in the view of gostin an eminent lawyer and ethical authority in this area five major ethical principles that policymakers should particularly take into account when designing policies to be implemented during disasters 7the first principle as noted is utility this principle typically involves saving the greatest number of lives some additional values not based on consequences should possibly prevail an example already considered is the value of justice another is respecting persons as by telling them the truth keeping promises to them and insuring that they are adequately informedan example in another non-disaster context illustrating how important these latter deontological or non-consequence-based values is our present practices when doing research a person cannot be enrolled in a protocol against his or her will since this would violate this persons autonomy despite the possible gain to others likewise it may be also that during disasters some similar dis-utilitarian outcomes should be absolute and built in an example might be an absolute prohibition against active euthanasia another example mirroring the new zealand model might be equally treating people dependent on others this might be done despite its foreseeable result of saving fewer livesthe second principle is to respect peoples dignity as indicated already here though it may be that utilitarian concerns still should prevail even when there is only a threat of great harm to many this precautionary principle holds that there is an obligation to protect populations against reasonably foreseeable threats even under conditions of uncertainty 7 here though there is also an ethical requirement that the least restrictive or least intrusive alternative that will still achieve the same objective should be implemented 7 an example is this during pandemics peoples interest in privacy though important is of only secondary importancethe third principle of utmost importance is that of justice also considered earlier justice requires that the benefits and burdens of public health action be fairly distributed 7 here as an example already discussed people who are poor may have less direct access to acquiring protective medications andor treatments again compensatory practices may be adopted though these too might go against achieving maximal utilitythe fourth principle is what gostin refers to as procedural justice or fairness procedural justice requires a fair and independent hearing for individuals who are subjected to burdensome public health action 7 an example here is that people shouldnt be subject to undergoing personal harm without their having access at some time to making an appeal people during a disaster may for example as stated lose income if they stop work to care for members of their family if this occurs it may be that they should be able to appeal for compensation as on the ground that if they hadnt cared for a family member at this time he or she would have gone without itthe fifth principle which gostin sees as non-negotiable is transparency this principle requires all institutions including government officials and care providers to make decisions in an open and fully accountable manner 7 a foremost rationale for transparency is that if a policy is unfair this requirement allows other people to better review this then as a result practices later can be changed ethically also of course this respects all people maximally by keeping them more fully informedgroups should then be made available to provide these reviews and these groups should be balanced the judgments they make should not reflect of course a tyranny of experts 24care providers must care for their own physical and emotional needs to be able to best care for others their psychological needs are like their patients thus they may be best able to reduce their intensity by attending to such personal physical needs as being warm fed and safe from danger 32 care providers also may fare psychologically better if through planning they are as prepared as they can be and thus gain comfort from this belief 33they should not though try to be heroes because their being too courageous during disasters can actually prevent the providers from being able to do all for their patients howduring disasters care providers often are an overlooked highly stressed group they may be expected to carry on in ideal ways by those whom they treat these ideal ways include for instance their being able to bear being away from their families without worrying their always being good to their patients and their not having the need to express their own worries fear and even despair 33further during disasters care providers may feel it is right and indeed only right for them to help their patients as much as they can 10 thus they may continue to do this even when they themselves need sleep food and time for respitecare providers should for this reason it is advised arrange to have a buddy this buddy can tell those when necessary that they need to stop treating these patients for any or all of these reasons these buddies in turn should have some preparation for serving in this role themselves they should for example be prepared to accept that their asking these care providers to sleep eat and take these times off may result in these care providers at these moments resenting them 10care providers should also as noted not accept taking on potentially conflicting roles such as triaging and treating if possible if they perform these conflicting roles patients may be more likely to perceive them as being more willing to betray their interests by switching back to meeting the needs of the many if these care providers see this as necessary at a later time 34 their greater patients distrust of them may be as stressful as any other factordisasters may pose unique ethical dilemmas care providers analyzing some of these dilemmas prior to their occurring may help suggest ways in which they can be best resolved or at least help prepare them for what may occur policymakers likewise by anticipating these problems may be better able to reduce themthese analyses usually wont though provide right answers rather reasonable persons will still reasonably disagree then what may be important and indeed most important is that these disagreements are decided in a way that many or most see as sound and fairsuch analyses may on some occasions however suggest outcomes that may go against common logic they may suggest for example that care providers triage people during disasters in a less than the most utilitarian way this may involve their not pursuing only the greatest good for the greatest number they may give instead some moral weight to values not based only on consequence such as their respecting patients and treating them justly they may even not give priority to ethical principles at all they rather may give priority to an ethics of careapproximately 20 of children and young people diagnosed with cancer do not survive despite significant medical advances in recent decades12 the majority of deaths are due to the malignancy with some attributable to anti-cancer treatments3 distress from symptoms and suffering during the end-of-life phase can be significant46 impacting on the child and their familys quality of life78 in addition many children and young people who die from cancer continue to have high-intensity treatments towards the end of life910 with nearly half dying in the acute care setting11 despite preferences from the majority of children and their parents for being at home during the end-of-life phase1213palliative care defined by the world health organization who as the active total care of the childs body mind and spirit    that begins when illness is diagnosed and continues regardless of whether or not a child receives treatment directed at the disease14 is recognised as an important component of children and young peoples cancer services1516 in addition and over the last 30 years specialist paediatric palliative care services for children and young people have been developing in many countries including the united states canada united kingdom and across europe17 the english national health service nhs defines specialist paediatric palliative care as a consultant-led multi-professional specialist palliative care team    led by a medical consultant working at paediatric palliative care competency level 416 in practice however the models of providing specialist palliative care vary within and between countries including for example hospital- and community-based teams which support all children with life-limiting conditions18 teams embedded within paediatric oncology departments joint working with or hospice-led provision and specialist nurse-led teams as well as services led by a paediatric palliative care consultant171920even within the developed world the availability referral and uptake of specialist palliative care among children and young people with cancer remains low and variable between and within countries and settings and it is not clear to what extent these services are addressing all aspects of palliative care as defined by who172125 for children with cancer referral to palliative care also often occurs late in the trajectory of illness sometimes only days before death2627 recent systematic reviews suggest that access to specialist palliative care services is associated with improvements in quality of life symptom control perceived support reduced time in hospital less invasive treatment and greater advance care planning192829 however these reviews have aggregated the results for children and young people across conditions and the evidence for those with cancer remains unclear because of conflicting results between individual studies28 and the lack of work exploring condition-specific factors that may influence access to and benefit from specialist palliative care services3031a rigorous review of the evidence on the impacts of specialist paediatric palliative care for children and young people with cancer and their families is both crucial to informing debates within paediatric oncology regarding the positioning and role of these specialist services and for future service development this mixed-methods systematic review synthesises the existing evidence on the benefits drawbacks facilitators and barriers associated with referral to and uptake of specialist paediatric palliative care for children and young people with cancer and their familiesprimary studies of any design eg experimental observational surveys consensus and qualitative studies examining either the impact of or factors affecting specialist paediatric palliative care access for children and young people age 024 years with cancer were included studies of a mixed population were included if 1 the majority of the participants were children and young people with cancer andor 2 data were reported separatelywe defined specialist paediatric palliative care as care provided by multidisciplinary teams or palliative care services which included clinicians eg oncologists paediatricians nurses with paediatric palliative care training or services who self-identified as providing specialist paediatric palliative care we included services delivered in different settings eg inpatient community or home settings and both liaison services eg supporting the childs usual care team and services directly supporting children and their families although broad this reflects the varying provision of specialist palliative care for children within and between different countries and so enabled us to synthesise the evidence about these specialist servicesto understand the different perspectives on referral to specialist palliative care services studies that included the following participant groups were eligible children and young people parents including bereaved other family members and health and social care staff no comparator was requiredwe excluded case studies review articles descriptive theoretical or clinical opinion articles conference abstracts and articles not published in the english language we also restricted the eligibility to studies conducted in high-income countries defined as oecd organisation for economic co-operation and development33 member countries because of the very different healthcare infrastructure and status of specialist paediatric palliative care in developing countries17electronic databases cinahl cochrane database of systematic reviews cdsr embase medline psycinfo were searched on 27 june 2017 from 2000 in line with increasing availability of specialist paediatric palliative care services internationally19 the search strategy consisted of terms and synonyms for malignancies and children and specialist paediatric palliative care see supplementary information appendix a reference lists of included studies and relevant literature reviews were checked and backward and forward citation searching of included studies and pubmed-related articles link searches were undertaken an update search in medline which identified all the eligible studies in the original search was performed on 13 september 2019titles and abstracts were screened in covidence34 and relevant full-text articles were retrieved and independently assessed for eligibility by two reviewers with disagreements resolved via a third reviewer35 reasons for exclusion at full text were recordeddata on study characteristics methods study focus eg impact andor factors affecting access and quantitative outcome data were extracted into microsoft excel using a pre-piloted data extraction template qualitative data including author-reported results direct quotations and results tables were imported into nvivo version 1136 for analysisdata extraction was carried out by one reviewer and checked by a secondthe mixed methods appraisal tool mmat3738 was used to appraise the methodological quality of all included studies mmat comprises two generic screening questions and an additional four criteria for use with specific study designs criterion assessments eg is the sample representative of the population under study are categorised yes no or cant tell an overall quality score of 0 25 50 or 100 based on how many study design specific criterion were met those categorised as yes was calculated for each studythe quality assessment was undertaken independently by two reviewers and informed the synthesis methods and reporting of the review results along with identifying needs for future research we did not exclude studies based on quality assessmentan integrative narrative synthesis was planned drawing on interpretative review methodology39 with thematic analysis as the principal method of synthesis40 the synthesis plan outlined in the protocol32 was modified following an assessment of the potential for aggregation configuration and integration of study findings the final method involved separate syntheses of data reporting the impact of specialist paediatric palliative care and factors affecting access both

studies used the same or potentially overlapping samples as other included studies see figure 2in total data for 7933 children and young people 4289 of whom had received specialist palliative care compared to 3644 who did not were included while the majority n  23 included children and young people with any cancer eight studies concerned children and young people with particular diagnoses or treatments see table 1 for details4456616266676978 overall these 31 studies address diagnoses from infancy to young adulthood with only three studies focused on young adults which included any malignancy545886 five studies included some children and young people with conditions other than cancer6167707388of the 11 studies exploring stakeholder views 3 recruited paediatric oncology staff from single hospitals75778283 and 1 from multiple hospitals7980 1 recruited staff involved in providing palliative care to children with cancer from primary tertiary and community settings76 4 recruited paediatric oncologists via professional organisations65717281 and 1 recruited parent and young person dyads from three hospitals68 in total these studies represented the views of 1133 physicians 986 other healthcare professionals mainly nurses social workers and other staff working in paediatric oncology but also in palliative care and other settings 129 parents and 129 young peoplewe identified five broad service types from the included studies hospital-based palliative care teams with referral triggering an initial consultation465053586164676973757782858788 n  17 hospice services234547555659606586 n  8 home-based services48577090 n  4 integrated oncology services4466 n  2 and an integrated oncology inpatient unit49 n  1 three studies referred to palliative care consultation only435478 and three a palliative care team687981 although it is likely that these were all referring to hospital-based teams of the remaining four studies three included a range of models717289 and one referred to specialist paediatric palliative care explicitly but did not define this76very few studies provided specific details about the team or service providing palliative care in terms of skills mix role and the extent of provision there were also some anomalies between studies for example five studies used hospice discussions or enrolment as an outcome of specialist palliative care4661626490 whereas in other studies hospices were defined as the source of specialist intervention not all studies investigating hospice settings specified the characteristics eg adult vs childrens hospice and it was difficult to determine what home-based services might comprise among the studies exploring stakeholder views three offered only hypothetical models for participants to consider687576 and three focused primarily on views about early integration of specialist palliative care which was defined as close to the time of diagnosis687581only two studies accounted for the timing of the initial palliative care consultenrolment when deciding which children to classify as having received specialist intervention one only included children who had received specialist palliative care for more than 30 days63 and the second for more than 1 day54 a third study which compared early and late interventions included all children receiving specialist palliative care but defined early provision as that received for more than 30 days5253 only two studies explored how the duration of specialist paediatric palliative care exposure affected outcomes6170the quality and reporting of studies varied greatly among the 37 quantitative studies with scores ranging from 0 to 100 see table 2there were concerns about the representativeness of samples in 14 of the quantitative studies due to the single-site design of many studies long study period and inappropriate participant selection or recruitment methods44464851545761626470728689 assessment of representativeness was not possible in another seven studies because of poor reporting66687378818990 in eight studies there were concerns about the comparability of groups eg use of historical cohorts different participant characteristics which were not accounted for in the analysis445051545557586290although inappropriate measures were identified in only three studies50515666 wider concerns about measurement were evident across studies these included how receipt of specialist palliative care was determined eg from day of initial palliative care consultation whether outcomes could be attributed to specialist provision or care from the primary oncology team potential recall problems in studies using bereaved parent-reported outcomes and failure to take account of the chronology of variables for example having a do-not-resuscitate dnr order was a predictor of specialist palliative care in some studies465960 and an outcome in others5458 determining the extent of these limitations was hindered by poor reporting of study methodsthe five qualitative studies75777983 used appropriate methods for sampling data collection and analysis however there were limitations to the transferability of findings due to the single-site design in three studies757783 and for the third the time period elapsed since the study was conducted published in 2001 when specialist paediatric palliative care for children with cancer was at an early stage of development76a total of 17 distinct outcome domains were identified and these were categorised under one of six overarching categories advance care planning n  9 studies end-of-life care provision n  16 location of death n  18 childs quality of life n  6 family support n  3 and service satisfaction n  7 the synthesis of results by category and outcome domain is summarised below and in detail in table 3the outcome domains were of end of life discussions and decisions about attempting resuscitation dnr orders and the timing of these provision of specialist palliative care was found to be associated with an increased likelihood of end-of-life discussions being documented in all six studies that measured this505461626474 with evidence from two studies that these occurred earlier in the childs illness in those receiving specialist palliative care6164 six studies found that dnr orders occurred earlier in care trajectories in those receiving specialist palliative care465455586264 however the evidence about whether a dnr order was more likely was mixed465455616264there was evidence from the seven studies which measured treatment intensity54586163648788 that children who received specialist paediatric palliative care were less likely to receive high-intensity treatments and to spend less time in an intensive care unit icu during the end-of-life phase compared to children who did not receive this there was also evidence from the five studies which assessed hospital admissions either the duration of stay or the number of admissions that children who received specialist palliative care spent less time in the hospital than those who did not4447557090 only one study compared the types of admission here specialist palliative care was only found to decrease the number of planned admissions47 two studies examined the cost of care also focusing on hospital admissions but did not find any significant differences between before and after specialist input70 or between those who received specialist palliative care and those who did not54there was no evidence to suggest that hospice care either enrolment or utilisation changed as a result of specialist involvement from the four studies that explored this46616290 outpatient care90 home-based care57 and preferred location of care51 were each assessed by a single study so no conclusions can be drawn about thesea total of 17 studies examined differences in location of death between children receiving and not receiving specialist palliative care a consistent finding across studies was that children who received this were less likely to die in icu4952545758616484 however studies varied in whether or not they found differences in the proportion of home or hospital deaths464857596062647390 for example the study comparing early and late involvement of a hospital team found that late access children were nearly five times more likely to die in icu than at home or in a hospice but observed no differences in terms of non-icu hospital versus homehospice deaths52 however they did find lower odds of hospital deaths when comparing hospice and no hospice involvement84 just four studies investigated the impact of specialist palliative care on whether children died in theirfamilies preferred location of death48515790 three of which found that congruence between preferred and actual place of death increased with specialist involvement485190this theme included three outcome domains quality of life comfort and symptoms data were primarily from parent-reported measures collected after a child had died two studies measured quality of life but did not use validated measures one found that children receiving specialist paediatric palliative care had more fun and more events adding meaning compared to children not receiving this but found no differences in how afraid or peaceful they felt48 in the second 70 of parents strongly agreed that these specialist services improved their childs quality of life but there was no comparator group66 the study which measured comfort also with no comparator found an increase in comfort levels over time reported by parents but no change reported by children this was the only study that used a child-reported measure67 although three studies suggested that treatment of symptoms increased with specialist involvement577490 there was little evidence that the extent of symptom controlsuffering from physical and emotional symptoms differed between children receiving and not receiving specialist palliative care indeed high levels of suffering from symptoms were described by the four studies which assessed this48576490only three studies investigated whether specialist paediatric palliative care affected provision of support to family members or the impact of that support one study found that use of bereavement support for parents and siblings was more likely if a child had received specialist input62 two studies found that specialist palliative care increased parent preparedness for the end-of-life phase of care6466all seven studies six surveys666769727390 and one qualitative77 assessing this reported high levels of family and professional satisfaction with specialist palliative care with reported benefits including expertise in pain and symptom management time to plan end-of-life care with families and meeting psychosocial and family needs none of these studies included a comparator group although one reported increasing parental satisfaction in line with increasing provision of specialist servicesthe synthesis of studies exploring factors affecting specialist paediatric palliative care access identified four overarching categories each containing several linked themes sociodemographics n  14 studies disease profile n  22 studies end-of-life care characteristics n  18 studies and acceptability of specialist paediatric palliative care n  17 studies the synthesis of results by category and theme are summarised below and presented in detail in table 4multiple quantitative studies which investigated the sociodemographic profile of children andor their families receiving and not receiving specialist palliative care consistently showed that access was not associated with a childs gender47495359616378 or ethnicity454749505359617885 there was mixed evidence about whether a childs age4749505355616378 or the socioeconomic status of their family eg deprivation education47505963718789 influenced access only one or two studies investigated language4659
rurality5563
religion4659 and distance to treatment centre63 so it was difficult to draw conclusions about these factors just two of the studies exploring staff attitudes assessed sociodemographic factors focusing on lack of insurance coverage7189 the majority of participants in both studies did not view this as a barrier to referralout of 12 studies examining type of cancer 10 found that children with solid tumours were more likely to receive specialist palliative care than children with haematological malignancies4647495053555961637886 six studies investigated whether disease status eg prognosis relapse was associated with access no consistency was found across these with some studies reporting conflicting results464950545561 in contrast all the studies investigating staff-reported practices consistently identified children with a poor prognosis as those most likely to be referred657172757779818389 staff in two studies believed that this could result in referrals that were too late for children to benefit from specialist input7179uncertainty about a childs prognosis and about the benefits of introducing specialist palliative care earlier in the disease trajectory eg around diagnosis were identified as key barriers to a timely referral6571757779818389 although non-physician professionals7581 and families68 were more receptive to early integration than physicians automatic referral triggers were used by the majority of providers in one study however in line with reported practice most encouraged referrals for children during the end-of-life phase of care71the end-of-life care provided to children was found to influence whether or not children received specialist palliative care four studies consistently found that advance care planning eg documented advance directives or dnrs hospice referrals was associated with an increased likelihood of specialist involvement or earlier compared to late involvement46535559 provision of palliative care by the oncology team we already do palliative care was also reported by oncology staff to influence referral practices6571727579 and to impede oncologists abilities and willingness to identify needs for specialist input in their patients and practice something that was reported to encourage referrals65717275777989 similarly young people were more likely to accept specialist input if they had specific unmet needs for example pain and poor quality of life68 although staff in one study were concerned that parents might not discuss their childs palliative care needs during active treatment81there was conflicting evidence about whether treatment intensity eg phase 1 trial enrolment influenced access to specialist palliative care434650535661 and this mirrored varying beliefs among oncology staff and families about whether children receiving active treatments should or could be referred6568717275staff acceptability of specialist palliative care was reported to influence access in 16 studies family acceptability was identified in 13 although families views were sought in only three of these6769 eight studies measured intervention uptake to explore acceptability2346616367698990 these reported varying rates of referral and uptake of specialist palliative care but provided evidence of increasing involvement over timestaff uncertainties about the benefits of specialist palliative care and about how a specialist service differs from care provided within oncology the added value of specialist paediatric palliative care were identified as key barriers to referral68757779818389 concerns that bringing in a new team could undermine continuity of care and impact on relationships with families were also reported to influence referral practices687275777989 as were perceptions about availability and capacity of specialist palliative care services perceived availability657172staff in eight studies identified the association of palliative care with end of life what specialist paediatric palliative care symbolises as a barrier to access72757779818389 a clinicians emotion about a family and their readiness to accept a childs prognosis and discuss this were identified as additional challenges757779818389 and contributed to what was described as the emotional labour associated with introducing a service which staff participants referred to as death nurses76 the death team77 and the death squad75 a perception that oncologists need to control patient care clinical ownership was identified as a further barrier to specialist palliative care referral and could deter others involved in a childs care from recommending this for a family75818389oncology staff reported that family readiness75778183 and family resistance6571727989 could affect access although views on this varied for example 60 of paediatric oncologist respondents in one survey believed that their patients had negative perceptions of specialist palliative care but very few 4 reported that patients refused a referral72 in another study only 38 of staff participants identified family resistance as a barrier89 and the study that explored young people and parents attitudes found mainly positive views and very few participants 2 and 8 respectively believed that referral was associated with the loss of hope for a cure68 which was a fear commonly reported by staff727577798389this systematic review found evidence that children and young people with cancer who receive specialist paediatric palliative care are more likely to be engaged in advance care planning receive less intensive care at the end of life and are less likely to die in hospital compared to those who do not receive this some of the included studies also indicate that these differences may be more marked when children receive specialist input for a longer duration before they die the review did not find that receipt of specialist palliative care is associated with improved quality of life or symptom control however no conclusions can be drawn because of the significant methodological limitations of the seven studies investigating this485758646667 importantly only one study sought young peoples views about the impact of these specialist services across the 28 studies which examined this and this was a feasibility study with no comparator group67the review also found that the type of cancer and whether or not paediatric oncology teams themselves engage in palliative care practices may affect access to specialist palliative care services thus studies reported fewer children with haematological malignancies receiving specialist palliative care and involvement more likely where the oncology team were proactively addressing palliative care needs eg evidence of advance care planning there was no indication from the studies included about why children with certain cancers are less likely to receive specialist palliative care and a recent review of barriers to access did not explore this31 evidence from adult cancer91 indicates that the remitting and relapsing trajectories of haematological malignancies a more aggressive approach to treatment and greater difficulties predicting prognosis may contribute to the observed inequity of specialist palliative care involvement92 evidence from our review regarding clinician uncertainty about when to involve specialist palliative care combined with the commonly reported practice of referring children with a poor prognosis27 suggests this might be the caseclinicians views regarding the need for specialist palliative care input for their patients and their acceptability of specialist palliative care services were also consistently reported as affecting referral practices more specifically views on how these specialist services differ to palliative care provided by the oncology team perceived drawbacks associated with involving a new team readiness to accept a change in prognosis and the negative connotations associated with the term palliative care were identified as barriers to referral concerns among clinicians about how families might react to the offer of a referral was a common theme in several studies and although the study that explored young people and parents views runs counter to this wider work on this issue reports mixed opinions among young people9394 and parents7374 about palliative care and how this should be introduced9596this review is the first to systematically synthesise the available evidence about specialist paediatric palliative care for children and young people with cancer strengths of the review include a published protocol robust search independent screening and data extraction by two reviewers and the use of appropriate mixed-methods techniques to synthesise the results there are however limitations in the conclusions which can be drawn from this review due to the heterogeneity of study populations and interventions this and the substantial risk of potential bias identified in some of the studies and inconsistency of measurement across studies meant it was inappropriate to aggregate the results statistically or to compare results between the different approaches to providing specialist palliative care in addition the descriptions of specialist services and the palliative care provided by oncology teams were typically very poor making interpretation of the differences between these challengingour finding that end-of-life care is different for those who receive specialist paediatric palliative care compared to those who do not broadly aligns with three recent reviews about children with all life-limiting conditions192829 two of these reviews1929 concluded that specialist intervention appears to offer benefit in terms of improved quality of life by focusing only on children and young people with cancer our review highlights the lack of robust evidence pertaining to both quality of life and symptom burden in this population although the broader literature implies that other differences we observed such as reduced hospital stays and more advance care planning are indicative of better care63 there is no evidence that these changes in the delivery of care reflect family preferences485157 or lead to reduced symptom burden which studies continue to show is significant for children with cancer59097the integration of findings from evaluation studies and those which have explored factors affecting access tells us that while end-of-life care may be different for children who receive specialist palliative care children who receive this are also different to those who do not particularly in terms of their disease profile and care processes synthesis of the qualitative studies go some way to explaining these differences highlighting in particular the central role of clinicians emotions beliefs and attitudes in shaping referral practices and the ongoing uncertainty about when to initiate palliative care and whether this should be provided by a specialist service or the oncology team it also reveals that in practice decisions and discussions about no longer pursuing curative treatments and introducing specialist palliative care go hand in hand and that families who are comfortable discussing an uncertain future or families cared for by clinicians who have this confidence may be more likely to receive specialist palliative care757783interventions that support clinicians to initiate palliative care with families and improve clinical acceptability of specialist palliative care services therefore offer the potential to address these key barriers to access8298 although there are various initiatives to support the delivery of palliative care within oncology services eg palliative care training99100 communication tools101102 early integration models266769 we know very little about whether these are being implemented in practice and how they might influence referral to specialist palliative care there is also little available evidence about whether families play an active role in the initiation of palliative care or whether clinicians concerns about how families will respond to a referral are warranted68future research should therefore investigate the effectiveness delivery and acceptability of the different models of delivering palliative care for children and young people with cancer particularly outside of north america future research also needs to examine factors affecting uptake from families perspectives and to explore the role of socioeconomic factors this conclusion is supported by the recent priority setting partnership results for teenagers and young adults with cancer103 which includes how best to support young people who have incurable cancer and their families in order to undertake this research we must first determine what outcomes are the most important to measure and develop appropriate tools to measure them104107 development of a core outcome set would meet this requirement108 this too will need to include the views of children and young people and their families particularly if we are to address the methodological challenges that continue to affect the quality of research in this area and the lack of evidence about whether specialist paediatric palliative care improves quality of life for children and their familiesin south africa with over 2000 total covid-19 cases and 25 deaths at the time of writing it is important to reflect on the intersections between the biomedicine of the novel coronavirus and its sociopolitical manifestations while sars-cov-2 is clearly a biological phenomenon that clinicians and researchers are learning more and more about each day we also observe that the disease plays out differently in different bodies and in different socialpolitical realities no two people and no two countries are living and dying from covid-19 in exactly the same way while there are common threads of pathophysiology and constraints of health-care systems the illness experiences of individuals families communities and countries are unique based on underlying contextual factors that are embedded in culture economics politics and philosophy as clinicians what can we learn from such observations how can south africa benefit from analysing what has happened in countries that are ahead of us in viral spread is it possible to avert a future imperfect in our context that is already fraught with social upheavals and inequity what will a post-covid-19 health-care workforce look like these questions and others probably keep many of us up at night with good reason as we struggle to plan for meaningful interventions what social considerations need to be kept in mindin the past month vast amounts have been written capturing the south african experience of the sars-cov-2 adenovirus that causes covid-19 disease from the social distancing necessary to reduce the speed of transmission and flatten the curve to buying essential goods for the duration of a communal lockdown to the suffering endured by not consuming alcohol and tobacco to reports about the personal and collective economic costs to the nightly release of case statistics by geographical region to the biographies of those who have died we have amassed a hefty repository of pandemic stories that are intended to reveal a shared humanity and promote common cause yet there is something that should niggle at us a discomfort as we begin to realise that apart from the similarities there are also major divergences in our narratives while transmission is the same for everyone droplet spread vs aerosolisation which only occurs during invasive medical procedures we are told that the expression of symptoms can range from completely sub-clinical to severe respiratory failure and death biomedically these differences are accounted for by age andor other comorbidities in his daily broadcasts minister of health dr zweli mkhize reassuringly informs the public that those who have died so far would have died anyway from their co-morbid conditions those with hypertension diabetes obesity chronic obstructive lung disease end-stage cancer underlying immunosuppression and the elderly with the exception of two people under age 501 by implying that covid-19 was simply an added insult to an already-compromised human he attempts to avoid panic by explaining that these people were already sick he acknowledges that while the loss to each family is significant the loss to the collective should be mitigated by this understanding how true is this however it is certainly a more palatable explanation for the mounting death toll weakened constitutions people battling to stay alive anyway a necessary culling of the herdindividual bodies live in communities with histories these reveal the complex and less visible web of a persons or a communitys inherent sociopolitical vulnerabilities that emerge as risk factors for poorer health outcomes increasingly it appears that someones positionality on the uneven playing field of life will determine her prognosis in addition to biological factors for covid-1923 although there are well-established links between social positionality and the bodys ability to mount an effective immunological response the exact mechanism of these interactions remains elusive45 in the united states we observe relationships between zip code race and death from covid-19 such as in new york city where latinx people those with latin american cultural or ethnic identity in the united states make up 29 of the population but account for 34 of the death rate a difference also seen with black new yorkers 24 of the population and 28 of the deaths6 there is speculation that poorer access to the advanced technologies for heroic life-saving interventions was the reason however there is a growing body of evidence pointing to the intersectional stressors of living with inequality racism classism marginalisation or being othered that act at a cellular level even in the presence of adequate medical care2this interplay between inherited and acquired vulnerability works its way into an embodied expression of disease at a granular level however there are ways to conceptualise some of the social and structural forces that increase risk such as power and privilege and simultaneously silence the expression and visibility of such suffering7 paul farmer points out structural violence is one way of describing social arrangements that put individuals and populations in harms way  the arrangements are structural because they are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world they are violent because they cause injury to people  neither culture nor pure individual will is at fault rather historically given and often economically driven processes and forces conspire to constrain individual agency8 unlike the direct police violence resulting in the marikana massacre or the brutal rape and murder of uct student uyinene mrwetyana structural violence is often invisible and has been likened to the unseen mass that lies beneath the tip of every iceberg exerting its influence by creating unequal life chances structural violence is viewed as simply the way the world works the natural order of things entrenched power has become so normalised that it is often difficult to fathom where and how the injury came aboutreflecting a recent episode of structural violence in our own health-care context the life esidimeni tragedy comes to mind as well intentioned as psychiatric deinstitutionalisation is in theory economic expediency and a callous disregard for human life trumped professional ethics and the right to dignity at least 144 people died from hunger starvation hypothermia and neglect following the ill-conceived transfer of long-term mental health patients to community-based non-governmental organisations that were not equipped to care for them what is striking about this disaster however is the role of those in the gauteng department of health who foresaw nothing unusual or turned a blind eye to possible pitfalls while executing the deinstitutionalisation plan when reading out the findings from evidence presented to the arbitration commission he chaired retired deputy chief justice dikgang moseneke commented about the sheer lack of official accountability for the life esidimeni tragedy senior provincial heath officials had lied played the victim abused their power and knowingly violated the rights of mentally ill patients and their families because the instruction had come from above9 given that those who were directly responsible for the plan have not yet faced criminal prosecution it remains whether this incident will be seen as a catastrophe of inordinate proportions or as a massive injustice perpetrated by particular individuals who benefittedthe late political theorist and legal philosopher judith shklar in her book the faces of injustice posits how accountability is apportioned according to how an incident is framed if one interprets what has occurred as a misfortune or rather as an injustice there is an important distinction between whether and how accountability can be attributed although people suffer either way the depersonification of responsibility for that suffering in the case of a misfortune  a tsunami landslide tornado or other natural disaster  assumes that it is the invisible hand of fate at fault according to shklar however a calamity is rarely neutral scratch deeply enough and there will be an injustice where someone or something has behaved with culpability10 returning to our current crisis of covid-19 we actually have a choice in how our own responses will be judged by history like famine pandemics can either be mitigated or exacerbated by the political leadership and the decisions they make11 in fact as many have argued the root causes of mass starvation are wholly human-made12 although extreme weather events such as drought or flooding or a scourge of locusts or other blight may destroy food crops theorists of the politics of famine argue that it is human beings who first determine their degree of responsiveness to climate change that actually results in such natural disasters and after the nature and extent of food distribution that has been banked for emergencies often privileging one group over another as food becomes weaponisedthe national department of health in its covid-19 infection prevention and control guidelines for south africa states an obvious truth about combatting the spread of the virus in our particular situation south africa has a unique challenge of a large vulnerable immunocompromised population living in overcrowded conditions13 over the past 26 years prior to being hit by the sars-cov-2 virus this is a frank admission that we have been sluggish in our duty to address the needs of the masses despite constitutionally enshrined guarantees to housing sanitation nutrition education recreation gender equity and protection of those most vulnerable progress on these fronts has been achingly slow while pandemics are the ultimate litmus test of a nations health system the social determinants of health have never been more meaningful in our context the minister of health dr zweli mkhize made it clear at this point  this is collaborative work we did say that to defeat covid-19 its no longer an issue of a nurse and a doctor its actually about societyabout going into a combat zone to fight this infection14 attention to the social determinants of health those underlying predictors of life and death should give us pause to realise that no amount of ventilators and hospital beds can in fact stem the ravages of a virus that only knows a single pathway that of vulnerability we have ignored engaging with them at our perilstats sa data from 20142015 indicate that almost half of the adult population men and women over age 18 were living below the upper bound poverty line the cut-off point at which there is just enough money for basic nutrition and other essential non-food items such as soap clothing and sanitary pads15 in 2019 that amount was r1227 per person per month with women experiencing 6 higher rates of poverty 52 than men16 as regards changes in housing value over a 10 year period the statistics are also grim more than half of south african households headed by black africans lived in dwellings that were valued at less than r50 000  in contrast most households headed by indiansasians and whites lived in properties valued at r400 000 or more17 in terms of both the number of rooms in these dwellings  and by implication size  there has been a shift between 2002 and 2014 towards more rooms in formal dwellings and changes from multiple rooms in informal housing to one to two rooms italics added for emphasis17 in another report released by stats sa in february 2020 explaining income inequality there is the stark finding that the poorest 60 of south african households are now relying more on social grants than paid employment to attain overall household income this intervention prevents an even greater income inequality gap between the bottom and top deciles18 despite this attempt at economic stabilisation the divide between rich and poor is so wide that south africa carries the dubious honour of being the longest running most unequal country on the planet from 200619 now it seems we must pay the price as the virus threatens to run its course along the fault lines of poverty and inequitytherefore adherence to world health organisation directives like social distancing is impossible for large swaths of south africans who through no fault of their own lack the necessary infrastructure for such adherence in an ironic twist a resident of a rural community in mpumalanga expressed his thanks to the coronavirus for water commenting on the installation of six boreholes with running taps and six 10000 litre water tanks in the space of a week after years of waiting for access to fresh water another resident pointed out that although they government had promised us water a long time ago  now that we have this virus we see fast delivery20 ongoing service delivery protests bear testament that in other parts of the country after decades of neglect improving access to water and sanitation has not been as successfulsimilarly sheltering in place takes on new meaning across the inequality divide given the challenge highlighted by stat sa 2014 in that 14 of the countrys population live in informal dwellings corresponding to 8 million people21 physical distancing in such conditions becomes next to impossible there are substantive differences in self-isolating with a fridge and freezer full of food opportunities for recreation on ones own lawn or swimming pool or tennis court versus the informality and overcrowding that are daily realities for much of the population in the early days of the lockdown we recall the images of law enforcement officials acting with zealousness to confine people to their shacks as the bbc reported the police and army have at times acted with thuggish abandon in their attempts to enforce the  lockdown humiliating beating and even shooting civilians on the streets of the commercial capital johannesburg and elsewhere22 similar reports from front-line colleagues providing primary medical care in the townships expressed exasperation that the mall in ebony park remained open or that it was business as usual with informal traders and food vendors in daveyton23despite application of the siracusa principles see table 1 during the declaration of a national disaster to ensure that any limitations of human rights are the least restrictive possible and affect all members of the population without discrimination is it really possible to apply these principles equally if we live in such an inequitable society these principles are not explicitly discriminatory against the poor yet the lockdown disproportionately affects low-wage workers in precarious employment during and after the 5-week lockdown the consequences of staying home are substantively different on the one hand for a person with no guarantee of sustainable income or paid sick leave and on the other for a person with job security or a stable business can we blame the population for wanting to leave their overcrowded homes and travel to the local clinics during the lockdown to consult on previously neglected health matters can we blame a parent who because of lockdown is not working at her usual three jobs and sees it as an opportunity to catch up on delayed immunisations for children to extract a tooth that has been bothersome for months or to pass by for a social visit with the staff or other patients the experiences of confinement and boredom are psychological for those of us with adequate housing in the townships and informal settlements these experiences are spatial and material davis and others have described such toxic urban environments as  a dumping ground for a surplus population working in unskilled unprotected and low-wage informal service industries and trade26 in such contexts does the restriction of rights to freedom of movement and employment carry the same meaning or intentionthe current national debates about whether to extend the lockdown and for how long reveal the tensions between competing agendas although few people are explicit about the trade-offs in terms of lives worth sacrificing as opposed to lives worth preserving experts speak as if we inherently share the same belief that some lives are more precious or at least worth saving than others further signalling the contingencies that will sway the balance between human life and the survival of the economy is the personification of corporations and businesses how long can the engines of industry remain moribund without suffering terminal complications the flip side of this however is that there have been some very brave public health-motivated decisions taken by president cyril ramaphosa and his cabinet to regulate industry and repurpose manufacturing to address the pandemic although the combat zone war metaphor may be problematic it invokes powers for the executive to act in ways that place health at the centre of a societal agenda something that we have not seen during peacetime it opens up certain possibilities that are at odds with getting back to normal such as the mining industry is keen to do27 embedded in this calculus is what number of human beings can be forfeited to get the stock exchange up and running again  so that the poor can get back to work and not starve because without employment and in the absence of a meaningful social safety net they will die anyway we are told that actuarial scientists are key to resolving these equations presumably relying on a common understanding of what utilitarianism means in our context while it is acknowledged that we will all take a hit certain among us must pay with our lives as well as our purseso what will be our levels of complicity with managing these surplus people those who in the best of times die from falling into a pit latrine or a delayed cancer diagnosis or at the hands of a violent partner or from a gang rape for being queer in conversations with gauteng colleagues regarding their role in the covid-19 pandemic they recall the trauma of working or training in apartheid-era segregated hospitals or wards with woefully inadequate resources and security police monitoring or the overwhelming helplessness in the pre-antiretroviral days when aids patients lay dying on stretchers everywhere other colleagues are more in tune with the fluidity of this crisis well we are rationing all the time which is probably a more honest appraisal of the resource constraints structural violence we have come to accept as a normal condition of practising in south africas public health sector in the 21st century whether we support national health insurance as the realisation of universal health coverage or not we are now confronted with a number of questions that will determine our post-pandemic future what is our appetite as clinicians to tackle these underlying sociopolitical issues recognising their inexorable links to the current best medical and scientific management of covid-19 it is not a one or another choice traditionally clinicians have been averse to engaging in such issues because they are not regarded as purely medical but rather political something that i have written extensively about in the past yet these are exceptional and truly ominous timesin thinking about what instructs and informs physician advocacy we can turn to various guidelines first the world medical association statement on patient advocacy and confidentiality advises medical practitioners have an ethical duty and a professional responsibility to act in the best interests of their patients this duty includes advocating for patients both as a group such as advocating on public health issues and as individuals28 italics added for emphasis the canmeds health advocate role adopted by the health professions council of south africa states as health advocates physicians contribute their expertise and influence as they work with communities or patient populations to improve health they work with those they serve to determine and understand needs speak on behalf of others when required and support the mobilization of resources to effect change29 italics added for emphasisinherent in these professional statements is a divide between the doctor and the patient or community which recognises both the power differential and a need for therapeutic distancing that is purported to allow objectivity and reason to prevail this divide also confers an element of safety a recognition that doctor and patient are not in the same boat at least not in that exact moment covid-19 has changed that equation now it is not safe to be caring for patients with sars-cov-2 especially in an environment where access to appropriate personal protective equipment may be restricted st augustines hospital in durban is closed indefinitely due to an outbreak of covid-19 at the facility where 48 nurses and 16 patients who tested positive are being kept in quarantine30 the media coverage of both famous and ordinary doctors from around the world who have died in the line of duty caring for covid-19 patients makes us question our own mortality and realise that in this instance nothing separates us from our patients really except if fortunate a medical or n95 mask even the retreat to the sanctuary of our own homes is fraught with the risk of unwittingly bringing the virus trojan horse-like into our most sacred of spaces patients are us we are them yet not reallythe repercussions of the pandemic will exact a high toll on our collective psyche and on the publics trust in medicine nursing and the health-care system clinicians can choose to exhibit leadership in opening up difficult conversations that frame a set of questions about the value of life in principle and about the underlying and obvious value chains of who deserves human rights we can advise on how to get people to stay home by giving them the resources to make that possible or we can usher in a police state that will further violently punish poor people for existing while we do nothing to help stop the spread of the virus community engagement public education housing and financial support are required to help people practise physical distancing our treatment armamentarium for covid-19 needs to expand if we have a hope of coming through this alivethis perspective piece describes how policymakers should consider inequalities as potential long-term consequences of the current coronavirus epidemic in addition to health and economic costs governments and the international community should consider the repercussions of their mitigation and suppression measures as they might deepen inequalities between the developing and developed world poor and rich within societies women and men and vulnerable populations this is a call to action for more coordinated efforts at the international level that does not turn a blind eye on this aspect of the pandemicthe developed world is facing an unprecedented epidemic of a novel pathogen covid-19 worldwide more than 14 million confirmed cases and 83 000 deaths have been recorded as of april 8 2020 1 currently developed countries including the united states of america italy spain france and germany are the epicenter of this virus as an increasing number of african and south-east asian countries have started seeing their first cases the global south is preparing for the epidemic to hitgovernments around the world are acting to reduce the reproduction number r0 the average number of new infections caused by each infected person below one and flatten the curve of the contagion mitigation and suppression measures include closing borders closing schools case isolation of symptomatic individuals and their contacts social distancing and widescale lockdowns of populations 2 by observing how developed economies are struggling to contain this infectious disease governments in less developed countries are implementing similar measures rwanda was the first country in africa to impose a lockdown on march 21 2020 when 11 cases were recorded zimbabwe followed with a 21-day lockdown on march 23 2020 when it only had 2 cases india issued a 21-day lockdown for the countrys 13 billion people on march 24 2020 as more than 400 cases were recorded south africa lesotho and uganda imposed lockdowns on march 26 march 28 and april 1 2020 respectively sierra leone even announced a year-long state of emergency despite no confirmed coronavirus unfortunately despite early actions the coronavirus outbreak is expected to threaten disproportionately the economies of already impoverished countries both in terms of the disease burden and in terms of social and economic damagescountries in the developing world have already experienced and survived other crises which deteriorated their economies among others west africa and the drc were hit by ebola in 2014-2016 and 2018-2020 respectively mozambique was affected by cyclone idai in 2019 and billions of desert locusts swarmed somalia ethiopia and kenya earlier this year conflicts such as the recent rohingya crisis in northern myanmar forced the displacement of millions of people however nothing seems to be on the scale of what is expected for covid-19 3 which is projected to have worse consequences in developing countriessince poorer economies have limited financial resources and weaker health systems with insufficient health workforce and testing capacity leaders are acting quickly to try to save lives yet the economic consequences of these measures might devastate their economies even further take india for example where still 60 of the population lives below the world banks median poverty line the shutdown order sparked mass migration of workers who were forced to walk hundreds of miles to their home villages after public transport was suspended in kenya where president kenyatta ordered milder measures to slow the coronavirus outbreak informal laborers who account for more than 80 percent of the total workforce are left without jobs more generally in developing countries most of the communities do not have access to clean water let alone soap additionally as individuals mostly rely on their daily income to put food on the table they are facing the hard choice to either go to work with a chance of getting the virus or assured starvation if they stay at home there is a concrete risk that people will die of hunger before the curve will flatten 4among the consequences of the coronavirus outbreak in developing economies something else to consider is how the epidemic could ramp up inequality first poorer countries are likely to be hit harder than rich countries due to poor infrastructure and lack of resources which will hamper public health efforts this will widen inequality between the developed and developing world second both in the developed and developing world inequality in the societies are expected to widen as well poorer workers relying on daily income will be the most affected as they are at a greater risk of losing their jobs another inequality that is expected to increase relates to gender as 70 of women are health workers and women do more than three-quarters of all unpaid care work 5 women will be the more affected by the crisis compared to men 6 finally some measures like social distancing as well as the availability of clean water remain impossible for people in conflict zones and refugee camps or migrants coronavirus could further widen inequality among these vulnerable populations 7after the ebola outbreak in west africa one of biggest epidemics to occur in recent history the international community was criticized for its failure to warn the world in time and for the slow and inadequate response 8 the world bank set up a pandemic emergency financing facility pef  a financing mechanism designed to quickly release funds to the worlds poorest countries and agencies to mitigate the humanitarian and economic consequences of cross-border large-scale outbreaks the pef helped release funding for the 2018-2020 drc ebola outbreak but its design is currently highly criticized for the complex payout criteria which does not allow the release of funding in response to the coronavirus outbreak only two outbreaks since 2006 would have met the criteria to activate pefs insurance payments with pef remaining inflexible or too slow to meet its aim of preventing disease outbreaks from becoming pandemics 9as a result international agencies are now considering acting for developing countries in other ways the world bank group just approved a us 19 billion fast-track package to strengthen the covid-19 response in the developing world and shorten the time to recovery 10 economists and global health experts have called on g20 leaders to provide financial support to poorer countries for their health systems and economies others believe that relieving poorest countries from debt will help them better manage health and economic impacts of the coronavirus as the developed countries are focused on getting stimulus packages approved for their economy some poorer countries are thinking of doing the same indias finance ministry just announced a us22 billion economic stimulus package that will include delivering grains and lentil rations for three months to 60 percent of the population still not all developing countries will have the resources to do thatthere is still an urgent need for action to help mitigating the impact of the coronavirus epidemic in less developed countries as those economies with few recorded cases are already feeling the consequences of the contagion this is a call to coordinated efforts at the international level the response should reach those most vulnerable not only to mitigate the health and economic costs of the virus but more importantly to limit the widening of inequality worldwidethe world health organization who officially declared the sars-cov-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 and a global pandemic on march 11 2020 countries were urged by who to adopt strict social distancing and quarantine measures to avoid virus spread and to protect public health 1 despite fragmented international efforts to contain the spread sars-cov2 has spread to 213 countries resulting in more than 5 million cases and deaths approaching 400000 since its formal identification in wuhan china in december 2019

pestilence is in fact very common but we find it hard to believe in a pestilence when it descends upon us there have been as many plagues as wars in history yet always plagues and wars take people equally by surprise
- albert camus the plaguehow quickly it hit us  this is one of the most common sentiments about the covid-19 pandemic we were all caught off guard in one way or another in an instant an obscure outbreak of pneumonia in an exotic foreign locale - in the next a viral outbreak jumping from china to the heart of italy then to all of europe on to america - finally a plague that stopped the world as the pandemic hit all countries of the globe it became indisputably clear that everyone was connected - united against a viral scourge 2despite the shock there were plenty of warning signs since the beginning of the 21st century recurring outbreaks and epidemics presaged what was coming - there was the first sars outbreak in 2003 h1n1 influenza pandemic in 2009 mers coronavirus in 2011 ebola in 2014-16 mosquito-borne zika in 2016 a collage of news magazines

international cooperation and a unified strategy of pandemic preparedness were not a priority in the end there was no united response - a global leadership void painfully revealed at a moment when it was most needed what resulted was an international cacophony of last moment efforts strategies and opinions to suppress the viral pandemic - after it was already upon the world
i have no idea whats awaiting me or what will happen when this all ends for the moment i know this there are sick people and they need curing
in order to tackle the covid-19 crisis an unparalleled international scientific response has been launched with the goal to understand viral genetics immunopathogenesis and therapeutic strategies public and private funders across the globe have launched an unprecedented number of initiatives to support multidisciplinary projects addressing the detection treatment and prevention of sars-cov2 infections most of the calls encourage collaboration between international scientists industry healthcare community and government policy makers to facilitate a well-integrated covid-19 response the dramatic effects of covid-19 outbreak taught us that similar pandemics cannot be managed solely at the national level for this reason alliances consortia and networks have emerged in almost every continent to connect experts in different research areas of fundamental science clinical trials social and behavioural sciences engineering and bioinformatics 3in the same context it has been remarkable how research groups and companies from all over the world have been repurposing equipment facilities and product lines in a joint effort for a rapid response against the ongoing pandemic companies that were once producing perfume switched gears to production of much-needed hand sanitizers and disinfectants industrial companies switched into making face masks which were in short supply in many countries and automotive companies started evaluating the possibilities for production of medical devices such as ventilators scientists in non-virology research fields who were required to halt their research indefinitely due to the lockdowns turned their laboratories into diagnostic testing facilities for sars-cov-2 and organized into volunteer groups to help researchers on the front lines with their skills and expertise 4567this pandemic has also brought to light the importance of open science data-sharing and new means of communication among members of the scientific community 78910 numerous data sets are available publicly alongside literature reviews and preprint articles in bioarxiv and medarxiv portals this openness has resulted in a massive amount of information spreading swiftly which is an important driving force moving covid-19 research forward in a short time of course such openness comes with a cost the surge of preprints available in bioarxiv and medarxiv has made it harder to keep up with the screening process of articles to be published in the preprint repositories this also applies to peer reviewing processes and there is an increasing concern that the quality of articles published in journals might suddenly be low and even the rapid peer-reviewing efforts will not solve the problem more than ever before information needs to be scrutinized before going public to avoid the danger of inaccuracies misinformation or even conspiracy theories of course such scrutiny can also result in bottlenecks that will slow down the spread of new datasets and results at a time when they are most needed such a situation is unprecedented as no other pandemic in human history has been tackled in this way many scientists all over the world welcome this new form of communication and data-sharing and believe that eventually there will be a balance between good-quality information spreading quicker versus perfect-quality information that is unavailable until much later 8the eu joined forces to coordinate a common response against the coronavirus pandemic on 30th january 2020 when the pandemic was not declared yet european commission mobilized a budget of 10 million for research that was subsequently increased to 475 million 11 later on the innovative medicines initiative imi a partnership between the european commission and the pharmaceutical industry invested a total of 90  million for research proposals to combat the covid-19 emergency 12 during the coronavirus global response pledging event organized by the eu together with who may 4th 74 billion was raised from donors worldwide to be used for developing producing and deploying a vaccine for all the european commission president von der leyen said 13 in the uk government invested 20 million to fund new studies against coronavirus including studies to sequence the different virus isolates as a tool to understand virus behaviour mutation frequency virus spread and emergence of new strains 1415 other eu projects will collect data on hospitalized patients to investigate transmission of the disease and to test successful therapiespart of these funds will be also used to allow the rapid large scale production of a vaccine with more than 100 research laboratories conducting vaccine development research and with eight vaccine candidates already moving to clinal trials the race to develop an effective prophylactic vaccine is on 1622 since the biotech firm moderna announced plans to launch vaccine trials in humans the us government has invested 483 million to scale up that companys vaccine production 17 meanwhile the national institutes of health nih together with other government organizations and biotech companies set up a partnership to coordinate efforts against the covid-19 pandemic giving priority to the development of an efficient vaccine and therapeutic drugs 18 days ago moderna announced the results of a small eight-person phase i trial of their spike mrna vaccine candidate and the preliminary results indicate that all subjects developed antibodies even at the lowest dose of inoculum 19 encouraging the company to proceed with a phase ii clinical trial that will involve 600 participants however scientists are cautious over the successes of such vaccine candidates since the levels of the immune response needed to grant protection against sars-cov-2 are not yet well understood 8european biotech companies are also working to develop a potential covid-19 vaccine in germany biontech has designed four vaccine candidates that deliver mrna encoding four different viral antigens 20 reithera in rome leukocare in munich and univercells in brussels have announced the creation of a european consortium that will start the clinical trials of a covid-19 vaccine the two pharma giants sanofi and gsk have recently started a collaboration finalized to the development of an adjuvanted covid-19 vaccine 21
22to contribute to the pandemic effort the covid-19 high performance computing hpc consortium demonstrates cooperation amongst global high tech giants google microsoft amazon and ibm the hpc consortium offers services resources and expertise to support molecular modelling projects as the simulation of sars-cov2 entering in a host cell the high throughput screening of drug candidates and the evaluation of patients genomic features with prognostic values 23the public lacked in short standards of comparison it was only as time passed and the steady rise in the death-rate could not be ignored that public opinion became alive to the truth
a europe as the pandemic spread throughout the world countries took drastic measures to protect their citizens these measures focused on achieving a fragile balance between limiting virus spread from person to person and maintaining economic activity it was an impossible balance although the timing of the implementation of these measures proved to be crucial both for public health and sars-cov2 spread as well as the economic impact on each country early lockdown and strict enforcement were the most effective strategies available to limit virus spread 2425 in an accompanying article in this issue olagnier  mogensen describe the implementation of lockdown procedures in denmark a country with a remarkably rapid and effective response the trilogy - social distance personal hygiene protective mask  became the mantra throughout europe and the world follow the spread of covid-19 in a worldwide cases timeline fig 2
httpswwwworldometerinfocoronavirusworldwide-graphsworking in close cooperation with the who and eu member states the european union took clear strict measures based on the best available scientific expertise some member countries faced a significantly limited availability of personal protective equipment ppe and the public health systems came close to collapse from the ever-increasing number of severe cases requiring emergency intensive care and ventilation 26 in some cases medical equipment destined for other countries was confiscated 27 on the 20th of march the eu announced a funding scheme of 13 billion euro for bulk purchase of ppe 28 unfortunately the uk missed the opportunity to join that funding scheme 29in europe health systems adapted to the crisis by mobilizing staff increasing pharmaceutical spending on vaccine development and optimizing space with the aim to increase the number and availability of intensive care beds capacity the european average is currently 115 critical care beds per 100000 capita of population 30 in addition to the shortage of icu beds and ventilators the lack of health workers to staff the new units became critical countries such as france used army forces and camps to transport patients and optimize care bed capacity 31 germany with the highest proportion of icu beds per capita of population and one of the best european health systems campaigned to obtain the medical help of foreign doctors who were living in germany but did not yet have a license to practice medicine 32 in italy the netherlands france and the uk retired doctors nurses and medical students were recruited to help 33rather than impose a lockdown of its population the uk initially followed a mitigation strategy to build population immunity but abandoned this plan after realizing it would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths as noted in a report from the imperial colleges covid-19 response team 34 the subsequent illness of the prime minister and his transfer to intensive care further contributed to the realization that strict lockdown measures were necessary despite ongoing restrictions in the uk the number of cases continues to rise the death rate is the highest in europe and the curve of infections has yet to plateau  a reflection of the lag time before the start of the lockdownthe johns hopkins university jhu coronavirus resource center httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml provides an important live global update of the spread of sars-cov2 that includes world map us map and critical trends as of 20th may 2020 the total reported cases in europe were 1909592 and the total deaths are 167538 the uk currently has the highest number of cases  deaths 250138  35169 followed by italy 226 699  32169 spain 232037  27778 and france 180933  25025sweden similarly followed a plan of voluntary social distancing with the country remaining open with a population of 10 million the country remains amongst the top 25 in the world in terms of total number of cases even though testing is reserved only for those with severe symptoms these measures have not proved to be effective and altogether the country has registered 5-10 times more deaths than neighboring scandinavian countries the above examples again demonstrate that fast response and strict lockdown saved livesjhu lists sweden with 30799 cases and 3743 deaths compared to denmark 11315  551 finland 6399  301 and norway 8267  233moreover results from a recent antibody testing study across spain showed that only 5 of the total number of participants tested positive for exposure to the virus and developed some level of immunity 3536 a modeling study based on data obtained from french hospitals has shown that by the 11th of may only 44 of the french population had developed potential immunity against sars-cov-2 37 such numbers even if remotely accurate make it clear that letting the infection run its natural course will not result in protection levels high enough to satisfy the criteria of herd-immunity on the other hand if such data are interpreted as a low percentage of the population exposed to sars-cov-2 in two of the most affected countries in europe this showcases a massive positive impact of lockdown measures in containing the spread of the viruslockdowns were not the only measures taken to protect public health asian countries which had experience with other viral outbreaks rapidly implemented strict movement restrictions and suspended all unnecessary activities but in parallel ramped up testing for virus as well as tracking and isolating cases and contacts 38 at the same time china in response to the surge of cases built new specially equipped hospitals to increase the number of intensive care beds while in korea hotels were repurposed as care units exclusively for patients suffering from covid-19 these countries were also the first to ban flights to and from other countries borders were closed and open only for cargo trade 3940jhu many months after the start of the outbreak in china the number of confirmed cases is more than 84063 and the deaths are 4638 the case fatality ratio is close to 55 as stated on numerous occasions it is not clear how accurate the chinese numbers are remarkably in south korea the number of cases is 11110 with only 263 deaths numbers that reflect the positive impact of in depth efforts in testing contact tracing and social distancingin the pandemic emergency the lack of ppe and supplies like disinfectants created fear among frontline medics and staff to draw attention to this aspect german medical practitioners posed naked on a twitter page this protest was inspired by the french doctor alain colombi who affirmed that doctors were being asked to go to the front without weapons and no defences 41 for the same reason protest marches involving doctors nurses and paramedics took place in many countries - in pakistan they evolved into violent clashes between police and doctors in italy silent flash-mobs protested the government response 4243many continued hoping that the epidemic would soon die out and they and their families be spared thus they felt under no obligation to make any change in their habits as yet plague was an unwelcome visitant bound to take its leave one day as unexpectedly as it had come
b america the first case of covid-19 was confirmed in america on january 21 st and a few days later the white house coronavirus task force was established but with government inaction about the pandemic weeks were lost when the government could have prepared its own response informed the public and identified necessary medical supplies new york city with its dense population and hundreds of flights a day from europe became the epicenter of the pandemic in america the first new york case was recognized on march 1 2020 although reports now indicate that by march 1 there may have been as many as 10000 cases in the state imported from italy and elsewhere mixed messages from city and state officials essentially claiming go on with your lives at the beginning of march further confused the response additional delays in announcing a lockdown and containment practices the new york pause was issued march 22 guaranteed the firm establishment of the virus in the city and state new york governor andrew cuomo became a daily fixture on the news providing daily updates on the number of cases the search for proper medical equipment and the courageous efforts of medical front line personnel however with more than 15000 deaths in new york city the critical need to recognize and respond swiftly to the virus was once again sadly reinforced by the staggering numbers in contrast california reacted more swiftly to the emergence of sars-cov2 and issued a stay-at-home order on march 19 an important decision when hours and days matteredjhu as of may 21st new york state listed 354370 cases with 28636 deaths while california registered 85997 cases and 3497 deaths for comparison the number of casesdeaths in new york city are 194550 and 15789 while in san francisco there are 2179 cases and 36 deathsby the end of march all 50 states of the usa reported cases of covid-19 a few weeks after the first covid-19 case the hospitals began reporting supply shortages - both for testing and personal protective equipment a severe safety issue for frontline medical staff that was never addressed nationally rather it was left to state governors to grapple with the purchase supplies on the international market 44 in mid-march the army started constructing new hospital facilities 45 as in europe large-scale gatherings were prohibited schools and other educational institutions were closed businesses shuttered and restrictions on movement were imposedjhu as of 20 may 2020 the total reported cases in usa is 1528661 the number of deaths is more than 91938the truth is that everyone is bored and devotes himself to cultivating habits our citizens work hard but solely with the object of getting rich their chief interest is commerce and their chief aim in life is as they call it doing business
a europe the eurozone was experiencing poor economic growth even before the shock of the pandemic with an expansion of just 01 for the last three months of 2019 the economic productivity of the 19 countries of the eurozone decreased by 38 for the first three months of 2020 in the shadow of the spread of coronavirus throughout europe analysts now say it is certain that the entire eurozone will experience the largest recession since its creation in the late 1990s germany france and italy the three largest economies in the monetary union have all entered into economic recession with eurostat recording an even bigger drop in gross national product gdp compared to what markets expected although countries have published data only for the first quarter of 2020 analysts predict an even greater recession for the second and third quarters of the year 464748of the individual eurozone countries that published relevant data france reported that after a recession of 01 for the last quarter of 2019 its economy shrank by 58 for the first 3 months of 2020 the largest recession since the country began recording data in the late 1940s italy has also experienced recession for the first half of the year with the economy shrinking to 47 after falling 03 at the end of 2019 the effects of coronavirus pandemic on an already weak economy were enough to squash it spain one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic reported a 52 drop in the first quarter the year while gdp in belgium and austria fell 39 and 25 respectively 4647germanys economy shrank by 22 in the first quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic pushed the eurozones strongest economy into recession the seasonally adjusted number of unemployed in germany jumped by 373000 to 264 million in april the jobless rate climbed to 58 from a low of 5 the previous month the government also increased the number of underemployed workers to 101 million during april these part-time employment measures helped to maintain the overall employment figures in germany 49according to reuters experts from the world bank the world resources institute wri and other organizations warn that the coronavirus pandemic will leave behind about 100 million new poor living in cities around the world due to job losses and income 5051 in this scenario another sad truth must be faced coronavirus pandemic is widening the gap dividing rich and poor as for any epidemic in fact poverty and inequality can exacerbate rates of transmission and mortality the main factors that sentence poor people to illness are the lack of access to health care plus degraded and crowded living conditions moreover in the context of the current pandemic a key factor in infection risk is represented by the possibility of working remotely but again this is a luxury that a large segment of the workforce doesnt have for people who work outside home the choice is between lose job lose salary in most cases if they dont show up they dont get paid or keep going out to work amid the pandemic and because they very much need the income and their financial position is far more precarious than those who are working from home continuing going to work in most cases by public transportation is the only option even if they put themselves and their families at risk of being infected a primary consequence of this phenomenon is the racial disproportion in sickness and death percentages in the us black or african americans are contracting sars-cov2 and dying for it at higher rates compared to white americans and this has nothing to do with a biological or genetic predisposition toward coronavirus infection but is more likely due to a social predisposition 52in the european union after a series of confrontations in a series of eurogroup meetings it was decided to provide financial assistance of 5 of its gdp and the ability of member states to adopt a more flexible program in terms of their fiscal targets 53 moreover the eu commission to support the member states had set up eu solidarity fund to respond to major natural disasters and express european solidarity to disaster-stricken regions within europe 54 the worst affected countries can use that funds to alleviate the burden of the immediate response measures including assistance to the population medical assistance and equipment support to vulnerable groups and measures to contain the spreading of the disease strengthening preparedness and communication among the various fiscal measures adopted to contain the economic fallout several governments have decided to defer certain payments including taxes loans or utility bills to improve the liquidity positions of individuals and companies facing difficulties but in many cases those measures are not sufficientin italy the eu country worst affected by coronavirus economy has been damaged in such a severe manner that people in some regions are running short of food and money many of these new poor have turned to charities for help and several cases of looting at supermarkets have been reported this critical situation encouraged italians to give a new twist to an old custom known as suspended coffee in this century-old neapolitan tradition bar customers pay in advance a coffee for someone who cant afford it the same concept is being applied to suspended grocery shopping customs buy food with long shelf-life for the needy - such as pasta and canned goods those who can put something in those who cant help yourself this is the slogan written on solidarity baskets that appeared in supermarkets local grocery shops and even on the streets throughout italy 55 beyond these acts of charity an important help will come from the government which has designated 400 m for food vouchers to those who can no longer afford groceries 56he knew quite well that it was plague and needless to say he also knew that were this to be officially admitted the authorities would be compelled to take very drastic steps this was of course the explanation of his colleagues reluctance to face the facts

b america the country with the greatest wealth and medical minds in the world failed to heed warnings from china and then italy refused to acknowledge the emergency of international concern from the world health organization on january 31 2020 and lacked a pandemic preparedness plan that would have mobilized the american health system to respond to the coming viral pandemic as early as february a failure of national leadership compounded by the political divisions and a fragmented state by state response guaranteed the numbers - more than 15 million cases and counting deaths approaching 100000 it is impossible to imagine that the united states will emerge from this pandemic with the same perspective on its historic economic inequalitythe coronavirus pandemic has already triggered the sharpest recession in the united states since the great depression for the first 2 12 months of 2020 the economy continued to grow at a steady if not spectacular pace but the plug was suddenly pulled in mid-march - when bars restaurants and retail shops were abruptly closed and tens of millions of americans were ordered to stay home in an effort to slow the spread of the deadly disease more than 35 million people suddenly out of work have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks the spread of the coronavirus has threatened the social and economic fabric of american communities and revealed in a striking way the inequities of the american system  a single event threw more that 35000000 people into joblessness and a step closer to poverty expanded unemployment benefits and a one-time stimulus package were forthcoming from the us house and senate but these are temporary solutions to a much larger structural inequality that the pandemic has exposed the covid-19 pandemic highlighted the flaws in the system but didnt create them it has however revealed two economic conditions that have been left unchecked poverty and economic insecurity an inclusive social safety net that includes a basic income and health coverage may be the only solution to ensure that its citizens have a strong foundation for preparedness for the next pandemic
thus each of us had to be content to live only for the day alone under the vast indifference of the sky
our simple displays of social connection - a handshake a kiss on the cheek a hug a touch - these are the human encounters that sars-cov2 anticipates and exploits not mention its favorite  an unintentional dry cough on a bus in restaurant in the officethe measures taken to avoid the spread of the new coronavirus have left their mark on the psyche of citizens around the world at its peak an estimated 26 billion people  or a third of the worlds population  was living under some kind of lockdown or quarantine arguably the largest psychological experiment ever conducted 57 adapting to new unprecedented conditions brought a change in our daily routine and our habits given that human mental health is fragile if is confronted with the fear of the unknown it is certain that the pandemic imposed adverse effects on citizens at multiple levels fear of death and the end of humanity loneliness and isolation at home sadness and anxiety for the next day and the future of our loved ones are the grounds for psychological disorders increases in firearm and alcohol sales have been registered in the us over the last two months clear signs of the stress and anxiety generated by coronavirus pandemic among people 5859 since the onset of social distancing calls to domestic abuse helplines or suicide hotlines have intensified all over the world 6061 france offered free accommodation to victims of violence in the home and encouraged people to ask for help in pharmacies 62 australia announced a special phone line named coronavirus wellbeing support line 63in late february 2020 before european countries mandated various forms of lockdown the lancet published a review documenting the psychological impact of quarantine the restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease in short and perhaps unsurprisingly people who are quarantined are likely to develop a wide range of symptoms of psychological stress and disorder including low mood insomnia stress anxiety anger irritability emotional exhaustion depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms 64 in china these expected mental health effects are already being reported in the first research papers about the lockdown 65a study reporting on the long-term effects of sars quarantine among healthcare workers found a long-term risk for alcohol abuse self-medication and long-lasting avoidance behavior - where some hospital workers avoid being in close contact with patients by simply not showing up for work reasons for stress abound in lockdown risk of infection fear of becoming sick or of losing loved ones as well as the prospect of financial hardship scientists predict that if the pandemic continues psychological and social effects of covid-19 will worsen and create the perfect storm of conditions for suicide especially in the most vulnerable categories like the elderly poor and people suffering from previous mental problems 66well personally ive seen enough of people who die for an idea i dont believe in heroism i know its easy and ive learned that it can be murderous what interests me is living and dying for what one loveswidespread measures adopted by governments facing the pandemic crisis were social distancing country-wide lockdown and restriction of traffic numerous constitutionalists have argued that such measures violate human rights as freedom of movement is a fundamental right directly linked to human nature however international human rights law does recognize that during serious public health threats and public emergencies that threaten the life of a nation restrictions on some rights can be justifiedvarious measures have been taken by the majority of the countries to protect human rights in these difficult times countries like ireland austria and argentina have banned the evictions and have announced measures to protect housing recognizing its role in the crisis response portugal announced that people with pending residency and asylum applications will be treated as permanent residents giving them equal access to free health care 67 initially several incidents of racism and xenophobia were reported towards people of chinese and asian descent all over the world 68 some politicians started to use the term chinese virus to describe the sars-cov-2 pandemic and received criticism for their statements as the virus spread progressed in european countries and italy became an epicenter italians were also subjected to racism unfortunately such incidents are neither extraordinary nor isolated socioeconomic and anthropologicalarchaeological studies have shown that past pandemics like the 1918 spanish flu and the black death in the 14th century affected societies disproportionally as reviewed by l wade 69 people at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum were more likely to die from infectious diseases due to different treatment practices or lack thereof based on their societal status compared to the wealthier members of society african americans latinos and indigenous populations have also faced health care inequalities and discriminations during the course of past pandemics since the current pandemic does not yet belong to the past it is a pivotal moment in history to prevent such discriminations and racial inequalities from leaving their social stigma in the years to come
there comes a time in history when the man who dares to say that two and two do make four is punished with death
who has repeatedly stated the urgency of adhering to the measures and positions of the scientific community  social distance personal hygiene and the use of protective masks but such invasive measures also opened the floodgates of misinformation with social and mass media spreading a range of questionable information conspiracy theories misinformation or non-scientific views regarding the virus its origin and spread that endanger public health have acquired a criminal character in several countriesone of the most difficult issues concerned reports that us officials were investigating the possibility the coronavirus was secretly manufactured andor escaped from a chinese lab in wuhan specifically the wuhan institute of virology there is no scientific evidence to support these theories the sequencing and analysis of coronavirus genomes have already dispelled these rumors and instead demonstrate that bats are the likeliest source suggesting that covid-19 was created by nature not humans at its molecular level the viral genome most closely resembles an isolate that already exists in horseshoe bats in hunan province supported by several studies bats have an unusually high capacity to harbor viruses and have been linked to past outbreaks including sars mers and ebola the virus may have spread from bats to an intermediary animal before infecting humans this remains unclear the fact that the earliest cases of covid-19 were linked to a live animal market in wuhan that sold exotic species only bolsters these observationsin a recent study from nature medicine researchers concluded our analyses clearly show that sars-cov-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus 70 it is well known that the wuhan institute of virology and other institutes have been studying coronaviruses and bats ever since the sars outbreak of the early 2000s but there is no evidence that this research was malicious rather it was a response to the need to understand the pathogenesis and epidemiology of sars high containment research was essential given earlier outbreaks as well as warnings from former presidents and scientific leaders see abovein 2003 the chinese government was legitimately criticized for their attempted cover-up of the original sars outbreak leading to skepticism amongst its critics about the openness of its response to the sars-cov2 outbreak of 2019 calls from over 100 nations for an investigation into the origins of sars-cov2 and the pandemic have been recognized by premier xi of china with his qualification that the review take place after the virus is under control there remains much to learn from the early days of the pandemic and the chinese response as well as the pandemic response of other countries from an epidemiologic perspective these were critical days understanding the nature and necessity of the immediate response will only prepare the global community for the next outbreak
whats true of all the evils in the world is true of plague as well it helps men to rise above themselves

we have reached may 2020 and the lockdown efforts in most countries are winding down at the time of writing the population in italy has moved forward with re-opening the economy restaurants stores and businesses are active once again although the tourists have yet to return germany spain and france are moving forward with the re-opening their countries after reducing the number of cases and deaths through strict lockdown enforcement the united states pushes ahead with re-opening business travel beaches and bars despite the continued rise in cases and deaths and new regions of concern are emerging russia and brazil report massive daily increases in the number of cases and are now becoming the new epicenters with the second and third highest rates of infection in the world singapore and china are carefully evaluating spikes in new cases - using testing contact tracing and isolation to prevent a second wave of coronavirus cases research and vaccine development are moving at warp speed in the hopes of finding a treatment that will restore us to a new normal in the first four months of 2020 covid-19 has engulfed the world it remains to be seen if global efforts during the next four months will unwrap our planet 
fig 4
the pandemic continues although it is not clear whether the virus will to continue to smolder and ignite in different global regions during the summer or perhaps retreat only to return to new peaks in the fall and winter most experts agree that covid-19 is not going away anytime soon and will probably be with us for the next two years 76 on may 21st the who reported 106000 new cases of covid-19 globally the highest one day total since the pandemic began as new knowledge about the virus accumulates new complications of the disease arise including the recent recognition of a serious kawasaki-like disorder in children termed multi-system inflammatory syndrome mis and new modelling research states that had the lockdown of america been imposed two weeks earlier - march 9 vs march 23 - over 80 of the cases and deaths could have been prevented this sobering estimate brings us to another unsettling fact throughout this crisis efforts have been made to mute the response of scientific leadership to the pandemic if covid-19 ushers in a new normal for citizens around the world we hope that new reality will include the recognition that the voice of science reason and experience must be heardon march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the sars-cov-2 outbreak a pandemic 1 to date the number of coronavirus cases has passed 400000 worldwide and more than 18000 persons have died after china italy is the country that has been most violently hit by the covid-19 tsunami with 69176 cases and 6820 deaths updated on march 24th 2020 the case fatality rate due to covid-19 in italy is one of the highest in the world about 98 well above what has been recorded in china 2 in particular the lombardy region with its cities of bergamo brescia lodi and milan is paying the heaviest toll to the coronavirus in terms of fatalities 3 the vast majority of deaths is occurring in older persons a fact that can only be partially explained by the older age of the italian population in fact although current data indicate that persons aged 70 years and older contribute to about the 85 of the death events in italy it cannot be overlooked the fact that japan has substantially smaller figures despite being the oldest country in the world it is likely that the strategies adopted for testing the population as well as the robustness of the healthcare system may play a much more relevant role than age in the explanation of the scenariounfortunately numbers can only provide a partial description of what is happening and probably underestimate the ongoing tragedy 3 right in these days the international media have broadcasted worldwide the dramatic column of military trucks leaving the city of bergamo laden with the coffins of many patients died of covid-19 people cannot even celebrate the funeral of their relatives who died isolated in covid-19 facilities schools universities activitiesall of them have been closed the entire country is locked down since march 21st the worldwide web is full of videos showing how healthcare professionals are today working around the clock often with limited resourcesthe limitation of resources has indeed been a major issue especially during the very first days of the crisis when there still was a certain dose of unpreparedness and surprise in front of the magnitude of what was happening low number of ventilators saturation of beds in intensive care units shortage of personal protective equipment overcrowding emergency departments inability to adequately isolate suspected cases have been the most urgent and critical problems faced by clinicians especially at the beginning it is thus not surprising why about 10 of the persons infected by the sars-cov-2 is today constituted by physicians and nurses working in such an emergency to counteract the enormity of what was arriving unavoidably led to healthcare professionals falling sick and sometimes even die under the coronavirus the consequent reduction of the healthcare professionals due to covid-19 has been threatening the sustainability of the system to overcome this critical moment many healthcare professionals from everywhere in the world have answered to the call for help and converged to italy to put their expertise at disposal of our community to keep the healthcare machine running and support the colleagues overwhelmed in the management of covid patients there have been pediatricians working with older patients or surgeons taking care of internal medicine issues everyone is giving what heshe canhow is the life of a geriatrician in such an apocalyptic scenario geriatricians are sadly used to the fact that our hedonistic society often finds no place for older people 4 in normal times geriatricians regularly battle for guaranteeing the proper care to persons who are otherwise excluded from interventions just because they are old geriatric medicine has produced substantial evidence showing that frail older persons require adaptations in the clinical approach and that the environment plays a critical role for the wellbeing of the aging individual 56 welleverything we know has simply been wiped away by this period of crisis we are living it can be understandable that the focus is today exclusively on the sars-cov-2 and the hospitals are primarily acting for defeating it nothing else seems important in front of the enormity of the crisis the differences across specialties have been cancelled because sars-cov-2 is everywhere probably more diffused than what is generally thought or objectively measured by tests the only priority in the clinical setting is to isolate covid patients or suspect cases as soon as possible and offer prompt respiratory support when symptoms appear and start to dramatically worsen the coronavirus has deleted everything that can be felt superfluous redundant andor unnecessary unfortunately geriatric medicine did not start the coronavirus crisis with solid roots it has traditionally been considered a poor specialty always struggling for recognition it was indeed not in the best position compared to other disciplines to protect the results it has been accomplishing over the past decades for the care of frail older persons furthermore it has never been a winning ticket for geriatrics to specifically serve those frail older persons often at the margin of the society under this scenario it has not taken a lot before everything related to geriatrics was forgotten in the name of the battle against the coronavirus ubi major minor cessat is this right is this the way things should go of course not the fact that the emergency has forced drastic and sometimes cynical decisions does not justify the loss of attention to the persons values listening a physician stating luckily in our hospital no one younger than 60 years has died provides a clear taste of the well-known ageism of our society this kind of attitude was before more or less hidden behind a faade of politically correct but is receiving now a sort of legitimation in front of the dramatic emergency when media have been underlining that older persons with comorbidities were the most likely to die a relief breath was made by many as they had no older relatives or as they will not be old as well one day nevertheless geriatricians are also to blame for the failure we experience today we have lost ourselves and wasted time running after futile controversies missing opportunities for contaminating other disciplines with the correct principles of geriatric medicine we probably remained closed inside our ivory towers and left others design their inadequate solutions for our patients 7the costs of the coronavirus for older persons are and will likely remain underestimated we can count deaths events occurring in individuals resulting positive to the test however these figures do not consider that
tests have not been routinely available especially for older persons for example long term care facilities and primary care physicians cannot yet easily perform the test for the identification of sars-cov-2the test is limited by a relatively high number of false negative results clinicians are quite confident that many patients died of covid despite not officially being diagnosed for it although these patients could still be managed with all the precautions as they were covid they have still been excluded from the statistics there has been a patient in our hospital who resulted three times negative at the nasopharyngeal swab before finally being found positive at the broncho-alveolar lavagethe already fragile integration of care services completely collapsed under the coronavirus diffusion hospitals closed within themselves for limiting the diffusion of the virus while post-acutelong-term care facilities reduced admissions being afraid of a possible contamination arriving from outside primary care physicians have been paying a huge tool even with their lives finding themselves isolated in the community with no means and no support from the hospitals many older persons with their chronic conditions and care needs remained isolated after the sars-cov-2 outbreak the consequences of this are not part of the standard covid narrativein a situation of constant emergency it is almost impossible to apply many interventions against geriatric conditions across clinical settings physical therapists for mobilization of the older patient avoidance of stressors for prevention of delirium social contacts for re-orientation of the person teamwork for the design of person-tailored interventions all this does not exist anymore there is no time no personnel no resources for supporting the good practice of geriatric medicine the same human interaction between the patient and hisher physician is lost behind the burdening personal protective equipment in covid-19 facilities are we redundant we prefer to think that we have not yet been able to communicate how certain care standards solicited by geriatricians are necessary for practicing a modern medicinewhat will remain after the sars-cov-2 will be defeated we will count our deaths we will probably take some time for thinking at our acts and decisions we will surely see many errors but this will give us a unique opportunity for improvement after all albert einstein said the crisis is the greatest blessing for people and nations because the crisis brings progress hopefully we will learn from our mistakes and contribute for a better society a society able to give more value to persons independently of their agein the covid19 crisis also labelled as the corona crisis one of the most often used words by government around the world to motivate the exceptional intervention strategies such as lockdown policies and the incremental unlock or exit policies to deal with the crisis is the word together to minimise the number of casualties and in the meantime be able to win time for a vaccine to be developed the united nations and the world health organisation have plead for humankind all across the globe to work together to stand as one in order to protect the vulnerable un 2020 who 2020a 2020b and for this to work solidarity of all of us would be required in line with this globally we have seen the rise of national calls and even national legal enforcements of togetherness to maximally protect the elderly children and young people are less affected in contrast to especially elderly men and the vulnerable especially heart lung and diabetes patients who face the highest risk of becoming seriously ill and to spread the pressure on the health care in the best possible way such that every patient receives the care heshe needs radical measures were needed and also to make sure that health care employees are not confronted with the horrific choice who to let live and who to let die just because of capacity shortagesin this paper we build on the burgeoning academic debate on the corona crisis by conceptually assessing the current societal challenges which the demanded policy of human togetherness is facing in particular we will build on and contribute to the literature related to the geopolitical bordering of solidarity and togetherness that is acting in opposition with andor marginalising certain others van houtum  van naerssen 2002 vollan  ostrom 2010 sennett 2012 jackson 2015 bauder  juffs 2020 to do this we will be using a radical humanistic approach burrell  morgan 1979 with which we theoretically assess the socially constructed nature as well as the value bound axiology of the current politically used notions of solidarity using this radical humanistic lens in our conceptual exploration we will critically discuss illustrated with recent examples the applied forms of togetherness in this crisis ranging from a track and trace model to a complete lockdown van houtum  van uden 2020 after this we will explore topical forms of counterproductive antagonisms that geographically demographically and socially border the required togetherness we will end with a short reflection on the autoimmune effects of this bordering of solidarity what we using a portmanteau typify as coronativism and argue that for a virus that travels beyond borders we also need a togetherness beyond socially constructed ingroups  what we call agape defined as love for mankind  if we wish to create a sustainable and just immunisation and exit strategyalthough it has not literally been framed as such one could recognise in the urgent global call for togetherness the classic philosophy of the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 ostrom 1990 the concept of the tragedy of the commons stems from the work done in human ecology initiated by hardin 1968 subsequently this concept has also been applied to various fields and issues in social and economic research see eg ostrom 1990 frischmann 2018 frischmann et al 2019 in general the tragedy of the commons refers to problems that come about when a commonpool resource which can be accessed by a large number of people free of charge is overused and this overuse destroys the resource itself examples relate to the harvesting of fish in public lakes and seas greenhouse emissions in the global atmosphere and the use of public health care each individual makes hisher own decision about how much to use of this resource that is how many fish to catch or when applied to this crisis how much medical supplies and health care capacity to use however if none of the individuals restrain their use of the resource the resources will soon collapse as it falls short on capacity if one limits oneself but fellow citizens do not the resource will also be depleted which creates in the short run an incentive to take your maximum share thus the idea is that if everyone pursues hisher own selfinterest the ultimate outcome will be worse for everyone as it will hollow out the commons and thereby harm the interests of the general public this mechanism is typified as the tragedy of the commons or emphasising the depletion of the commons the tragedy of the failure of the commons or the tragedy of the unregulated commons jensen 2007the nobel prize winner in economics elinor ostrom 2003 2009 has famously suggested that key factors in order to avoid this tragedy of the commons are democratic and fair rules governing the commons use especially when there is such a perceptible threat of resource depletion without available substitutes as is the case with medical care and medication in the corona crisis hence she argues what is necessary is local contextual rules with builtin incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse in the defined commonality all members of the same local community that make use of the commons should strive to achieve the same goal namely to protect the commons of selfish overuse in order to attain this targeted local governance is needed in the form of tacit norms andor explicit rules institutions and laws that constitutes and enforces the solidarity that is called for typically the political appeal to solidarity in the locality will often be based then on a contingent mix of indigenous identity imagined community tacit rituals and skills or rational recognition of the reciprocity and mutuality needed to achieve the common goal sennett 2012 iorio 2013 jarvis 2019 bauder  juffs 2020 yet what is typical of this corona crisis  and different from the membership of a locally bordered commons that ostrom 1990 dominantly based her writings on  is that all human beings are perhaps unwillingly yet unavoidably member of the same global commonality if everyone would live hisher life as normal during this global outbreak including economic and social crossborder and interregional travel and interaction the common medical care capacity would fall short very quickly making the impact on society at large in terms of the number of ill patients and deaths in the end beyond control so communities may develop their own governance rules and procedures and that may be effective within that context and for the short run but in the case of the corona pandemic these local communities are unavoidably geographically and chronically embedded in a global interdependence when trying to keep control over the virus in this corona crisis to quote mazzucato 2020 you are only as healthy as your neighbour be it your local or national neighboursyet this vital togetherness plead for by the who and un is still rather far from reality un 2020 who 2020a despite the calls to stand and act together different nations have chosen different and largely centripetally oriented pathways to protect the commons of the public health care system anderson et al 2020 in the following we will discuss the dominant variations in the immunisation and exit strategies chosen and assess their effects on togethernessin most asian countries and later in also a country like israel the focus from the start was not so much on standing together as an anonymous united one but more on the targeting and public disclosure of infected individual citizens cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 instead of the whole society joining in a lockdown to protect the vulnerable individuals were tracked and traced and when sick isolated this resulted in a massive and public testing  for instance by constantly checking peoples temperature when entering a building or a public space and communicating this publicly  and the use of apps to trace the exact contacts and mobilities of people whenever someone would fail the temperature test then she would be locked up for several weeks in special corona camps combatwise the track and tracing seems very efficient and effective and society does not have to bear the burden of being locked up as a whole yet technically in many countries the model quickly proved to be insufficient the tracking and tracing could not keep up with the infection rate among the population as a result many of these countries eventually had to combine it with a lockdown after all cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 what is more it is an immunisation strategy that potentially also has severe autoimmune consequences referring to a situation in which the strategy to protect the society eventually forms a threat to that same society borradori 2003 van houtum  bueno lacy 2020 for one in order to let it function effectively it would require a farreaching almost panopticonlike invasion of privacy and freedom foucault 2009 2010 a government that follows and controls peoples private moves and publicly shares their temperature risks transforming society into an orwellian paranoid system this not only rewards indifference and egoism in society to a worrying extent but also leads to a distrust in the anonymous possibly affected fellow citizen and this could result in a grim and punishing dichotomy of the tobeavoidedsick versus the nonsick people which would thus directly harm the idea of togetherness the anonymous but solidary wein our home country the netherlands like in the uk the chosen immunisation strategy at first was to create a socalled herd immunity which entails that the fittest in society would gain immunity and thereby protect the vulnerable cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 but when it became clear to the general public that this immunisation strategy would lead to the autoimmune consequence of a massive amount of victims and would take many years and thus would not painlessly and quickly lead to a herd but literally to a hurt community the dutch as well the british government transitioned into a lockdown strategy for their citizens and the closing of the national borders for most foreigners cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 the lockdown was not complete in the sense that all citizens who did not feel ill could still go out for essential shopping and recreational purposes as long as they would keep a distance of less than 15 metres nl or 2 metres uk to others and would not go around in groups of more than 2 uk or 3 persons nl cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 in the netherlands this strategy was framed as an intelligent lockdown although it was not made clear what a stupid lockdown strategy would look like currently as an unlock strategy the netherlands has announced to introduce a track and trace model including perhaps a coronaapp with which people and their contacts can be tracked down while supposedly guaranteeing maximum privacy rijksoverheid 2020 it remains to be seen whether this is indeed feasible at allmost other countries in europe like italy france spain portugal serbia and austria but also various other countries around the globe like australia and new zealand have immediately chosen for a farreaching lockdown cohen  kupferschmidt 2020 in many cases by declaring a state of emergency in which in line with the works of carl schmitt and agamben the normal rule of law is temporarily transcended by extralegal exceptional sovereign decisions aimed to mitigate the emergency all citizens were geographically bounded and borders were closed for inbound travel agamben 2005 2020 schmitt 2005 fitting with such a martial law to legitimise this complete confinement  in which citizens were prohibited to freely and independently move around other than via specific certificates and only for essential purposes  the presidents and primeministers of these countries publicly declared a state of emergency in special tv broadcasts to justify the exceptional state of affairs president macron for instance declared in his national tvspeech nous sommes en guerre we are at war cohen  kupferschmidt 2020to shut down a society by a lockdown be it framed as intelligent or as a martial act is when it comes to immunisation perhaps less targeted because sick people will only be revealed when they report it themselves but from the perspective of solidarity and togetherness it seems a less discriminatory alternative after all with a public lockdown everyone participates for the greater good of the elderly and vulnerable what is more it quickly became clear that this strategy had a flywheel effect on togetherness itself the threat of a constantly looming dangerous viral infection that potentially could hit every body gave a powerful boost to new forms of local and global solidarity zizek 2020 all kinds of neighbourhooddeliveryservices were introduced to do some shopping for the people who had to stay in homequarantine music was being played for the elderly to cheer up their day private balconies and windows were used as public platforms to sing or make music together like in the case of italy and it resulted in applause for those who kept the commons going the people working in the socalled vital sectors of course as with every new normality not everyone obeyed the rules some people went on the streets in bigger groups than was allowed or even held secret parties something that governments condemned and framed as asocial the message was clear together should be really together no exceptions men or woman young or old sick or not sick stayathome and the ones who did not obey to these rules could expect substantial finesto begin with it has become clear that the plea for the new normal of solidarity cooperation and togetherness has run into direct confrontation with prevailing neoliberal calculative reasonings in this vein some utilitarian critics have argued reasoning with the premise that society should aim to create the largest utility for the largest number of people that the costs related to the standstill of the economy in the long run would be much higher than the benefits of collectively saving the elderly and the vulnerable in the short run luimstra 2020 and hence they argue it would economically be unwise to close down the entire society because the ones who potentially are facing the health and lethal consequences the most would also be the ones who in the long run would not yield the biggest profits to society at large some have therefore even provocatively argued much against the kantian and medical logic in which every human being is morally equal and worth saving regardless of hisher characteristics and behaviour that we do not have to go at such length saving these people because many of them would be fat and smokers and it was therefore their own fault that they ended up at the intensive care unit and hence they could perhaps best be isolated locked up luimstra 2020 so that the rest of us could continue with our normal livesbut also between cities and regions in the same nation state we have seen manifestations of antagonistic neoliberal competition logics if we for instance take a closer look at our own home country the netherlands we have seen that hospitals located in the region that was hit first by corona the north of brabant could not necessarily rely on the solidarity of other regions many hospitals elsewhere in the country were accused of unwillingness to take up patients of the almost full intensive care units in the hospitals in the north of brabant de volkskrant 2020 to a large extent this unwillingness could be interpreted as the material consequence of continuous waves of neoliberal privatisation and deregulation for decades brown 2015 sparke 2016 garnham 2017 the upshot of this continuous privatisation of the public sector is that even commons like hospitals are nowadays part of a neoliberal competition it implies that collaboration between hospitals even if it is better or cheaper for the patient is not easily permitted because it would violate free competition and indeed for hospitals in the netherlands it became clear that collaboration between regional hospitals and even between different departments within the same hospital cooperation and solidarity had to be reinvented so that patients and information would not be locked up within the boundaries of one hospital or region and to ensure that hospitals would take over patients of other regions and information and supplies were readily sharedhow dire the outcome of this neoliberal market thinking in health care can be also became apparent in terms of the stock of pharmaceutical supplies emanuel et al 2020 harvey 2020 the corona crisis has brought to light how the economic logics in national health care have created a vulnerable lockedin dependency on forprofit billiondollar pharmaceutical companies harvey 2020 some of these pharmaceutical companies as well as traders in medical supplies persisted in prolonging their monopoly rents and some even tried to take extra profit by asking extortionate prices notwithstanding such a whopping lifethreatening crisis like this impacting people all over the world buranyi 2020 oxfam international 2020 for many critical scholars this comes as no surprise as the damaging and even deadly consequences of a harsh neoliberal application in health care had been shown and warned for extensively in critical health care debates for a long time already see eg lemke 2001 dardot  laval 2013 brown 2015 sparke 2016so one could argue that a strict utilitarian take on the corona crisis as is argued for andor practised by some risks turning the required solidarity into a hobbesian kind of togetherness in which the calculative pursuit of ones personal interests of ones health hospital or medical company prevails kapeller  wolkenstein 2013 this potentially creates an atomised society in which competition rather than cooperation is seen as meritable which potentially constitutes an unsolidary dichotomy of the fit versus the nonfit the healthy young versus the vulnerable elderly fit women versus obese men or whatever category is hit harder by the virus in which the nonfit should be locked up in their nursery homes such that the fit and healthy can live their life as normal creating a neoliberal survival of the fittest and in fact literally so with the virus as a deadly invisible handthe second force that erodes the required togetherness that we discern here is the persistence of nationalism in this global corona crisis the socalled coronationalism colijn 2020 van hecke 2020 the virus itself is blind for national borders skin colour power positions descent or richness and as such is apolitical as it could affect everyone everywhere but the political fight against it has clearly made the national differences more manifest and has increased the geographical inequalities even further it has become painfully evident that even in an urgent and truly global crisis like this the alignment of national combat policies and global coordination in the distribution of medicins and supplies is seriously failing put differently to a large extent the societal lockdowns have led to nationalistic lockedinssometimes we have seen tendencies of solidarity beyond members that merely belong to the specific ingroup for instance when the chinese jack ma foundation and the alibaba foundation donated half a million mouth masks and other protective equipment to the netherlands ministry of wealth health care and sports 2020 or when the european union implemented a fund for research of which the results should be shared globally european commission 2020a but mostly and especially among nation states what we have seen is a global anarchistic fight sometimes coincided with wild west scenes in the battle for medical supplies like mouth masks and respiration devices in which even piracy was not shunned as shown by reports about deliveries that were stolen including orders that were stopped at the border and prices of supplies that increased by tenfold the guardian 2020 in addition countries like the united states have even further undermined the international order by threatening to terminate their support to the who kupferschmidt  cohen 2020also in the eu the union that was actually founded with the aim to create solidarity and to protect the rule of law and human rights beyond borders the national oppositions have been magnified during the corona crisis bozorgmehr et al 2020 again an emergency situation resulted in an internal clash the eu has lately faced three major crises a financial crisis a socalled refugee crisis and now a corona crisis and all three crises have derailed into a crisis of solidarity among member states bozorgmehr et al 2020 and each time the eu commission members emphasised without much effect the importance of international collaboration and unity of policies also in this corona crisis vicepresident frans timmermans as well as other commissioners warned if we do not do this together we should not be surprised if the eu harms itself even to the extent that it could fall apart timmermans 2020 clearly there have been some examples of crossborder solidarity in the eu for instance germany  showing a similar kind hospitality and humanitarian aid as during the socalled refugee crisis  generously took over several patients of the netherlands in their hospitals close to the dutch border bosman 2020 but unfortunately what is standing out is again international distrust and lack of solidarity the same as in the case of the financial and refugee crises the northern more affluent member states were not really willing to help the southern member states like greece italy and spain bozorgmehr et al 2020 and with every new crisis the support for the eu in both northern member states they did it to themselves as well as the southern states again we are being left on our own seems to be decreasing furtheralso the contrasts between east and west in europe have further inflamed because of the corona crisis in particular in hungary and poland this crisis like in the case of the call for a europeanwide redistribution of refugees has led to a further selfdistancing from the rest of the eu and has strengthened the autocratic seizure of the national rule of law kosmehl 2020for agamben 2020 this latter misuse of the corona crisis by undemocratically seizing more power in a state of emergency is typically what could happen in a crisis and is something that he has recently warned for in no mistaken terms what is more he regards the emergency measures even to be worse than the risk of the disease itself in his words the measures would be frantic irrational and absolutely unwarranted agamben 2020 for him it is blatantly evident that these restrictions are disproportionate to the threat from what is according to the nrc a normal flu not much different from those that affect us every year  we might say that once terrorism was exhausted as a justification for exceptional measures the invention of an epidemic could offer the ideal pretext for broadening such measures beyond any limitation agamben 2020 so agamben sees in this what he labels as disproportionate response a growing tendency to use the state of exception as a normal governing paradigm for him and various critical scholars like him the autoimmune risk of a nationally declared state of emergency that is deemed necessary to protect the nation is that a democracy effectively becomes a technocracy run by nondemocratically accountable experts that decisions are opportunistically taken that are not directly related to the emergency at hand and lastly that the temporary situation is prolonged deliberately and unnecessarily which eventually could result into autocracyhowever in sharp opposition to agambens opinion it has widely been established by now that covid19 cannot and should not be equated with a regular flu as it much more contagious and deadly to call the response frantic and disproportionate can hence hardly be called an expression of solidarity but what we do indeed see happening and this would be in line with his expectations is that countries such as poland and hungary but also china have already pushed the boundaries of martial law to an autocratic level harari 2020 rachman 2020 similarly elsewhere elections have been postponed opportunistically like in bolivia and the campaigning of the opposition has been blocked like in guinea durbino 2020 in addition some governments have already suggested to enrich the border apparatus in terms of socalled immunity passports and the discrimination of travellers from certain states who 2020c this would only strengthen the nativist discrimination and global mobilityinequality that is already engrained in the visa border regime where people are judged on the basis of their place of birth in the attempt to acquire the permission to travel van houtum  bueno lacy 2020 furthermore rightwing populists like trump and orban have been playing a populistic blame game claiming that the spread of covid19 what trump illustratively discriminatively labelled the chinese virus realdonaldtrump 2020 at first would be the fault of the cosmopolitan elite foreigners and imaginatively open borders chung  li 2020 devakumar et al 2020 white 2020 and we will probably will be seeing more examples of what could be called pandemic populism around the globe in the time to come pfeifer 2020 when it comes to the eu one could state that the strategy to achieve togetherness paradoxically threatens to tear the eu further apart the eu commission  by way of vicecommissioner timmermans recently raised the question how many avoidable and selfprovoked internal crises the eu can actually survive for him the fear that the eu by way of its own internal divisiveness threatens to fatally harm itself what recently has been called eucide becomes more and more real van houtum  bueno lacy 2020in short what we see happening is that the required global togetherness is fiercely impeded by the national bordering of solidarity a thinking in terms of our nation first as well as by all kinds of opportunistic misuses of the coronacrisis by populist leaders both of which have the potential to adversely exclude and marginalise people not belonging to the own imagined community anderson 1991 van houtum  van naerssen 2002 featherstone 2012 this brings us to the third divisive forceto what degree the lack of geographical unity beyond local and national borders is amplifying the failure of the tragedy of the commons will only be known when the crisis is over what however is already becoming clear is that some parts of the world and some population groups are clearly more vulnerable than othersto wit nations that are highly dependent on tourists are hit hard mckenzie 2020 especially for the new touristdestinations that have emerged around the globe and moved out of poverty just because of their touristindustry this means a serious setback gssling et al 2020 but perhaps even more poignant is that the adagium of stayathome that was dominant and to some extent still is a guiding principle at least until a cure is found is a luxury that many people cannot afford bryant 2020 meade 2020 yancy 2020 the poorest on this planet have in fact been confronted with choosing between two evils a lockdown without any opportunity to gain sufficient income and thus in the worst case scenario die of starvation or the threat of being infected by the virus due to a lack of protection when moving around in the city to earn some money an unbearable choice between life and livelihood also inhabitants of slums are proportionally more vulnerable when exposed to the virus simply because they do not have a proper shelter to stay at home running water to wash their hands or because there is no option to go into selfquarantine when sick bryant 2020 meade 2020 wurcel et al 2020 on top of that in a lot of the less affluent parts of the world but also in the richer countries like the us yancy 2020 access to health care and the extent to which the government can provide support is not up to par hopman et al 2020 deslatte 2020 reyes et al 2020 thebault et al 2020 thomas and anoruo 2020 yancy 2020 recent findings suggest that people with lower incomes who are more often suffering from chronic health conditions such as obesity diabetes or heart disease are likelier to catch the disease and are also likelier to die from it who 2019 fisher  bubola 2020 as a result it has already been established that the coronavirus is disproportionately affecting and killing african americans who 2019 fisher  bubola 2020 as they are more often living in poorer areas characterised by high housing density high crime rates and poor access to healthy foods havranek et al 2015 yancy 2020and what to think of a possible corona outbreak in the refugee camps on the borders of the eu the inhumane camps are the heartbreaking consequence of a lack of solidarity in the distribution of the reception of refugees the previous crisis in the eu bozorgmehr et al 2020 kelly et al 2020 van houtum  bueno lacy 2020 the refugees are now yet again left to their own devices with potential devastating lethal consequences bozorgmehr et al 2020 brandenberger et al 2020 hopman et al 2020 this comes in sharp contrast to the rich and super rich whofled to their second or third homes to private islands private bunkers or decided to stay for months on their superyachts mckeever 2020 in other words we have seen the rise of incredibly affluent corona refugees that fled without all the deprivation loss of freedom and hardship that most ordinary refugees suffer from how the greatest utility for the greatest number of people in practice can come down to the greatest benefit for the smallest amount of people indeed the virus potentially hits us all but because of the selfexclusionary and discriminating practices clearly in a grossly unequal manner it is telling that in most speeches held by presidents and primeministers these international vulnerabilities are not or only very scarcely given attention it is not unlikely therefore that when a vaccine or medicine will become available we will be seeing only a prolonging of the othering of the already vulnerable van houtum  van naerssen 2002 mazzucato  torreele 2020 with adverse effects on global inclusiveness it is for the marginalised the poor the refugees the homeless and the ethnically discriminated or excluded that the call for international solidarity and the idea of togetherness in this corona crisis is tested the most bozorgmehr et al 2020while the call of togetherness by governments is loud and widespread it has become clear that its practical implementation is still obstructed by policies geared towards expanding merely an ingroup belonging shared identity and reciprocity hunt  benford 2004 routledge et al 2007 iorio 2013 rahbari 2019 bauder  juffs 2020 such a solidarity although internally potentially effective runs the risk of creating or enlarging a bordered togetherness and exclusive reciprocity and hence a medical care only attainable for the ones that are part of that particular ingroup the result of this prevailing identityoriented notion of togetherness is that it reduces and borders membership to those who belong to the own imagined community and exclude others who do not van houtum  van naerssen 2002 featherstone 2012 yet what the virusoutbreak in a paradoxical way has shown is the interdependence of humanity beyond socially constructed divides and this interdependence is both a threat as well as a necessary remedy because of our intrinsically globally connected world and our living closely together in dense countries and cities we are vulnerable to the rapid spread of viruses across the globe a togetherness based on geographical economic or ethnic divides will therefore not help to solve the crisis and could even have autoimmune effects in terms of democracy rule of law and inequality at the same time it is also this very interdependent togetherness beyond nativistic divides beyond what we term coronativism that should be seen as the most powerful and vital source we currently have to combat a virus like coronareacting to agambens 2020 warning for the disproportionate response possibly leading to more autocratic control slavoj zizek 2020 recently argued that the measures necessitated by an epidemic should not be automatically reduced to the usual paradigm of surveillance and control indeed he argues quarantines and similar measures of course limit our freedom and new assanges are needed here to bring out their possible misuses but such a social interpretation doesnt make the reality of the threat disappear for him to only criticise the curtailing of ones own freedom risks missing the paradox not to shake hands and to go into isolation when needed is todays form of solidarity and so what we need he argues is an approach that should reach well beyond the machinery of single governments it should encompass the local mobilisation of people outside state control as well as strong and efficient international coordination and collaborationwe very much agree with this plea for a togetherness that goes beyond ingroup divides or local communities the commons that the world is trying to protect from being affected by a globally spread virus namely human life itself cannot be exclusively related to any specific ingroup but is unavoidably a vital concern of us all it calls for a togetherness in which people realise that their lives and actions affect one another in a web of institutions interactions and unintended consequences and acknowledge that they are together in a space of mutual effect young 2000 p110 put differently a virus that is by its very nature politically blind calls for a combat strategy that should be equally blind for political dividesin ancient greece they had a beautiful term for such a nondividing togetherness agape it refers to one of the seven forms of love that were defined next to for instance philia friendship and eros romantic love and stands for an overarching form of love love for humankind not merely based on reciprocity group belonging or any other personal characteristic but an allencompassing love iorio 2013 pope 2013 hummels et al 2019 based on concrete benevolent actions and equal regard jackson 2015 a radical form of love and as radical etymologically stems from radix roots we need to deroot denavitisticate the togetherness and the geographical ingroup solidarity because it is exactly this radical nondividing form of togetherness which is needed to deal with the crisis that potentially affects us all everyone and everywhere a common threat asks for a common response and a common responsibility to protect equality and human rights now and after the crisis independent of age ethnicity and on where you are born or locatedthus such an agapeic radical togetherness is necessary for two principal reasons first as a virological remedy because everyone depends on the efforts of others no matter who or where to let the policies succeed and second togetherness is needed because it signifies what could be called a social remedy to let society at large survive and to halt processes of egoism and atomisation which jeopardise creating or magnifying the tragedy of the failure of the global commonsin a world that has gained social and economic prosperity due to international interdependencies and exchange and in which globally spread viruses can and will occur working together across socially constructed divides to fight these global viruses is not a romantic wishful thinking but an absolute necessity to further shape the international alignment the persistence of a rivalling health care antagonistic nationalism and global inequality will only prolong the rates of transmission and mortality for everyone fisher  bubola 2020 for the demanded togetherness we thus might need to refine and enrich the current concept of solidarity as this is we ascertain still predominated by a thinking in terms of solidarity for an imagined community an us notwithstanding them a populist our country first kind of thinking we would argue that the concept of agape the love of humanity could be seen as a solidarity beyond borders and actionoriented complementation of the equal moral worth of individuals on which the un as well as the eu declaration of human rights is founded as such it could be the normative foundation for global regulations of togetherness and consequently an open and fair access to medical care and vaccines benkler 2006a radical inclusive togetherness that moves beyond ingroup based solidarity and incidental charity would be a hopeful and vital message for a world that finds itself in such a devastating crisis and it would be instrumental as a moral guidance in the new normality of tomorrow yet to let such an agapeic togetherness flourish a lot of work needs to be done still because what is continuously imminent is the notion to fight the virus first nationally as well as internationally and in a largely incompatible manner we would consider these bordering and othering tactics some of which we described above as counterproductive for the world of tomorrow harari 2020 rachman 2020 they represent a stubborn and clinging on at all cost to the ideas of a past that never existed in the same vein neoliberal thinking in the commons of health care which has been has been producing calculative agents reproducing inequalities and a hollowingout of the health care sector lemke 2001 dardot  laval 2013 brown 2015 sparke 2016 will not be conducive for an agapeic togethernessthe interdependence that is becoming even more apparent during this corona crisis is perhaps thus also a chance for a reimagination of the global interconnectedness of humanity calling for systemic changes in the governance of our global world order and perhaps it can learn from and contribute to the interesting discussions about alternatives such as degrowth solidarity economics and social innovations to name a few that are already taking place see for instance dalisa et al 2015 van der have  rubalcaba 2016 jarvis 2019 and hopefully the recent agapeic expressions of support  like china and cuba who sent medical supplies and doctors to italy and south africa respectively bbc 2020 world economic forum 2020 the imf that implemented an emergency fund for the less affluent countries to support their health care imf 2020 academics across the world collaborating on covid19 vaccine and medicine research and the european union who after a lot of pain and struggle installed a sort of support package for the eu as well as a global fund to combat the virus european commission 2020b will have an illuminating and contagious impact for this to develop and grow furtheras long as we regard human life as something we need to care for together and not pass on the burden to the individual  the sick versus the nonsick the young versus the old and the protected versus the vulnerable or to lessaffluent regions or nations  we will be able to retain and preserve the necessary sustainable togetherness that is needed to overcome this crisis if not the powerful idea that only together we will get control over corona might derail in an atomised and vulnerable world of together aloneneedless to say doctors nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease in response to the global pandemic the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges the list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors nurses medical cleaners pathologists paramedics ambulance drivers and health-care administrators in the fight against coronavirus the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers stethoscopes and ventilators as their weapons not to forget medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds hoping to find the antidote to the diseasesince the coronavirus outbreak health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way on top of that many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of dutyevery day the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones the sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end most importantly we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over moreover the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than thisthat being said wed now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some courageous and inspiring doctors from across the globe who lost their lives while saving the lives of covid-19 patientsthe death that broke several hearts in the initial days of coronavirus spread was of dr li wenliang a chinese ophthalmologist who tried to warn fellow practitioners about the potential outbreak of a virus fig 1 unfortunately he was accused of making false claims and misleading the public dr lis warning did not depend on sophisticated laboratory testing or expensive imaging studies but on his own understanding of biological plausibilitythe kind of analysis that clinicians of all specialties could make2 the new york times reported that on january 10 2020 dr li developed a cough after having treated a woman for glaucoma who had unknowingly been infected with the coronavirus probably by her daughter no report suggests that he observed any ophthalmologic complications of the coronavirus infection in his patientthe 34-year-old eye specialist in his weibo story revealed how he had come down with cough and fever after a month of his warning going unnoticedthe doctor had contracted the virus while treating a glaucoma case suffering from corona virus in wuhan dr li passed away on february 7 2020 leaving the people in china and worldwide grieving and angryanother doctor who died of the disease in wuhan was just 29 years old as per the reports he had postponed his lunar new year marriage to serve humanity and treat patients who had been hit by the virus unfortunately he ended up contracting the virus from one of his patients and died a herothe covid-19 wrath is taking no stop in italy and the situation seems to be getting out of hands in the new epicenter of the disease more than 66 doctors who were tested positive for coronavirus in italy have reportedly died according to the head of an italian research institute a total of 8358 health workers have caught the diseasedr roberto stella aged 67 was an italian general practitioner who died on march 10 at the como hospital as confirmed by the towns mayor mario landriscina fig 2 he died of respiratory failure due to coronavirus like other heroes dr stella had contracted the virus while actively taking care of patients and guiding them on proper careanother case that shattered millions of hearts across the world was of a nurse who has reportedly taken her own life after being tested positive out of the fear of spreading the disease to othersa 67-year-old physician in italy who despite running out of his protective gear continued to treat the patients ended up sacrificing his life furthermore a 34-year-old doctor daniela trezzi who had been working on the front line at a hospital in lombardy died after catching the disease her death was confirmed by the national federation of nurses of italyjean-jacques razafindranazy fig 3 was the first french doctor who died while treating coronavirus patients the 68-year-old accident and emergency department doctor was retired but the passion that he had for serving humanity was undying thus he volunteered to help his colleagues save the lives of people as the number of incoming patients continued to increasethe retired doctor was working in an emergency ward at the lille university hospital where he caught the disease his death was announced through a social media post titled my father a hero written by his familydr usama riaz fig 4 a young 26-year-old became the first pakistani doctor to die of coronavirus he remained on the forefront screening people returning from abroad from the pakistaniran border at a hospital in gilgit-baltistan he was busy fighting the deadly virus with utmost bravery and confidence when he contracted the virus upon showing symptoms he was rushed to the hospital and was put on a ventilator but he could not make it he proved to be a real hero by sacrificing his life while saving the lives of manysixty-three-year-old dr adil el tayar fig 5 became the first frontline health-care worker to die of coronavirus in the uk on march 25 the organ transplant consultant was performing his duty at st marys and st georges hospitals in london when he contracted the virus he started showing symptoms in mid-march due to which he immediately self-isolated himself in a matter of 12 days he went from a perfectly fit doctor treating patients to a covid-19 victim lying in a hospital morguethe iranian doctor shirin rouhani fig 6 also lost her life while treating coronavirus patients her determination and will power was such that she continued to treat patients till her last breath even when she herself was on iv she knew she could not rest because of the shortage of doctors and medical workers to cater to the needs of patientsthe philippine heart center announced the death of the first doctor dr israel bactol fig 7 who was a senior adult cardiology fellow-in-training the medical professionals in the country are devastated and so are the citizens while grieving the death they have strengthened their resolve to make it the first and last deathas of april 11 2020 a total of 20043 people died due to the covid-19 pandemic outbreak in america while approximately 521084 cases have been registered in the national healthcare systemdoctors face the contagious disease daily as they work around the clock to keep the situation under control however with the rising cases it was inevitable for someone within the medical field to contract the viral infectionthe american college of emergency recently reported two emergency room doctors have come down with the virus in the past week out of which a senior emergency physician doctor frank gabin passed away a few days back the good doctors contracted the disease after wearing the same surgical mask for a week the inadequate supply of personal protection equipment ppe for healthcare workers is the primary reason for this tragedy the other physician is a 40-year-old washington-based practitioner both doctors are under observation as their colleagues try to prevent their condition from escalatingthe coronavirus crisis in india is also steadily engulfing the nation so far there have been 8339 cases of the coronavirus reported in india and 249 deaths the current statistics include 774 recovered cases as of 11th april 2020 moreover over 50 healthcare professionals have been tested positive for corona virus in india the first three doctors that were tested had no prior travel history or symptoms it is believed that all the doctors contracted the disease through their patients an andheri-based doctor is currently under quarantine with his family as all members have tested positive for the diseasefurthermore the first medical practitioner to die was dr shatrughan panjwani a private practitioner from indore the 60-year-old physician passed away on 9th april 2020 leaving behind many mournerswhile the deadly virus has brought attention to the inadequacies in the health-care systems across the globe doctors and health-care workers have been risking their lives to save all of us they are also risking the lives of their family members which indeed is a huge sacrifice on top of that the shortage of face masks shields and protective gear is not helping and this makes the efforts of the medical workers even more extraordinary on occasion of the doctors day march 30 2020 usa and australia the stories of the medical heroes putting themselves on the forefront to fight the virus are inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time they deserve all the appreciation and support the sacrifice of doctors and healthcare workers across the globe will not go to waste humanity will always be grateful to them for what they are doing during these unprecedented times the respect for healthcare professionals has grown manifolds in the hearts of people it is good to see that the government of india along with the governments worldwide have decided to allocate more budget for healthcare in their respective countries the world is taking the health healthcare professionals and hospitals more seriously as it appears more work is expected to be done for hospitals and intensive care units icus to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in india as well as in countries across the worldthe world expects a sars-cov-2 vaccine against the covid-19 disease to appear so that life can return to a near-normal condition all social economic and healthcare system plans have built in such a discovery vaccine safety and efficacy requires meticulous testing and oversight under the current development testing and production schedules however vaccines may prove to be ethically dubious medically dangerous and socially volatile the purpose of this paper is to better inform the public to be able to assess vaccine promises about the novel vaccines being produced and to tolerate delays and uncertaintymost experts agree that having a safe effective affordable and widely available vaccine will be the only way to end the pandemic both medically and socially the pandemics medical end will come when about 70 of the worlds populationroughly 56 billion peopleis immune through either natural immunity or vaccination to end the pandemics social effects people will need confidence that they can again participate in their work and recreational activities without fear of contracting the disease however repeated promises of a rapidly produced vaccine ethically and scientifically dubious routes being taken to develop a vaccine and planned distribution systems favoring rich countries may strengthen the antivaccination movement ultimately lengthening rather than shortening the pandemic we can overcome these deficiencies by making the entire process transparent to the public and the healthcare community this entails providing consistent honest assessments of vaccine development progress disseminating sophisticated pro-vaccination education and developing an equitable distribution programcandidate vaccines developed in the laboratory normally must demonstrate that they can safely provide long-term immunity first in laboratory animals and then in progressively larger groups of human volunteers many current sars-cov-2 vaccine developers are skipping abbreviating or dangerously modifying these steps the us warp speed project has said that it is doing animal testing of its eight candidate vaccines in parallel with human testing
3 other groups are using methods that have never produced a successful vaccine such as messenger rna encoding the coronavirus surface protein or using an adenovirus to deliver the same proteins gene
4 such ethically and medically dubious shortcuts will eventually engender fear and mistrust in potential vaccine recipients especially because few people are aware of how these procedural changes may affect the vaccines safety and efficacy when they ultimately find out this may dissuade many people from being immunizedan initial and vital step in designing vaccine studies is to define the safety efficacy and other criteria called a target product profile tpp that must be met for the test vaccine to progress to the next stage most new medications fail to meet their targets during testing table 1 a major tpp is assuring the compatibility and stability of the vaccines adjuvant used to improve the immune response and antigen this is normally done through in vivo tests in animals and can take months if not years to complete if the results demonstrate that the vaccine is dangerous it does not move on to human testing for example animal testing of some non-covid-a9 coronavirus vaccines has shown an increased risk of the animals getting the disease rather than preventing it
5

6 other animal tests reveal that vaccines are ineffective that is they do not trigger antibody production in fact medications often fail to demonstrate that they can successfully modify the disease or health concern they are designed to address only about 12 of pharmaceutical candidates that go through this rigorous evaluation including vaccines make the transition from the laboratory to clinical trials

the basic moral concern is the potential danger to the health of human test subjects and eventually the large number of vaccine recipients in truth the riskbenefit ratio is acceptable for fully informed volunteer test subjects even when they are knowingly receiving a potentially lethal virus without transparency to the public however it is ethically dubious to expose the public to the possible risk of harm from unsuspected side effects or ineffectiveness this may outweigh any potential benefits of abbreviated vaccine production any such results will feed the inherent distrust of vaccination among the antivaccination community diminishing the chance to ultimately immunize at least 70 of the world to achieve herd immunity to ameliorate this issue we ought at the least to publicly describe the risks human-challenge study hcs subjects are taking make the criteria for vaccine approval transparent to the public and healthcare community and admit what still is not known about any vaccine before it is released including the chance of recipients having complications or not being immune to sars-cov-2even if all testing and manufacturing steps work well producing a safe and effective sars-cov-2 vaccine will probably be a long process because trust is essential to maintain viable leadership truth telling is a key element in the fight against covid-19 while dishonesty and hyperbole will undermine all other efforts this includes full disclosure about uncertainty around vaccine availability which will greatly disappoint for those unfamiliar with medical science for politicians it will be ego challenging pharmaceutical company stockholders will fear for the enormous investments being made on balance the public will tolerate the truth much better than repeated unfulfilled promises thus we ought to clearly and consistently state that no one knows when a safe effective sars-cov-2 vaccine will be available although we are using all available resources to make that happenit is unclear whether in their haste to produce a viable vaccine most researchers will follow the who criteria for ethical hcs trials although even these standards may not be adequate to protect research subjects following these protocols may reduce negative public reaction but if significant numbers of people were to die as a result of taking part in vaccine studies following hcs protocols then a widespread public reaction should be anticipated as hope and mcmillan wrote the idea of giving a healthy person a disease is so alien to the publics expectations of medicine and medical research that it is vital to conduct such studies within a well-considered and transparent set of guidelines and regulatory processes
25doing hcs may raise additional ethical and legal questions these include whether vaccine trial participants can volunteer for a potentially lethal experiment whether physicians can violate their duty to do no harm whether social and political pressure and general misinformation allows for true informed consent and if this type of study conforms to the norm of minimal risk or minimal harm generally undefined described by most research guidelines
26yet if actual volunteers not military members as has been suggested receive enough information to give meaningful informed consent and the risks and benefits are publicized in advance instead of after complications or deaths using this testing method will pass ethical muster with most people in philosophy the method is similar to the classic trolley dilemma where one person may be sacrificed to save a group in the sars-cov-2 vaccine trials the rewardrisk ratio is significantly higher
27not only will hcs provide a faster and less-expensive answer to whether the vaccine works but it will also require many fewer individuals to be subjected to the risks from an experimental and possibly ineffective vaccine the small number of participating volunteers will provide numerous benefits to the world including saving tens or even hundreds of thousands of lives and hastening a return to normal social functioning with its economic and public health benefits
28nations survive because in times of need generosity and supporting others is the norm in nearly every culture the privilege of wealth or the good fortune to produce a vaccine engenders the responsibility to equitably share rather than hoard resources pragmatically as members of the worlds population we have a moral duty to eliminate lethal diseases when possible including among the least-advantaged populations any vaccine allocation decision made behind john rawls veil of ignorance would result in equitable distribution
38 since diseases do not recognize national borders it is in everyones interest to widely distribute the vaccine to address this issue the worlds governments vaccine producers and funders and healthcare agencies should immediately devise a plan to equitably share all vaccines that are proven to be safe and effectivewhile no one can predict how long it will take to produce a viable vaccine even using these abbreviated testing methods many of the potential ethical social and political problems raised in this paper can be mitigated by transparency some vaccine developers such as the coalition led by the us nih have publicly detailed many aspects of their process at least in a format available to and understandable by biological scientists and healthcare professionals what we now need is for all vaccine developers to do likewise all private and government leaders involved in the process should use the news and social media in as sophisticated persistent and entertaining a manner as the antivaxxers are doing to clearly explain in lay terms what they are doing how long it may take and the chances of any one developer producing an ultimately successful vaccine only when potential recipients understand the processs complexities as well as their personal risks will they be able to tolerate the uncertainties in our near future
78-year-old alice lost her only sibling charles age 69 to covid-19 alice and charles lived in different towns but were very close speaking daily on the phone for hours they were practicing christians and had similar interests he often drove to visit her they enjoyed spending time with each other and doing things together despite having coronary artery disease and hypertension charles was independent and happy alice was shocked to learn he had been hospitalized for covid-19 pneumonia and that he was intubated and on a ventilator a bereavement coordinator reached out to her which she very much appreciated however alice declined an offer to visit charles frightened of contracting the disease herself she understood that she too was at high risk for dying of covid-19 because of her age although she tried to reach out to him via skype charles died with only the bereavement coordinator and hospital staff at his side alice completed the funeral arrangements via skype charles was cremated without her being present and his ashes were delivered to her several weeks after his passing alice was plagued by remorse for abandoning her dying brother she yearned to be with charles and could not believe he was gone she fluctuated between numbness overwhelming sadness and intense guilt she could not stop thinking that she failed her brother during his last days she was having trouble sleeping and was beginning to lose weight but did not meet criteria for major depression she liked to reminisce about fond memories of charles and knew he was with god she had confidence in the religious belief that she would see him again one day she also knew that she wanted to live and that she would carry charles in her heart for the rest of her days she continued to talk with the hospital bereavement coordinator weekly an important source of solace they often discussed the details of her plan to hold a memorial service in celebration of charles life after pandemic restrictions are lifted
bereavement is the experience of losing a loved one and grief is the natural response to this loss typically acute grief is intensely painful and disruptive and often feels overwhelming and unmanageable still most people adapt to the death of a loved one along with the accompanying changes in life circumstances we accept a changed relationship to the person who died and find ways to honor them and keep them in our hearts we restore our sense of purpose and meaning and possibilities for happiness grief quiets as we do so finding a place in our life however the process of adaptation takes time grief is complex multi-faceted and time varying it progresses erratically the tremendous upheaval created by losing a loved one typically produces a raft of mixed feelings and confusing thoughts alice is experiencing an especially intense period of acute grief because of the sudden onset and rapid course of her brothers illness as well as deeply troubling thoughts because she was unable to be at his side when he passed
bereaved people usually pass certain milestones as they adapt to their loss they learn to understand and accept their grief and manage painful emotions they begin to restore a sense of purpose and meaning and see possibilities for a promising future they strengthen their ongoing relationships and restore a sense of mattering ie the feeling that ones life is important and makes a significant difference and belonging ie the feeling that one fits in in a world without their loved one present they can tell the story of their loved ones death to themselves and share it with others they gradually return to a world of reminders and realize they have an ongoing meaningful connection to the deceased that is internalized and permanent bereaved persons can use the acronym healing as a simple way to remember these milestones see httpscomplicatedgriefcolumbiaeduwp-contentuploads202006healing-milestones-what-grievers-can-expect-with-covid-19-addendumpdfmost people adapt to a loss naturally not easily but often without deliberate effort however this process can be derailed this usually happens because there is something about the meaning or experience of the loss that is troubling in a way that the bereaved person is unable to resolve this might be related to characteristics of the bereaved person the specialness of the relationship with the person who died circumstances of the death or the context in which the death occurred certain thoughts feelings and behaviors that occur naturally during acute grief can derail the adaptive process the acronym derailers summarizes the more common impediments to adaption see httpscomplicatedgriefcolumbiaeduwp-contentuploads202006healing-milestones-what-grievers-can-expect-with-covid-19-addendumpdf when adaptation is stalled or halted the result is prolonged grief disorder pgd1

2 recently included as a new diagnosis in the world health organization international classification of diseases 11th edition icd-113 and now also proposed as a formal diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder 5th edition dsm-5 diagnosis recently posted for public comment4 this syndrome is characterized by persistent and pervasive yearning longing or preoccupying thoughts and memories of the deceased accompanied by other evidence of grief-related emotional pain causing significant distress or impairment in functioning and lasting at least 6 months and exceeding the timeframe expected by social cultural or religious norms the circumstances context and consequences of deaths during the covid-19 pandemic comprise risk factors that will likely elevate rates of pgd table 1
 to understand why the pandemic holds risk factors for pgd and how they might be mitigated we can take a closer look at the process of adapting to loss and the common ways it can be derailedthe dramatic upheaval caused by the death of a loved one often triggers troubling feelings and thoughts in addition to yearning and sadness most people feel anxiety guilt or anger bereaved people are inclined to protest the death and have a natural tendency to imagine alternative scenarios in which their loved one did not die most feel survivor guilt although there is little research on the topic of survivor guilt we believe that it is a universal human feeling while it is widely acknowledged as a natural human response much of the discussion about this issue is theoretical or philosophical5 this guilt can be understood as a sense of uneasiness or discomfort about having been spared from some adversity  the discomfort is about feeling it was not fair or the person did not deserve to be spared almost all bereaved people seek to avoid situations that trigger intense emotional pain although such thoughts feelings and behaviors are natural if they take control they can derail the healing process risk factors are characteristics of a bereavement experience that increase the likelihood of developing pgd1

6 or another mental health problem risk factors make derailers more difficult to resolve or set aside examples of risk factors include those related to the bereaved person such as previous depression or anxiety history of insecure attachment and previous trauma or loss risk factors related to the relationship to the deceased include an especially close identity-defining relationship such as a romantic partner or being a parent to the deceased other risk factors are related to circumstances context or consequences of death examples include sudden violent death stressful life circumstances other concurrent losses or important secondary losses table 1 lists probable pgd risk factors related to the covid-19 pandemic not only are the circumstances of deaths occurring during this pandemic likely to increase the risk for pgd but the measures taken to mitigate pandemic spread may also enhance the riskdeath from covid-19 is often sudden and unexpected restrictions in place because of the pandemic have changed the experience of dying healthcare systems have implemented stringent limits on visiting ill patients in acute adult inpatient settings permission to visit in person may be granted to a loved one only briefly or not at all as a result it is healthcare professionals support staff or chaplains and not family members who are by the sides of dying persons often too these healthcare personnel are wearing personal protective equipment which limits their ability to connect with their patients these difficult circumstances increase the burden for family members dealing with the loss of a loved one during this pandemic comprehending the reality of a loss is difficult under any circumstances but even more so when the death is sudden and a loved one is left to die alone
in addition to becoming a focus of intense preoccupation and guilt after he died alices inability to visit charles left her with a strange feeling of uncertainty about his death she had trouble understanding how her brotherher best friendcould really be gone in her mind he was young and healthy  the way he had been when she last saw him she would have struggled with this had she been at his side but not having seen him made the feeling of disbelief even stronger his death did not compute for her
adding to the burden of not being with a dying loved one is the unprecedented disruption of cultural and religious rituals that provide many mourners with a supportive social context funeral homes are overwhelmed and sometimes unable to pick up bodies in a timely manner in-person funeral arrangements and services are sharply curtailed during the pandemic with additional constraints for those whose loved ones died from covid-19 only a limited number of family members can convene to make funeral arrangements and such preparations must often be completed virtually faith- and culture-based practices such as embalming washing of the body kissing of the deceased and open casket viewing are not permitted private viewing is often not possible and when allowed is offered only to immediate family members close friends as well as bereaved family members who are ill in isolation or at-risk must stay home mourners must refrain from hugging or touching one another as any physical contact before during and after funeral services is strongly discouraged due to covid-19 travel restrictions create further obstacles to usual practices mourners and their supportive community must find new ways to observe these rituals the bereaved must postpone conventional memorial services to an uncertain later date decisions are made to postpone memorials as alice did or to conduct them by live stream
alice and charles were religious christians and it troubled her that she was unable to give him the send-off she dearly wished she could she felt awkward to make arrangements for his remains by skype and was sad and guilty because she could not be present for the cremation all of this weighed heavily on her mind she did however gain some solace from planning a memorial for charles when restrictions are lifted it heartened her to discuss these plans with a bereavement counselor though she understood the need to forego this she longed to have her friends and family around her as she mourned charles she wanted to hug them and just sit with them she yearned for the others who loved charles to mourn together and share stories grieving alone felt almost like a physical deprivation
the context in which bereavement is occurring also is challenging virtually all social gathering places have been shuttered due to physical distancing schools and workplaces are closed congregations are not permitted in places of worship and informal gatherings of large groups are disallowed deaths happening with stay-at-home orders in place can intensify the sense of social isolation and loneliness that is a part of the natural experience of many grieving individuals
for alice the inability to spend time at church has been very painful she regularly prays at home and she on one occasion was able to talk with the minister but it was not the same as being in church alice believes she would be able to feel charles presence more strongly in the church building and she feels she needs god now more than evercovid-19 mitigation policies are associated with other forms of loss that are also stressful there are high rates of unemployment furloughs salary reductions and an increase in homelessness many are experiencing disruptions in living arrangements and painful physical separation from close friends and family there is widespread fear of contamination possibly increased by frequent reminders of death rates and exposure to distressing stories and other emotionally activating media coverage such challenges can make it more difficult to resolve thoughts and feelings that can derail adaptation in the absence of mitigating efforts a rise in pgd cases is a likely sequel to this pandemic
in the back of her mind alice had a constant fear of getting sick she tried to ignore it but was sometimes unable to do so she felt an urge to talk this over with charles and this reminded her that she and charles will never talk on the phone again  that they will never take their favorite walks or have lunch in their favorite restaurant she tried her best to ignore these thoughts because they evoked pain so strong that her whole body hurt the many stresses and the need for social distancing made it more difficult for alice to accept the reality that charles was gone
there is a pressing need to implement measures that might lessen the adverse consequences of covid-19-era bereavement we might do this by educating the lay public about grief and healing milestones and ways the pandemic might affect bereavement and grief we can promote awareness of derailers  the thoughts feelings and behaviors that can stall or halt the grieving process these include a view of the future as empty and meaningless a strong focus on imagining alternative scenarios andor rewriting our role in the story of the death excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss social isolation survivor guilt or a persistent strong aversion to experiencing positive emotions2 disruptions in eating sleeping or exercise can also make it difficult to restore a sense of wellbeing just as the risk of covid-19 is greater for older people and especially those with chronic physical illness so too the risk for pgd is likely higher in those who are older and who have a psychiatric history family members might be encouraged to closely monitor these vulnerable groupsclinicians in both primary care and mental health settings are now practicing telemedicine there are clear advantages to in-person visits and many older patients currently have difficulty navigating and becoming accustomed to the digital world however telemedicine services can be especially convenient for some older adults and over time patients may become more comfortable using this modality this could increase access to care for those for whom travel is difficult or impossible clinicians can learn about the natural grieving process the healing milestones and the unique challenges faced by the bereaved during the pandemic they can learn how to promote adaptation and how to recognize and address derailers clinicians can help by active empathic listening during virtual discussions that are warm inviting and open-ended healthcare providers can help bereaved individuals understand and accept their grief they can assist grieving individuals to modulate their emotional pain by naming emotions observing and reflecting on them considering how they are affected by thoughts mindfulness exercises or any other emotion regulation strategies they have in their toolbox clinicians can invite bereaved people to talk about the story of the death and to voice and discuss any concerns they have about their loved ones illness or treatment sleep disturbance can be managed by providing advice on healthy sleep practices and other nonpharmacological techniques sedative-hypnotic medications should be avoided or used judiciously for short periods pgd is a new diagnosis recognizing this condition is important because it is associated with impaired physical health cognitive decrements mental disorders including substance use disorders and increased suicide risk reduced quality of life and premature mortality7 8 9 10 11 bereavement might also trigger depression anxiety and trauma-related disorders without pgd identification of a treatable disorder and appropriate management andor referral to mental health services is therefore important bereaved individuals also may benefit from referral to virtual grief counseling or psychotherapy services additionally online group and self-help interventions may provide meaningful support for the bereavedwhen pgd is diagnosed psychotherapeutic interventions are the first-line treatment complicated grief psychotherapy cgt is the best studied of these12 13 14 and other similar approaches are also available15 16 17 18 19 among these are internet-based cognitive behavioral-based therapies that use strategies to increase involvement in enjoyable activities and reduce avoidance of reminders of the deceased1 cgt is a short-term approach developed and tested by researchers across the country cgt addresses derailers and fosters progression through healing milestones participants in three randomized controlled trials funded by the national institute of mental health had a substantially better response to cgt than interpersonal psychotherapy antidepressant citalopram treatment or a pill placebo12 13 14 in other words depression-specific treatments are relatively ineffective in relieving pgd symptoms but grief-specific interventions like cgt are effective this observation underscores the importance of diagnosing pgd being careful not to misconstrue grief symptoms as depression cgt is an accessible method of grief therapy that can be learned by any licensed mental health professional by utilizing a range of training methods such as online workshops and other methods currently offered by the center for complicated grief clinicians can learn to administer this treatment effectively as with any grief therapy attention to therapist self-observation self-compassion and self-care is important cgt is currently being provided by trained therapists around the world using telehealth learning about the healing milestones and derailers can also be helpful for friends and family who want to support bereaved peoplein summary the public health emergency defined by covid-19 has brought elevated rates of bereavement as well as unique challenges that can increase the risk of the development of pgd a new diagnosis for which proven efficacious treatments are already available such treatments promise to provide relief for multitudes of people worldwide who have long suffered from unending grief continued research in this area holds the promise of identifying protective and risk factors for pgd especially in the context of the covid-19 pandemic studies testing hypothesized mechanisms for the development of pgd and other psychiatric conditions in the wake of bereavement also are needed putative mechanisms of action and efficacy of in-person and remotely delivered interventions should be examined additionally preventative interventions should be developed and their mechanisms of action and effectiveness tested for use during acute grief to mitigate the mental health consequences of bereavement especially for older peoplecovid-19 has opened up new opportunities to deliver interventions that can alleviate the suffering of grieving individuals the federal government has issued emergency orders to relax regulations to increase telehealth services access across the country the american psychiatric20 and psychological21 associations have created resources for mental health professionals to learn about developments in telehealth delivery alice might take advantage of this if her grief continues unabated over the next six months she could contact the center for complicated grief httpscomplicatedgriefcolumbiaedu to find a teletherapist trained to provide efficacious treatment for pgdsince covid-19 will leave a lasting impact on our community we call for immediate action to educate practitioners in recognition and treatment of pgd and to make telehealth policies permanent beyond the pandemic this would ensure continued access to much-needed care for bereaved individuals especially those like many older adults who may be isolated with limited capacity to travel andor inhibited by stigma in seeking mental healthcarejsg wrote the initial draft of the manuscript and case historymks and jsg revised the manuscript including all content and provided final approvalmks provided the tablethe authors report no conflicts with any product mentioned or concept discussed in this articlemany old and modern cities have been built on terrain that was previously vegetated and part of biologically diverse ecosystems this was often on productive farmland that was not protected from encroachment as municipalities expanded and opened pristine areas to development the encroachment continues as rural citizens and their families are attracted to urban centers for the way of life they seemed to offer this starts with employment possibilities education for workers children and family health services as manufacturingindustrial operations and large and small businesses that serviced them spurs economic development agricultural projects are located mainly away from population centers be they major metropolises or smaller cities they provide food security for urban citizens through brought into markets in-ground crops bush crops and tree crops they cultivate and through animal husbandry eg beef and dairy cattle poultry hogs sheep the last chapter described how manufacturingindustrial endeavors can present potential harm to the health of urban and rural citizens and to natural resource rich ecosystems that help sustain them and how to find solutions to the problems this chapter will discuss the problems that food production methods present the threats they pose to urban populations that are generally distant from them and possible solutions to such problemsit should be noted that animal husbandry range stock will cause little environmental harm if herds and flocks are properly tended however commercial high production operations can create massive waste-related problems eg manure urine  pathogens eg salmonella e coli listeria coronavirus foot and mouth disease added to this are the wastes of blood innards bones heads feet skin feathers from the slaughter and dressing of ruminants and poultry in addition there are the problems from the overuse of antibiotics and growth hormones anabolic steroids delivered to food animals via feed or patches the overuse of antibiotics for animal husbandry may stimulate the mutation of target bacteria to antimicrobial strains that can resist antibiotics treatment of human bacterial infections and result in patient death the risk to human health is a worry to the medical community 1 world wide it was estimated that in 2014 there were 700000 deaths attributed to microbial resistant infections 2 3 this problem can begin to be alleviated by using antibiotics only for sick animals and not an entire herd or flock and research that focuses on medicines to kill the existing antibiotic strains this should be coupled with the elimination of the use of growth hormones in commercial operations where food animals or food-giving animals are raised residues of these antibiotics and growth hormones have been found in the meats from food animals and over time can build up in consumers billions in cities and be dangerous to their long term health we will discuss what governments are doing to minimize the use of chemicals in animal husbandry operationsmany in the global population  especially babies young children and the aged in africa and the middle east suffered with chronic malnutrition and starvation from famine in 2017 this is the result of drought people being displaced from their homes by warring factions and decisions not to allow humanitarian food supplies to reach starving populations thus exacerbating the famine problem if there is agricultural land that adds to the food security and it is nearby expanding cities this land should be preserved and neither encroached upon by growing populations nor be subject to seizure by eminent domain laws for economic development here we have a moral question should cities limit population growth
from
and immigration
to prevent encroachment the flow of people to cities can be arrested if urban attractions are not driving forces this means improving the services available in rural areas by subsidizing farming increasing employment opportunities and upgrading and increasing educational offerings there should also be improvement in rural health care facilities with professional and support staff and well stocked with basic medications and with ready access to diagnostic medical equipment this solution is easily prescribed but difficult to bring to fruition mainly for economic reasons but also by the reluctance of some trained personnel to move to rural areas such as those needed to provide professional health services nonetheless a start in bringing this prescription to reality may slow urban population influx from in-migration and lessen the possible encroachment on productive landas indicated above it is good practice to preserve farmland near an urban center not only from population encroachment but also from processes that can degrade good agricultural soil and affect the quality and yield of food crops grown and hence food security the former action requires a municipal decree that will prevent squatting and establishment of shantytowns on protected land the latter requires that consultants assess erosion potential of farm acreage and provide solutions to prevent erosion by wind eg change plow and seed method to slice and seed plant vegetation wind breaks at peripheries of croplands or by flowing water after heavy rains eg by diversion channels to safe discharge locations if this could be a problem when protected land is to be used for agriculture experts have to determine what water requirements will be for crops that are planned and consider how this might change if crops are rotated alternated and thus affect urban water security will crops be irrigated or rain fed or be sustained by a combination of both if irrigation is necessary will the irrigation technique to be used preserve water supplies eg drip irrigation that needs initial investment and subsequent maintenance or will it lose precious water to evaporation during arm irrigation will the irrigation water come from aquifers or surface waterways if from aquifers is the seasonal discharge balanced by recharge so as to sustain water supplies and prevent subsidence as may occur if subsidence were to take place there can be additional problems that affect a population that were discussed in a previous chapter eg greater susceptibility to flooding ruptured infrastructure in planning for the future there is the question of how will projected climate changes affect availability of the agricultural water supply over time and perhaps require changes in crops that should be grown
genetic modifications can produce seeds that may protect farm crops from weeds and repel pests that harm crops or diminish yields thereby avoiding the application of chemicals to do the job this eliminates chemical residues on vegetables and fruits that if not thoroughly washed can enter the human food chain and potentially be harmful to consumers however ingestion of gmo grown products could be a risk to human health as suggested by controlled experiments in these rats developed lesions suffered organ damage and died after consuming gmo grown potatoes however a critical review of the literature suggested that the published research left an incomplete evaluation regarding the safety toxicity of gm crops eaten by humans and fed to animals this is because there was no unified experimental methods so that reports could not be properly reviewed and perhaps more important experiments could not be repeated a key to validation of experimental results 4 there have been failures in gm grown corn that contributes to mutated resistant insects that attack gm growing crops and pesticide protected crops for example the rootworm that infected corn developed a resistance to gmo corn treated with bacillus thuringiensis bt 5 6 in a sense this can be likened to the overuse of antibiotics in cattle feed consumed in feedlots that resulted in the mutation of bacteria to strains resistant to antibiotic therapy there is the fear that during pollination of gm crops the pollen will be carried to non-gmo fields and affect the purity of their crops in capulalpam mexico  scientists documented the discovery of transgenic genes in the mexican native corn in 2013 mexico banned the entry of gm corn it is because of uncertainty of their effects on human and animal health and food security that gm crops are not allowed in the european union several nations in africa and elsewhere in addition some researchers believe that there is the potential for an allergic reaction in humans from ingestion of gm based corn products organically grown foodstuffs obviate the chemicals or gms problems but do not produce the mass of crops needed to feed large and growing global and urban populations as was the case for the gmo green revolution that allowed many countries to improve their food securitymicrobes associated with plants from biomes on all continents except antarctica have been studied in great detail and some identified as to the characteristic they give to plants that assist agricultural projects  these have been cultured batch produced and used to coat seeds the first product of this effort indigo cotton cotton seeds coated with a proprietary mix of microbes bacteria and fungi were sown in west texas in 2016 this resulted in an 11 improvement in yield by protecting the crop against drought stress 7 similarly treated seeds of soy rice wheat and corn coated with proprietary microbe mixtures have been produced with like results this adds to the food security of city and mega-city populations dependent on foods from outside the urban locations complementing advances in natural hybridization and gmo that impart seed properties that protect crop yield the company is working on microbial products that can reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizer and that offer protection against pests
another major food security concern for growing urban and global populations are problems with animal husbandry during growth and after slaughter and distribution it is most threatening to ecosystems close to where thousands to millions of animals are bred in close quarters eg cattle feed lots and commercial chicken farms respectively and where they are taken for slaughter the problems are how to capture and control the wastes and how to safely use them or dispose of them so as not to contaminate soils and waterways or aquifers these are manure and urine from cattle plus pigs sheep and goats and fecal matter from chickens plus ducks turkeys added to this are slaughter house wastes fluids blood wash water and solids heads innards skins bones feathers plus pathogens eg salmonella e coli listeria coronavirus foot and mouth disease from dressing the food animals if these wastes are not collected and put to use by manufacturers or not disposed of securely to prevent interaction with the environment they can pollute and diminish food production and contaminate natural resources in terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems this may be by rainwater runoff of fecal matter rich in nutrient into food fish habitats eg oceans estuaries rivers the nutrient rich runoff fuels algal blooms that poison habitats with toxins or cause depletion of oxygen eutrophication as cited previously both toxins and eutrophication can result in great fish kills also leakage of pollutants in waters from animal husbandry locales into soils can contaminate crops this might be by unregulated disposal of solid matter that allows rainwater to interact with soils and as previously noted move dissolved contaminants into soils and by seepage through soils into aquifers thereby contaminating them as noted in an earlier paragraph free range stock will not cause such environmental harm when herds are properly tended eg prevent overgrazing but will have fewer but organically bred food animals to sellto appreciate the extent of the animal husbandry waste problem we can examine the issue with thousands and thousands of tons of manure generated at cattle feedlots each head of cattle in a feedlot can drop 1520 times the mass of manure as does one person a lactating dairy cow can excrete 44 times a persons output 8 thus a feedlot with 50000 cattle would excrete the same mass of manure daily of about 800000 people there are 32 such lots licensed in kansas usa state with well over 2000000 heads of cattle in feedlots the sheer mass and volume of manure that has to be disposed of and well cleansed of pathogens and residues of growth hormones anabolic steroids and antibiotics used in animal husbandry this can be accomplished in three ways done properly this can reduce the risk of contamination of water and soils that can negatively affect food delivered to urban centers as well as clean water security and limit the evolution of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria that threaten the healthcare community topics that will be treated in following paragraphs pigs and sheep raised in close quarters and that are infused with growth hormones and antibiotics generate masses of solid wastes that should be treated as described below for cattlean initial disposal method used was to spread raw manure over acreage with its contained pathogens and residues of growth hormones and antibiotics mobilization of these pollutants by rainwater melting snow or floodwater has contaminated nearby surface waters by inflow and via leakage into soils and seepage through soils into aquifers ingestion of these residues from soil grown and irrigated foodstuffs that are not thoroughly washed can be health threatening over time to consumers by bioaccumulation in body organs in the end the volume of manure generated daily overwhelmed the available acreage and required the use of other disposal methods that would not endanger people and ecosystems planning teams for building a new city have to determine possible health risks may originate from previous use of what appear to be good terrain for development but that may have been for animal husbandry if so the teams have to assess how and where wastes were disposed of and the efficiency of such disposalone disposal method uses heat generated by manure fermentation to kill pathogens at or close to the waste accumulation site masses of manure are stacked up and with time ferment and heat up from within to temperatures that eliminate pathogens growth hormones  and antibiotics 131 f but 160 f for 15 days higher temperatures will kill beneficial microbes  a problem with this method is that the high temperatures do not reach the outer edges of the stacks leaving a significant amount of the contaminants active 9 10 these would have to be retreatedanother fermentation method to cleanse cattle manure is to compost it in large rotatable drums that hold thousands of pounds of manure that are turned once a week for six weeks this mixes and aerates the manure thus distributing the built up heat 131 f but 160 f throughout the mass eliminating 90 of the health threatening components in this way the tonnage of manure changed to compost is reduced by 60 the sterilized nutrient rich manure product can be dried bagged and sold as fertilizer that also enhances moisture retention by soils the manure product can also be dried pressed into briquets and combusted to produce energy 9 10 this can be an economic benefit to feedlot ownerschickens produce an average of 0054 pound of manure daily 8 a commercial operation with one million chickens would produce 27 lbs 12 14 kg of manure daily or 54 lbs 245 kg daily for two million chickens the manure is nutrient rich nitrogen and phosphorus but is a carrier of disease and internal parasites when this is spread on fields as a disposal method runoff during rainstorms can carry the waste to discharge into productive rivers estuaries and oceans that may be serving the interests of urban populations as discussed earlier the nutrient rich matter stimulates algal and toxic dinoflagellates growth when algae die they decompose using oxygen in the water to the point where there is no oxygen for fish and a resulting massive fish kill including oysters and clams  when toxic dinoflagellates die they release a neurotoxin into the water that manifests itself in the ocean as a red tide and millions of dead fish this causes a break in the aqueous food web and temporarily diminishes food fish security for coastal communities cities and towns villages as well as causing a temporary economic disruption for fisheries instead of spreading the chicken manure on fields and causing ecological and economic problems many commercial poultry producers are composting and aging the manure for 23 months and then recycling it as fertilizers the perdue chicken producer set up a large scale controlled composting operation that has profitably processed 650000 tons 591000 tonnes of chicken manure waste from more than 48 million chickens during 16 years to produce certified organic fertilizer 11
urine from feedlots that is not captured and properly treated before discharging it at the surface can seep through soil into groundwater and contaminate it with the chemical nitrate groundwater carries the nitrate slowly down flow commonly at 15 ft 30150 cm a day depending on the aquifer rock permeability if there is a population 5 mi 8 km down flow out of sight out of mind that uses the groundwater as its primary source a 5 ft a day flow rate would bring the nitrate contaminated water from a feedlot to unaware users in about 14 years if urine input were to stop it would take 14 years for the contaminated aquifer water to clear a municipal or individual well 5 mi away if the aquifer flow rate is less than the 5 ft 150 cm a day then the time to reach a user or for contaminated water to clean the well is longer this is a possible problem planners have to deal with untreated nitrate-laced water can be unknowingly used to prepare baby formula and the subsequent bioaccumulation of nitrate in a babys system has caused blue baby sickness a type of nitrogen narcosis it is important for a planning team that proposes to use aquifer water for a new city or more likely redevelopment of a city to accommodate its growing population to do four things first is to have analyses made of the water to check its potability or need for treatment second is to determine what projects are or were up flow and what contaminants were or could have been released as untreated effluents onto aquifer recharge areas remember that recharge areas are extensive so that surveys of what possible contaminant sources might be in the recharge zones or have been there in the recent past have to be broad and fairly far reaching third is to determine the flow rate of the aquifer water fourth if treatment is necessary planning on how to treat the water at a well site or at the tap and the cost of doing so determined this precludes an assessment of whether a collection treatment facility and clean water distribution network is feasible given the costs for its construction operation and maintenancea chemical element that has poisoned groundwater sickened many and put millions in india and bangladesh
at health risk before its presence was discovered is arsenic as the arsenic has nothing to do with animal husbandry but is worth mentioning here to emphasize the fact that ground water has to be analyzed at its source and along its flow path the arsenic originated from excessive seasonal extraction of groundwater for irrigation from 20000 tube wells during the green revolution the water was used as well for drinking cooking and personal hygiene excessive pumping lowered the water table during a crop growing season and exposed the arsenic bearing mineral pyrite in the aquifer rock to oxidation that released an arsenic toxin to groundwater when recharge took place after a harvest once the health problems were diagnosed and related to arsenic ingestion methods were designed to remove this toxic metal from the groundwater 12as important as dealing with solid and liquid wastes generated in food supply businesses is dealing with the residues from growth hormones anabolic steroids implanted in cattle as they enter feedlots in the united states there are three natural and three synthetic steroids in use at slaughter houses these are found in measurable concentrations in beef muscle and fat and organ meats eg liver and kidneys these may be consumed by most urban citizens that do not opt to buy organic meat products most often because of higher cost in addition to beef cattle the steroids are also allowed for use in dairy cows and sheep but not for pigs or poultry the use of the recombinant bovine growth hormone rbgh was banned in meat production in the european union in 1988 and subsequently in canada australia new zealand and japan because the rbgh gives rise in milk to igf-1 a chemical that helps some types of cells to grow and may influence the risk of prostate breast or colorectal cancer 13 14 because the growth hormones cause unnatural cell growth a phase in the development of cancer it is incumbent on governments to further investigate banning their use in animal husbandry also their ingestion by humans and possible bioaccumulation in vital organs may alter fetal development and bring about early puberty early puberty in young girls and breast development could be a target for unnatural cell growth and a catalyst for breast cancer 15 there is a paucity of research reports on steroid sex hormone residues and meat consumption however a 2007 paper reported on meat consumption during pregnancy associated with sperm concentration and volume in sons of women in two groups  low meat consumption and high meat consumption the sperm concentrations and volumes were 243 higher for the low meat consumption group but for the sons of the high meat consumption group 18 had sperm concentrations below the who standards threshold for sub-fertility this was three times greater than the sons of the low meat consumption group 16 the probable health issues that arise from the secondary ingestion of growth hormones should drive the united states congress and regulators from other governments to increase financial support in this research field
equally important to human health in cities and villages as regards animal husbandry as well as in food producing ecosystems is the use of antibiotics in feed for cattle and other food animals raised in feedlots or other close quarters eg pens cages and the sometimes poor hygienic condition there in 2009 in the united states 288 million lbs 131 million kg of drugs were sold for livestock use and 72 million lbs 33 million kg for human use 80 vs 20 respectively many of those antibiotics that are commonly used to treat human bacterial infections were sold and used for livestock 17 18 the drugs are employed to stimulate livestock growth and to protect the enclosed animals from sickness medical professionals fear that the sheer volume of the antibiotics being used abets the mutation of bacteria to antibiotic resistant strains before mutation antibiotics could control most pathogens that cause sickness in humans medical groups have suggested that antibiotic use should be limited to feedlot cattle that are sick and not to every head in the feedlot this would spectacularly reduce the volume of antibiotics used and slow the evolution of mutated strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria as of january 1 2017 farmers in the united states needed a prescription or veterinary food directive to use antibiotics that are important to humans drug resistant bacteria pose a public health threat that is not a major focus of pharmaceutical research into effective antibiotics against the resistant bacterial strains this is likely because pharmaceutical companies are tasked to deliver maximum dividends to their stockholders thus there is no heavy investment in antibiotic research that is not foreseen as yielding strong financial returns however to counter this government funding in the united states and other countries is being directed to government and university research laboratories to focus on the development of drugs to be effective against the resistant bacterial strains
an example of a looped project in the eritrean coastal desert begins with a 5 km 3 mi long canal that brings red sea water into concrete lined shrimp tanks to prevent leakage into surface ecosystems or the underlying aquifer the shrimp species penaeus vannamel and indian prawn penaeus indicus tolerate changes in salinity temperature ph and oxygen the sea water from the tanks is then channeled into three salt lakes for aquaculture cultivation of tilapia and milk fish chanos chanos for food and to make products including shrimp feed from recycled fish heads waste from the lakes rich in organic nutrients is carried by water to fertilize salicornia farming salicornia is a succulent plant that can grow normally in fields irrigated with salt water its seeds are pressed to give oil and young shoots of salicornia are exported to europe where they are considered a gourmet vegetable the waste from salicornia is used to make particle board firebrick and animal fodder the seawater then seeps into the soil and flows back to the red sea although the looped process worked well the business was not economically profitable because of management problems and lack of enough production to meet demand development of sustainable aquaculture in coastal eritrea and other countries can contribute significantly to urban centers protein rich food supplies and is ongoing 21net-penned fish aquaculture plus shellfish shrimp oysters algae in estuarine and nearshore ocean environments that allows free water exchange with the pens has a lesser ecosystem waste problem than the contained pseudo ecosystems however if the fish have been genetically modified to stimulate growth and prevent disease there is the problem of escape from a pen and interaction with wild species that may negatively alter the wild species genomeaquaculture products should be checked periodically by certified consultants to detect any unhealthy contents of chemicals in their flesh in the same way ocean food fish eg tuna swordfish tilefish king mackerel shark are tested for mercury a neurotoxin results would then be subject to recommendations made by the medical community for rate of consumption as is the case for mercury in the species named above
in the united states as of 9 april 2020 there is a severe shortage of tests for sarscov2 the virus that causes people to become sick with covid19 as a consequence even people in hospital with obvious and severe symptoms of covid19 are rarely tested for the virus furthermore it is by now becoming clearer that many perhaps most people infected with sarscov2 have mild or no symptoms the combination of these factors means that only a small fraction of sarscov2 cases are ever confirmed by a positive test in practice the confirmed case counts tell us more about the availability and distribution of tests than about the prevalence of infections consequently the true number of sarscov2positive individuals is necessarily much higher than the reported counts but how much higher



the total size of the infected population determines how many people will need critical care and how many will ultimately die it is therefore important for healthcare planning economic policy and public communication to estimate the population prevalence of sarscov2 infectionthe foundation of epidemiological modelling is the sir model this model enables us to estimate the progression day by day of the sizes of three subpopulations those who are susceptible s infectious i and removed ron each day some of those who are susceptible get infected and themselves become infectious to other people the number of people who become infected is a combination of how contagious the disease is as well as the effectiveness of social distancing handwashing and other practices that can limit transmissionsimilarly on each day some of those who are infected will recover or die and these people are no longer at risk of transmitting the disease we call these people removed in the sense that they are no longer part of the infected populationthis model is dynamic which means that it changes over time to understand what is happening today each component of the model depends on what was happening yesterday with the other componentswe can observe the number of deaths on each day dt this is pretty much the only part of the pandemic we can measure without a lot of uncertainty there is still a little error because not all deaths due to covid19 are reported correctly and some deaths that are not due to covid19 might be reported in error



susceptible in this context means available to become infected the number of people in a population n who are susceptible on day t equals the number susceptible yesterday minus the people who are newly infected today vt st  s
t1  vt note that as long as people can only be infected once the number of susceptible people can only go downthis is not usually defined as a separate term but it is worth noticing that the number of people who recover and are no longer sick each day is some fraction  of all the people infected up to and including yesterday minus all the people who died up to and including yesterday i
t1  d
t1 the  term is a proportion between 0 and 1 and it tells us how many people are recovering most sir models lump together the recovered and dead but i think it is useful to think about them as separate processes i will use this definition of recovered in the next two definitionsthe number of infected people on day t equals the number infected yesterday plus the people newly infected today minus the people who died yesterday minus the people who recovered yesterday note the recovered term at the end it  i
t1  vt  d
t1  i
t1  d
t1 this number can go up as new infections occur and down as people recover or diethe number of people removed on day t equals the number removed yesterday plus the people who died yesterday plus the people who recovered yesterday note the recovered term at the end rt  r
t1  d
t1  i
t1  d
t1 note that as long as people can only be infected once the number of removed people can only go upthe number of new infections each day is equal to the number of susceptible people yesterday times some fraction  of the infected proportion the infected proportion is simply the proportion of the population who were infected yesterday

the  term is a measure of infectiousness  is mathematically related to the epidemiological term r
0 which is the average number of people that each infected person newly infects i have shown it here as  rather than r
0 so that the role of infectiousness can be clear in the mathematics relating the susceptible and infected populationsthe fraction of the infected people who will eventually die equals the total deaths summing all the daily totals divided by the total people ever infected

this rate may change as health care is overloaded or as new treatments are discovered it is different for people of different ages and different comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension and smoking there is still considerable debate about the p number which is usually expressed as a percentage most sources report that p seems to be between 05 and 20 averaged across various studies various age groups and various comorbiditieswe can estimate the sir values by using the relationships among them and information from clinical studies the new york times has an interactive online tool nytims3cfqpnf which allows a user to see immediately the effect of changing any of these parameterscovid19 can be understood as a generic epidemic which has its own values of these parameters of course policy and human behavior influence the parameters too by reducing transmission through social distancing reducing fatalities through better treatment and ultimately reducing susceptibility through a vaccine the processes over time can be seen in figure 1 page 13the top graph shows the number of deaths each day which is the only measure we can really observe the middle graph shows the number of new infections each day note that it leads the deaths by a couple of weeks and the length of this lead is another variable in the model which can only be observed through limited clinical studies the bottom graph shows the sir values the susceptible population green line starts with everyone and declines over time the infected group orange line rises for a while then slowly declines the removed population blue line rises over time eventually including everyone  the dead and the survivorsdifferent modelling projects approach this framework differently which parts are assumed measured or modelled vary among different studies some models let the interactive user guess different values of r
0 and thereby  or p and thereby  while other models incorporate measures from small clinical studies some models include an intervening term exposure between the susceptible population and infection not all susceptible people are exposed and the unexposed people cannot become infected the mathematics that connects all the pieces is also different in different modelsin the long term we will learn which models were best however time is too short for more than a tiny number of these models to be subject to formal peer review in time to be relevant that means it is more important than ever that engaged laypeople especially journalists have at least a minimum sense of how to read these essential studies kermack w and mckendrick a 1927 a contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics proceedings of the royal society of london series a mathematical and physical sciences 115 700721 anderson r m and may rm 1991 infectious diseases of humans oxford oxford university pressi am interpreting these ideas from a paper by james johndrow kristian lum and me

with an atypical form of pneumonia was diagnosed in china a disease that would later be referred to as covid-19 by the world health organization who one month later in january 2020 the causative agent of the covid-19 disease the sars-cov-2 virus was deciphered and identified and its genome was published rapidly 1by mid-april 2020 the extent of impact of covid-19 on the global population was becoming evident the most adversely affected region per capita was western europe the most seriously affected population being the elderly especially those with extensive co-morbidities and weakened immune systems the causes for regional differences in covid-19 will require months of analysis if not years to ascertain more focused approaches to reduce the impacts of covid-19 in the near-term especially on the most vulnerable populations need to be pursued in parallel with longer-term approaches to lessen the impact of covid-19 or other coronavirus-driven diseases across all demographicsas of mid-april the very short-term measures that have been implemented to reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 are the same as those that were taken to reduce the transmission of sars-cov during the 2002-2003 sars pandemic good hygiene and quarantine with the latter being far more severe and extensive than the quarantine implemented in 2002-2003 other short-term measures that have been implemented on a very sporadic basis are what can be termed tactical treatments these tactical treatments do not strengthen the immune system but rather have the goal of containing the adverse impacts of the viral attack some examples of tactical treatments that have been tested are eidd-2801 remdesivir favipiravir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine combination of lopinavir and ritonavir tocilizumab losartan to name a few tests so far have yielded very mixed resultsa second avenue being pursued to amelioratereduce the effects of covid-19 is development of vaccines to induce viral immunity the bulk of the present review addresses the status and prospects of this vaccine approachthe third leg of this triad of approaches to ameliorate the ravaging effects especially for the most vulnerable of covid-19 is what can be called the strategic treatment approach 2 this approach has the goal of strengthening the immune system to allow its adaptive component to neutralize the incoming coronavirus without the need for external support strategic treatments eliminate tangible factors that contribute to weaken the immune system some examples of such factors based on existing studies include titanium dioxide air pollution chlorpyrifos aluminum sulfate prenatal alcohol exposure zno oil fly ash and many others 3-9 also the real life exposure scenario in which we are exposed continuously to combination of stressors influences in the long term the immune system and the response of the organism to the viral stressors 10-14tsatsakis et al 15 have shown how pollutants can influence the immune system particularly by modulating ahr pathway and how these effects can be prevented by more strict regulations while some positive impact may result in the short-term from strategic treatments their main impact will probably be for the long-term except for those whose immune systems have suffered irreversible damage or those who have an overwhelming genetic predisposition to immune dysfunction because strategic treatments appropriate to any specific individual are difficult to identify and difficult to eliminate because of ingrained habits some emphasis needs to be placed on those types of treatments that do not require severe lifestyle alterationsthis work aims to analyze the strategies and challenges regarding the development of effective vaccines against sars-cov-2 the discovery of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus is an important component of the three-pronged approach described initially given that the pandemic cannot seem to be entirely stopped by social distancing and good hygiene practices the tactical therapies identified so far have not been entirely effective especially for the most vulnerable individuals being unable to prevent severe disability and ultimately death while healthcare systems are still struggling not to crumble under pressure from coronavirus patients research laboratories around the world are competing to produce an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 as soon as possible in order to be able to stop the spread of the new coronavirusglobal immune deficiency is a risk factor for anti-covid-19 vaccine efficacy particularly in elderly who have been exposed to a myriad of factors that contribute to weakening of the immune system as described previously these factors also result in diseases such as obesityobesity-related eg type ii diabetes metabolic syndrome and immune-mediated cancers mechanistic reasons for these diseases include weakness of antigen recognition decreased immune cell quantity and functionality increased levellength and timing of humoral immune alterations of components reduced initiation of cellular responses and memory cell disorders other associations with immunodeficiency include age-dependent humoral and immune cell alterations immunosenescence malnutrition 19 protein-energy-micronutrient deficit and telomere shortening 20 in addition past or current treatments affect the scalable ineffectiveness of vaccines in both older adults 21 and children 22 especially in immunocompromised 23exposure to immunosuppressive drugs 24 or residence in developing countries 25 with a low socioeconomic status is associated with a higher viral mortality compared to residence in developed countries 26 current global obesity prevalence in adult and children is also a risk factor for anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine inefficacy due to higher levels of il-6 27 and decreased igg concentrations parasitic infections respiratory tract infections such as complicated pneumonia 28 can also affect subsequent immune response to anti-sars-cov-2 vaccination 29adjuvant purity and safety knowledge gaps of the relative contribution of the innate and adaptive responses to protection against individual pathogens and the precise mode of action of individual adjuvants 30 are existing negative factors in vaccine efficacy anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be available by vaccine market players according to current orphan drug 31 and vaccine legislation 3233 due to the fight against sars-cov-2 pandemic this means that design defect failure to warn and negligence in testing may also affect vaccine efficacy under those conditions long-term safety testing of vaccines in humans will be non-existent there is no data on whether anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be first licensed in developed countries 34 or if all vaccine production facilities will be adequate to assure a reliable supply of new anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines 35 in a timely manner and are compatible with specifications and improved adult vaccine design strategy by who or immunobiography 36 and heterogeneity of immune responses in the elderly subpopulations 36the safety of the vaccine is initially assessed in laboratory studies with mice or rabbits if the animals do not show signs of disease after receiving the vaccine then the tests begin in humans and the number of subjects gradually increases 37 duration of the clinical trial on average for a classical vaccine after preclinical stage - in vitro and in vivo tests is as follows 3839in phase i also called the first human test the vaccine is given to a small group of healthy volunteers 10 to 100 the purpose is not to test whether the vaccine protects against the disease but whether it is safe or whether it causes severe side effectsin phase ii the candidate vaccine is administered to a larger group of subjects 100-1000 and in phase iii to an even larger group 1000-100000 separate studies may be required in adults children and the elderly it sometimes happens that vaccines that seem safe when given to a small number of people show side effects when given to a larger number of people this is explained by the fact that any rare complication is less likely to occur when the group of subjects is small continuous monitoring is important in case of complications that occur with delayed effect 40 during a pandemic these sequential studies may be shortened and partially overlapped but it is important that thousands of vaccinated people are followed for several months before the general purpose vaccine is approvedif there are more severe signs of inflammation or if the vaccine causes the immune system to malfunction in other ways the candidate vaccine may not be suitable for widespread use when such adverse effects are identified delays in the production process inevitably occur 41 at present only two potential vaccines against the sars-cov-2 virus are in the first phase and this by a derogation from the rule - skipped animal studies fig 1the first vaccine that does not follow all research steps is called mrna-1273 and will be tested in the first phase in seattle there is an explanation for the speed of approval which is related to the fact that the coronavirus is not used in the vaccine development it is an experimental vaccine made by a new method based on rna basically the rna molecule in the vaccine teaches the cells to produce the disease-specific antigen and trains the body for the real enemy but there is also a small problem to date no vaccine based mrna technology has been approved for any disease although a few have reached the second phase of testing 42the second vaccine is ad5-ncov the vaccine is created by genetic engineering and tries to teach the body to recognize the coronavirus protein s which is delivered via a type-5 adenovirus adenoviruses are a family of about one hundred double-stranded dna viruses that cause various diseases in humans and animals and type-5 is often used for genetic recombinationalthough clinical trials have begun for these two candidates and are likely to begin soon for other potential vaccines it is unlikely to move to phase ii earlier than a few monthsvaccines stimulate immunity to the virus but can also stimulate inflammation in the body this can manifest itself either as pain or inflammation at the site where the subject was injected or as general symptoms such as fever or fatigue symptoms similar to covid-19 disease for most vaccines these reactions are mild and affect only a small proportion of subjectswhen a vaccine causes the production of antibodies in mice or in humans this does not necessarily mean that the vaccine will protect against the disease ideally before moving on to human studies researchers should be able to demonstrate that the vaccine will protect laboratory animals from the disease when they are experimentally infected with the virus in the case of diseases caused by previous coronaviruses sars and mers it was difficult to find an animal species that would be affected by the disease in the same way as humans are affected however previous research may help scientists speed up the animal testing process for covid-19 the protective effect of a human vaccine is assessed using a series of studies similar to the series of safety studies if the vaccine elicits an immune system response for example if antibodies can be detected in the phase i study then larger phase ii and phase iii studies can be performed to see if the vaccine protects against infection or diseasealthough covid-19 is a new disease research on sars and mers has helped us understand how the human body responds to coronaviruses and how the response of the immune system generates protection against disease 43 restricted human studies can also be used to calculate the correct dose and schedule for the vaccine some vaccines generate a strong immune response after a single dose but others require a booster dose after a month or longer this strategy also increases the duration of studiesto assess whether a vaccine prevents covid-19 among those exposed to the infection it should be tested in phase iii studies in a setting where the infection is actively occurring in response to the west african ebola outbreak in 201415 the rvsv ebola vaccine went through all three phases of clinical development in just 12 months through the centralized coordination of who mdecins sans frontires and manufacturer during this period there were still cases of ebola in guinea and the protection of the vaccine was demonstrated by vaccinating the contacts of the residual cases as they appeared in the community 44in the case of pandemic vaccines tens or hundreds of millions of doses are needed this production process takes at least six months if the production lines already exist any new vaccine involves a new production process which involves several quality control stepsthe manufacturer must ensure that each vaccine produced is of consistent quality and requires repeated testing moreover because vaccine manufacturing is a biological process inevitably some batches of vaccines will fail for reasons that are not always clear which can further delay production there are quite a few manufacturers in the world that can produce vaccines on a large enough scale to meet the needs of a pandemicbefore initiating each stage of the human testing process the developer must provide evidence that the vaccine has early indications of protection and is safe among those who have been tested research ethics committees review clinical trial plans and authorities such as the european medicines agency ema and food and drug administration fda oversee the entire vaccine development process before approving it for general use these assessments usually take several weeks or months 45 although such approvals could be shortened in the event of a pandemic many potential covid-19 vaccines use new technologies so regulators will not be able to rely on the experience of similar vaccines to speed up the process developers of the covid-19 vaccine were given a target to produce a vaccine in 12-18 months while historically vaccines took 15-20 years to develop there are diseases against which vaccines do not yet exist despite decades of work for example more than 100000 children die each year from respiratory diseases caused by another rna virus rsv respiratory syncytial virus which causes pneumonia despite 50 years of research and 18 products developed there is currently no rsv vaccine available 46numerous scientific research groups are working on the development of a covid-19 vaccine using a number of different approaches having many groups in the race is important as most vaccines entering clinical trials will fail for safety or efficacy reasonssars-cov-2 is part of the coronavirus family as is sars-cov-1 which generated the 2003 sars epidemic and mers-cov which generated the mers epidemic in 2013 47the new sars-cov-2 coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes a respiratory infection called covid-19 coronavirus infectious disease - 2019 with an average incubation period of 5 days between 2 and 14 days 48 the disease is characterized by predominant respiratory symptoms cough difficulty breathing fever of moderate intensity in about 80 of cases but may have severe manifestations bilateral interstitial pneumonia with progression to respiratory failure acute respiratory distress ards the main cause of mortality there are also cases with gastrointestinal manifestations especially diarrhea and in some patients especially in the young ones hypoanosmia loss of sense of smell and hypodysgeusia alteration of the sense of taste have been reported as early symptoms 49shortly after the publication of the genetic structure of sars-cov-2 the first two vaccines were developed sars-cov-2 virus structure is composed of an rna molecule surrounded by a series of structural and functional proteins 50 known structural proteins are protein s or spike - which leads to the characteristic appearance protein m membrane protein e envelopes protein n nucleocapsid of these protein s has the role of attaching to receptors in human cells and facilitating the fusion of viral content with the cell in the case of sars-cov-2 the receptor is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is found in large quantities in the respiratory tract and lung parenchyma 51-54 the initial infection of sars-cov-2 occurs in the ciliary epithelial cells of the bronchi 5556the binding of protein s to ace2 is greatly favored by the existence of the polybase cleavage site - a protein fragment cleaved by the furin enzyme commonly found in the human body allowing protein s fragments s1 s2 and s3 to perform their function in addition to fusing the viral envelope with the cell membrane the virus also infects the human cell through endocytosis the cell membrane around the portion that binds to the virus forms a vesicle inside the cell detaches from the membrane and introduces the virus into the cell via that vesicle through the process of entering the cell the virus loses its envelope which fuses with the cell membrane and the viral rna is free in the cytoplasm carrying out two processes replication and transcription first the cellular components responsible for rna transcription produce viral proteins and the rna is copied subsequently these proteins and copies of the initial rna are packed into new virions released from the cell to spread the infection 57humoral immunity consists of the production of specific antibodies against these antigens these are i antibodies that appear rapidly during infection and disappear rapidly igm and ii antibodies that appear slower and persist in the body for a long time even after the infection is cured igg 58cellular immunity requires training certain immune cells to recognize and destroy the virus it has been observed in sars-cov-2 infection that the number of cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes is low in the peripheral blood because they are destroyed in the process of elimination of the virus but has high concentrations of activation markers 59 regarding the sars-cov virus memory cells capable of recognizing it have been identified in the blood of healed patients several years after the infection the persistence of memory cells is an important element to consider in the development of the anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine 60 cases have been described where the sars-cov-2 infection recurs after being considered cured 61on the other hand there is evidence that coronaviruses are equipped with mechanisms by which they can sometimes evade immune attack first after infection of the cell the vesicles in which the virus is located are lacking in the receptors that could recognize the virus as an invader of the body second interferon synthesis with antiviral function is inhibited by coronaviruses and the presentation of viral antigens by pca is low in infected patients 62current pandemic of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 is a global epidemiological problem the solution of which will require establishment of large-scale production of the vaccine given the experience of previous coronavirus outbreaks showing a high variability of the virus it is required to develop a vaccine production platform providing the scalability technological flexibility and versatility these vaccines must provide high efficacy safety and tolerabilitythis is due to the time required to prove that the proposed vaccine is safe and effective as well as the time required to produce millions of doses many candidate vaccines which initially look promising are likely to fail during the testing process the process of developing a new vaccine begins with a so-called candidate vaccine which a team of scientists believes to have potential this is the fastest part of the process and takes up to a few weeks thus some candidate vaccines are being developed in russia against covid-19 the shemyakin and ovchinnikov institute of bioorganic chemistry is developing liposome-encapsulated dna-protein vaccine based on the covid-19 spike antigens and its dna coding sequence and vlp vaccine based on hsb antigen fused with covid-19 spike antigens the vaccine candidates against covid-19 based on live attenuated recombinant influenza vector platform are developed by fsbsi chumakov federal scientific center for research and development of immune- and biological products of russian academy of sciences and smorodintsev research institute of influenza who national influenza centre the fsbsi chumakov federal scientific center for research and development of immune- and biological products of russian academy of sciences is developing two vaccines based on an attenuated and an inactivated strain of the covid-19 virus isolated in centre chumakov personal communication of professor egorovfor efficient application of sars-cov-2 vaccines not only the production procedure needs to be developed but also requires a large-scale production followed by vaccination program targeting muti-million population of different regions only such a complex approach will allow combatting of the coronavirus disease pandemic new technologies do not require the work with live virus making their production much easier but still needing further scientific and technological evidence fig 2the mrna encoding ribonucleic acid vaccine encodes a stable prefused form the form before being fused to the cell membrane of the host cell of spike protein s 63 protein complex s is required for membrane fusion and host cell infection and has been the target of vaccines against mers and sarsmembrane fusion viral and cellular is an essential step when encapsulated viruses enter cells fusion of the double lipid layer requires catalysis to overcome a high kinetic barrier and viral fusion proteins are agents that perform this catalytic function 64 although coronavirus uses many different proteins to replicate and invade cells protein s is the main surface protein that it uses to bind to a receptor - this becomes a bridge to the human cell after protein s binds to the human cell receptor the viral membrane fuses with the human cell membrane allowing the viral genome to enter the human cells and initiate infection 49the mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 is based on a relatively new genetic method that does not require growing the virus in the laboratory the technique transforms the human body into a living laboratory because the whole process is no longer carried out in the laboratory but directly in the body that received the vaccine 65the technique is actually based on messenger ribonucleic acid mrna fragments the genetic material that is copied from dna and encodes proteins moderna company loads its vaccine with viral mrna which encodes the proteins of the new coronavirus and then injects it into the body immune cells from the lymph nodes process the mrna and synthesize specific viral protein antigens so that other immune cells recognize them 66 mrna is like a software molecule in the body which then produces viral proteins that can generate an immune response 67 how the body processes the viral protein is often very different from the way it processes the same protein of the vaccine thus one of the theoretical benefits of introducing mrna into a vaccine is that the body causes the viral protein to behave in exactly the same way that the virus would have directed the host to do 63 table idna vaccines represent the latest direction of development in the manufacture of vaccines vaccines obtained by recombinant dna technology are produced by genetic modificationthe dna encoding the target molecule is introduced via a plasmid or viral vector in a suitable microorganism or cell line in which dna is expressed and translated into protein the product is subsequently recovered by extraction and purification the injected dna is a plasmid plus a promoter that provides immunogenic protein synthesis 69an advantage of this type of vaccine is that it stimulates both humoral and cellular immunity also this type of vaccine is stable and does not require maintenance under controlled conditions refrigeration as is the case for conventional vaccines in contrast to live attenuated vaccines the risks arising from a potential inadequate attenuation of vaccine strains are not present in dna vaccines 70 other advantages of this new technology are the fact that the plasmids used are easy to manufacture in large quantities and the immunity conferred is long-term the disadvantages identified so far with regard to dna vaccines are due to the fact that this type of vaccine is limited to protein immunogens 71a clinical trial for a new dna vaccine against coronavirus has begun this is called chadox1 ncov-19 and it was initially developed to prevent mers 72 this vaccine is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and on sars-cov-2 spike protein 73 it has been modified so that it cannot be reproduced in the human body and the genetic code that transmits instructions for the production of coronavirus spike protein has been added allowing the adenovirus to produce this protein after vaccination the result is the formation of antibodies against the spike protein known to be on the surface of sars-cov-2 74the ino-4800 vaccine is another new dna vaccine to prevent sars-cov-2 infection it is entering human phase i testing 75 the phase i study will enroll up to 40 healthy adult volunteers each participant will receive two doses of ino-4800 every four weeks and initial immune responses and safety data from the study are expected by the end of the summer preclinical data have shown promising results in immune response in several animal models also the preclinical results for the inovio sars-cov-2 vaccine were consistent with the results of the phase i study for the middle east respiratory syndrome mers vaccine caused by another type of coronavirus here the inovio dna vaccine was well tolerated and induced high levels of antibody response in 95 of subjects generating t cell-mediated responses in nearly 90 of study participants long-term antibody response was maintained for up to 60 weeks in the case of the anti-mers vaccine 75 table iisubunit vaccines contain only certain antigenic determinants of pathogenic microorganisms and are obtained either starting from conventional cultivation processes or by recombinant dna technology 76antigen determinants included in the vaccine increase the efficiency of the immune response and the presence of a small number of pathogens reduces the risk of side effects subunit vaccines mainly contain surface fragments of pathogens because these types of structures are weak immunogens to obtain vaccines with suitable efficacy the antigens are conjugated with protein molecules 77antigen purifiers sometimes lead to loss of immunogenicity requiring coupling with a protein carrier or with an aluminum salt however adjuvants are associated with the onset of local reactions to the vaccination site also the duration the immunity conferred by vaccination is lower except for live vaccines 78 table iiialong with traditional virus vaccines viral vectors are widely used in which genome of one virus is used to deliver the antigen of another virus thus allowing development of a platform technology of virus production these technologies are available for large-scale production of vaccines drawbacks of such vaccines include a large variation of purification methods need for a reliable confirmation of purity and activity of the virus 79 tables iv and vvaccine development based on the recombinant proteins and virus-like particles vlps is a more innovative approach antiviral vaccines are usually developed on the basis of surface proteins that form vlps production of vlps in the cells with further reconstruction into the stable and immunogenic forms is a multi-stage process substantial issues appear for the vlp production for non-enveloped viruses nucleic acid based vaccines are very interesting from the platform technology viewpoint allowing the same process to be used for the production of different antigens they elicit both humoral and cell immune responses 80production of these vaccines may be based on e coli cell fermentation and corresponding technologies of extraction and purification of plasmids ensuring their structural integrity 81 table vianother category of vaccines is vaccines containing whole microorganisms but inactivated by chemical or physical methods this type of vaccine has the advantage of higher stability however effectiveness is lower and requires reminders of immune system vaccines with inactivated live virus require stabilization of the structure in the dry form separate supply of the solvent and cold-chain transportation these factors complicate the production process and lead to increase of their cost 82 table viilive attenuated vaccines were the first vaccines utilized these types of vaccines are obtained through cultivation of microorganisms under suboptimal conditions or through successive passage in cultures techniques that determine attenuation of virulence while maintaining the capacity to induce the immune response 83although characterized as very effective live attenuated vaccines have the disadvantages of risks related to the possible occurrence of mutations leading to the virulence reversal as well as contra-indication in the case of immunocompromised persons table viiithe lv-smenp-dc vaccine lentiviral minigene vaccine shenzhen geno-immune medical institute entered phase i clinical trial in march 2020 it is a vaccine based on dendritic cells modified with a lentiviral vector expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domains and is administered with antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes 84pathogen-specific aapc vaccine shenzhen geno-immune medical institute phase 1 clinical trial 85 is based on lentiviral vector modified artificial antigen presenting cells aapcs expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domainsthe development and manufacture of a covid-19 vaccine is an urgent issue but it is likely to take many months to resolve although many companies have announced that the covid-19 vaccine will be ready soon this will be quite difficult to do in reality 72the main reason is that before being put on the market the vaccine should be safe both in the short-term and in the long-term this is very important because in the history of vaccine production there have been situations of contamination with other viruses fortunately without major consequences 16 for example one third of the polio vaccines administered in the us between 1955 and 1963 also contained simian virus 40 sv40 and more recently rotavirus vaccines have been discovered to also have swine circoviruses 86-88in order to avoid such situations everything to be tested on humans should first be checked for purity and then sterile production lines provided this takes time in rare cases certain antibodies generated by immunization may promote an aggravated form of the disease a situation called ade antibody dependent enhancement 89 when these antibodies re-establish contact with the virus they will actually help it enter the cells and cause infection ade has been described in many viral infections influenza dengue zika etc but also in coronaviruses the mechanism of ade has not been confirmed for coronavirus in humans 90several animal studies have shown that some types of anti-sars and anti-mers vaccines although effective in generating antibodies can lead to more severe forms of disease when the virus is subsequently inoculated 91the second reason is that the vaccine must not only be safe but also effective it must be able to determine the synthesis of antibodies of a certain type at a certain concentration titer and to provide protection for a reasonable timehowever vaccines never generate immunity to all vaccinated people 92 the causes are complex and vary from genetic and immunological factors to the quality of the vaccines themselves and how they are administeredage is an important aspect and some influenza studies have shown that aging of the immune system dramatically decreases the effectiveness of vaccination 93 therefore for any future anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine all these aspects should be evaluated and the primary immunization failures minimized by adjusting the doses or number of administrationsassuming that the vaccine will generate an effective immune response to a sufficient number of individuals among those vaccinated the time frame of vaccine protection is questionable 94 for example after measles vaccination a small percentage of those who initially respond well lose their protective antibody status within a few years a phenomenon called secondary immunization failure 95this is why it takes time to check the post-vaccination persistence of anti-covid antibodies last but not least both safety and efficacy are significantly dependent on the type of vaccine ie the technology or platform usedsome technologies are very new and therefore require more careful testing others are old but need to be adapted for covid-19 another aspect is not only the ability of a company to develop the technology but also its large-scale production capacity so that it is quickly accessible globally because there is no commercially available anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine precedent for the proposed platforms completely new production lines capable of generating billions of doses in a few months must be considered and this must be done without stopping the production of current vaccines already included in the official protocols and guidelines at present this capacity will be reached with difficulty and will represent an unprecedented effort dna and rna vaccines are based on the principle of insertion of these nucleic acids in some cells of the vaccinated ones forcing them to make immunogenic viral proteins 96 although some recent data seem encouraging these concepts have questionable efficiency in humans non-replicative vectors are actually common viruses eg adenovirus genetically modified to display sars-cov proteins on the outer surface 97 but they are so common that many of us have already met with them throughout our lives and as a result we already have immunity and neutralize them before they do their jobthe attenuated viruses would be variants of sars-cov-2 made less or not at all pathogenic by genetic engineering they are by far the most immunogenic but there is a risk that they will become pathogenic after mutations 98inactivated viruses viral fragments and synthetic peptides are all relatively weakly immunogenicthe analysis of these variables is normally done over 10 years in the form of a trial the stages of a trial are inflexible standardized intensely regulated for the purpose of maximum safety and efficacy of the final vaccinethe first stage is the preclinical research in which the technology that will be included in the vaccine is selected and then the efficacy and safety profile of human cells in vitro and animal models in vivo is tested if the expected anti-infectious effect is seen in vitro and cells do not die excessively then in vivo animal studies are conducted mice are usually the perfect candidate for in vivo studies because they are about 85 genetically similar to humans relatively inexpensive and do not raise major ethical issues 99 however one of the notable differences between the human and the mouse is fixed in the case of the ace2 receptor gene to which sars viruses bind during infection mice simply do not make the respiratory syndromes they eliminate the virus relatively quickly from the body this is why it is necessary for either the genetically modified mouse to have a human ace2 receptor or to use ferrets and monkeys and this makes everything much more expensive and more difficult to accessthe preclinical stage lasts between 1 and 2 years and is by far the most selective it is estimated that less than 20 of the vaccines tested are able to progress to human tests some fail because the product does not work others because they can no longer find financing 1100after obtaining the vaccine the first people vaccinated will be the highest risk categories for everyone else the term is sometime in 2022 possibly long after we have naturally acquired immunitythere are still many unknowns related to coronavirus immunity and that is why obtaining a vaccine is difficult future mutations in sars-cov-2 could occur at any time which automatically means a high risk of any vaccine becoming useless no vaccine has been obtained for any other coronavirus so far and no one can guarantee its success yet it is possible that we will have the anti-covid vaccine in a very short time without having the benefits from long-term testing results the vaccine will probably not be available to all of us for 18 monthsscientists began working on coronavirus vaccines during sars and mers outbreaks but their efforts did not materialize because of a myriad of difficulties since this extremely severe current coronavirus pandemic covid-19 the spread of the outbreak appears much broader than was the case for sars there is also the possibility of the disease becoming endemic and seasonal in its appearance according to some investigators this explains why many research groups and companies are undertaking efforts to develop an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 all over the world also speeding up all the usual phases needed to develop and test a vaccine in the humanan important feature in the landscape of vaccine research and development for sars-cov-2 is represented by the varied range of evaluated technological platforms including nucleic acids dna and rna virus-like particles peptides viral vector replicative and non-replicative recombinant proteins live attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses many of these platforms are not currently the basis of vaccines already authorized but experience in areas such as oncology encourages developers to exploit new opportunities for increased development and manufacturing speedsthere is not an effective therapy for severe covid-19 and social distancing is extremely costly from a social and economic perspective therefore the development of an effective vaccine along with efforts to implement immune-enhancing strategic treatments and shorter-term efforts to identify tactical repurposed treatments should be considered major public health priorities we hope to get this key tool for disease prevention and to do this quite soonit is unknown whether there ever will be a successful sars-cov-2 vaccine but the efforts of the scientific community in attempting to develop such a vaccine is without precedent thus covid-19 vaccines are a never ending story
