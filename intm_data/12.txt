coronaviruses are a family of viruses which can cause broad spectrum of respiratory tract infections from a simple common cold to more serious respiratory system infections like mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome and sars-cov southern asia respiratory syndromein december 2019 a new coronavirus epidemic which firstly emerged in china and by 27 march 2020 disseminated almost to all countries and all the regions in the world was identified the disease caused by this newly identified coronavirus subtype named as coronavirus 2019 covid-19 eventually international virus taxonomy group named this virus as sars-cov2 1new coronavirus cases firstly appeared in december 2019 as clusters of pneumonia cases with no identifiable cause in wuhan city located in chinas hubei stateon 30 december

evaluations for different potential difficulties at this point these include economical psychological and social aspects of the evacuation and quarantine practicesone of the authors prof dr rfan encan was among the members of the evacuation team of ministry of health of turkey who went to wuhan to evacuate turkish citizenssince december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases infected with novel coronavirus have been reported in wuhan china through genome-wide sequencing and culture identification of patients sample a new type of betacoronavirus has been identified it was named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and became the seventh member of the coronavirus family that can infect humans 1because the outbreak of this new coronavirus pneumonia coincided with the chinese lunar new year the cross-provincial transfers of people in china have provided excellent opportunities for the virus to spread throughout the country current evidence shows that the new coronavirus has a high infectivity with the basic reproduction number r0  22 95 ci 14 to 39 2 in order to prevent the transmission of 2019-ncov the chinese national health commission 3 has implemented different measures including centralized treatment for confirmed cases home-isolated or centralized medical observation for close contacts suspected cases mild cases and asymptomatic casesas a city with a large number of immigrants millions of migrant workers are returning to shenzhen after the chinese lunar new year which bringing great challenges to the prevention and control of the novel pneumonia people with travel history in hubei province or close contacts with confirmed cases were investigated and isolated at home or at designated hotels as required in shenzhen however the basic characteristics contact history self-protect measures and overall infection rate of people who receiving medical observation at home is not yet well understoodin this study we estimated the demographic characteristics travel history contact history self-protection measures infection situation and other key information of people who were quarantine at home to provide information for prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19people who were identified as close contacts with confirmed cases or had travel history in epidemic provinces were at higher risk of infection both of them need to be self-isolated for 14 days according to the shenzhens guideline for covid-19 prevention and control people who had travel history in epidemic provinces are required to be isolated at home and receive medical observations including regular temperature measurement and syndromic surveillance we regarded this group of people as our target population and used the formula nz2p2p1p to calculate sample size we set infection rate of 19-ncov as 5 the relative error  as 10 and  as 005 the sample size was calculated to be 1825 people considering the sample attrition we planned to recruit 2000 people in our studywe applied a stratified multistage random sampling process to recruit participants in this study first we randomly selected 2 streets from 10 districts in shenzhen then we randomly sampled 2 communities from the selected streets if the total number of people who receiving medical observation at home in selected community was less than 50 we merged the community with its neighboring community to ensure that the total number of target people in the sampling unit at this stage was more than 50 people finally we used simple random sampling method to choose 50 target people each from the selected community or merged communitieswe collected data from feb 5 2020 to feb 10 2020 self-reported questionnaires and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were used to collect information of people under home quarantine considering that our participants might have been infected we developed online questionnaire and asked respondents to fill the questionnaire by themselves we collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens and employed the 2019-ncov real-time pcr kit to detect virus all the laboratory tests were conducted by the beijing genomics institution bgi shenzhenproportions and frequencies were used to report the results of categorical variables mean and range were used to express continuous variable statistical analyses were conducted using the stata software version151a total of 2004 people were involved in our study of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 817 table 1
shows the demographic characteristics of the study sample the prevalence of underlying diseases in this sample was 947 and the mean age was 337 range 03802 years old
table 2
shows the travel history of the sample in this study a total of 1213 subjects 7410 traveled to epidemic areas within 14 days before the home quarantine from them 129 people have traveled to wuhan city 1046 people have traveled to other cities in hubei province and 40 participants have been to other provinces such as sichuan and beijing most of the subjects drove private car for traveling and 1520 of the sample used public transportations excluding people who were long-term resident in the epidemic areas the average length of their stay was 42 days most of the participants arrived at shenzhen between jan 24 2020 to jan 27 2020 fig 1
 less than 1 of the participants reported any contact history with confirmed or suspected cases see table 2in our study sample more than 85 have taken various self-protection measures such as wearing masks washing hands and reducing outdoor events recommended by the specialist however there were still 96 subjects 588 who seldomly wearing masks table 3
we conducted nucleic acid testing for a total of 2004 people and three of these in our study tested positive for 2019ncov after recheck by shenzhen centers for disease control and prevention these persons were confirmed as covid-19 cases the incidence of covid-19 in the sample was 15 95 ci 031437 none of the three patients had obvious symptoms during the time of home quarantine table 4
 also they did not report any history of contacts with confirmed cases during their stay in wuhanhubeithis is the first population-based study to estimate the characteristics and the incidence of 2019-ncov infection among people who were quarantined at home using data collected from a stratified multistage random sample it presents results from a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the travel history and laboratory results and provides information for policy makers to produce guideline for the management of people who have travel history in epidemic areasthree quarters 7407 of our study population had travel history in january and february 2020 of which 9670 have been to hubei province most of the subjects 5901 arrived at shenzhen between jan 24 to jan 27 2020 right after the travel bans on jan 23 2020 considering that 2019-ncov is a highly contagious infectious disease 4 and the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly in hubei province people participated in our study have potentially been exposed to the virus during their travel therefore it is important to provide effective management measures to prevent the outbreak onset in our study population especially to stop transmission during the incubation period 5 we also recruited 424 people who did not have any travel histories but lived together with those personsincidence of confirmed covid-19 cases in our study population is 15 95 ci 031437 which is lower than the incidence 11 95ci 0431 calculated from the evacuation of korea japan germany singapore and france 6 this may be explained in two ways first most of participants in our study returned to shenzhen after the travel bans and the first level emergency response of guangdong province began on jan 23 2020 which resulted in restricted travel and strict temperature screening in and out of hubei province people who had symptoms such fever or cough were detected and isolated before entering shenzhen second less than 1 of the participants reported contact history with confirmed case and more than 85 of the subjects have taken self-protection measures wearing masks washing hands reducing outdoor events cancelling gatherings and following cough etiquette recommended by the government during their stay in epidemic areas since the common person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-ncov are direct transmission and contact transmission 7 the risk of getting infected is low without close contactsthree out of 2004 persons have confirmed 2019-ncov infection in our study which highlighted the importance of home quarantine quarantine is defined as restricting movement of people who have potentially been exposed to infectious diseases to prevent the transmission 89 it has been widely used in response to plague e g the black death severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and ebola outbreaks 10 11 12 13 in current covid-19 outbreak the three in one task force composed of community work stations community health centers and community police is responsible for home quarantine and medical observation in shenzhen during the 14 days of quarantine people are required to stay at home and daily necessities are ordered and delivered by community workers the task force members take their body temperature and record their health status twice a day and health workers in the task force need to assess if he or she need further investigation people who have travel history in epidemic areas and their cohabitants have red code on a smart phone application called ishenzhen people who staye at shenzhen have green code community workers and community polices take temperature and check codes for everyone in and out of the community at the entrance and only people with green code could pass after 14 days of home quarantine if people with travel history in epidemic areas do not have any symptoms they will receive a green code and a proof of complete quarantine consistent with previous experience home quarantine for people who have travel history in epidemic areas has been proven effective to prevent community transmission during the incubation period and the period of early onsethowever one of the three cases was confirmed as 2019-ncov infection 16 days after his arrival case 1 this patient had a transient high body temperature 374 c and another case had dry cough during the home quarantine moreover previous case reports suggested a high risk of severe illness for elderly people and those who had underlying health conditions 14 in our study 446 of the sample aged above 60 years old and 947 had at least one type of underlying disease such as hypertension diabetes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease et al awareness of incipient symptoms of covid-19 during the quarantine is important to speed up early detection and reduce poor clinical outcomes therefore regular training for community health workers and comprehensive instruction for people under home quarantine are requiredas of march 31 2020 there was no other case reported in the study population or in close contacts with our study population there was also no case reported in people who finished home quarantine in shenzhen this indicates that although there was case tested positive after 14 days of home quarantine in our study the risk of second outbreak due to people who complete home quarantine may be low however further information and study is required to estimate if asymptomatic patients are highly contagiousthe main limitation of this study is that nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected only once according to previous reports 1516 there were cases who were tested negative several times before they confirmed as 2019-ncov infections and laboratory results may show false negatives however as of feb 29 2020 there was no other case reported in the study population another limitation is that this is a sampling survey not a census incidence calculated in this study may not be representative for all the people under home quarantine in shenzhen we used a stratified multistage random sampling method and recruited participants who traveled from epidemic areas within 14 days before the home quarantine although further study is needed to get a more accurate incidence our findings provides preliminary evidence to improve measures of prevention and control of covid-19 especially for areas and cities that need to reduce early transmission from imported casesthis study suggests that home quarantine has been effective in reducing the early transmission of covid-19 but that more needs to be done to improve early detection of covid-19 infection regular training and systematic supervision for community health workers as well as comprehensive and feasible instructions for people under home quarantine should be provided since the 2019-ncov has been transmitted in multiple countries caused severe illness and huge disease burden experiences in china should be considered across the

reviewed and edited the manuscriptcoronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the family of coronaviridae 1 they cause generally mild respiratory infections even though they are occasionally lethal since their discovery and first characterization in 1965 2 three major large-scale outbreaks have occurred caused by emerging highly pathogenic coronaviruses namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in 2003 in mainland china 3 the middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreak in 2012 in saudi arabia 45 and the mers outbreak in 2015 in south korea 67 these outbreaks have resulted in more than 8000 and 2200 confirmed sars and mers cases respectively 8recently a fourth coronavirus outbreak has occurred in wuhan the capital city of the hubei province and the seventh largest city of peoples republic of china 91011 since 31 december 2019 when the wuhan municipal health commission reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia including 7 critically ill cases the pneumonia outbreak has received considerable global attention a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent by the chinese authorities on 7 january 2020 and on 10 january 2020 the world health organization who designated the novel coronavirus as 2019-ncov on the same day the who released a wide range of interim guidance for all countries on how they can get prepared for coping with this emergency including how to monitor for potentially infected people collect and test samples manage patients control and mitigate the burden generated by the infection in health centers maintain the right drug supplies and effectively communicate with the lay public regarding the new virus 12by the morning of 23 january 2020 more than 571 confirmed cases with 17 deaths had been reported in other parts of mainland china and in various countries including south korea japan thailand singapore the philippines mexico and the united states of america as of 6 february 2020 0245 gmt 28276 cases of which 3863 are in critical condition and 565 deaths had been reported the transmission potential often measured in terms of the basic reproduction number the outbreak peak time and value and duration under current and evolving intervention measures remain unclear and warrant further investigation on 20 january 2020 the chinese government revised the law provisions concerning infectious diseases to add the 2019-ncov as a class b agent a pathogen that can cause an epidemic outbreak on the same day public health officials announced a further revision to classify the novel virus as a class a agent a pathogen that can cause an epidemic in a short time some non-pharmaceutical interventions npis including intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine of individuals potentially exposed to the disease and isolation of infected symptomatic individuals were implemented but their effectiveness during the early stage is questionable quantifying the effectiveness of these interventions is of crucial importance for wuhan as well as for other cities in their preparedness and rapid response to the importation of infected cases with the arrival of the spring festival massive traveling is expected to mobilize a large segment of the population by which the novel coronavirus may be broadly reseeded extreme unprecedented measures have been taken for example on 23 january 2020 the chinese authorities introduced travel restrictions affecting five cities wuhan huanggang ezhou chibi and zhijiang effectively shutting down the movement of more than 40 million people however how these expensive and resource-intensive measures can contribute to the prevention and control of the infection in these cities and other parts of the country and how long these travel restrictions should be maintained remain to be determined in the context of a novel coronavirus affecting a nave population estimation of the basic reproduction number is important for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for designing and implementing disease outbreak responses in terms of the identification of the most appropriate evidence-based interventions mitigation measures and the determination of the intensity of such programs in order to achieve the maximal protection of the population with the minimal interruption of social-economic activities 8 as recognized by the who 13 mathematical models especially those which are timely play a key role in informing evidence-based decisions by health decision- and policy-makers to the best of our knowledge only a few mathematical models have so far been publicly released including a bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission network model and a returning traveler study aimed to compute underestimated coronavirus cases 1415 no study has focused on the practical implications of public health interventions and measures therefore the present study was undertaken to fill in this gap of knowledgewe obtained data of laboratory-confirmed 2019-ncov cases which occurred in mainland china from the who situation report the national health commission of the peoples republic of china and the health commission of wuhan city and hubei province 16171819 data information includes the cumulative number of reported cases as shown in figure 1a and the quarantined and released population as shown in figure 1b the data were released and analyzed anonymously since the identification of the 2019-ncov on 10 january 2020 some cases were ruled out and the cumulative number of reported cases per day was 41 from 10 to 15 january 2020 to obtain the relatively reliable data we used the exponential growth law to deduce the number of reported cases per day from 31 december 2019 to 10 january 2020 called datarev2 or from 10 to 15 january 2020 called datarev1 based on the 41 cases on that date as shown in figure 1a by inferring the effectiveness of intervention measures including quarantine and isolation figure 1b we estimated the required effectiveness of these interventions in order to prevent the outbreakhere we propose a deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease epidemiological status of the individuals and intervention measures figure 2 we parameterized the model using data obtained for the confirmed cases of 2019-ncov in mainland china and estimated the basic reproduction number of the disease transmissionin more detail we investigated a general seir-type epidemiological model which incorporates appropriate compartments relevant to interventions such as quarantine isolation and treatment we stratified the populations as susceptible s exposed e infectious but not yet symptomatic pre-symptomatic a infectious with symptoms i hospitalized h and recovered r compartments and further stratified the population to include quarantined susceptible sq isolated exposed eq and isolated infected iq compartments with contact tracing a proportion q of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined the quarantined individuals can either move to the compartment eq or sq depending on whether they are effectively infected or not 20 while the other proportion 1  q consists of individuals exposed to the virus who are missed from the contact tracing and move to the exposed compartment e once effectively infected or stay in compartment s otherwise let the transmission probability be  and the contact rate be constant c then the quarantined individuals if infected or uninfected move to the compartment eq or sq at a rate of cq or 1  cq those who are not quarantined if infected will move to the compartment e at a rate of c1q the infected individuals can be detected and then isolated at a rate di and can also move to the compartment r due to recovery the transmission dynamics are governed by the following system of equations 1sccq1siasqec1qsiaeieiiia1eaasq1cqsiasqeqcqsiaqeqhiiqeqhhriiaahh
where  is the derivative with respect to time and the other parameters are summarized in table 1 given the model structure with quarantine and isolation figure 2 we used the next generation matrix 2122 to derive a formula for the control reproduction number when control measures are in force as follows2rcc1qiic11qas0we used the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to fit the model and adopted an adaptive metropolishastings m-h algorithm to carry out the mcmc procedure the algorithm is run for 100000 iterations with a burn-in of the first 70000 iterations and the geweke convergence diagnostic method is employed to assess convergence of chainswe employed the likelihood-based method or generation interval-informed method of white and pagano 23 using the following formula3lrc pnt1texpttntnt1
where trcj1kpjntj k is the maximum value of the serial interval chosen as k6 here and x is the gamma function nn0n1   nt where nj denotes the total number of cases on day j and t is the last day of observations pj is the probability function for the generation interval on day j we assume that the generation interval follows a gamma distribution with mean e and variance v since the generation interval of the 2019-ncov is undetermined we investigated the sensitivity of rc to different e values ranging from 2 to 8 days given in table 2 the population of wuhan is around 11081000 inhabitants 18 hence we set s011081000 as of 10 january 2020 two patients had been recovered and were subsequently discharged from the hospital leading to r02 and 739 individuals were quarantined leading to sq0739 we set h01 corresponding to the reported confirmed case on 10 january 2020 the quarantined individuals were isolated for 14 days thus 114 according to the who 24 the incubation period of 2019-ncov is about 7 days hence 17likelihood-based estimation of rc during the outbreak in wuhan gives a mean value of 639 with mean and variance of generation time of 6 and 2 days on the basis of a revised data series datarev1 the reproduction number based on likelihood-based estimation ranges from 166 to 10 and it follows from table 2 that rc is sensitive to changes in mean generation intervals fitting to the other revised data series datarev2 gives a mean value of 632 with mean and variance of generation time of 6 and 2 days note that the estimates of rc based on the two time series agree well and consequently both revised data series can be used to fit the proposed dynamics transmission model in this study we chose the estimations based on datarev1 as the comparison reference to verify and validate our model-based estimation thus in the following sections of the manuscript we will use the revised dataset datarev1 to fit the proposed model by fitting the model without considering asymptomatic infections to the data of hospital notification for the confirmed 2019-ncov cases datarev1 we estimated the mean control reproductive number rc to be 647 95 ci 571723 whereas other parameter estimations are reported in table 1 note that the mean estimations of rc based on the likelihood method are within the 95 confidence interval of the model-based estimates table 2 using the estimated parameter values we predicted the trend of the 2019-ncov infection under the current intervention before 22 january 2020 the number of infected individuals it is expected to peak on around 10 march 2020 with a peak size of 163105 infectious individuals to examine the possible impact of enhanced interventions on disease infections we plotted the number of infected individuals it and the predicted cumulative number of reported cases with varying quarantine rate q and contact rate c this analysis shows that reducing the contact rate persistently decreases the peak value but may either delay or bring forward the peak as shown in figure 3 and table 3 in more detail our analysis shows that increasing quarantine rate q by 10 or 20 times will bring forward the peak by 65 or 9 days and lead to a reduction of the peak value in terms of the number of infected individuals by 87 or 93 this indicates that enhancing quarantine and isolation following contact tracing and reducing the contact rate can significantly lower the peak and reduce the cumulative number of predicted reported cases figure 4considering the spreading of the virus figure 5 and in order to examine the impact of the travel restriction on the infection in other cities such as beijing we initially calculated the daily number of exposed individuals imported from wuhan to beijing denoted by imet according to our model we get the exposed fraction as of 22 january 2020 approximately 40000 persons from wuhan to beijing via trains around 37000 and flights around 3000 25 then we haveimet  40000  etn4
with 40 individuals being imported exposed individuals as of 22 january 2020 however there could potentially exist an ascertainment bias in reported case data since cases may have been larger than 40 individuals but have not been reported or reported with a delay in timewe find that with travel restriction no imported exposed individuals to beijing the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 9114 in beijing compared with the scenario of no travel restriction while given no travel restriction the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 8884 only if we increase the quarantine rate by 100 thousand times as shown in figure 6a this means that the effect of a travel restriction in wuhan on the 2019-ncov infection in beijing is almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value which is a rate that can hardly be achieved in any public health setting it follows from figure 6b that with travel restriction the number of cumulative individuals in seven days will significantly decrease by 7570 in beijing compared with the scenario of no travel restriction based on the 2019-ncov cases data until 22 january 2020 we have estimated the basic reproduction numbers using different methods likelihood-based and model-based approaches the mean control reproduction number was estimated to be as high as 647 95 ci 571723 in comparison with the values of the sars epidemics r0  491 in beijing china in 2003 26 and mers in jeddah r0  3567 and riyadh r0  2028 kingdom of saudi arabia in 2014 27 our value is higher than other published estimates for instance reference 28 such a high reproduction number is consistent with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least threefour generations of transmission in the period covered by this study 24 note that our estimation is based on a dataset collected during a period of intensive social contacts before the chinese new year 25 january 2020 there were lots of annual summing-up meetings andor parties with higher than usual close contacts leading to a higher likelihood of infection transmission than that of the earlier periods covered by other studies furthermore we noted that more recently published studies based on datasets during periods comparable with ours reported similar findings in terms of a high basic reproduction number for instance reference 29 where authors using an exponential growth method computed a basic reproduction number of 611 95 ci 451816 assuming no changes in reporting rate and with a serial interval of 84  38 days variability in the estimation of the basic reproduction number is also a well-known methodological issue and standardized methods both for calculating and reporting it are still lacking 30 during the initial phases of an epidemics outbreak only small datasetstime-points can be used some crucial information may be missing and the quality accuracy and reliability of data improves over time in these situations estimations are highly dependent on the specific datasets utilized and revisingupdating such datasets could influence the results we note that several key clinical parameters could be inferred from relevant clinical data based on sero-epidemiological surveys and the possibility of spreading the infection from asymptomatic cases was only reported recently 31our finding of a high reproduction number implies the potential of a very serious epidemic unless rather swift public health interventions are implemented 3233 during the season when the social contacts is the highest note that the serial interval is an essential factor affecting the accuracy of the likelihood function estimation according to the current report the incubation period of wuhan patients with coronavirus pneumonia is about 2 to 15 days we then assume that the serial interval follows the gamma distribution with varying mean and variance which allows us to examine the influence on the reproduction number with the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days the likelihood-based estimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation it shows that longer serial intervals induce greater reproduction numbers and hence more new infections which further confirms that the epidemic may be more serious than what has been reported until now 15 based on the reported data we have estimated that the number of people who were identified through contact tracing and quarantined was 5897 as of 22 january 2020 in comparison with the total population size of wuhan the effort of close contact tracing and quarantine was insufficient and appears to have a limited impact in terms of reducing the number of infected cases andor slowing down the epidemic the contour plot of rc  1 gives the threshold values of contact rate and quarantine rate for a city to avoid an outbreak this high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely high requirement for the citys public health infrastructure and its citizens adherence to personal protective and public health interventions including a reduction of transmission-effective contacts separation and restriction during the quarantine such a high level of quarantine rate and reduction of contact is possible only when the number of imported cases from the epicenter is minimal speaking in terms of the value of the travel restriction a strict travel restriction to the city of wuhan is expensive and resource-consuming imposing a substantial challenge to the decision- and policy-makers and the citys resilience moreover such a measure could only delay the transmission of the infectious disorder in conclusion our simulations show that the appropriate duration of this travel restriction depends on a combination of effective quarantine and reduction of contact within the cityconsidering the latest events the lock-down of wuhan on 23 january 2020 the adoption of the travel restriction strategy by other regions and provinces the introduction of new detection technologies etc the present model needs to be revised in that the basic reproduction number estimated here is no longer suitable for predicting future epidemic trends table 4 this will be the aim of a forthcoming articlecoronaviruses occasionally lead to major outbreaks with documented reproduction numbers ranging from 20 to 49 currently a fourth large-scale outbreak is occurring and spreading out from wuhan hubei province china to neighboring provinces and other countries there is a dearth of epidemiological data about the emerging coronavirus which would be of crucial importance to design and implement timely ad hoc effective public health interventions such as contact tracing quarantine and travel restrictions in this study we adopted a deterministic model to shed light on the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus and assess the impact of public health interventions on infection we found that the basic reproduction number could be as high as 647 95 ci 571723 which seems consistent with the special period prior to the spring festival when contacts were higher than usual and with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least threefour generations it is worth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29 january 2020 as shown in table 4 particularly the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29 january 2020 which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711 furthermore according to our model the outbreak under the most restrictive measures is expected to peak within two weeks since 23 january 2020 with a significant low peak value our investigation has major practical implications for public health decision- and policy-makers the rather high reproduction number suggests that the outbreak may be more serious than what has been reported so far given the particular season of increasing social contacts warranting effective strict public health measures aimed to mitigate the burden generated by the spreading of the new virusquarantine is the segregation and limitation of travel of individuals who might have
been subjected to an infectious illness to decide if they are ill thus decreasing
their chance of contaminating others centers for disease control and prevention
2020 this concept varies from isolation which is the seclusion of
those who have been afflicted with an infectious illness from healthy uncontaminated
individuals however the two definitions are sometimes used synonymously
particularly in interaction with the media the term quarantine was first recorded
in 1127 in venice italy and became commonly employed in reaction to the black
death but it was not until 30 decades later that the united kingdom formally began
to enforce a quarantine in answer to the epidemic newman 2012quarantine has been used in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19
outbreak to date the world has recorded 382126 coronavirus cases with 16568
deaths and 102501 recovered cases this epidemic witnessed whole cities in china
immediately put under national quarantine while hundreds and thousands of foreign
citizens arriving in china were told to protect themselves at households or in
government facilities zhao
 chen 2020 most recently upon declaring the covid-19 as a
worldwide pandemic by the world health organization who many countries around the
world besides china have been put under quarantine and have been enforcing social
distancing measures through health policy authorities in an attempt to flatten the
curve reduce the outbreak and flooding the health care system as a consequence

about covid-19 developing the possibility of dying and the potential for exposing
others this stress is expected to be intensified due to the prolonged duration of
isolation or quarantine brooks

of the quarantine and mainly the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptomatology
ptss during the times of covid  among lebanese citizens post- traumatic stress
symptomatology ptss accompany stressful events beyond the context of normal human
encounters such as aggressive sexual attacks abuse injuries violence or natural
catastrophes and are defined by standard intrusive manifestations the intensity of
distress subsequent stimuli avoidance affective numbing and hyperarousal of
certain physiological functions deja et al 2006 post-traumatic stress pts defines a broad
collection of symptoms that an individual may experience after living through an
incredibly stressful event however post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd is an
official diagnosis with more intense and continued symptoms being prevalent such a
diagnosis would take at least 6 months to make identifying the prevalence of ptss
is quite significant to prevent further development and complication of symptoms
into disorders in addition such research would provide the scientific community
with ethnically relevant data regarding the psychological response to quarantine
among asymptomatic lebanese citizens whether they might have been exposed or have
been practicing social distancing to avoid exposure these data would give the
health authorities more insight regarding the proper measures to be taken in order
to make such national enforcements successful and sustainable thus affecting health
communication and public awareness campaigns and control measures used by the
government in a way which will in turn increase compliance among citizens and
enhance their emotional and psychological coping with the situationthe study employed a quantitative cross-sectional research design an online
questionnaire was sent through a google form link via email to be completed by
quarantined people in different lebanese geographic areas the questionnaire was
sent to 1067 citizens where their emails were accessed through university
web-mails and national syndicates where we received an 8903 response rate the
analysis was conducted based on a sample of 950 respondents belonging to various
demographic profiles and from various provinces of lebanon the participants
included in this study were adult community living civilians who have abided by home
quarantine and social distancing which is characterized by staying home and not
leaving unless if there is a need keeping a distance of 13 meters between oneself
and anyone who is coughing or sneezing who 2020 quarantine enforced in lebanon
was characterized by only going out to the supermarket or the pharmacy no retail
shops no restaurants or cafeterias no availability of public transportation using
private vehicles was only allowed on certain fixed dates stated by the government
between the hours of 5 am and 7 pm only which were the imposed curfew hours
citizens were not able to go out during the light of day for unnecessary purposes
which are usually monitored by law enforcement officials however visiting families
was doable from time to time it was the situation of a partial embargo enforced by
the government and military forces the study excluded any person who is exhibiting
any signs of coronavirus infection or who has been diagnosed to have covid-19 or any
person who is diagnosed with any mental illness in order to isolate and study the
effect of home quarantine on the psychological status of the citizens institutional
review board approval was procured as the study has abided by the ethical guidelines
of research irb number eco-r-12 the online questionnaire was sent to the
eligible participants on 18 march 2020 and then on 1 april 2020 and written
informed consent was requested in correspondence the participants received an
explanation of the studys aim and that all the data extracted will be confidential
noting that the participation is voluntary the data were collected from the same
participant on two occasions 2 weeks and then 4 weeks after the start of
quarantine the survey included a sociodemographic data sheet which also measured
the participants certain behavior pattern of quarantine the second part of the
survey included the ptsd checklistcivilian version pcl-c which measured the
psychological experiences during the quarantine period ptsd symptom severity was
assessed using the 17-item pcl-c weathers et al 1993 the pcl-c is made
of up b c and d items where b items relate to the active symptoms of ptsd c items
pertain to what is called numbing symptoms and are characterized by avoidance and
passivity and the d items which are referred to as hyperarousal or hyperactive
symptoms simms et al
2002 the pcl has been used in diverse samples including hospitalized
physical injury survivors and possesses solid psychometric properties ruggiero et al 2003
wang et al 2010
participants rated the degree to which they were bothered by each symptom on a scale
ranging from 1 not at all to 5 extremely with
possible scores ranging from 17 to 85 the reliability of the pcl-c was examined by
the research where a cronbachs alpha of 88 was recorded the surveys reliability
and use were also validated by previous research where a cronbachs alpha of 90 was
recorded by gelaye et al
2017 upon completion of the survey the data were entered into spss
version 22 for analysis where descriptive and inferential statistics were carried
outthe sample of this study comprised of 292 307 males and 658 693 female
citizens from various areas of lebanon the participants were distributed among
various age groups where 246 2589 aged between 18 and 25 years 286
3010 aged between 30 and 35 years of age and 166 1747 aged over
40 years of age the descriptive statistics showed that 509 536 of the
participants did not work in the health care sector while 441 464 were
health care workers the respondents were asked about their quarantine patterns
and practices such as potential exposure sources the results showed that 441
464 of the participants reported that the fact of being a health care worker
in the time of the spread of covid-19 is in itself a major source of exposure
while 334 352 citizens reported that they are practicing home quarantine and
that the only sources they might contract covid-19 from would be their
household in addition 106 112 of the participants reported that they are
still going to work and that the source of exposure might be a coworker while
46 48 indicated that being a patient procuring health care services at a
hospital is a major source of exposure in all 908 956 of the respondents
reported that they have not been in contact with any suspected covid-19 case
4 weeks ago 558 597 of them reported that leave home during the quarantine
period and they are not strictly abiding by home quarantine where 338 356
of them left home to go to the supermarket while 258 272 broke their
quarantine to go to work the average duration for leaving home quarantine was
288 hours per day table
1the pcl-c was used in order to measure the prevalence of ptsd symptoms among the
citizens during the times of covid-19 quarantine in lebanon on two occasions
2 weeks after the start of quarantine and then 4 weeks after that point of time
any response that ranged between 1 and 2 on the likert-type scale was considered
asymptomatic while the responses that ranged between 3 and 5 were considered
symptomatic the majority of the respondents were not symptomatic upon answering
the pcl-cduring the second week of quarantine the highest reported symptom among the b
items was feeling very upset when something reminded you of a stressful
experience from the past where 316 332 were symptomatic followed by
repeated disturbing memories thoughts or images of a stressful experience
from the past where 204 2147 were symptomatic on the level of c items the
most reported statement was feeling distant or cut off from other people were
412 4336 were symptomatic followed by feeling as if your future will
somehow be cut short were 352 3705 were symptomatic as for the d items
the most reported symptom was being super alert or watchful on guard where
366 2852 were symptomatic followed by feeling irritable or having angry
outbursts reported by 352 3705 of the respondents table 2during the fourth week of quarantine the symptoms of ptsd appear to be more
prevalent in comparison to the numbers reported during the second week of
quarantine where on the level of the b item feeling very upset when something
reminded you of a stressful experience from the past 595 6263 were
symptomatic higher than 316 332 reported during the second week on the
level of the c item feeling distant or cut off from other people 655 6894
were symptomatic higher than 412 4336 during the second week further on the
level of the d item being super alert or watchful on guard 672 66 were
symptomatic higher than 366 2852 during the second week the details are
provided in table

carried out to determine if theres a difference in the prevalence of ptsd
symptoms among the civilians according to various characteristics and quarantine
patterns the results showed that there was no difference among genders
p  07 and among occupations whether the respondent
was a health care worker or not p  34 age
p  15 and leaving home during quarantine or not
p  77 did not result in a significant difference in
ptsd symptoms however the possible sources of exposure to covid-19 did make a
difference p  02 table 4furthermore regression analysis was carried out and neither gender

p  96 nor potential sources of exposure
p  48 and quarantine practices such as leaving home or
not p  16 have been predictors of ptsd symptoms table 5this study has been conducted among a proportionately small sample of the general
lebanese public during the first 2 weeks of quarantine in lebanon a period
during which the public was relatively still going out from the homes and
before the armed forces started enforcing strict laws and punishments to people
breaking the regulations of the partial embargo these conditions might have
limited the prevalence of various results as well as might limit the
generalization even though the sample was distributed among the various
provincesthe authors recommend repeating the study after the end of quarantine thus to
compare the psychological distress during and the persistence of such symptoms
after this phase among a larger representative sample recruiting especially
various health care providers to evaluate their psychological affection due to
the application of quarantine that has been further decided by the lebanese
ministry of healtha novel coronavirus  the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2  emerged in wuhan hubei province china in late december 2019 on january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic 1 and on january 31 2020 the number of coronavirus disease covid-19 cases exceeded that of sars with a reported 8096 people infected worldwide 2 as of february 6 2020 there were 28018 confirmed cases including 563 deaths of covid-19 reported in china moreover 325 confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 infection have been reported from outside china across 27 countries including japan thailand singapore south korea hong kong australia germany the united states taiwan macau and vietnam 3the who confirmed the possibility of human-to-human transmission therefore the epidemiological link such as close contact tracing of exportedimported covid-19 patients is among the most important features for the prevention and control of the covid-19 outbreak in most of the developed countries such as the united states europe japan and south korea there is a well-established infectious disease prevention and quarantine policy even in the early stages of disease spread however the international travels of sars-cov-2-infected patients have threatened public health in other countries furthermore it is worthwhile to measure the potential risk of sars-cov-2 transmission outside china when the quarantining of symptomatic infected individuals is delayedin this study we used stochastic simulations to estimate the expected number of covid-19 patients and epidemic duration in various scenarios of quarantine and reduction in the transmission rate the potential size of the epidemic outside of china especially in developed countries with a well-established public health infrastructure is estimated by assuming similar transmission probabilities in the early disease stages as that in hubei province as well as by considering the potential impact of various social and personal nonpharmaceutical interventionsdata were obtained from the 2019-ncov global cases by the johns hopkins center for systems science and engineering 4 and novel coronavirus 2019-ncov situation reports issued by the who 5 last retrieved on february 7 2020 all reported data were from confirmed covid-19 caseswe constructed a dynamic model of sars-cov-2 transmission on the basis of a deterministic compartment model the population was classified into six classes susceptible s exposed e symptomatic infectious i asymptomatic infectious a quarantined q and removed individuals r susceptible individuals are exposed to the sars-cov-2 on close contact with infectious individuals or respiratory droplets that are generated when a patient coughs 6 after the incubation period the exposed individuals develop either symptomatic or asymptomatic infections asymptomatic individuals recover after the infectious period however symptomatic individuals who are infected are quarantined and patients who are quarantined will recover or die figure 1 describes a schematic diagram of the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2

				begindocument mathbfmathcalr enddocumentr is less than 1 the number of cases continues to decrease and the disease will die out using this property we can identify an intervention strategy which can reduce the reproductive number to less than 1the transmission rate was estimated from the number of cases that was confirmed per day in hubei province from january 11 to february 6 2020 and then best-fitted to the model by using the least squares method all confirmed cases were assumed to be quarantined and incapable of spreading the disease our model was programmed in matlab 2018b the least squares fitting optimization tool lsqcurvefit was used to estimate the best-fitted transmission rate for uncertainty analysis the transmission rate was estimated by using the data generated from the poisson distributions with the mean equal to the observed data mean standard deviation and 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated from 1000 sample datasets in addition we conducted a sensitivity analysis by varying the parameters over a range of possible values to establish which of the parameters had the greatest effect on the reproductive numberstochastic simulation was implemented to estimate the risk of an covid-19 outbreak in a country outside china due to the arrival of an exposed individual according to the various scenarios of transmission reduction and the duration from symptom onset to quarantine we calculated the average number of local transmission cases the probability of an outbreak and the epidemic duration the gillespie algorithm which is an affordable method to observe individual random events was adapted as the stochastic simulation method 10 table 2 lists the possible individual level events in stochastic simulation and their propensities which emerge from the mathematical model in the gillespie algorithm the probability of the event occurrence is proportional to its propensity whereas the time interval between a prior and posterior event is proportional to the sum of every propensity in the prior event
the rate of transmission in hubei province is estimated to be 08238 95 ci 0809508382 and the reproductive number was calculated as 41192 95 ci 4047341912 figure 2 presents the data-fitted results from december 29 2019 to february 6 2020 the red circles indicate the daily reported data of confirmed cases in hubei province and the black curve represents the best-fitted model curve our model initially comprised four symptomatic infectious individuals 7 furthermore confirmed cases reported from january 11 2020 were used for data-fitting
the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan has spread in china as well as to other countries the risk of outbreak is investigated as the entry of an exposed individual to a country outside of china we assumed there would be a lower rate of transmission and shorter duration from symptom onset to quarantine outside china for the purpose of this research we considered ten reductions in transmission from 0 to 90 at 10 intervals and three durations from symptom onset to quarantine 24 36 and 48 h we investigated 30 different scenarios based on changes in the quarantine rate and transmission reduction among those 30 scenarios 9 selected scenarios are listed in table 1 including the number of individuals with local transmissions the epidemic duration the maximum prevalence and the probability of the estimated total cases from 2000 realizations table 3 lists the results for three reductions in transmission 0 30 and 60 we defined prevalence as the total number of exposed infectious quarantined hosts and the epidemic duration as the interval from symptom onset of the index case to quarantine onset of the last case every result except for probabilities is presented as the mean lower bound 25th percentile and upper bound 975th percentile values of the trials respectively the results from the simulation of other cases of reduction in the rate of transmission are provided in the supplementary table
we found a high deviation in the number of local transmission cases of infection maximum prevalence among the trials as the upper bound was approximately more than five times larger than the mean in every scenariofigure 3 depicts the probability  of a certain number of local transmission cases being exceeded in relation to the reduction in the rate of transmission and duration from symptom onset to quarantine when quarantine can be instituted within 24 h the probability that the number of local transmission cases exceed 40 is 32 scenario with a 0 reduction in the rate of transmission
we aimed to present an initial perception of the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 in hubei province china and to enable a quantification of the potential risk of sars-cov-2 transmission outside china especially when an infected patient from china arrives in developed countries we used confirmed data from the clusters of covid-19 cases that occurred from january 11 to february 6 2020 in hubei province chinamany researchers have warned the possibility of outbreak outside of china thompson calculated the potential transmission when the patients arrived in other countries 11 the risk of outbreak according to the imported cases the connectivity of the country with china and the efficacy of control measures is estimated 12 in addition studies have been conducted on the impact of international travel and border control measures on the spread outside china global spread 13 14 in this study we used mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation to estimate the reproductive number and analyze interventional measures the reproductive number for sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics is estimated approximately as 4 which is significantly higher compared to that of the previous sars epidemic in china 15 this implies that human-to-human transmission is significant in hubei province unless additional interventional strategies are implemented there will be a significant increase in the daily incidence of new cases however several control policies are being implemented in china such as public education on disease prevention and environmental hygiene it is possible that the transmission rate and reproductive number have been decreased such that the number of new cases will be less than the number in the model predictionthe reproductive number derived in this work facilitates the evaluation of control measures such as quarantine or transmission-intervention strategy to reduce the reproductive number to less than 1 with a single intervention measure we need to either reduce the rate of transmission by more than 7572 or shorten the duration from infection to quarantine to less than 291 h from january 31 2020 onward a real-time confirmatory procedure has been instituted whereby the time to laboratory confirmation can be reduced to 6 h 16 moreover a rapid diagnosis test kit has been provisionally approved and this new diagnostic method has become available since february 7 2020 which could possibly enable faster diagnosis and quarantine 17 if two strategies are implemented simultaneously the requirement for each intervention strategy will be reduced when compared to the requirement for a single-intervention strategy for example if the rate of transmission is reduced by 10 the quarantine from symptom onset needs to be implemented within 3237 hin this study we assumed that the probability of transmission from exposed individuals was zero because of insufficient epidemiological evidence that could be applied in the model however if we assume that exposed individuals have a 20 rate of transmission compared to symptomatic individuals the reproductive number would be reduced to 34796 furthermore our model assumes that quarantined individuals would not transmit the disease ignoring this assumption would result in a higher reproductive numberthis study was conducted with an aim to understand the requirements of sufficient preparedness to counter the spread of sars-cov-2 infection outside china thus we assumed the highest rate of transmission moreover a stochastic simulation was conducted to measure the probability of an outbreak and its size when a person with infection exposure from china enters another country if a symptomatic infectious individual is quarantined within 24 h of symptom onset we can expect four cases of local transmission to occur the epidemic duration would be approximately 17 days under the same rate of transmission as in hubei province therefore the number of individuals with local transmission would be significantly decreased if patients are isolated within 24 h of symptom onsetthe who has warned of the possibility of global spread to other countries and public health authorities in these countries are expected to develop preparedness strategies such as thorough campaigns for enhancing personal hygiene screening the national borders and quarantine of individuals with suspected infection or exposure to respond to disease spread in south korea the first case of covid-19 was reported on january 20 2020 and a total of 24 confirmed cases who are mostly individuals who returned from the chinese city of wuhan have been reported as of february 7 2020 among these cases nine were identified as local transmissions human-to-human transmission arising from contact with patients from china or with a secondary infection-transmitted person in south korea 18 given that the average duration from symptom onset to quarantine is approximately 24 h in south korea the rate of transmission is considered to be approximately 50 lower than that in hubei province in the united states one case of local transmission has been identified from among 11 confirmed cases with the sars-cov-2 infection 19 the local transmission of infected case per import case is 111 and this implies that the rate of transmission is reduced by approximately 90 compared to that in the hubei province if a patient can be quarantined within 24 h after symptom onsetresults from our risk estimation of the covid-19 outbreak outside china accentuate the importance of quarantine control such as through specific guidelines with regard to visitors who have traveled from china the results of our stochastic simulation emphasize that rapid quarantine before the rate of community transmission increases is crucial to prevent a covid-19 outbreak outside of china even if the rate of transmission is assumed to be similar to that in hubei province the probability of no local transmission is approximately 549 with the implementation of a 24-h quarantine strategy in addition there is only a 7 chance of seeing more than 20 cases of local transmission thus quarantine is implicated as a significantly important measure to minimize community transmissionthis study has some limitations first our model was developed with limited confirmed data from the hubei province of china given that the outbreak has not ended the model dynamics could change as new confirmed cases are added second more detailed patient information particularly the dates of symptom onset and exposure were unavailable at the time of analysis third this study was conducted on the basis of data from confirmed covid-19 patients with symptomatic onset who underwent testing however some cases of asymptomatic infection have been identified 20 21 and given the availability of options for assessment at present it is difficult to explicitly estimate the possibility of transmission or the number of asymptomatic infections based on the observational empirical data nonetheless even a model with limited data such as the one in this study can allow an early assessment of the transmission dynamics of the sars-cov-2 epidemic in the hubei province chinathis study describes an outbreak of the sars-cov-2 that originated in the hubei province and estimates the reproductive number the epidemic has spread significantly due to failures in early diagnosis and rapid quarantine in view of the difficulty in controlling this outbreak our results lead us to strongly recommend that an infected person be quarantined as soon as possible after diagnosis to reduce the possibility of sars-cov-2 transmission outside chinathe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has evolved as a global public health emergency affecting 212 countries and territories around the world as of may 12 2020 30 covid-19 is one kind of respiratory disease by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 that was first spotted around late december 2019 in wuhan hubei province china 3 7 this novel virus started transmitting around the world rapidly and on 30 january who declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern pheic later who director-general announced covid-19 as a global pandemic as of may 11 2020 an outbreak of covid-19 has resulted in 4271689 confirmed cumulative cases with reported deaths of 287613 worldwide 30 in most of the countries infected patients are struggling to get the proper treatment due to highly transmissible and virulent nature of the virus nevertheless numerous covid-19 mitigation strategies has been adapted so far such as quarantine isolation promoting the wearing of face masks travel restrictions and lockdowns with a view to reducing community transmission of the diseasein the absence of either established effective treatment or a vaccine the already fragile health care systems of different developed and developing countries can be overburdened due to the overwhelming surge of infections in in the coming months provided that the spread is not controlled this pandemic is giving an upsurge to multifarious noteworthy socio-economic and public health impacts and has highlighted the significance of detecting the evolution of the disease and prediction of disease future dynamics for designing infectious disease prevention and control strategies effective public health policies and economical activity guidelines different mathematical paradigms have always played a notable role in providing deeper understanding of the transmission mechanisms of a disease outbreak contributing considerable insights for controlling the disease outbreak one of the familiar models for human-to-human transmission which is reasonably predictive is susceptible-infectious-removed sir epidemic model proposed by kermack-mckendrick in 1927 10 14 after that the sir epidemic model has been extended to susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir model and many of its variants to explore the risk factors of a disease or predict the dynamics of a disease outbreak 9 11 13 10 12 14 it is really challenging in population based model to incorporate certain real-world complexities in fact analysis and prediction could go wrong in the absence of adequate historical real data on the other hand various agent-based often stochastic models where individuals interact on a network structure and get infected stochastically have been treated as useful tools for tracing fine-grained effects of heterogeneous intervention policies in diverse disease outbreaks 4 15 16 17 however accuracy of this approach can be a vital issue due to the time-varying nature of network-structuresince the outbreak of the virus incorporating travel between major cities in china 3 proposed an seir-model incorporating a metapopulation structure for both reported and unreported infections it has been discovered in their studies that around 86 of all cases went undetected in wuhan before travel restrictions imposed on january 23 2020 according to their estimation on an individual basis around 55 asymptomatic spreaders were contagious who were responsible for 79 of new infected cases other studies 19 4 solidified the significance of incorporating asymptomatic carriers with a view to understanding covid-19 future dynamics appropriately later 10 estimated that around 63 cases went under-reported in italy by analyzing a modified sir-model 13 apply the sird model to chinese official statistics estimating parameters using linear regression and predict the covid-19 pandemic in hubei province by using these models and parameters nonetheless long-term forecasting is debatable while using a simple mathematical model 20 and 21 independently apply modified sird models in which parameters change overtime following specific function forms parameters govern these functions are estimated by minimizing the sum-of-square-error however using the sum-of-square method causes over-fitting and always favors a complex model therefore it is not suitable to access policy effectiveness moreover fitting the sird model in the early stage of infection is questionable as wellin the light of above shortcomings of several established mathematical models a more refined deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations considering all possible interactions a susceptible-exposed-symptomatic infectious-asymptomatic infectious-quarantined-hospitalized-recovered-dead seidiuqhrd model has been proposed which can give more accurate and robust short-term as well as long-term predictions of covid-19 future dynamics this model could be considered as a generalization of seir which is based on the introduction of asymptomatic infectious state quarantined state in order to understand the effect of preventive actions and hospitalized isolated state based on similar studies performed over seir dynamical systems some assumptions are taken into account 9 13 10 as of may 11 it is evident that how the early stage mathematical model parameters have changed drastically as detection rate was really low until middle of february however the outbreak situation has improved comprehensively in several countries due to massive scale testing 31 we have considered the nominal values of the model parameters understanding the characteristics of the coronavirus infection quantitatively estimated in the literature or published by health organizations 3 9 19 2 in sequence a rigorous process of model calibration which is known as trust-region-reflective algorithm is applied to determine the best-fitted parameter values of the model our analysis was based on the publicly available data of the new confirmed daily cases reported for the future probable covid-19 hotspots which are russia brazil india and bangladesh from late january until may 09 2020 18 further we have validated our model for the united kingdom using same time frame based on the released data we attempted to estimate the mean values of the crucial epidemiological parameters for covid-19 such as the infectiousness factor for asymptotic carriers isolation period the estimation of the inflection point with probable date recovery period for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals case-fatality ratio and mortality rate in those potential hotspots perfect data-driven and curve-fitting methods for the prediction of any disease outbreak have always been question of interest in epidemiological research trust-region-reflect algorithm is one of the robust least-square data-fitting techniques that can promote a fine relation between the model driving mechanisms and model responses this real-time data fitting approach could be efficient providing considerable insights on disease outbreak dynamics in different countries and designing worthwhile public health policies in curtailing the disease burden calibrating our model parameters by using the above algorithm we have provided probable forecasts for the newly evolving covid-19 hotspotsthis paper is organized as follows in section 2 the mathematical model is described and the background of choosing baseline parameter values for the model is discussed in section 3 and 4 the model has been analysed and model calibration technique has been discussed respectively in section 5 model prediction accuracy has been illustrated by representing a graphical comparison between model responses and real-time data in section 6 one of the robust global sensitivity analysis techniques is used to quantify the most influential mechanisms in our model this paper ends with some qualitative and quantitative observations and discussionsin the study of 5 the average incubation period of covid-19 was calculate to be 51 days and similar model-based studies also justified the above finding 3 6 4 moreover within 115 days ie 1115day1 of infection the individuals who were exposed to the virus started developing symptoms 5 19 and 200 days was the mean duration of viral shedding observed in covid-19 survivors 7 the time duration from symptoms onset to recovery was estimated to be 247 days whereas from onset of symptoms to deaththe average mean duration was estimated to be 178 days 19 in previous modeling studies3 1 2 the novel coronavirus effective transmission rate  ranges from around 02515day1 which gradually follows a downward trend with time 6 in sequence we have considered this parameter as a time-varying parameter in our fits table 1

following sectionwith much of europe now easing itself out of confinement russia could become the continents new covid-19 hotspot according to our analysis the model fitting and projection results for russia from early february to late august are shown in figure 2 and 3 we collected real data from february 01 to may 08 2020 to calibrate the model parametersas we can see the results from the proposed model match the real data very well based on the proposed model we want to project that from figure 3 the number of daily detected symptomatic infectious cases in russia will reach the peak at may 27 with about 15774k cases as time progresses our estimated daily projected mean error drops to 10 for the cumulative cases and daily new cases which represents the robustness of the model forecasting the basic reproduction number is 4234 as of may 08 which lies in prior established findings 27 for covid-19 26 the number of cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 970k around august 30 and the estimated total death cases will reach to about 35k in the end to date russias official death toll of 1827 is relatively low because not all deaths of people who have contracted the virus are being counted as covid-19 deaths table 2 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literaturethe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic headed toward latin america later than other continents on feb 25 2020 the first infected case was documented but now brazil has surpassed the records in latin america in terms of deaths and new infected cases 155939 cases and 10627 deaths as of may 9 this is probably an underestimated scenario in comparison to real severity in brazil our analysis projects that brazil is developing as one of the worlds next coronavirus hotspots the model fitting and projection results for brazil from late february to late august are shown in figure 4 and 5 we took real data from february 25 to may 08 to calibrate the model parameters as we can see the results from the proposed model fit the real data very well based on the proposed model we project that from figure 5 the number of daily detected symptomatic infectious cases in brazil seem reaching the peak around june 11 with about 26449k cases the basic reproduction number is estimated about 53467 as of may 11 which is in between the observed basic reproduction number for covid-19 estimated about 2-7 for covid-19 26 this crucial epidemiological parameter could blow up because of scant diagnostics and impermanent non-pharmaceutical interventions the case-fatality rate is hovering around 93 as of may 11 which is necessary to assess how much community transmission has occurred and its burden according to our projection this ratio could be doubled within two months the number of cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 1800k around august 30 if current trend is held and the estimated total death cases will reach to about 108k in the end table 3 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literaturesome people might think about the possibilities of the presence of a less virulent strain of the virus in india along with the possibility that its hot weather could diminish the contagion nevertheless our mathematical analysis suggests that india could become the new covid-19 hotspot in south asia according to our projection india could continue seeing spikes in the number of cases as it time progresses despite of following lockdown and other disease mitigation measures the first case of the covid-19 pandemic in india was reported on 30 january 2020 originating from china but now india has the most cases and deaths in south asia 62808 cases and 2101 deaths as of may 9 and these are probably substantial underestimates figure 6 and 7 illustrate covid-19 disease modeling and prediction for india from late january to late august we took real-time data from january 30 to may 8 to calibrate the model parameters as we can see our proposed model match well for the historical real data based on our prediction from figure 7 the number of daily detected symptomatic infectious cases in india seem reaching the peak around june 15 with about 9504k cases the basic reproduction number is 5218 as of may 11 which lies between the studied observations 26 this estimation may be considered as an overestimation of this critical parameter notwithstanding this is owing to the infectiousness factor of the asymptomatic spreaders minimally or reasonably symptomatic infectious and the asymptomatic spreaders should be quarantined to avoid the transmission of the virus with the critically symptomatic patients isolated in proper health care settings by carrying out massive scale contract tracing risky individuals could be identified by means of their exposure the number of cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 730k around august 30 if current pattern is held and the estimated total death cases will reach to about 438k in the end table 4 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literature interestingly we have found in our analysis that indias case-fatality rate is at 35 and the countrys recovery rate is at 33 which commensurate with real reported statistics preciselyour analysis indicates that the united kingdom could face risk of a second wave of coronavirus infections as the united kingsom gradually eases a nationwide lockdown according to 30 by 11 may there had been 223060 confirmed cases and 32065 deaths overall a rate of 465 deaths per million population the outbreak in london has the highest number and highest rate of infections while england and wales are the uk countries with the highest recorded death rate per capita recently the prime minister of the uk has expressed his plan to unveil a coronavirus warning system as an intervention strategy while he was planning to ease the lockdown gradually in the uk for the uk the modeling and projection results from january 31 to august 31 are shown in figure 8 and 9 as we can see from figure 9 the number of daily detected symptomatic infectious cases reached the peak around april 10 since then the curve has been maintaining a plateau which is a really unusual scenario this phenomenon has closely been captured by our proposed model this case study was really important for the validation of our model in fact this guarantees the fact that this model is capable of providing more precise and vigorous short-term predictions of covid-19 dynamics according to our calculation the basic reproduction number is around 4649 as of may 09 which lies in the prior studies of covid-19 13 26 the number cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 618k around august 30 and the estimated total death cases will reach to about 6348k in the above mentioned period importantly as of may 11 we have found in our analysis that the uks case-fatality rate is at 172 which is the worst among our five studied cases this could exacerbate as time progresses in the absence of proven effective therapy or a vaccine in addition our study suggests that relaxing social distancing too soon could result in thousands of additional death in the uk table 5 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literaturefor bangladesh the calibration and projection results from early march to late august of are shown in figure 10 and figure 11 on 22 march with an aim to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus in the wake of four deaths and at least 39 infections bangladesh government deployed a nationwide lockdown effective from 26 march 2020 notice that there are some jumps in the number of confirmed daily new infected cases data from 16 april to 20 april due to the increase of limited testing system from 2000 samples to 2700 samples per day 32 bangladesh is still struggling around 6700 samples per day 32 to design a massive scale testing program as of may 11 2020 despite the fact as we can see from figure 10 our proposed model fits well for the historical real-time data as time progresses the estimated error declines and is hovering around 10 for the cumulative cases and daily new cases according to our calculated daily projected mean error the estimated case-fatality rate in bangladesh is at 27 which is kind of satisfactory however without massive scale testing this rate could rise sharply incoming days moreover the countrys estimated recovery rate is at 24 which again complements the real statistics precisely importantly without an aggressive level mass-testing program it is impossible to portray the real outbreak scenario in bangladesh table 6 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literatureon 4 may bangladesh authorities intended to open up more factories shopping malls and logistics operations as they could diminish the economic impact of a coronavirus lockdown which they extended to may 16 33 this ease of lockdown could worsen the ongoing community transmission drastically as we can see form figure 11 the daily detected symptomatic infected cases confirmed will reach the peak about 2209 around june 11 2020 and then start to de-escalate however the probable peak time could occur in no time due to easing the coronavirus lockdown too quickly and this could bring a second wave of infections in the outbreak after post-peak period the effective reproduction number is around 35 as of may 11 which again lies in prior established ranges 13 26 our estimation is reasonably high which due to the fact that we have considered the infectiousness factor of the asymptomatic carriers massive level testing is highly required and recommended to identify the asymptomatic spreaders quickly unlike other mitigation strategies like reporting contacts putting on face masks and maintaining physical distancing a massive test-and-isolate approach could control the disease burden of covid-19 otherwise this basic reproduction number could increase upto 57 within 20 days and inhabitants of bangladesh could see a disease catastrophe in near future in near future owing to various changing factors such as mitigation measures and mass people awareness such estimation and projection could differ significantlyprcc analysis which is a global sensitivity analysis method that calculates the partial rank correlation coefficient for the model inputs sampled by latin hypercube sampling method and outputs 27 28 29 the prcc method assumes a monotonic relationship between the model input parameters and the model outputsthe calculated prcc values are between -1 and 1 and they are comparable among different model inputs quantitative relationship between the model input and model response can be determined by calculating the prcc values a positive prcc value depicts that the model output can be increased by increasing the respective model input parameter or vice versa in addition a negative prcc value indicates a negative correlation between the model input and output the magnitude of the prcc sensitivity measures the significance of the model input in contributing to the model outputas our proposed epidemic model contains a moderate number of empirical parameters uncertainty analysis can give considerable insights regarding the quantitative relationship between model responses and model input parameters however it is really challenging for complex models to determine the relationship with sufficient accuracy importantly we have got startling yet realistic results from our sensitivity analysis as we can see from figure 12
 we found nearly the same qualitative and significant quantitative relationship between the number of symptomatic infectious individuals one of the crucial model responses and three parameters which are rate of getting quarantined of susceptible individuals q transition rate from exposed to infectious or quarantined  which can also be referred as the inverse of the average incubation period of covid-19 and recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic undetected infectious carriers for our proposed modelin case of russia from figure 12a recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers u is the most negatively influential parameter when the number of detected infectious individuals is our selected model response the prcc index is found to be 0585 in addition rate of entering into home-quarantine or self-quarantine of susceptible individuals q and the fraction of wrongly quarantined people who become susceptible after certain latent period r
1 are the other two influential empirical features with prcc indexes are 05672 and 0567 respectivelyin case of brazil rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of susceptible individuals q the fraction of quarantined people who become susceptible due to avoiding home-quarantine r
1 and the inverse of the covid-19 mean latent period are the most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size idt the corresponding prcc indices are 062 053 and 0499 the figure 12b qualitatively elucidates that a high quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals can curtail the number of symptomatic infected individuals in broader view high efficacy of home or self-quarantine and a lower unlockdown rate could flatten the idt curve in brazilin case of the india rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of susceptible individuals q and the inverse of the covid-19 incubation period are the most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size idt and the corresponding prcc indexes are 064 and 062 both the parameters are negatively sensitive to the size of detected infected individuals which is illustrated in the figure 12c this elucidates that a higher quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals can reduce the number of symptomatic infected individuals therefore it is obvious that early unlockdown in india could worsen the outbreak situation in the blink of an eyein case of the uk rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of susceptible individuals q and the inverse of the covid-19 incubation period are the most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size idt and the corresponding prcc indices are 058 and 0499 both the parameters are negatively sensitive to the size of detected infected individuals which is illustrated in the figure 12d this elucidates that a higher quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals can curtail the number of symptomatic infected individuals nevertheless early easing lockdown measures could bring a second wave of infection in the uk in no timefor bangladesh it has been found in our analysis home-quarantine rate is the most negatively sensitive parameter on the size of symptomatic infectious individuals and the corresponding prcc index is 068 which is the highest among our five studied cases the result in figure 12e elucidates that if the people in bangladesh start breaking social distancing restrictions extensively then it would be difficult to control the disease outbreak there as of may 11 when bangladesh is seeing continuous spikes in covid-19 infections every day the government has announced an easing of movement for all on a limited scale with a view to reviving the countrys economy moreover the length of the inverse of the latent period is the another negatively sensitive parameter with prcc index lying at 043we have proposed a methodology for the calibration of the key epidemiological parameters as well as forecasting of the outbreak dynamics of covid-19 pandemic in russia brazil india bangladesh and the uk while considering publicly available data from late january 2020 to early may 2020 with an introduction of an real-time differential seidiuqhrd epidemic model which can give more accurate realistic and precise short-term predictions baseline parameter ranges are chosen from the recent clinical studies and relevant literature concerning the covid-19 infection trust-region-reflective algorithm which is one of the robust least-squares fitting techniques has been deployed to calibrate the proposed model parameters numerical results on the recent covid-19 data from russia brazil india bangladesh and the uk have been analyzed with an aim to determine probable peak dates and sizes for the above mentioned countries based on the projection as of may 11 2020 russia will reach the peak in terms of daily infected cases and death cases around end of may brazil and india will reach the peak in terms of daily symptomatic infectious cases and death cases around beginning of june in addition the united kingdom might face a second wave of infection provided that lockdown is lifted quickly global sensitivity analysis results depict that home-quarantine or self-quarantine is the most effective measure for controlling the transmission and spread of the novel coronavirus infection to fade out the pandemic it is compulsory to identify potential carriers and asymptomatic infectious spreaders through and massive scale testing scheme and without sufficient level of evidence of controlled low transmission rate of covid-19 in any certain territory we cannot afford lifting up physical distancing measuresthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperin december 2019 several health facilities in the chinese city of wuhan hubei province reported clusters of individuals with pneumonia1 whose clinical presentations resembled the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which emerged in 2002 in the nearby guangdong province and led to outbreaks worldwide2 on jan 7 2020 a novel strain of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was isolated confirming the circulation of a new respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 with evidence suggesting that the huanan seafood wholesale market was the initial transmission site3 on jan 1 2020 the market was closed for environmental sanitation and disinfection to prevent further transmission4 cases of covid-19 have since been reported in health-care workers3 and family clusters in china5 with 67 794 cases and 3805 deaths confirmed in hubei province as of march 15 20206 older individuals aged 60 years and people with chronic underlying health conditions are particularly susceptible to severe disease5 rapid spread of the virus compelled the chinese government to restrict movement in affected cities with the cessation of public transport7 and cancellation of flights8 despite extensive efforts to prevent onward spread 143 countries and territories outside of mainland china have now reported imported cases6

research in context
evidence before this study
at present in wuhan the capital of hubei province in china an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is ongoing caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 previously called 2019-ncov evidence to date has suggested rapid spread of the virus at the time of writing imported cases have been reported in 143 countries and territories including singapore 243 confirmed cases have been reported in singapore however this number is expected to increase substantially in the following weeks in 2003 sars-cov which also originated from mainland china established locally causing 33 deaths after 238 cases were confirmed therefore there is considerable concern since 3204 deaths and 81 048 cases of covid-19 have already been confirmed in mainland china which surpasses the numbers observed in the sars-cov outbreak 2020 lunar new year celebrations have now ended marking a period of extensive travel between china and singapore and a corresponding high risk for case importation despite heightened surveillance and isolation of individuals suspected to have covid-19 and confirmed cases the risk is ongoing with the number of cases continuing to increase in singapore immediate deployment of interventions will be required to contain the outbreak in the event that significant secondary local transmission is observed within the community we searched pubmed from database inception to feb 26 2020 for articles using the search terms wuhan coronavirus covid-19 sars-cov-2 2019-ncov and coronavirus interventions our search yielded three relevant articles two articles investigated the effects of travel restrictions in wuhan during the early stages of the outbreak one of the articles additionally investigated the effects of quarantine in china and the other article estimated the effectiveness of airport screening for the detection of infected travellers we found no articles assessing the efficacy of immediate national control measures outside of china
added value of this study
this study is the first to investigate the use of isolation for individuals with covid-19 and quarantine of family members school closures and workplace distancing as interventions for the immediate control of covid-19 in the event of secondary local transmission using a simulation model we found that a combined approach incorporating quarantine school closures and workplace distancing could prevent a national outbreak at low levels of infectivity and reduce the number of total infections considerably at higher levels of infectivity such control measures should be deployed in countries outside of china with evidence of imported cases and evidence of local transmission
implications of all the available evidence
the results of this study provide policy makers in singapore and other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of relatively standard outbreak control measures that could mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed effectively and in a timely manner
internationally ongoing local transmission of sars-cov-2 has been confirmed in 81 countries and territories6 in singapore 243 individuals have tested positive for sars-cov-2 121 have been hospitalised and are stable 13 are in a critical condition and 109 have been discharged at the time of writing9 the first case in singapore was identified on jan 23 2020 and was imported from china10 a further 68 cases were imported with the remaining 175 cases most likely the result of transmission within singapore11 all imported cases were travellers who had returned from wuhan before feb 4 2020 with transmission to close contacts recorded within families at a church and shop in three small transmission clusters11
as of march 16 2020 inpatients with covid-19 in singapore are isolated at the hospital they present to or at the national centre for infectious diseases a specialised facility designed to facilitate infectious disease outbreak response10 a government-wide taskforce has been established to increase surveillance at borders and prepare the public in terms of awareness and education10 the ministry of health singapore has implemented contact tracing efforts to identify potential cases among people travelling with or in close proximity to individuals with covid-1912 despite these efforts and nationwide precautionary measures including the dispensing of masks to households and public hospital emergency departments being on high alert for an outbreak response the number of suspected and imported cases in singapore is expected to increase due to the high volume of incoming travellers10 preliminary estimates indicate that the ascertainment rate in wuhan is 51 95 ci 485513 however high levels of under-reporting and misdiagnosis due to difficulties in identifying cases make it challenging for policy makers to prepare a large-scale response consequently following the recommendations made by wu and colleagues14 modelling studies are needed to estimate the potential impact of interventions in the early phase of the outbreak when uncertainty is highest which is crucial should local transmission begin to increasein this study we aimed to develop a national spatial model of covid-19 transmission in singapore to estimate the distribution of cases across time and space and to assess the potential impact of interventions on outbreak size should local containment efforts failwe used flute15 an agent-based influenza epidemic simulation model which accounts for demography host movement and social contact rates in workplaces schools and homes to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 should local containment fail the flute simulation model requires a synthetic population to build the contact and transmission network therefore we used the geographical demographic and epidemiological model of singapore hereafter referred to as geodemos-r where r represents respiratory illness16 a modelling framework that aims to recreate a synthetic but realistic representation of the singaporean population at the household and individual level we generated the synthetic population using national 2010 census data17 18 to fit multiple attributes of the population at the household and individual level the generated households contained demographic characteristics such as age marital status religion and ethnicity of household members individuals were then allocated to workplaces or educational facilities on the basis of local transportation data and home addresses according to 2010 census data19 the contact behaviour of individuals in the area of their home ie between family members and their local community defined as the home community workplace and school where applicable were recorded with potential transmission events as a function of infectivity we ran the models for 80 days to investigate the early stages of an epidemic and seeded 100 local cases randomly among the resident population at 0 days representing a few generations of local transmission at the time of scenario implementation ie when contact tracing has failed to identify cases within the community and unknown local transmission has started a full description of the model is available in the appendix pp 15within the flute infection model we assumed that no individual had existing immunity to sars-cov-2 since data ie infectiousness the cumulative distribution function for the incubation period and the duration of hospital stay on sars-cov-2 were unavailable at the time of designing this study we used sars-cov parameters to estimate the infectivity profile of sars-cov-2 these parameters included how infectious an individual is over time20 the proportion of the population assumed to be asymptomatic 7521 the cumulative distribution function for the mean incubation period with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 having the same mean incubation period of 53 days3 22 and the duration of hospital stay after symptom onset 35 days20 asymptomatic individuals were able to infect at a 50 reduced rate compared with their symptomatic counterparts based on estimates from nishiura and colleagues23
we also investigated four alternate asymptomatic proportions 227 as reported by furuya-kanamori and colleagues24 for influenza a h1n1 in a pooled prevalence study and 300 400 and 500 as potential but theoretical proportions to investigate intervention efficacy with a high fraction of infections that are cryptic and undetectablethree values for the basic reproduction number r

for the baseline scenario ie no interventions we ran 1000 epidemic simulations to account for the stochasticity in infection contact networks and to calculate cis across time four intervention scenarios were proposed for implementation after failure of local containment following policy options currently being assessed by the singaporean ministry of health as standard interventions for respiratory virus control isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of their family members hereafter referred to as quarantine quarantine plus immediate school closure for 2 weeks quarantine plus immediate workplace distancing in which 50 of the workforce is encouraged to work from home for 2 weeks and a combination of quarantine immediate school closure and workplace distancing hereafter referred to as the combined intervention quarantine of infected individuals is expected to occur 1 day after symptom onset in a health-care facility that is assumed to have 3000 beds at maximum capacity during the early stage of the outbreak and is fully equipped to handle full quarantine measures ie negative pressure isolation rooms full personal protective equipment use by staff so that the individual is unable to transmit sars-cov-2 to other inpatients at full capacity the remaining individuals are isolated at home after receiving treatment family members of infected individuals are quarantined at home for 14 days and thus are unable to attend work or school or infect the wider community at their residential address however transmission within families is possible as a result of the presence of an isolated and infected individual each of these intervention scenarios had 1000 simulations in which we additionally recorded the location of infection as the home community workplace or school appendix pp 34each of the 1000 epidemic simulations had a set of parameters and was run for baseline and the four control strategies the median simulation was determined as the median cumulative number of cases at day 80 the same set of parameters was used for each 1000 set of simulations for each r

0 is low 15 with a combination of the proposed intervention measures quarantine school closure and workplace distancing being most effective under this scenario r
015 workplace distancing reduced the median number of cases from 279 000 iqr 245 000 320 000 to 4000 20023 000 as a result of the high employment rates around 98 among individuals of working age in singapore25 this observation is consistent with the conclusions of a review of 15 studies that found a median reduction of 23 range 1282 in the cumulative influenza a h1n1 attack rate with workplace distancing alone26 the implementation of such a control measure however is likely to have an acute societal economic effect on individuals who must work from home or take leave especially if reimbursement is not possible thus decision making becomes a function of risk as to whether the imported cases have or will infect the local population and cause a local outbreak an r
0 value of 15 is not consistent with the evidence from china14 and thus prevention of community transmission might not be possible using interventions that would be widely supported by the populationat the start of the outbreak the risk of repeated importation of sars-cov-2 into singapore was deemed to be considerable given that around 34 million people travel from wuhan to singapore annually27 furthermore the start of the epidemic coincided with the 2020 chinese lunar new year holiday with the expectation that the number of individuals arriving from china would be similar to that for the 2018 celebrations around 800 000 tourists from china27 the high influx of incoming travellers exacerbated the risk of local disease establishment bringing at least 18 initial confirmed imported cases into singapore before feb 4 2020 when the first four local transmission cases were confirmed11 these four cases had contact with at least two infected tourists at a shop who were identified through intensive contact tracing efforts although travel is now reduced at least 175 subsequent locally-acquired infections have been reported at the time of writing across a diverse range of residential and commercial sites despite efforts by the singaporean government to quarantine and isolate infected individuals on march 16 2020 11 of the 17 confirmed cases were imported with travel histories including the uk indonesia portugal spain the usa france germany switzerland and belgium11 on march 17 2020 a further 17 of 23 cases were reported to be imported11 with the risk of disease establishment remaining high from the continued importation of cases workplace distancing and school closure remain as critical interventions that can avert a significant number of caseswe found that these two interventions when used in combination with quarantine would be highly effective at low infection rates ie r
0 of 15 with median of 10 000 cases iqr 20028 000 observed for school closures and 4000 cases 20023 000 for workplace distancing compared with 279 000 cases 245 000320 000 at the baseline at the highest level of infectivity r
025 substantial reductions were observed with a median of 466 000 cases iqr 175 000728 000 observed when school closure was used and 320 000 116 000558 000 for workplace distancing compared with 1 207 000 cases 1 164 0001 249 000 at baseline however if the preventive effect of these interventions reduces considerably due to higher asymptomatic proportions more pressure will be placed on the quarantining and treatment of infected individuals which could become unfeasible when the number of infected individuals exceeds the capacity of health-care facilitiesscale-up of ongoing surveillance programmes and rigorous contract tracing12 28 are thus required to assist in the maintenance of a low number of unidentified infections at this time with school closure and workplace distancing being potentially effective strategies for deployment nationwide should local transmission with multiple transmission events recorded between individuals in the resident population begin our simulation model which examined hypothetical infection spread with 100 unidentified singaporean cases as a seed population showed that for the baseline scenario ie no control interventions by day 80 when r
0 was 15 around 279 000 individuals would be infected when r
0 was 20 around 727 000 individuals would be infected and when r
0 was 25 around 1 207 000 individuals would be infected in the event that suppression of transmission through quarantine is unsuccessful and local transmission begins which has currently been observed in other countries on a small scale29 30 policy makers in singapore should deploy alternate measures such as school closure and workplace distancing in a timely manner school closure has been used in the past in singapore to limit the spread of hand foot and mouth disease and was associated with a decrease of up to 53 in secondary cases31 probably because children generally have high contact rates with their peers in the school environment given this historical experience a similar programme for covid-19 could be established reasonably quickly however at present data on the susceptibility of children to sars-cov-2 infection the number of infected children in singapore and the probability of children becoming symptomatic are limited making school closure less desirable than workplace distancingthe continually high percentage contribution of work-related infections despite work distancing being effective suggests that the workplace is a key infection site in singapore whereby reductions in workplace transmission averts cases at all other sites the effects of school closure and quarantine were comparable since the displacement of students to the home community will then rely on quarantine as a measure of preventing infection however asymptomatic cases assumed to account for 75 of the infected population would continue to contribute to transmission and the identification of these individuals presents a challengeincreasing the asymptomatic proportion in our model from 75 to 227 which is reflective of influenza a h1n124 resulted in limited infection control with considerable stochasticity whereby the failure of early quarantine led to outbreaks similar in size to those observed for the baseline scenario even when r
0 was 15 under this assumption the median number of cases averted compared with baseline ranged from 219 000 to 282 000 cases 644829 reduction depending on the intervention scenario for the quarantine school-closure work-distancing and combined intervention scenarios assuming an asymptomatic proportion of 75 and an r
0 of 15 a median of 264 000277 200 cases 946994 reduction would be averted compared with the baseline scenario thus considering the differences in number of cases averted by proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population additional interventions such as vaccination where research is rapidly ongoing or the prescribing of existing antiviral drugs that are effective for the treatment of related viral infections should be considered contact inhibition remains important but the high proportion of asymptomatic and undocumented infections and missed opportunities to quarantine will make control challenging even at a low infectivity r
0 15 a high asymptomatic proportion is problematic with 58 000 infections iqr 5400123 000 occurring at an asymptomatic proportion of 227 compared with 1800 infections 20023 000 at a 75 asymptomatic proportion with the combined intervention these effects were exacerbated further at higher asymptomatic proportions of 300500 with fewer cases averted and larger outbreak sizes from undocumented spread due to asymptomatic individuals the dialogue partly shifts from containment to case management to reduce mortality from complicationsregardless of the proportion of individuals in the population with asymptomatic infection all the proposed interventions should be used in addition to other measures such as rapid diagnosis and appropriate case management if local containment fails current government-led outbreak control measures will only be successful with public cooperation through exercising good hygiene infection prevention in shared spaces and adequate education to understand when symptoms might be indicative of a potential sars-cov-2 infection public complicity is particularly crucial for older individuals 60 years individuals who are immunocompromised and people with comorbidities who are at high risk of severe complications5 during the 2003 sars outbreak 238 probable sars cases were reported and 33 individuals died in singapore with the highest proportion of deaths 45 reported among people aged 65 years and older32 the same observation is thus expected for covid-19 should local transmission occur since the median age of infection in our models was 37 years iqr 2649 with comparatively few children becoming infected because of school closure and awareness among parents to quarantine children with fever singapore has one of the highest employment rates among older individuals aged 65 years of all countries within the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd33 and a culture of eating at so-called hawker centres ie food courts with around 75 of people visiting a hawker centre at least once a week34 consequently many older people are expected to be exposed to infection at work or within their home communities which could be mitigated in part by implementation of workplace distancing and if possible incentivisation to remain at home and practise workplace distancing specifically for older individualsat present the quarantining of family and close contacts of confirmed cases is crucial as shown by the substantial increase in infection rates among individuals who shared living spaces and bathrooms during the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in china despite the regular disinfection of these areas35 the protocols in place at present including the use of specialist ambulances negative pressure isolation rooms and ultraviolet disinfection will assist in isolating the infection and preventing transmission events at health-care facilities as was seen during the 2003 sars outbreak21 since at least 15 medical staff in wuhan have contracted the virus3 singapore has provided full personal protective equipment for health-care workers however the results of our study suggest that community transmission will substantially contribute to transmission should local containment fail despite these measures the main control measures at this time are surveillance standard testing procedures36 and quarantine of individuals who are confirmed positive for the virus such measures have been used in the past for suspected cases of mers-cov which has a 344 case-fatality rate37 with no cases of mers-cov reported in singapore to date and for zika virus which established locally in 2016 with only ten cases reported in 201938 such successes in preventing local outbreaks are attributed to robust disease surveillance in singapore nevertheless dengue outbreaks are ongoing in singapore39 which highlights the difficulties in disease control that are in part due to undocumented spread and individuals who are asymptomatic these issues are likely to affect the control of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic since many imported cases worldwide have been asymptomatic on entry to countries9 the implementation of school closure and workplace distancing can therefore be considered as a potential secondary control response in the event of infection quarantine failure and the establishment of community transmissionour study has several limitations first since geodemos-r is validated against census data errors exist in our estimations of population features that are based on data that have been sample enumerated second a large population of migrant workers who travel from malaysia to singapore each day visiting tourists and long-term visa owners were not accounted for in our infection dynamics third the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 remain uncertain in terms of the transmission and infectivity profile of the virus therefore estimates of the time between symptom onset and admission to hospital how infectious an individual is over time and the asymptomatic rate were based on sars-cov once this information becomes available for covid-19 a full sensitivity analysis should be done fourth the contact patterns between individuals are highly dynamic and heterogeneous across the population therefore our simulated work school and home populations serve as a general estimation of infection spread fifth effectiveness of the interventions might vary depending on the ongoing seeding of imported cases which we did not account for and will also rely on intervention compliance sixth multiple indirect effects from the interventions and modifications to human behaviour are likely which are difficult to quantify and measure the optimum times to implement each intervention and how long they should be run for to achieve long-term epidemic control should be explored finally there are multiple unforeseen factors that remain challenging to assess at this time such as increased infection rates at mass gatherings delays in quarantining as a result of individuals not seeking health care at symptom onset alternate contact events in locations such as public transport potential transmission events in the health-care setting and the effects of community-wide behavioural shifts in response to knowledge of the outbreakpandemic planning is crucial at the early stages to avert a nationwide outbreak in this study we investigated the use of interventions that aim to restrict contact between individuals at important mixing sites schools workplaces and at home we found that especially for lower infection scenarios r
0 of 15 a combined approach comprising quarantine for infected individuals and their families school closure and workplace distancing is effective and could prevent 993 of infections iqr 926999 when compared with the baseline scenario at higher infectivity scenarios outbreak prevention becomes considerably more challenging because although effective transmission events still occur for the combined approach scenario a median of 50 000 cases were estimated at r
0 of 20 and 258 000 cases at r
0 of 25 these combined interventions should therefore be implemented rapidly upon confirmation of second-generation local transmission occurring within the resident population to suppress increases in the national r

in december 2019 a series of viral pneumonia cases appeared in wuhan hubei china 6 deep clinical trials indicated a novel coronavirus covid-19 which was named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov this infection is characterized by lung failure which leads to respiratory distress the recent outbreak has raised numerous questions about our biological understanding of the pathogen how to respond to outbreaks 7 facing this situation the world paid a price both socially and economically countries have taken strict measures including the use of protective measures such as wearing face masks and gloves encouraging people to work from home to avoid contact with other people and limiting the travel between provinces from an international point of view several flows of goods and services are blocked due to geopolitical distrust cooperation between countries in this case becomes very difficult according to the world health organization who this pandemic has now infected more than 2 million people and 193825 cases confirmed deaths across the world 8 the who has stated that the spread of coronavirus may be interrupted by quarantine this strategy is defined as the separation of individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious disease like methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or the influenza a h1n1 virus from the rest of the population to reduce their risk of infecting others 5 during the coronavirus epidemic covid-19 quarantine was used as a public health fstrategy to reduce the transmission of disease many countries are taking measures to slow down the spread of this pandemic the measures differ from one country to another see table 1
the frustration related to the quarantine involves the loss of our daily routine for example the regular activities at home and work the purchases of necessities social contacts and physical limitations with others 9 zandifar et al discussed that quarantine during covid-19 can increase the psychological problems 10 this condition can show elevated rates of depression anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder like other pandemics the fear of death can develop depression among people who are quarantined 11 on the one hand the absence of financial sources costs of healthcare can lead to socioeconomic distress especially among people with low incomes on the other hand fear or suspicion avoidance or exclusion from leisure work or school activities and perceived stigma are some of the important factors causing depression when the quarantine ends returning to work and social routines can take several weeks or even months thus increasing even more worry anxiety and frustration specifically media exposure should be monitored because unreliable sources can increase stress consequently stress and depression push people to consume specifically high sugar food like chocolate and soft drinks and choose to eat high calorie treats to boost their mood 116 thus they easily gain weight 3 this desire to eat this unhealthy food will be much enhanced by the people quarantine-related depression also results in sleep disturbances that in turn further increase food intake thus giving rise to a dangerous vicious cycle 17 mediouni et al explained the impact of depression on obesity and this phenomenon was called depreobesity 4 besides physical activity has been reduced because of school closures which have derailed the lives of children 2 for that purpose they eat more unhealthy food have much longer screen time and have irregular sleep patterns all of which are linked to obesity 3 in the period of quarantine reducing energy expenditure contributes to the development of obesity 12 waiting for developing a covid-19 vaccine the quarantine will be prolonged and doubled for many countries physical exercises can be a good solution not only for losing weight but also can be beneficial for the immune system 13in the period of quarantine psychiatrists and psychologists will play a crucial role to help peoples to overcome the stress and depression and to create a sense of trust and safety the stressful environment of quarantine has a unfavourable impact on body weight after the disappearance of pandemic covid-19 policymakers need to focus more on these challenges and try to predict the upcoming epidemic depreobesity coronavirus will be a lesson for humanity to focus more on the science of prediction 14 the emerging of new techniques of translational medicine will help researchers to accelerate the treatment of this pandemic 1518 we hereby would like to alert public health officials to minimize as possible the depreobesity and we propose some solutions that can help people to be healthierthis manuscript received no funding

that they have no conflicts of interest regarding this publicationthe novel coronavirus 2019-ncov that emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 quickly spread within hubei province and has now reached all provinces in china and was exported to 20 countries by 30 january 2020 2019-ncov is thought to be primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets with a similar incubation time and generation time as sars coronavirus sars-cov12 sars was frightening at the time maybe even more frightening compared to 2019-ncov now renamed covid-19 given its much more frequent progression to severe disease and death but the world was able to completely interrupt human-to-human transmission halt the epidemic and sars-cov is now eradicated in the absence of vaccines and antivirals this remarkable achievement was only possible because of rigorous implementation of traditional public health measureswe are yet again faced with a situation of an outbreak with a closely related virus for which we currently have no specific therapeutics or vaccines again we need to rely on classical public health measures to curb the epidemic of this respiratory disease the primary goal of such public health measures is to prevent person-to-person spread of disease by separating people to interrupt transmission the tools we have at hand are isolation and quarantine social distancing and community containment all these tools are currently being employed at an unprecedented massive scale in china here we define these tools explain how they are being used to control the novel coronavirus and elaborate on the benefits and challengesisolation is the separation of ill persons with contagious diseases from non-infected persons to protect non-infected persons and usually occurs in hospital settings an isolation room could also be equipped with negative pressure to reduce transmission via aerosols but for large droplets like for sars cov control was achieved without negative pressure rooms isolation of patients is particularly effective in interrupting transmission if early detection is possible before overt viral shedding given that influenza patients can already transmit before clinical symptoms set it isolation is often too late to be sufficiently effective to halt transmission and control an influenza pandemic however for sars cov the incubation time is longer than for influenza about 5 versus 2 days3 and viral shedding was highest once the patient is truly sick a longer incubation time allows for more time to identify cases and put them into isolation the incubation time of the 2019-ncov also has a median of 5 days4 however at this stage it remains unknown when viral shedding and transmissibility peaks and how frequently pre-symptomatic cases result in secondary casesquarantine is one of the oldest and most effective tools of controlling communicable disease outbreaks this public health practice was used widely in fourteenth century italy when ships arriving at the venice port from plague-infected ports had to anchor and wait for 40 days in italian quaranta for 40 before disembarking their surviving passengers5 forty days provided ample time for the incubation time to be completed so that yet asymptomatic cases became symptomatic and could therefore be identified quarantine was implemented successfully as an effective measure during the sars epidemic in 20036 it is also an important component of pandemic influenza plans quarantine means the movement restriction of persons who are presumed to have been exposed to a contagious disease but are not ill either because they did not become infected or because they are still in the incubation period7 quarantine may be applied at the individual or group level and usually involves restriction to the home or a designated facility quarantine may be voluntary or mandatory during quarantine all individuals should be monitored for the occurrence of any symptoms if such symptoms occur they must be immediately isolated in a designated centre familiar with treating severe respiratory illness quarantining is most successful in settings where detection of cases is prompt contacts can be listed and traced within a short time frame with prompt issuance of quarantine with voluntary compliance to this issuancesocial distancing is designed to reduce interactions between people in a broader community in which individuals may be infectious but have not yet been identified hence not yet isolated as diseases transmitted by respiratory droplets require a certain proximity of people social distancing of persons will reduce transmission social distancing is particularly useful in settings where community transmission is believed to have occurred but where the linkages between cases is unclear and where restrictions placed only on persons known to have been exposed is considered insufficient to prevent further transmission8 examples for social distancing include closure of schools or office buildings and suspension of public markets and cancellation of gatheringsif these measures are deemed to be insufficient community-wide containment may need to be implemented community-wide containment is an intervention applied to an entire community city or region designed to reduce personal interactions except for minimal interaction to ensure vital supplies it is a continuum to expand from social distancing to community-wide quarantine with major movement restrictions of everyone enforcement of community-wide containment measures is far more complex given the larger number of persons involved such measures are also ethically more challenging with individual human rights weighing against the public health imperative the advent of social media is an additional challenge to ensure compliance during such community-wide quarantine it is particularly important to wisely use social media as social media provides an opportunity for communicating the reasons for quarantine reassurance and practical advice and to pre-empt false rumours and panic implementation requires close partnerships and cooperation with law enforcement at the local and state level and often involves checkpoints and may need legal penalties if quarantine violations occur a community-wide quarantine is currently happening in china on an order of magnitude that mankind has never witnessed before table 1  summarizes the different public health measureschina has been preparing to contain future pandemics by applying lessons learnt from sars ever since 20039 we have to commend china for their swift and decisive response within a matter of weeks china implemented all the tools ranging from case detection with immediate isolation and contact tracing with quarantining and medical observation of all contacts by 2 february 2020 14 600 cases had been confirmed and 20 000 cases were classified as suspect cases waiting for laboratory results 113 579 close contacts were been tracked and 4201 people were released from medical observation a total of 102 427 people were receiving medical observation this is an unprecedented gigantic effort that surpasses all quarantine measures during sars however the sheer magnitude of the new cases means that not all contacts can possibly be ascertained or monitored adequately it means that many unidentified contacts are in the community while sars was mainly an outbreak that propagated itself within hospitals and confined communities hotel metropole amoy gardens etc widespread community transmission is already evident for 2019-ncov in hubei province and beyond hence the most drastic of all classical public health measures was the only logical next step community containment with social distancing community-use of facemasks at all times and the city of wuhan with 11 million residents was locked-in with the shutdown of the citys public transportation including buses trains ferries and the airport prior to the lock-down in wuhan about 5 million many of whom were already infected left wuhan thus contributing to further spread as the community-based outbreak spread lock-down was extended to 60 million residents in 20 cities by 30 january 2020 china has issued the largest quarantine in historythere are multiple implications for travellers national borders may be closed or they may be barred from entry into cities or provinces where community containment is being implemented international travellers already locked into such areas will not be able to leave unless their governments charter airplanes to fly them out and even then it may be difficult to reach the airport due to blocked roads indeed most governments are now in the process of evacuating their citizens and such passengers will be subject to 14 days quarantine upon arrival in their home country quarantining of those returning travellers or expats will occur at designated facilities including islands for some countries with medical observationpublic health measures were successful for sars because the vast majority of sars patients were symptomatic and were thus identifiable and could be isolated viral loads peaked at 611 days after onset of illness for nasopharyngeal aspirates and overall peak viral loads were reached at 1214 days of illness when patients were usually already in hospital care10 low or absence of viral shedding in the first few days of illness meant that early isolation measures could be effective the incubation time allowed for timely isolation and also for contacts to be traced and quarantined in timethe victory of old-type public health tools over sars provides impetus to continue such stringent measures for the novel coronavirus given the trajectory of this outbreak it is now a matter of whether we are able to scale up such efforts to keep pace with the rapid increase of cases and geographical spreadwhether these rigorous measures will result in the same victory as for sars depends on the following questions that currently remain unanswered i what is the proportion of subclinical disease asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic that would be missed by the case definition hence not be identified and immediately isolated and therefore contribute to community transmission ii on what day of illness is peak viral shedding and how much viral shedding occurs before onset of symptoms iii does viral shedding occur also beyond respiratory droplets eg via fomites iv what is the true case fatality rate if the denominator also takes milder cases into accountthe answers to these questions will drive the response preliminary insights from clusters in vietnam and germany unveil that even mildly symptomatic persons may contribute to transmission1112 if this is indeed more frequent then old-style public health measures will not be sufficient and we need to await vaccines to halt the epidemicthe initial case fatality rate was reported to be 15 but the initial cases were biased towards the severe end of the disease with rapidly rising cases it is now thought to be around 23 until we understand the full clinical spectrum of the disease we will not know the case fatality rate what we do know is that disease severity does not drive transmissibility although the case fatality rate may be far lower than that of sars-cov the greatest concern could be that this novel virus behaves epidemiologically like influenza viruses will defy all old-style public health measures and turn into a pandemic with many more deaths than sars since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first detected in china on december 31 2019 it has rapidly spread all over the world and 230104 people have died from coronavirus disease covid-19 in 215 countries as of may 3 2020 1 there have been many infections and related problems on ships worldwide such as the grand princess united states 2 the ruby princess and ovation of the seas australia and costa luminosa france japan implemented a large-scale quarantine on the diamond princess cruise ship and all passengers including asymptomatic patients were tested for sars-cov-2 by using reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr valuable lessons can be learned from the steps taken for quarantine implementation on the cruise ship the diamond princess had 3711 people 2666 passengers and 1045 crew on board and the average age of passengers was 660 years 3 the ship left yokohama port on january 20 2020 a passenger who disembarked from the ship in hong kong on january 25 developed a fever on january 30 this passenger was confirmed to be positive for covid-19 on february 1 the ship arrived at yokohama earlier than scheduled on february 3 at which time the quarantine began 3we the authors worked as medical staff at the entrance of the diamond princess from february 14 to 17 2020 when the number of rt-pcrconfirmed covid-19 cases reached its peak we supported the transport of people with positive rt-pcr results by coordinating with the hospital and transportation provider depending on their condition in addition to scheduling transportation we arranged for emergency transportation of people whose symptoms worsened since february 18 fujita medical university okazaki medical center shinkaiin temple has accepted a large number of patients with mild symptoms and has served as a place for quarantining asymptomatic patientswe report on the experience of this large-scale quarantine and the passenger room isolation procedures implemented to control covid-19 aboard a cruise ship during the quarantine rt-pcr testing of throat swabs was extended to all passengers in the following orderthis report did not contain any personal information and all information was anonymized before it was added into the report there was no reward for the research participants since there are no economic interests that affect the research results this research paper was approved by the ethics committee of yodogawa christian hospital approved no 2020-006 rt-pcr tests were performed for all 3711 passengers and crew of the diamond princess 696 188 passengers tested positive of which 410 589 were asymptomatic figure 1 table 1 as of march 8 2020 31 patients 45 of those with positive rt-pcr results were hospitalized with a ventilator or in intensive care units and 7 patients 10 of those with positive rt-pcr results had died figure 2 45 we transported asymptomatic people to the quarantine location the criteria for asymptomatic status were no fever body temperature 375 c995 f as measured by an axillary thermometer with an spo2 blood oxygen saturation of 97 or above as measured with a pulse oximeter in room air of the 128 people who were transported 75 n96 had positive rt-pcr results while on board the ship of the asymptomatic people with rt-pcrpositive results 135 n13 required medical intervention after being transported from the ship and were transferred from the quarantine location to a hospital within 24 hours of arrivalcase fatality ratios and infection fatality ratios on the diamond princess ship were reported to be 26 95 ci 089-67 and 13 95 ci 038-36 respectively 6 mizumoto et al 7 determined that most infections occurred before the quarantine started however the environment of a cruise ship is vulnerable to the spread of infection and the peak reproduction number on the diamond princess ship was 121 before the quarantine started 8 we will describe the medical activities and difficulties experienced in infection control on the cruise shipfirst the structure of the cruise ship made it difficult to carry out the medical services required for an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease the situation necessitated onboard quarantine with complete inspection and isolation of rt-pcrpositive persons additionally todays cruise ships are huge the diamond princess had 3706 people on board including 2706 passengers of many nationalities the ship began service in 2004 it is 290 meters 9514 feet long and 375 meters 1230 feet wide with 18 floors 9 each room has a toilet and shower the high-class rooms are large and have balconies as the class level decreases the area of the rooms becomes smaller and the rooms are located on lower floors the lowest class rooms are interior rooms with no windows crew rooms are even smaller and have limited personal space all large cruise ships have many rooms with narrow corridors and many people gather in small spaces such as restaurants theaters and casinos the diamond princess was anchored at daikoku wharf yokohama city and berthed at the quay figure 3 the ship has three elevator halls one near the bow one near the center and one near the stern the opening at the stern is used only for carrying supplies so we could only use 2 elevators to enter from the outside of the ship we passed through a narrow passageway and entered the ship from the opening near the center figure 4 then we passed through a security check and reached the elevator hall in front of the medical centeremerging infectious diseases are novel to humans and the mode of transmission infectivity basic reproduction number severity rate fatality rate and long-term prognosis are not known at the time of confirmation at the beginning of the outbreak in china it was thought that covid-19 could not be spread via human-to-human transmission however it later became clear that human-to-human infection could occur the possibility of airborne infection was also raised at the beginning of implementation of the quarantine we had to enact measures based on limited information which is confusing in general when we do not have the exact information we have to consider the maximum risk possible during the quarantine of the diamond princess a lot of new information about covid-19 in china was published hence we had to change our practice and attitude accordingly there might be a gap between the new and old infection control measuresthere were several collaborators in the response to the outbreak on the diamond princess such as the original medical staff ministry of health labour and welfare quarantine support team self-defense forces disaster medical assistance team dmat japanese red cross society disaster psychiatric assistance team dpat japan medical association team jmat and national hospital organization some staff did not have medical qualifications and each organization had different standardson february 3 2020 when the ship arrived at yokohama a quarantine was initiated all passengers and crew underwent medical examinations on february 5 the rt-pcr results from the throat swab for symptomatic people and their close contacts revealed that 10 of 31 individuals were positive for sars-cov-2 on the same day the japanese government decided that all passengers were to be quarantined in their cabins for 14 days 10 based on international guidance on infection control the crew continued to maintain ship functions and support passengers for their food clothing and shelter-related needsat this point the rt-pcr testing took about 6 hours but it took additional time to collect and transport samples and verify the results to protect the personal information of the people involved specimens are not managed by name but by individually identified specimen id caution was required when double-checking the test results against the individual ida total of 2666 passengers and 1045 crew members underwent rt-pcr testing 45 we could not isolate the cabin crew since they needed to maintain the ships functions and provide passengers with food and laundry of the cabin crew those with symptoms or positive rt-pcr results disembarked and were transferred to the appropriate facilities depending on their condition those with negative rt-pcr results were transferred to a residential facility to be observed for 14 days after disembarkation we were aware that the rt-pcr test was not sensitive enough and might have led to false negatives those who tested positive were promptly notified that they were positive before being transferred to the hospital or quarantine facilities under the quarantine law since a certain number of false negative rt-pcr test results were expected the negative results were labeled as undetermined test results until the last day of the 14-day quarantine period and the negative result was reported at the time of the disembarkation the rt-pcrnegative passengers who had not developed any symptoms after 14 days of cabin isolation were discharged and returned to their homestheoretically we needed to divide the traffic line between infectious red zone and noninfectious things green zone including humans but exceptions were made because of the following reasonsfirst there were many elderly people over 75 years old and some of them could not walk on their own to separate the traffic line of the infected people from the medical staff the other opening on the bow side was considered to be the disembarkation port for the infected people however it was very hard for aging passengers to walk to the entrance at the bowsecond going through the center entrance was the shortest way for the medical staff to get to the headquarters the shipboard activity headquarters and the medical support headquarters were located in the two dining areas in the center of deck 5 which is directly above the entrance in the center 9 in addition using that entrance meant that we did not need to use an elevator to get to the headquarters this route minimized contact with the passengers and crew if the bow side was used as an entrance for the medical staff people would have had to walk through narrow corridors between cabins for a long time to reach the headquarterslooking back equipped with the current information it seems that the elevator hall in front of the medical center could have had a higher infection risk because it was not possible for infected and noninfected people to use the elevator separately the place where the headquarters was located was where it did not overlap with other peoples traffic linesunder the quarantine act and the infectious diseases act people infected with sars-cov-2 were to be placed in quarantine it was very difficult to decide where to isolate the 696 rt-pcrpositive individuals arrange for transportation and ensure that each person was transported to the facility the kanagawa prefectural government and its supporting dmat were in charge of contacting the hospital to be used as the isolation facility making inquiries about acceptance deciding who would be placed in which facility and securing vehicles for their transport the dmat command center located at the terminal of the daikoku wharf was in charge of deciding which vehicles would be used to transport the rt-pcrpositive patients the onboard medical headquarters was in charge of checking the medical condition of the people who would disembark and of supporting them to the entrance at the center of the ship the dmat at the entrance of the ship was in charge of checking the preparation of the vehicles and their destination and ensuring correct transportationat first we transported the symptomatic patients to the designated medical institutions in that area that were equipped to handle infectious diseases however all the beds in kanagawa prefecture were soon filled and we had to extend transportation to other places in the kanto region at the same time the japanese government was operating facilities for health observation and quarantine for people who were returning to japan on flights from hubei province we had to expand the transportation area to fukushima nagano and even osaka which is a 6-hour drive from the ship on the peak day we had new 99 rt-pcrpositive patients and we had to transport family members separately even though they should have stayed in the same facility we could not send all family members to the same quarantine place at that time the fujita medical university okazaki medical center offered to accept 170 asymptomatic patients since this facility was still in preparation to open as a hospital in april 2020 it was intended to only accept patients who would require no medical treatment the author was dispatched as a dmat for logistic support at okazaki medical center and was in charge of ensuring bus transportation room allocation arrival confirmation advice on the transfer to a medical facility and overall reception since the patient lists were sent to the quarantine facility from yokohama headquarters in advance we finished the allocation of the name id and room before the arrival of the bus at the quarantine building the transport bus was attached to the front entrance the staff first carried their baggage to the entrance hall and then the passengers got off the bus we checked their body temperature and spo2 levels while their baggage was picked up and patients were registered we took face photos and attached the id registration wristband in the allocated room figure 5as previously reported chest computed tomography ct has a high sensitivity 97 95 ci 95-98 for covid-19 pneumonia 11 we also confirmed that 54 n221 of the asymptomatic patients with a positive rt-pcr result had observable lung opacities on chest cts 12 some people who were transported from the ship to the okazaki facility developed mild chest pain during the 6-hour transportation based on the results of the ct image the development of pneumonia may cause pleural pain the speed at which the patients changed from being asymptomatic or mild to severe was very high about 10 of asymptomatic people developed symptoms during a 6-hour transport and 10-20 of them worsened rapidly to a state in which intubation was considered within 24 hoursthe following 6 processes were required to transfer a person from self-isolation in the cabin room to another facilityonce the process was completed the dmat of the onboard medical headquarters assisted the person in moving from their cabin to the entrance of the ship many medical institutions preferred to accept patients in the daytime so these tasks were concentrated in a very short timeunlike the usual disembarkation from a cruise ship the patients needed to carry their baggage themselves they had to pass through the quarantine area and customs some people had difficulty walking or had a lot of baggage which meant it took a long time to move the author was to check each transportation process and the departure of the vehicle and report it to the command center many foreign passengers did not understand japanese or english at all making the situation unimaginably difficult to manage sometimes we had to ask the crew to interpret the command even if it increased the risk of infectionwe needed to support the daily lives of 3711 people on the ship since all passengers were isolated in each cabin we had to deliver daily supplies to each room there were people of various nationalities and religions aboard and it was necessary to consider religious taboos and allergies the crew members had to keep working under the risk of infection the crew dining area was considered the primary area of infection for the crew since the food service had the most confirmed cases 13 we recommend treating the crew the same way as the passengers for infection control in addition a lot of water is necessary for human life and a lot of sewage was generated in the beginning we left the pier to the open ocean offshore once every few days for sewage disposal but in the latter half of the quarantine period the government and municipalities facilitated drinking water delivery and sewage water collection while the ship was still alongside the pier leaving the pier also became a barrier to the patients transportationwe have described the difficulties associated with medical activities in the management of emerging infectious diseases on a cruise ship infection control on a cruise ship is very difficult because of environmental factors 14 human factors and limited medical resourceson february 24 2020 the world health organization announced an interim guidance for the operational considerations for managing covid-19 cases and outbreaks on board ships 15 we learned that a significant number of passengers with positive rt-pcr results had no or mild symptoms the deterioration of patients with covid-19 is very fast suggesting that authorities need to prepare for patients transfer and the admitting hospital when disembarking the passengers there were several difficulties on the cruise ship such as securing traffic lines coordinating accepting facilities and transport means risk of deterioration the complex transporting process on the ship and support for daily life on the ship we recommend treating the crew the same way as the passengers for infection control we must make a plan for the future to protect travelers and passengers from emerging infectious diseases on cruise ships we strongly hope this report will be helpful to the people who are working to control covid-19 infections on cruise ships worldwidesocial isolation may sound modern but this is not the case isolation during illness is ancient it eventually became known as the quarantine a term derived from the17th-century italian word quarantina meaning forty days but as kelly drews reports in her brilliant 2013 article a brief history of quarantine in the virginia tech undergraduate historical review quarantines have been employed for thousands of years as safeguards against the spread of disease early in the history of civilizations isolation and confinement of ill persons were the predecessors of quarantine4 drews astute observations inform much of what followsmicrobes were not known by humankind thousands of years ago what were our ancestors trying to protect againstmicroscopic pathogens were discovered during the period 1665-83 by two fellows of londons royal society robert hooke and antoni van leeuwenhoek in micrographia 1665 hooke presented the first published description of a microganism the microfungus mucor leeuwenhoek a few years later actually observed and described microscopic protozoa and bacteria while employing his improvements on the recently invented microscope5
a key figure in the evolution of our understanding of the spread of infections was louis pasteur whose findings were published in 1861 fifteen years later the german physician robert koch traced the life history of the microbe responsible for anthrax in cattle and sheep six years after that in 1882 koch worked out the cause of tuberculosis it was the first microbial disease in humans for which this had been accomplished4 although a monumental achievement it was not until the 20th century that germ theory became a standard part of scientific and medical knowledge most of kochs contemporaries persisted in believing that the major culprits were bad air miasmas and undisciplined lifestyles and had nothing to do with tiny living organisms6
the incubation period is the interval from the time the pathogen enters the body until the time it first causes symptoms because of the incubation period an individual may carry a disease-causing pathogen without being symptomatic when symptoms occur they may be minimal such as a low-grade fever which reflects the bodys attempt to kill or control the spread of the harmful microbethroughout much of early epidemiological history isolation not quarantine was the primary method of halting the spread of pandemics because people did not understand the concept of an incubation period drews states4 therefore before microbes were discovered in the nineteenth century people understood that social isolation worked but they did not know why they only understood that sick people should be separated from well individualsthis type of uncertainty persists in many areas of medical science we have often known that something works before we understand how it works a classic example is general anesthetics whose effectiveness was unquestioned before we had a clue about the physiological mechanisms that were involveddrews finds an early form of semi-isolation the biblical book of leviticus the third book of the jewish torah thought to have been written between the fifth and eighth centuries bce instructions occur in the thirteenth chapter for the isolation of those suffering from a skin disease most likely leprosynearly a thousand years later in 541 ce the first recorded outbreak of what came to be known as bubonic plague or the black death was reported by the byzantine historian procopius7 this outbreak was also called the plague of justinian or the justinian plague after the roman emperor it afflicted the entire mediterranean basin europe and the near east constantinople the seat of the roman empire at the time was severely affected8
the justinian plague raged from 541 to 549 ce and destroyed up to an estimated 40 percent of the population in the affected regions justinian contracted the plague but did not die from it he instituted burial customs and control measures they included efforts to control the movements of people believed responsible for the disease including jews pagans heretics and homosexualsdrews is unsparing in her criticism of justinians response to the plague she states justinians discriminatory laws created a sort of quarantine though he had no knowledge of what caused the disease to spread people who were considered different from the christians of constantinople were accused of causing the terrible outbreak as a result justinian attempted to halt their movement these minorities were no guiltier in their role as plague carriers than the christians who had the disease but racism and aggression against dissident groups of justinians reign played a major role in their branding as the source of the epidemic the quarantine enacted by justinian proved virtually useless and did nothing to stop the spread of the plague however it still qualifies as a quarantine technology a failed technology but a technology nonetheless4
in drews piquant description originally appearing in the far east the disease that would come to be synonymous with plague first emerged in europe as nothing more than a rumor in 1346 over the next five to ten years the plague exploded onto the western world killing millions and altering the fabric of every society it touched4 the use of quarantine expanded during the fourteenth century as the epidemics of black death continuedwhat did the plague look like drews cites the description of the illness recorded by italian author boccaccio 1313-1357 in his decameron its earliest symptom in men and women alike was the appearance of certain swellings in the groin or armpit some of which were egg-shaped whilst others were roughly the size of the common apple against these maladies it seemed that all the advice of physicians and all the power of medicine were profitless and unavailingfew of those who caught it ever recovered and in most cases death occurred within three days from the appearance of the symptoms we have described some people dying more rapidly than others the majority without any fever or other complications9
as i write there are almost 400000 confirmed deaths worldwide from coronavirus infection httpsourworldindataorgcoronavirus-data these are tragic numbers but they are small compared to what our ancestors endured by the time the black death subsided after 1351 20 million people had died in europe alone reducing the population to 80 million people the epidemic completely halted the rise in human population begun in 5000 bce it killed so many people that it would take europe more than 150 years to return to its former population4
today people complain about isolation facemasks business closures and restricted movement compare these inconveniences with those imposed during fourteenth-century europe during the plague years drews by the late fourteenth century the effects of the plague were so bad that italian city-states resorted to desperate measures in an attempt to preserve public health without definite knowledge of what caused the disease italian health commissioners fell back on a common theory that the air itself was infected in their view the only way to stop the epidemic was to somehow clean the air in their pursuit of corruption-free air commissioners inspected wine fish meat and water supplies they worried about sewage they regulated burials and decreed the destruction of the clothing of the deceased these measures may have saved lives by cutting down on secondary sources of infection but besides burning the clothing of the deceased they did little to curb the rampant spread of the plague  more extreme measures were taken by viscount bernabo of reggio who ordered every person with plague be taken out of the city in to the fields there to die or recover4

by the mid-1370s modern quarantine procedures began to take shape in italy drews reports in 1374 both genoa and venice began determining the ports of origin of incoming ships and turned away any coming from infected areas ultimately the italian city-states extended their quarantine time requirement to forty days originally termed trentino the adjustment to forty days of quarantine caused the name to be modified to quarantino a term derived from the italian word quaranta which means forty some suggest this was based on the hippocratic belief that the 40th day distinguished acute diseases from chronic other authors contend that it was changed due to christian practices such as the observation of lent the length of the great flood of noah or the length of jesus stay in the wilderness regardless of the reason the increased quarantine time offered an improvement it better insured that the ships in question did not pose a health risk to the city4
if any deaths occurred or if anyone fell sick during the voyage or during the time the quarantine was being observed the quarantine would be extended for 50 or 60 days according to the danger and circumstances and the goods on board would be sent to the pesthouse to be purified4
in addition to establishing a maritime quarantine for incoming ships italian health officials began to restrict infected persons and their families and contacts to their homes as a means of preventing further spread of disease often the authorities would assign individuals to guard the homes of the quarantined in order to insure they did not escape isolation sometimes amounted to captivity and imprisonment in milan where cases of the plague were first discovered all the occupants of the three houses concerned dead or alive sick or well were walled up inside and left to perish this extreme action appeared to have worked as out of all the large italian city-states milan was the least afflicted with the black death11
some forms of isolation and quarantine amounted to banishment drews reports that in 2007 archaeologists discovered a mass grave of more than 1500 victims of the bubonic plague while working on the small island of lazzaretto vecchio in italys venetian lagoon during the plague years those in venice who caught the plague were sent to this island they were treated until they either survived or perished by physicians brave or foolish enough to tend to the infected drews states lazzaretto vecchio may have been the worlds first lazaret or quarantine colony4

englands major cities also suffered severely during the plague years poor sanitation and massive overcrowding guaranteed a hideous death toll the last in a long series of pandemics the great plague of london in 1665 killed between 75000 and 100000 of the capital citys citizens during the summer months the death rates rose peaking in september when 7165 londoners died in one week13
in the united states an epidemic of yellow fever struck philadelphia then the nations capital in august 1793 the disease killed around 5000 citizens and caused 20000 to flee the city in response the lazaretto station was established on the delaware river in tinicum township in 1799 it was a 10-acre compound consisting of a hospital offices and residences that processed ships cargo and passengers sailing for the port of philadelphia it operated for nearly a century14
in 1832 a cholera epidemic swept over new york city it was part of a pandemic that began in asia in 1824 eventually spreading to england and canada over the next eight years in 1832 learning that the disease had spread to quebec and the city of montreal new york city mayor walter browne instituted a quarantine in an effort to protect his city immigrants continued to enter new york city from england via canada however and the quarantine collapsed around 3500 new yorkers died while 70000 fled the city they carried cholera into americas interior spreading the disease as far south as new orleans and mexico15
quarantines and isolation have been used to stem disease for 3000 years as drews summarizes as human understanding of disease transmission grew quarantine sophistication and efficacy improved until it became standard practice in combating epidemics though not always successful quarantines delayed or contained outbreaks by removing all potential pathogen carriers from the populace at first lightly used against leprosy and plagues of antiquity quarantine as a technology expanded rapidly in the western world during the black death epidemic its initial success against the plague established quarantine as a standard procedure to stopping the spread of epidemics and pandemics4
for three millennia our predecessors have struggled to find ways of stemming illness and death from diseases that have been largely defanged by sanitation vaccines medications and the knowledge of the behavior of microbes some of the early forms of isolation were draconian as weve seen such as walling up the sick confining them to islands or sending them into fields to get well or dieagainst this painful historical backdrop perhaps we might be more tolerant of the preventative precautions issued by contemporary health authorities such as the cdc most of our ancestors who faced plague cholera and yellow fever would likely trade places with us without hesitation they would probably look with disbelief on our complaints of being inconvenienced by social isolation social distancing and wearing masks and gloves in public they would probably laugh at the current complaint that individual liberties and freedoms are being sacrificed by the preventative measures aged in our fight against covid-19 when far more lethal diseases killed them by millions and depopulated their citiesevery death from our coronavirus pandemic is tragic but remembering what our ancestors endured and their courage as well as mistakes can perhaps soften the blow larry dossey mdexecutive editora new coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome called sars-cov-21 emerged in the region of wuhan mainland china in december 20192 this rapidly spreading virus most likely originated from bat to human transmission in a wet market in china and now caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease covid-193 cheng et al

here we describe early experience in a military setting in switzerland and the herein associated challenges the cases occurred in the canton of ticino which is the southernmost canton of switzerland and borders italys regions of piedmont and lombardy which are among the most heavily struck covid-19 regions in the world7 although severe disease is unlikely in the highly selected population of a recruit school8 management of logistical issues in this closed environment is highly challenging our aim is to emphasise how aggressive early management of disease can avoid general spread among the troops which can jeopardise any subsidiary engagement in supporting civil institutions and hospitalsthis is a retrospective cases series among members of the swiss armed forces maf during the covid-19 pandemic all members of the swiss armed forces provided informed consent for the studynasopharyngeal swabs from both nostrils was performed by an experienced otolaryngologist diagnosis of covid-19 was made after positive pcr for sars-cov-2 by the cantonal laboratory in bellinzona ticino switzerlandquarantine was established for persons with close contact less than 2 m for more than 15 min in the last 48 hours before onset symptom of the covid-19 positive index patientfor serological testing we used a commercially available immunochromatography rapid test with sars-cov-2 protein-specific igm and igg this test was performed according to the manufacturers instructions with a reported sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 95 respectivelyon 12 march 2020 a recruit presented at the military medical centre of monte ceneri ticino switzerland with headache dry cough and fever since the previous day his exposition and travel history were unremarkable expect for a skiing trip in the swiss alps during a permission 4 days before the patient patient 1 was isolated pcr testing from nasopharyngeal swab was positive for sars-cov-2 at the time it was the second positive case in the swiss armed forces the patient was treated symptomatically with acetaminophen and antitussive drugs quarantine was ordered for any person with a close contact with patient 1 a total of 55 mafs had to be quarantined for a total headcount of 140 of the concerned company a separate military barrack was requisitioned for the planned quarantine period of 5 days the 55 mafs were put in seven separate rooms a thermometer was provided to each room and a room deputy was responsible of reporting the health state of the roommates twice a dayin the first day of the quarantine 13 march 2020 7 of 9 mafs in a particular single room developed flu-like symptoms such as coughing odynophagia weakness and slightly elevated temperatures pcr nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for all cases most of the symptomatic quarantined mafs showed rapid resolution of the symptoms without treatment except for two of them they showed persistent mild cough and slightly elevated temperaturesnasopharyngeal swab was repeated on 17 march 2020 in these two patients one was positive for covid-19 patient 2 isolation of the entire room was ordered for 10 more days the maf in the other rooms did not show any symptoms and quarantine could be withheld after 120 hoursboth sars-cov-2 positive cases patients 1 and 2 showed a very mild disease patient 1 had fever for 2 days 388c and 381c patient 2 never developed fever after 2 days in patient 1 and 3 days in patient 2 symptoms of covid-19 disappeared completely after 2 and 3 days symptoms of covid-19 disappeared completely in patient 1 and 2 respectivelyseven days after initial diagnosis 20 march we repeated pcr testing of nasopharyngeal swabs both patient 1 and patient 2 were still positive although they had been completely asymptomatic and well for the past 5 and 4 days respectivelyinterestingly patient 2 had very limited direct contact to patient 1 but they both had contact to a third person which remained asymptomatic the whole course of the quarantine and tested negative for sars-cov-2 although remaining unproven the third person was likely an asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carrier this patient may have been the link with patients 1 and 2finally we performed serological test on isolated maf 14 days after patient 1 was diagnosed with covid-19 in patients 1 and 2 serological testing was positive for both igm and igg interestingly all other close contacts to our positive patients including the third suspected asymptomatic carrier tested negativethe covid-19 epidemic is a rapidly spreading disease that is met with exceptional sanitary measures worldwide to limit its spread as illustrated in our case series limiting the spread of the disease has proven to be highly challenging for several reasonsfirst hygiene measures such as hand washing social distancing and sneezing andor coughing in the elbow are basic measures that only show limited efficacy in the particular conditions of a recruit school and military barracks some of these measures are hardly feasible and impracticalstrict contact isolation is required it has been shown that viable sars-cov-2 on plastic surfaces can be present up to 72 hours after inoculation in experimental setting9 making contagion through door knobs and scale ramps very likely9 it is therefore paramount to ensure separate catering sanitation and lodging with increasing case and suspected numbers patients with sars-cov-2 and quarantined mafs it can become increasingly difficult to obtain appropriate facilities in a military environment as emergency solution we used tents to extend lodging capacity for quarantined mafs figures 13our series shall emphasise the psychological burden during the time of quarantine and isolation10 although in the military setting we had the relative advantage of having to group mafs for logistical reasons which resulted in although isolated yet not lonely quarantine conditionssecond many young people are largely asymptomatic but may be sars-cov-2 carriers transmitting the disease11 estimates reach from 18 to at least 59 in some studies12 13 although fever and cough are described as the most common symptoms and sometimes deemed to be typical of covid-1914 it is very important to remember that in young adults symptomatology can be much milder and quite atypical our two patients showed a mild course disease with symptom resolution after few days but continued to be positive for sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs this finding underlies the importance of prolonged isolation to reduce further virus transmission as sars-cov-2 can still be proven in apparently healthy adults many days after symptom resolution15 this is also paramount for health workers to not underestimate as if they became infected the risk of further spreading the disease while willing to treat it is high15
covert virus spreading also seems to occur during the preclinical inoculation period mean incubation time was reported to be 62 days range 214 with asymptomatic carriers before and after the clinical overt phase if any present16 in the preclinical phase it is important to separate any person with contact to a suspected or confirmed case on 20 march 2020 the swiss government increased quarantine time recommendations from 5 days up to 10 days our findings support this decision as it covers more accurately the incubation time for contactshowever some slightly symptomatic carriers may test negative in pcr of nasopharyngeal swabs therefore it is important to time adequately swabs and to repeat them if clinical suspicion of covid-19 is present wang et al
17 described the highest sensitivity for pcr for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 93 followed by sputum 72 nasal swabs 63 and pharyngeal swabs 32 a combination of different or symptom-oriented swap localisation may be usefulof note sars-cov-2 can also be transmitted by oralfaecal route with viral shedding proven in stool specimen of patients with covid-1917
the relative lack of sensitivity of pcr especially in young and healthy population poses great challenges to epidemic control17 18 for that reason serological testing has gained great interest in the past weeks but still requires further validation19 in our case series none of the asymptomatic close contacts to patients 1 and 2 tested positive for pcr andor serology one possible explanation is that hygiene measures during quarantine and isolation were sufficient to avoid further spread however considering the high reproduction number of covid-19 a false-negative pcr from nasopharyngeal swab and false negative serology have to be considered for the latter a weak to mild symptomatology could explain the lack of detectable immune reaction20 finally negative serological testing might be linked to not yet fully validated technology19 how covert shedding of sars-cov-2 may be reduced in the future for example by prophylactic hydroxychloroquine21 remains unknown but is of great strategic interest for civil and military authoritiesyoung and healthy patients often show a mild course when infected with sars-cov-2 they may be before and after symptom presentation carriers and spreaders of sars-cov-2 this factor may lead to significant covert viral transmissionan early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contact persons respectively is therefore essential to slow down sars-cov-2 epidemic growth especially in confined space conditions seen in a military settingafter nearly 2 months of quarantine france has approximately 132000 people infected with coronavirus disease covid-19 and more than 25000 deaths 1 older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov-2 2 studies agree that we are only at the beginning of an unprecedented health crisis affecting the population and especially older adults 3-5in this period of quarantine one of the reasons for going out is physical activity 6 however this measure has been debated because it could lead to quarantine violation this issue is important as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults but is far more severe for older adults although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of covid-19 infection they also need to avoid a sedentary lifestylephysical activity is important for older adults especially to maintain their level of independence 7 mental health and well-being 8 physical inactivity among older adults is the fourth highest risk factor for mortality worldwide and a major contributor to disability 9 among people who do not engage in regular physical activity the risk of functional decline is higher 10 maintaining mobility in old age is therefore necessary as it may predict the loss of independence in older adults 11 insufficient physical activity during the quarantine period can therefore have deleterious effects on the mental and emotional health of older adults 12our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on organizations conducting physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults our second objective was to discuss alternatives that could be suggested to this population to avoid a sedentary lifestylewe conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs from the french federation of physical education and voluntary gymnastics ffpevg and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the ffpevg we followed a common interview guide multimedia appendices 1 and 2 the interviewees were sports trainers and older adults who were participating in the social marketing and physical activity in elderly smape study 13 the main objective of the smape study was to determine whether a social marketing program based on the promotion of group balance workshops for people aged 60 years and over increases their attendance rate in sessions of activities adapted physical skills this study was conducted in two french departments loire-42 and haute-loire-43 the ffpevg organizes these group physical activity programs the smape study was suspended because of the quarantine implemented in france we asked the professionals about the impact of covid-19 and quarantine on physical activity workshops and alternatives they could suggest we also interviewed older adults about the importance they place on the physical activity before and during the quarantine and whether they were aware of other tools to continue physical activity at home for analysis we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviewsfor this study 8 professionals with different professional roles and 6 older adults participated the professionals responded unanimously that because of the covid-19 epidemic attendance at physical activity workshops has declined three sports trainers estimated the drop in attendance by about 20 but its hard to tell because its uneven across the different workshops a majority also informed us that some participants no longer wanted to have close contact with the other participants and no longer wanted to touch the equipmentolder adults who were no longer attending the workshops preferred to abstain from these workshops to avoid contact with other participants and potentially contracting covid-19 a majority of the professionals told us that there was also influence from the families of these older adults who despite interest in such group physical activity did not want their close ones to risk exposing themselves to the virusfollowing the first announcement to contain covid-19 propagation in france the medical commission of the ffpevg decided to cancel all physical activity workshops held in its clubs until further notice professionals expressed concern that shutting down these activities could isolate some seniors many of whom live alone and often away from their familiesthe professionals pointed out that there are alternative ways for older adults to perform physical activity at home the ffpegv proposed for example video clips on its website to help older adults exercise at home however none of the older adults were aware of the existence of online videos to encourage and assist them in performing physical activity at homemoreover respondents were not interested in using online videos to perform physical activityall the older adults were receptive to the importance of physical activity for their healtha majority continue to engage in physical activity at homeintroducing physical activity into daily life requires the incorporation of a new culture into lifestyles that are provided for example in-group physical activity workshopshowever for some quarantine plays a limiting role in the practice of physical activity for some it is because of the material conditionsgroup physical activity creates social ties between people and encourages them to perform exercises therefore being alone is an obstacle to performing physical activitythis study suggests that the covid-19 epidemic has before implementation of quarantine measures affected the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories this was mostly due to the fear of meeting potentially infected peopleanother result of our study is that despite the decline in older adults participation in group physical activities before the quarantine they expressed the need to perform physical activity at home although quarantine is a measure to protect older adults from covid-19 staying at home can lead to negative consequences such as reduced physical activity and sedentary behavior it can also increase the risk of injury due to a lack of adapted equipment or poor knowledge of the physical exercises to perform moreover social ties are essential to encourage older adults to perform physical activity 14 reduced social ties for older adults during quarantine could lead to a significant decrease in physical activity in addition loneliness could accelerate physical and cognitive decline in older adults 15the need for physical activity expressed by older adults raises the question of how older adults can be physically active in the current quarantine period there is a need to help older adults integrate simple safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space a national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context in france based on individuals initiatives local structures have sent booklets of physical activity advice and exercises to older adultsthere are currently several online physical activity support systems some of them are very interesting such as ffpevg video clips 16 the website of the french ministry of sports 17 or the united kingdom national health service guide 18 aiming to encourage older adults to perform physical activity at home our study suggests that older adults do not want to use these online tools given the results of our study it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home among older adults there are cultural sociological and economic differences that need to be considered when developing targeted messages that echo a target audiences existing views and practices to produce more powerful persuasive effects behavioral segmentation can help better understand and target messages for high-risk subgroups 19 like older adultsin conclusion we are concerned about the level of independence and mental health status of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity at home for themthree major respiratory virus-related events have been observed in south korea in the 21st century severe acute respiratory virus sars middle east respiratory syndrome and the 2019-novel coronavirus covid-19 infection all of which are caused by members of the coronavirus family the first individual with covid-19 infection in south korea was identified on 20 january 2020 and the number of laboratory-confirmed cases increased between then and 12 february 2020 1 to reduce the number of individuals entering south korea who may have been exposed to covid-19 in wuhan china an international travel ban from hubei province china to south korea was implemented on 3 february 2020 2 furthermore to identify individuals who may have been exposed to covid-19 the south korean public health authority implemented a quarantine program any persons who have travelled from a country with covid-19 infection risk within the previous 14 days or have been in contact with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection within the previous 14 days is defined as an individual for quarantine 3 quarantined individuals are asked to comply with home-quarantine and are monitored by local public health workers twice a day for 14 days after contact with individuals with infection 3on 14 february 2020 the south korean public health authority identified an individual with covid-19 infection the patient had been contacted by another individual who was suspected of avoiding the quarantine program during his period of home-quarantine 4 according to previous literature the effectiveness of quarantine varies widely depending on individuals daily motility patterns 5 despite this compliance with home-quarantine in the present instance is still in questionit is important to note that 37000 students from china where major cities were experienced localized outbreaks on february 2020 6 has entered seoul south korea on 1 march 2020 at the start of the spring semester this large number of incoming youths from the country with covid-19 infection risk may increase the risk of local transmission in south koreain this study we aimed to estimate the number of infected and isolated individuals expected in seoul south korea based on compliance with home-quarantine and proportion of pre-infectious individuals among these incoming international students from china a country at risk for covid-19 infectionto simulate possible epidemics we used the deterministic compartmental model of susceptibleexposedinfectiousremoved type the population is divided into five distinct classes susceptible exposed infected with the virus but not symptomatic quarantined with a fraction of compliance rate infectious and symptomatic and removed or recovered from the infection the rate of change at time t in the number of susceptible st exposed et infectious it removed rt and quarantine qt under the model specification as illustrated in figure 1 are summarized by a set of differential equations in the supplementary materialwhere the parameters including      and  were the rate at which infectious contact occur probability that the infectious contact result in successful infection rate of exposed individuals becoming infectious rate of infectious individuals becoming recovered proportion of newly exposed individuals were quarantined and rate of quarantine release respectively the basic reproductive number r0 and the rate at which infectious contact occur were assumed to be 268 and 91  108 based on the r0   and the population size in seoul 974 million 6789 we assumed the model parameters as   04 8 1  65 days 7 1  35 days 10 and 1  007 the additional pre-infection seeding i as the international students from china would be influx into the exposed classwe assumed that the population mixed homogeneously and that no covid-19 transmission had occurred within the community in seoul furthermore we assumed that either 01 02 or 1 of the incoming international students i were in the pre-infectious period of covid-19 infection based on previous literature reporting that 02 of individuals with contactees of sars infection were asymptomatic 11 we also assumed that the international students would arrive in seoul south korea in the 15 days before and after 1 march 2020 and that no individuals were isolated during entry screening upon arrival furthermore we assumed that all quarantined individuals were confined at home or to the university dormitory as per the current south korean quarantine program for covid-19 the baseline scenarios were based on the currently identified number of infected persons from china in south korea which was 12 on 6 february 2020 1 with the assumption of 90 compliance with home-quarantine during the pre-infectious period scenarios with different quarantine compliance rates 70 80 90 or 100 among these international students as well as local cases were also modeled we considered a time horizon of 180 days for the number of individuals infected and quarantined since 20 january 2020 when the first covid-19 case was identified in south koreawe estimated that the total number of infected individuals would reach 1945 from march 1324 march 4072 from 12 march24 march and 184277 from 13 march26 march with the arrival of 01 02 and 1 of pre-infectious individuals in seoul south korea respectively figure 2 we also estimated that the number of individuals isolated from the south korean quarantine program would peak at 1940 from 13 march28 march 4064 from 13 march27 march and 184248 from 13 march27 march with the arrival of 01 02 and 1 of pre-infectious individuals in seoul south korea respectively figure 3 the number of infected and isolated individuals would increase with higher proportions of subclinical covid-19 cases however the number of infected and isolated individuals was smaller due to the higher compliance of the quarantine programwhen no effective vaccine or treatment is available for infectious disease the quarantine of individuals suspected of having the infection including those exposed to infection from epidemic countries has been used as a mitigation strategy by public health authorities 1213141516the number of laboratory-confirmed individuals with covid-19 infection has been increased in china and other asian countries in south korea the likelihood of local transmission remains increasing by high because travelers are arriving from covid-19-affected countriesthe quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to covid-19 is an efficient public health strategy to reducing transmission while using limited public health resources because the presence of individuals with unidentified infection is highly likely among individuals exposed to the infectious diseases 1317 therefore the number of individuals with infection can be estimated based on compliance with home-quarantine to provide relevant evidence for public health authorities and to improve international students compliance with the quarantine program in advancein south korea individuals who had contacted a person with infection were asked to comply with home-quarantine and were monitored by local public health workers twice a day for 14 days post-contact 3 individuals who were not included in the quarantine program but had experienced any possible contact were encouraged to notify public health authorities and submit to quarantine all daily necessities were provided to all quarantined individuals by the public health authorities to avoid possible contact with any susceptible population as indicated by the south korean law therefore the current quarantine program in south korea is very broad and includes a large number of people however to relieve the pressure on public health resources the quarantine program for incoming international students has been monitored by the education authority 18 this may affect the efficacy of quarantine and increase the number of infected and isolated individuals our findings indicate that the number of infected and isolated individuals could increase by mid or late march 2020 furthermore the quarantine program may consume a large number of public health resources because it involves monitoring quarantined individuals and isolating infected individuals however our findings also suggested that most of the infected individuals could be isolated from the home-quarantine program under the compliance rate of home-quarantine between 70 and 100 therefore epidemics by incoming international students from china are unlikely to occur in seoul south korea the present study has several limitations first of all some parameters including the latent period and rate of infection among those in contact with a person with infection were obtained from the modelling studies of covid-19 6710 and consequently may revise the results second we used a deterministic model and cant evaluate the uncertainty of these estimates which is an inherent feature and missed under current analysis however allowing a search of different plausible values of these parameters through this model simulation approach ensures the reliable parameter estimates and able to mimic the future dynamics of the number of infected individuals which is much smaller than the total population 19 third for model simplicity we did not consider transmission that occurred before symptom onset which often being undetected and might have substantial proportion of community infection in some caseas public health resources are limited quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to infectious disease is crucial for preventing local transmission therefore strict home-quarantine of individuals from countries at risk for covid-19 infection is important to reduce the number of infected individuals and to prevent possible epidemics in the community additional studies measuring the compliance of self-quarantine would be valuable for the evidence based public health policy as well as modelling studies in future epidemicsthe first ancient pandemic well back around 165 a d known as the antonine plague generally referred as the plague of galen was a pandemic that affected asia minor egypt greece and italy and is thought to have been either smallpox or measles though the true cause is still unknown and have killed over approximately 5 million people 3 then arose the plague of justinian around 541-542 a d which is assumed to have killed perhaps half the population of europe was an outbreak of the bubonic plague that afflicted the byzantine empire and mediterranean port cities killing up to 25 million people in its year long reign of terror 4 from 1346 to 1353 a d an outbreak of the plague called as the black death ravaged europe africa and asia with an estimated death toll between 75 and 200 million people this is assumed to have originated in asia the plague traversed to continents via the fleas living on the rats that so frequently lived aboard merchant ships 5 like the first and second pandemics the third cholera pandemic originated in india spreading from the ganges river delta before making disaster through asia europe north america and africa and ending the lives of over a million people originally the asiatic flu or russian flu scientifically said to be flu pandemic 1889-1890 as it was called this strain was thought to be an outbreak of the influenza a virus subtype h2n2 though recent discoveries have instead found the cause to be the influenza a virus subtype h3n8 6 the first cases were observed in may 1889 in three separate and distant locations bukhara in central asia turkestan athabasca in north-western canada and greenland rapid population growth of the 19th century specifically in urban areas only helped the flu spread and before long the outbreak had spread across the globe the sixth cholera pandemic originated in india where it killed over 800000 before spreading to the middle east north africa eastern europe and russia the sixth cholera pandemic was also the source of the last american outbreak of cholera 19101911 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 between 1918 and 1920 a disturbingly deadly outbreak of influenza flu pandemic tore across the globe infecting over a third of the worlds population and ending the lives of 20  50 million people of the 500 million people infected in the 1918 pandemic the mortality rate was estimated at 10 to 20 with up to 25 million deaths in the first 25 weeks alone 13 asian flu was a pandemic outbreak of influenza a of the h2n2 subtype that originated in china in 1956 and lasted until 1958 13 in its two-year spree asian flu travelled from the chinese province of guizhou to singapore hong kong and the united states and the death toll was approximately 2 millions a category 2 flu pandemic sometimes referred to as the hong kong flu the 1968 flu pandemic was caused by the h3n2 strain of the influenza a virus a genetic offshoot of the h2n2 subtype from the first reported case on july 13 1968 in hong kong it took only 17 days before outbreaks of the virus were reported in singapore and vietnam and within three months had spread to the philippines india australia europe and the united states first identified in democratic republic of the congo in 1976 hivaids has truly proven itself as a global pandemic killing more than 36 million people since 1981 currently there are between 31 and 35 million people living with hiv the vast majority of those are in sub-saharan africa where 5 of the population is infected roughly 21 million people as awareness has grown new treatments have been developed that make hiv far more manageable and many of those infected go on to lead productive lives between 2005 and 2012 the annual global deaths from hivaids dropped from 22 million to 16 million 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14the history of human coronaviruses began in 1965 when tyrrell and bynoe1 found that they could passage a virus named b814 it was found in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures obtained from the respiratory tract of an adult with a common cold 15 human coronaviruses first characterized in the 1960s are responsible for a substantial proportion of upper respiratory tract infections in children since 2003 at least 5 new human coronaviruses have been identified including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus which caused significant morbidity and mortality nl63 representing a group of newly identified group i coronaviruses that includes nl and the new haven coronavirus has been identified worldwide these viruses are associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease and are likely common human pathogens 16 the cause of a very new severe acute respiratory syndrome called sars emerged in 20022003 as a coronavirus from southern china and spread throughout the world with quantifiable speed the sars epidemic put the animal coronaviruses in the spotlight in the last twenty years several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 to 2003 and h1n1 influenza in 2009 have been recorded most recently the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 sars-cov provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in china and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths and the mers-cov that began in saudi arabia and has approximately 2500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases 17 18 19 on february 11 2020 the who director-general announced that the disease caused by this new cov was a covid-19 which is the acronym of coronavirus disease 2019 20 coronavirus is the name given to group of viruses that infect mammals and birds the name corona is derived from latin word meaning crown that refers to its characteristic appearance where its surface is covered in the form of club shaped protein spikes 21 the host and reservoir of coronavirus is depicted in figure 1
by 2020 coronavirus had gained popularity globally with respect to its nomenclature this family of viruses seems to expand continuously according to scientists and sars-cov-2 alternatively known as covid-19 also belongs to this family of viruses there is a probability that some of these viruses might have been missed by the scientists and hence there is still a lot to explore about covid-19 and the response mechanism of the human immune system by now 40 coronaviruses have got their names approved as per the international committee for the taxonomy of viruses the numbers of identified coronaviruses have reached to seven including the current covid 19 most of these viruses seem to affect the animals four among these seven viruses are acquired by community and transmit through population continually for long period of time on the other hand sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are recent outbreaks and are associated with very high mortality rates shereen et al 22 states in addition to the above three h5n1 influenza a and h1n1 2009 cause acute lung injury ali and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards all leading to pulmonary failure and ultimate fatality all corona viruses start in animals and pass on to humans through mutation recombination and adaptation shereen et al 22 supports that the originating source of covd-19 is bats but the intermediate source before transmission to humans is not yet identifiedmany animal coronaviruses infect animals during a particular season the reason why these animal coronaviruses do not cause symptoms in their host reservoir is because they continuously co-evolve and adapt over a long period of time with their reservoir host the symptoms are mild even if they are shown symptoms in species vary like in birds it causes upper respiratory tract infections while in cows or pigs it results in diarrhea in humans it causes respiratory tract infections that could lead to common cold the high infection rate recombination rate and mutation rate of these animal coronaviruses increase the probability of mutants ability to transmit into another host it has been speculated that the severity of disease is significantly very high between the new host and the coronavirus at the new round of adaption it is not yet proved but speculated that the new host will be able to fight the virus effectively only after a long period of adaption and co-evolution hence leading to milder symptoms the seven human coronaviruses are transitioned into humans through other animals after originating in animals like bats and rodents the four human coronaviruses including hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e cause mild common cold like symptoms although they cause infections across all age groups throughout the year but the rates are higher in winters and early spring they cause multiple re-infections throughout human lifespan these viruses are transmitted to human beings when they come in close in contact with the host these viruses during their incubation period in human beings develop or even mutate for further transmission to other human beings earlier form of coronaviruses includes sars and mers that were lethal but were not able to transmit in exponential manner like covid 19the structure of 2019-ncov s in the prefusion conformation is depicted in figure 2
 covid 19 is associated with the fever severe respiratory illness and pneumonia it is found to be related with sars-cov and several bat coronaviruses and is characterized as new member of the betacoronavirus genus shereen et al 22 states that the subgroups of coronaviruses family include alpha  beta  gamma  and delta  coronavirus and covid 19 belongs to the  group of coronavirusesits infection rate is significantly higher than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov hence raising the concern of international public health emergency it enters into the host cells through a densely glycosylated spike s protein this protein undergoes substantial structural change in order to form fusion between the membranes of the virus and the host cell the protein subunit s1 binds with the host cell receptor prefusion trimer is destabilized by the receptor binder resulting in transition to subunit s2 the down receptor inaccessible conformation state is more stable than the up receptor accessible conformation state s protein pays an indispensable function and the characterization the prefusion structure provides vital information which is used in the design and development of the vaccinecovid 19 overall structure s resembles that of sars-cov s resulting in a root mean square deviation rmsd of 38  over 959 c atoms the position of the receptor binding domains rbd in their respective down conformations is one of the larger differences between these two structures the sars-cov rbd packs tightly against the n-terminal domain of the neighboring protomer while covid 19 rbd is angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer covid 19 s and sars-cov s reflect the high structural homology between the two proteins despite the difference in the alignment angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the same functional host cell receptor shared between covid 19 s and sars-cov s the apparent ease with which covid 19 spreads from human to human is mainly because of its very high affinity for human ace2 shereen et al 22 supports that the transmission rate of sars-cov 2 is higher than the sras cov owing to the events of genetic recombination in the rbd domain shereen et al 22 states that a clinically approved antivirus is not yet available to fight against the covid 19the rapid spreading of covid 19 indicates the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines the information available on covid 19 atomic-level structure will facilitate the additional protein-engineering efforts which could result in the improvement of antigenicity and protein expression for the development of vaccine the structural data will also provide information on occurrence of the mutations when virus undergoes genetic drift define whether residues map to known antibody epitopes sites for other coronavirus spike proteins the structure also assures on whether the protein produced is homogeneous and in the prefusion conformationthe structure of respiratory syndrome which causes coronavirus in humans is depicted in figure 3
 the designing and screening of small molecules with fusion-inhibiting potential are also facilitated by the atomic-level detail the information is indispensable in supporting the precision design of the vaccine and discovering the antiviral measures 23 further shereen et al 22 also describes the compartive analysis of the critical nature of the three outbreaks including covid 19 sars cov and mers cov while emulating the approaches that are recommended in developing effective vaccinesthe covid-19 virus affects different people in different ways covid-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people develops mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring special treatment people who have underlying medical conditions and those over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death common symptoms include fever tiredness and dry cough other symptoms include shortness of breath aches and pains sore throat and very few people reports diarrhoea nausea or a runny nose 24pneumonia of unknown cause detected in wuhan china was first reported to the who country office in china on 31 december 2019 20 because the first cases of the covid-19 disease were linked to direct exposure to the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan republic of china the animal-to-human transmission was presumed as the main mechanism nevertheless subsequent cases were not associated with this exposure mechanism therefore it was concluded that the virus could also be transmitted from human-to-human and symptomatic people are the most frequent source of covid-19 spread the possibility of transmission before symptoms develop seems to be infrequent although it cannot be excluded moreover there are suggestions that individuals who remain asymptomatic could transmit the virus this data suggests that the use of isolation is the best way to contain this epidemic 25 based on data from the first cases in wuhan and investigations conducted by the chinese centre for disease control and prevention cdc and local cdcs the incubation time could be generally within 3 to 7 days and up to 2 weeks as the longest time from infection to symptoms was 125 days 95 confidence interval 92 to 18 26  this data also showed that this novel epidemic doubled about every seven days whereas the basic reproduction number r0 is 22 in other words on average each patient transmits the infection to an additional 22 individuals of note estimations of the r0 of the sars-cov epidemic in 2002-2003 were approximately 3 27 study suggests that people may acquire the coronavirus through the air and after touching contaminated objects scientists discovered the virus is detectable for up to three hours in aerosols up to four hours on copper up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel 28 an analysis of publicly available data on infections from the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 that causes the respiratory illness covid-19 yielded an estimate of 51 days for the median disease incubation period according to a new study led by researchers at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health 29 this median time from exposure to onset of symptoms suggests that the 14-day quarantine period used by the us centers for disease control and prevention for individuals with likely exposure to the coronavirus is reasonable the analysis suggests that about 975 percent of people who develop symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection will do so within 115 days of exposure lauer et al estimated that for every 10000 individuals quarantined for 14 days only about 101 would develop symptoms after being released from quarantine 29

based on the report of who the transmission of covid-19 in the top 10 countries across the globe is mentioned in table 1
30the subsequent materials of this paper are structured as follows section 2 deals with basic terminologies and basic reproduction number of severe pandemic diseases three epidemic models of three different stages of covid-19 and its stability are discussed in section 3 section 4 discusses on simulations and its analysis with examples finally the paper is concluded in section 5 followed by referencesnomenclature used in three epidemic models of the pandemic disease covid-19 is given in table 2

susceptible st in epidemiology a susceptible individual sometimes known simply as a susceptible is a member of a population who is at risk of becoming infected by a disease
immigrant population et it is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens or to take up employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker
infectious population it it refers to the population who are infected by a contagious disease covid-19 in our case may be through immigrant population transmission or by local individual transmission or community transmission
home isolation q1t it refers to the restriction of movement or separation of well persons who are susceptible or possibly exposed to a contagious disease covid-19 in our case before it is known whether they will become ill isolation usually takes place in the home and may be applied at the individual level or to a group or community of susceptible or exposed population
quarantine q2t it refers to the separation and restricted movement of ill persons who have a contagious disease covid-19 in our case in order to prevent its transmission to others it typically occurs in a hospital setting but under very special cases may be done at home under a special facility usually individuals are quarantined but the practice may be applied in larger groups
recovered population rt it refers to the population who are recovered from covid-19
basic reproduction number r0 the basic reproduction number denoted by r0
31 of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection 32basic reproduction number of some highly infectious disease is given in table 3
here a mathematical model is developed to express the first stage of covid-19 this model has six compartments susceptible population - immigrant population - home isolation population - infectious population - hospital quarantine population - recovered population any country or state is in stage 1 if persons are found covid-19 positive that has recent international travel history this model helps us to understand how this foreign return population spreads covid-19 to other citizens of that country if not handled properly in the absence of vaccination and proper treatment two force-control policies namely home isolation and hospital quarantine are adopted by many countries to control this covid-19 epidemic the same is framed and analysed here with the help of our model as depicted in figure 4
based on our hypothesis and flow of transmission of the disease covid-19 in human population as depicted in figure 4 we have the following system of equations1dsdtbsi1sq11ededta1e2e112e1edidtsiq112idq1dt2e1q1dq2dti112e12q2drdtq21rwhere the total population ns  e i q1  q2  rthendndtdsdtdedtdidtdq1dtdq2dtdrdtdndtba1n2iq1q2

in this section we discuss the local stability of endemic equilibrium and disease free equilibrium of the system 1 after dropping the last equation of 1  by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations respectively

clearly the system 2 has four negative real roots and the root 5120if12
clearly all roots are negative real roots so system 1 is disease free equilibrium and is locally asymptotically stable toothe endemic equilibrium seiq1q2r which is interior of  can be obtained by taking all the equations of the system 2 equal to zero thussb1112a1a1i1111ea11i2ai1i111112b1112a1a1q12a111q2i11112a1112ri11112a11112

here the four eigen values are1121231411which have strictly negative real parts and other two eigen values are given by quadratic equations2ab0whereai212s0bi12121211s0ab0
since ab  0 so by routh-hurwitz criteria system 1 is stablesince all the eigen values have negative real parts so the system 1 is locally asymptotically stable at the endemic equilibrium  if r0  1in this section we prove the global stability for endemic equilibrium we adopt the geometrical approach for the mapping f drn  rn where d is an open set if its differential equations xfx be such that its every solution xt can be uniquely determined by its initial condition xtx0 then an equilibrium points xd and satisfies the conditionsd is simply connectedthere exists a compact absorbing sub set k of d

for equilibrium points in the steady state of the system 3 we have4a2e12e1e0siq112i0s2e1q10i12e12q20q21r0
in this section we discuss the local stability of endemic equilibrium and disease free equilibrium of the system 3 after dropping the last equation of 3 and by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations

hence by routh-hurwitz criteria system is stablethus all the eigen values have negative real parts and hence the system 3 is locally asymptotically stable at the endemic equilibrium  if r0  1in order to prove the global stability of the region  we take s and i compartment leave q1 population and make it free from the r population therefore in the positive quadrant of the s-i plane we apply dulacs criteria with multiplier d1iconsiderf1bsis1sf2s12ithendf1bis1sidf2s12

thus no periodic solution exists in the region  hence by poincare-bendixson property all solution starting in positive quadrant of si- plane with io and siab1 approaches s i as t   in this case the limiting form of rest of the system of equations 3 shows that eeq1q1q2q2rr thus the endemic equilibrium seiq1q2r is globally stable in the given region  for the system 3based on our hypothesis and flow of transmission of covid-19 of stage 3 in human population as depicted in figure 6 we have the following system of equations5dsdtbsi1ssdidtsiq112idq1dts1q1dq2dti12q2drdtq21r

if the disease is absent in the population then dndtb1n
this shows that population size n tends to carrying capacity b1 as t  it shows that the solution of 5 exists in the region defined bysiq1q2rr5siq1q2rb1
since all the solution remains bounded in the positively invariant region  and in the maximal interval 0 the initial value problem is well posedfor the basic reproduction number we take the following system of equationsdidtsiq112idq1dts1q1dq2dti12q2drdtq21r

so by routh-hurwitz criteria the system is locally asymptotically stable thus all the eigen values have negative real parts and hence the system 5 is locally asymptotically stable at the endemic equilibrium  if r01in order to prove the global stability of the region  we take s and i compartment leave q1 population and make it free from the r population therefore in the positive quadrant of s-i plane we apply dulacs criteria with multiplier d1iconsiderf1bsis1sf2s12ithendf1bis1sidf2s12

thus there exists no periodic solution in the region  hence by poincare-bendixson property all solution starting in positive quadrant of si- plane with io andsib1 approaches s i as t   in this case the limiting form of rest of the system of equations 5 shows thatq1q1q2q2rr thus the endemic equilibrium siq1q2r is globally stable in the given region  for the system 5in this section a large number of experiments have been performed to verify the analytical results obtained in section 3 simulations have been carried out for each model to depict local and global stability some examples are mentioned below for simulating the models either for ro  1or forro  1
example 1 the local stability of the infection-free equilibrium point has been numerically simulated and depicted in figures 7
a 9a and 11a for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively and the corresponding simulated data for this unsuccessful attack are listed in table 4
 7 and 10 respectively the initial point and the parametric values along with basic reproduction number roare shown in table 5
 8 and 11 for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively the value of rofor all the three stages is less than one it is clearly observed that the infection-free equilibrium point turns out to be stable for all the stages
example 2 the local stability of the endemic equilibrium point has been numerically simulated and depicted in figures 8
a 10a and 12a for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively and the corresponding simulated data for this successful attack are listed in table 6
 9 and 12 respectively the initial point and the parametric values along with basic reproduction number roare shown in table 5 8
and 11
for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively the value of rofor all the three stages is greater than one it is clearly observed that the endemic equilibrium point turns out to be stable for all the stages
example 3 the behaviour of system 1 3 and 5 are studied by considering quarantine population  recovered population plane and figure 7b 9b and 11b for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively reflects that recovered population is directly proportionate with quarantine population for ro  1  even for ro  1 the same relationship is achieved in figure 8bi 10bi and 12bi for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively and the same with respect to time is shown with 3-dimentional graph in figure 8bii 10bii and 12bii for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively
example 4 the behaviour of system 1 3 and 5 are also studied by considering home isolation population  recovered population plane and figures 7c 9c and 11c for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively reflects that recovered population is not much affected or depends on home isolation population for ro  1  even for ro  1 the same relationship is achieved in figures 8c 10c and 12c for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively
example 5 the behaviour of system 1 3 and 5 are also studied by considering infectious population  quarantine population plane and figure 7d 9d and 11d for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively reflects that infectious population gradually becomes quarantine population and is under control whereas forro  1 figures 8d 10d and 12d for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively depicts that a large number of populations are infectious as well as quarantined
example 6 the global stability of the endemic equilibrium point forro  1 is shown in figures 8e 10e and 12e for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively it shows the plane formed by the susceptible population and infectious population it can be clearly seen in all above said figures that the trajectories are seen to be asymptotically stable at endemic equilibrium point which is unique and globally stable
from figure 7b it is clear that the more we quarantine the positive cases of covid-19 the more is the recovery in the infectious populationfrom figure 7c it is evident that the more we have social distancing of the susceptible population that is home isolation the larger we have the chances to escape from the infectious covid-19the more we quarantine the infectious covid-19 population in the hospital the more is the recovery which is very clearly reflected from figure 10
bii after 1185 days the recovery starts but after 21 days there is a sharp increase in the recovery populationsocial distancing that is the more we home isolate the susceptible population the transmission of the disease in population is almost negligible which is clearly reflected in figure 10cthe susceptible population when are in complete lockdown the transmission of the disease is very less which is evident from figure 11

bi clearly reflects that the more we quarantine the positive cases of covid-19 the recovery population is morefrom figure 12bii it is very clear that the more we quarantine the infectious population from covid-19 the more is the recovery and after 21 days of hospital quarantine there is a sharp increase in the recovery populationfrom figure 12c it is evident that the more we home isolate the susceptible population the more is the chances of getting them infected from covid-19three quarantine models are developed for three different stages of covid-19 reproduction number for all the three stages is obtained and the condition for local and global asymptotic stability is well established when the reproduction number is greater than one the systems developed in all the three stages of infection-endemic equilibrium in s-i phase plane is globally asymptotic stable the two vital pivot parameters of all the three models of covid-19 home isolation and hospital quarantine is well analysed from the numerical simulations it is very clear that the more we have home isolation or complete lockdown or social distancing the less we have the chances to be infected and the disease to be transmitted in the population which is very evident from figures 7c 8c 9c10c11c 12c the general home isolation for our results is approximately 1185 days from the simulation results it is also evident from figures 8bi 9b 10biii 11b 12bi ii that covid-19 positive population when are subjected to hospital quarantine the transmission of the disease is reduced and the rate of recovery also increases till date when no vaccine or treatment is available for covid-19 then from our developed models it is well established that social distancing and hospital quarantine for positive cases is the only best treatmentthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthere is no conflict of interest among the authorsquarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease to ascertain if they become unwell so reducing the risk of them infecting others1 this definition differs from isolation which is the separation of people who have been diagnosed with a contagious disease from people who are not sick however the two terms are often used interchangeably especially in communication with the public2 the word quarantine was first used in venice italy in 1127 with regards to leprosy and was widely used in response to the black death although it was not until 300 years later that the uk properly began to impose quarantine in response to plague3 most recently quarantine has been used in the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak this outbreak has seen entire cities in china effectively placed under mass quarantine while many thousands of foreign nationals returning home from china have been asked to self-isolate at home or in state-run facilities4 there are precedents for such measures citywide quarantines were also imposed in areas of china and canada during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars whereas entire villages in many west african countries were quarantined during the 2014 ebola outbreak
key messages
information is key people who are quarantined need to understand the situationeffective and rapid communication is essentialsupplies both general and medical need to be providedthe quarantine period should be short and the duration should not be changed unless in extreme circumstancesmost of the adverse effects come from the imposition of a restriction of liberty voluntary quarantine is associated with less distress and fewer long-term complicationspublic health officials should emphasise the altruistic choice of self-isolating

quarantine is often an unpleasant experience for those who undergo it separation from loved ones the loss of freedom uncertainty over disease status and boredom can on occasion create dramatic effects suicide has been reported5 substantial anger generated and lawsuits brought6 following the imposition of quarantine in previous outbreaks the potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine need to be weighed carefully against the possible psychological costs7 successful use of quarantine as a public health measure requires us to reduce as far as possible the negative effects associated with itgiven the developing situation with coronavirus policy makers urgently need evidence synthesis to produce guidance for the public in circumstances such as these rapid reviews are recommended by who8 we undertook a review of evidence on the psychological impact of quarantine to explore its likely effects on mental health and psychological wellbeing and the factors that contribute to or mitigate these effects of 3166 papers found 24 are included in this review figure
 the characteristics of studies that met our inclusion criteria are presented in the table
 these studies were done across ten countries and included people with sars 11 studies ebola five the 2009 and 2010 h1n1 influenza pandemic three middle east respiratory syndrome two and equine influenza one one of these studies related to both h1n1 and sarsfive studies compared psychological outcomes for people quarantined with those not quarantined9 19 27 28 33 a study9 of hospital staff who might have come into contact with sars found that immediately after the quarantine period 9 days ended having been quarantined was the factor most predictive of symptoms of acute stress disorder in the same study quarantined staff were significantly more likely to report exhaustion detachment from others anxiety when dealing with febrile patients irritability insomnia poor concentration and indecisiveness deteriorating work performance and reluctance to work or consideration of resignation in another study33 the effect of being quarantined was a predictor of post-traumatic stress symptoms in hospital employees even 3 years later approximately 34 938 of 2760 of horse owners quarantined for several weeks because of an equine influenza outbreak reported high psychological distress during the outbreak compared with around 12 in the australian general population28 a study27 comparing post-traumatic stress symptoms in parents and children quarantined with those not quarantined found that the mean post-traumatic stress scores were four times higher in children who had been quarantined than in those who were not quarantined 28 27 of 98 of parents quarantined in this study reported sufficient symptoms to warrant a diagnosis of a trauma-related mental health disorder compared with 6 17 of 299 of parents who were not quarantined another study19 of hospital staff examined symptoms of depression 3 years after quarantine and found that 9 48 of 549 of the whole sample reported high depressive symptoms in the group with high depressive symptoms nearly 60 29 of 48 had been quarantined but only 15 63 of 424 of the group with low depressive symptoms had been quarantinedall other quantitative studies only surveyed those who had been quarantined and generally reported a high prevalence of symptoms of psychological distress and disorder studies reported on general psychological symptoms22 emotional disturbance34 depression16 stress15 low mood18 irritability18 insomnia18 post-traumatic stress symptoms25 rated on weiss and marmars impact of event scalerevised35 anger20 and emotional exhaustion21 low mood 660 73 of 903 and irritability 512 57 of 903 stand out as having high prevalence18
people quarantined because of being in close contact with those who potentially have sars25 reported various negative responses during the quarantine period over 20 230 of 1057 reported fear 18 187 reported nervousness 18 186 reported sadness and 10 101 reported guilt few reported positive feelings 5 48 reported feelings of happiness and 4 43 reported feelings of relief qualitative studies also identified a range of other psychological responses to quarantine such as confusion11 12 13 23 fear12 13 14 15 23 24 anger12 13 grief29 numbness23 and anxiety-induced insomnia14 15
one study compared undergraduates who had been quarantined with those not quarantined immediately after the quarantine period and found no significant difference between the groups in terms of post-traumatic stress symptoms or general mental health problems29 however the entire study population were undergraduate students who are generally young and perhaps have fewer responsibilities than adults who are employed full-time and thus it is possible that these conclusions cannot be generalised to the wider populationonly one study17 compared psychological outcomes during quarantine with later outcomes and found that during quarantine 7 126 of 1656 showed anxiety symptoms and 17 275 showed feelings of anger whereas 46 months after quarantine these symptoms had reduced to 3 anxiety and 6 angertwo studies reported on longer-term effects of quarantine 3 years after the sars outbreak alcohol abuse or dependency symptoms were positively associated with having been quarantined in health-care workers32 in a multivariate analysis32 after controlling for demographic factors having been quarantined and having worked in a high-risk location were the two types of exposure significantly associated with these outcomes for quarantine unadjusted mean ratio 045 95 ci 102265after quarantine many participants continued to engage in avoidance behaviours for health-care workers20 being quarantined was significantly and positively associated with avoidance behaviours such as minimising direct contact with patients and not reporting to work a study25 of people quarantined because of potential sars contact noted that 54 524 of 1057 of people who had been quarantined avoided people who were coughing or sneezing 26 255 avoided crowded enclosed places and 21 204 avoided all public spaces in the weeks following the quarantine period a qualitative study13 reported that several participants described long-term behavioural changes after the quarantine period such as vigilant handwashing and avoidance of crowds and for some the return to normality was delayed by many monthsthere was mixed evidence for whether participant characteristics and demographics were predictors of the psychological impact of quarantine a study28 of horse owners quarantined because of equine influenza identified several characteristics associated with negative psychological impacts younger age 1624 years lower levels of formal educational qualifications female gender and having one child as opposed to no children although having three or more children appeared somewhat protective however another study16 suggested that demographic factors such as marital status age education living with other adults and having children were not associated with psychological outcomeshaving a history of psychiatric illness was associated with experiencing anxiety and anger 46 months after release from quarantine17 health-care workers25 who had been quarantined had more severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress than members of the general public who had been quarantined scoring significantly higher on all dimensions health-care workers also felt greater stigmatisation than the general public exhibited more avoidance behaviours after quarantine reported greater lost income and were consistently more affected psychologically they reported substantially more anger annoyance fear frustration guilt helplessness isolation loneliness nervousness sadness worry and were less happy health-care workers were also substantially more likely to think they had sars and to be concerned about infecting others conversely one study16 suggested that health-care worker status was not associated with psychological outcomesthree studies showed that longer durations of quarantine were associated with poorer mental health specifically post-traumatic stress symptoms16 25 avoidance behaviours and anger20 although the duration of the quarantine was not always clear one study16 showed that those quarantined for more than 10 days showed significantly higher post-traumatic stress symptoms than those quarantined for less than 10 daysparticipants in eight studies reported fears about their own health or fears of infecting others9 13 14 16 17 21 25 26 and were more likely to fear infecting family members than those not quarantined9 they also became particularly worried if they experienced any physical symptoms potentially related to the infection14 and fear that the symptoms could reflect having the infection continued to be related to psychological outcomes several months later17 conversely one study11 found that although very few participants were extremely concerned about becoming infected or transmitting the virus to others those who were concerned tended to be pregnant women and those with young childrenconfinement loss of usual routine and reduced social and physical contact with others were frequently shown to cause boredom frustration and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world which was distressing to participants10 11 13 14 15 16 25 26 31 this frustration was exacerbated by not being able to take part in usual day-to-day activities such as shopping for basic necessities16 or taking part in social networking activities via the telephone or internet17
having inadequate basic supplies eg food water clothes or accommodation during quarantine was a source of frustration10 31 and continued to be associated with anxiety and anger 46 months after release17 being unable to get regular medical care and prescriptions also appeared to be a problem for some participants10
four studies found that supplies from public health authorities were insufficient participants reported receiving their masks and thermometers late or not at all13 food water and other items were only intermittently distributed24 and food supplies took a long time to arrive12 although those quarantined during the toronto sars outbreak praised public health authorities for delivering kits of medical supplies at the beginning of the quarantine period they did not receive groceries or other routine supplies needed for daily living15
many participants cited poor information from public health authorities as a stressor reporting insufficient clear guidelines about actions to take and confusion about the purpose of quarantine11 12 13 15 24 26 after the toronto sars epidemic participants perceived that confusion stemmed from the differences in style approach and content of various public health messages because of poor coordination between the multiple jurisdictions and levels of government involved15 lack of clarity about the different levels of risk in particular led to participants fearing the worst14 participants also reported a perceived lack of transparency from health and government officials about the severity of the pandemic11 perhaps related to the lack of clear guidelines or rationale perceived difficulty with complying with quarantine protocols was a significant predictor of post-traumatic stress symptoms in one study25
financial loss can be a problem during quarantine with people unable to work and having to interrupt their professional activities with no advanced planning the effects appear to be long lasting in the reviewed studies the financial loss as a result of quarantine created serious socioeconomic distress24 and was found to be a risk factor for symptoms of psychological disorders22 and both anger and anxiety several months after quarantine17 one study28 found that respondents who were quarantined because of equine influenza whose principal source of income was from a horse-related industry were more than twice as likely to have high distress than those whose income was not from the industry this finding is probably linked to economic effects but could also be related to disruption of social networks and loss of leisure activities notably this study is exceptional in that occupation and exposure are confoundeda study14 of people quarantined because of potential ebola contact found that although participants received financial assistance some felt that the amount was insufficient and that it came too late many felt wronged as the assistance they received did not cover their ongoing professional expenses many became dependent on their families to provide for them financially during quarantine which was often hard to accept and could cause conflicts in one study13 none of those quarantined in toronto during sars reported much financial hardship because employers or the government compensated them but where that reimbursement was slow to arrive it caused those less financially well-off to strugglepotentially related to financial loss participants with a combined annual household income of less than can40 000 showed significantly higher amounts of post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms16 these symptoms are probably because those with lower incomes were more likely to be affected by the temporary loss of income than those with higher incomespeople who are quarantined and have lower household incomes might require additional levels of support along with those who lose earnings while in quarantine ie self-employed people who are unable to work or salaried staff who are unable to take paid leave financial reimbursements should be provided where possible and programmes developed to provide financial support throughout the quarantine period where appropriate employers might also wish to consider proactive approaches that allow employees to work from home if they wish to both to avoid financial loss and to stave off boredom while being mindful that staff in these situations might not be at their most productive and might benefit more from remote social support from their colleagues2
stigma from others was a major theme throughout the literature often continuing for some time after quarantine even after containment of the outbreak in a comparison of health-care workers quarantined versus those not quarantined9 quarantined participants were significantly more likely to report stigmatisation and rejection from people in their local neighbourhoods suggesting that there is stigma specifically surrounding people who had been quarantined participants in several studies reported that others were treating them differently avoiding them withdrawing social invitations treating them with fear and suspicion and making critical comments13 14 15 16 18 21 23 24 25 26 30 31
several health-care workers involved in the ebola outbreak in senegal reported that quarantine had led their families to consider their jobs to be too risky creating intra-household tension14 in the same study three participants reported being unable to resume their jobs after surveillance ended because their employers expressed fear of contagionthose quarantined during the ebola epidemic in liberia reported that stigma could lead to disenfranchisement of minority groups in the community as families under quarantine were often said to belong to different ethnic groups tribes or religions and were perceived as dangerous because they were different24 perhaps because of this stigma being quarantined led participants in this study to keep easily treatable non-ebola illnesses a secret and avoided seeking helpgeneral education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can be beneficial to reduce stigmatisation whereas more detailed information targeted at schools and workplaces might also be useful it might also be that media reporting contributes to stigmatising attitudes in the general public the media is a powerful influence on public attitudes and dramatic headlines and fear mongering have been shown to contribute to stigmatising attitudes in the past eg during the sars outbreak36 this issue highlights the need for public health officials to provide rapid clear messages delivered effectively for the entire affected population to promote accurate understanding of the situationlonger quarantine is associated with poorer psychological outcomes perhaps unsurprisingly as it stands to reason that the stressors reported by participants could have more of an effect the longer they were experienced for restricting the length of quarantine to what is scientifically reasonable given the known duration of incubation periods and not adopting an overly precautionary approach to this would minimise the effect on people evidence from elsewhere also emphasises the importance of authorities adhering to their own recommended length of quarantine and not extending it for people already in quarantine an extension no matter how small is likely to exacerbate any sense of frustration or demoralisation40 imposing a cordon indefinitely on whole cities with no clear time limit such as has been seen in wuhan china might be more detrimental than strictly applied quarantine procedures limited to the period of incubationpeople who are quarantined often feared being infected or infecting others they also often have catastrophic appraisals of any physical symptoms experienced during the quarantine period this fear is a common occurrence for people exposed to a worrying infectious disease41 and might be exacerbated by the often inadequate information participants reported receiving from public health officials leaving them unclear of the nature of the risks they faced and why they were being quarantined at all ensuring that those under quarantine have a good understanding of the disease in question and the reasons for quarantine should be a priorityofficials also need to ensure that quarantined households have enough supplies for their basic needs and importantly these must be provided as rapidly as possible coordination for provision of supplies should ideally occur in advance with conservation and reallocation plans established to ensure resources do not run out which unfortunately has been reported2
boredom and isolation will cause distress people who are quarantined should be advised about what they can do to stave off boredom and provided with practical advice on coping and stress management techniques having a working mobile phone is now a necessity not a luxury and those stepping off a long flight to enter quarantine will probably welcome a charger or adaptor more than anything else17 activating your social network albeit remotely is not just a key priority but an inability to do so is associated not just with immediate anxiety but longer- term distress2 42 one study21 suggested that having a telephone support line staffed by psychiatric nurses set up specifically for those in quarantine could be effective in terms of providing them with a social network the ability to communicate with ones family and friends is also essential particularly social media could play an important part in communication with those far away allowing people who are quarantined to update their loved ones about their situation and reassure them that they are well therefore providing those quarantined with mobile phones cords and outlets for charging devices and robust wifi networks with internet access to allow them to communicate directly with loved ones could reduce feelings of isolation stress and panic2 although this is possible to achieve in enforced quarantine it could be more difficult to do in the case of widespread home quarantine countries imposing censors on social media and messaging applications could also present difficulties in ensuring lines of communication between those quarantined and their loved onesit is also important that public health officials maintain clear lines of communication with people quarantined about what to do if they experience any symptoms a phone line or online service specifically set up for those in quarantine and staffed by health-care workers who can provide instructions about what to do in the event of developing illness symptoms would help reassure people that they will be cared for if they become ill this service would show those who are quarantined that they have not been forgotten and that their health needs are just as important as those of the wider public the benefits of such a resource have not been studied but it is likely that reassurance could subsequently decrease feelings such as fear worry and angerthere is evidence to suggest that support groups specifically for people who were quarantined at home during disease outbreaks can be helpful one study23 found that having such a group and feeling connected to others who had been through the same situation could be a validating empowering experience and can provide people with the support they might find they are not receiving from other peoplehealth-care workers themselves are often quarantined and this review suggests they like the general public are negatively affected by stigmatising attitudes from others none of the studies included in this review focused on the perceptions of their colleagues but this would be an interesting aspect to explore it is also possible that health-care workers who are quarantined might be concerned about causing their workplaces to be understaffed and causing extra work for their colleagues21 and that their colleagues perceptions could be particularly important being separated from a team they are used to working in close contact with might add to feelings of isolation for health-care workers who are quarantined therefore it is essential that they feel supported by their immediate colleagues during infectious disease outbreaks organisational support has been found to be protective of mental health for health-care staff in general39 and managers should take steps to ensure their staff members are supportive of their colleagues who are quarantinedperhaps because of the difficulties of designing an appropriate study no research was found which tested whether mandatory versus voluntary quarantine has a differential effect on wellbeing in other contexts however feeling that others will benefit from ones situation can make stressful situations easier to bear and it seems likely that this is also true for home-based quarantine reinforcing that quarantine is helping to keep others safe including those particularly vulnerable such as those who are very young old or with pre-existing serious medical conditions and that health authorities are genuinely grateful to them can only help to reduce the mental health effect and adherence in those quarantined19 33 notably altruism has its limits if people are being asked to quarantine without adequate information on how to keep the people they live with safe it is unacceptable to ask people to self-quarantine for the benefit of the communitys health when while doing so they might be putting their loved ones at riskquarantine is one of several public health measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and as shown in this review has a considerable psychological impact for those affected as such there is a question as to whether other public health measures that prevent the need to impose quarantine such as social distancing cancellation of mass gatherings and school closures might be more favourable future research is needed to establish the effectiveness of such measuresthe strengths and limitations of this review must be considered because of the time constraints of this review given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak the reviewed literature did not undergo formal quality appraisal additionally the review was limited to peer-reviewed publications and we did not explore potentially relevant grey literature the recommendations we have made apply primarily to small groups of people in dedicated facilities and to some extent in self-isolation although we anticipate that many of the risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes would be the same for larger containment processes such as entire towns or cities there are likely to be distinct differences in such situations that mean that the information presented in this review should only be applied to such situations cautiously furthermore potential cultural differences need to be considered although this review cannot predict exactly what will happen or provide recommendations that will work for every future population that is quarantined we have provided an overview of the key issues and how they could be rectified in the futurethere are also several limitations of the reviewed literature which must be pointed out only one study followed up participants over time sample sizes were generally small few studies directly compared participants quarantined with those not quarantined conclusions based on certain study populations eg students might not be generalisable to the wider public and heterogeneity of outcome measures across studies make it difficult to make direct comparisons between studies it is also worth pointing out that a minority of studies assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress using measures designed to measure post-traumatic stress disorder despite quarantine not being qualified as a trauma in the diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 543
strengths of this review include the hand-searching of reference lists to identify any papers not found in the initial search contacting authors who sent full-texts of papers which were not available in full online and having multiple researchers carry out the screening to improve the rigour of the reviewoverall this review suggests that the psychological impact of quarantine is wide-ranging substantial and can be long lasting this is not to suggest that quarantine should not be used the psychological effects of not using quarantine and allowing disease to spread might be worse44 however depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled carefully if quarantine is essential then our results suggest that officials should take every measure to ensure that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people this can be achieved by telling people what is happening and why explaining how long it will continue providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine providing clear communication ensuring basic supplies such as food water and medical supplies are available and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should rightly be feeling health officials charged with implementing quarantine who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security should also remember that not everyone is in the same situation if the quarantine experience is negative the results of this review suggest there can be long-term consequences that affect not just the people quarantined but also the health-care system that administered the quarantine and the politicians and public health officials who mandated it
our search strategy was designed to inform this review and a second review to be published elsewhere relating to adherence to quarantine we searched medline psycinfo and web of science the full list of search terms can be found in the appendix in brief we used a combination of terms relating to quarantine eg quarantine and patient isolation and psychological outcomes eg psych and stigma for studies to be included in this review they had to report on primary research be published in peer-reviewed journals be written in english or italian as these are the languages spoken by the current authors include participants asked to enter into quarantine outside of a hospital environment for at least 24 hours and include data on the prevalence of mental illness or psychological wellbeing or on factors associated with mental illness or psychological wellbeing ie any predictors of psychological wellbeing during or after quarantine the initial search yielded 3166 papers of which 24 included relevant data and were included in this review the screening process is illustrated in the figure
quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease to limit disease spread1 this differs from isolation which applies to people who have been diagnosed with the disease2 although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably particularly during the early stages of a novel infectious disease outbreak quarantine can be applied to large numbers of people for example in toronto during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak 100 people were placed into quarantine for every case that was diagnosed3 the early stages of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak have already witnessed the quarantining of entire cities within china4 whereas thousands of foreign nationals leaving china are being asked to enter quarantine at home or in government facilities upon return to their home countriesthe efficacy of quarantine is uncertain and in previous incidents its overuse has been criticised as lacking in scientific basis3

5

6 regardless of this debate one thing is clear quarantine does not work if people do not adhere to it although officially sanctioned enforcement of quarantine orders is possible7 this can lead to legal dispute5 chaotic scenes of confrontation8 and poor mental health which can occur even under voluntary procedures4

9 many nations are understandably nervous of these outcomes especially given that confrontation can now result in harrowing mobile phone footage making its way to social and mainstream media in many societies it might also be difficult to persuade the police or military to forcibly prevent healthy people who wish to leave quarantine from doing so seeking to avoid instances of public backlash many countries rely instead on a combination of inducements and appeals to civic duty to encourage people to adherewe present a rapid evidence review10 of factors that increase or decrease adherence with quarantine requestswe used a search strategy including terms relating to quarantine eg quarantine patient isolation and adherence eg adherence compliance for the full search strategy see appendix 1studies were eligible for inclusion if they a reported on primary research b were published in peer-reviewed journals c were written in english italian or french which could be translated by a member of our team d included participants asked to enter quarantine outside of a hospital environment for at least 24 h and e included outcomes relating to factors associated with or self-reported reasons for adherence or non-adherencetwo authors ran the search strategy on medline on 27th january 2020 and two authors ran the search strategy on psycinfo and web of science on 30th january 2020 citations were downloaded to endnote version x9 thomson reuters new york usa the same authors who ran the search evaluated titles and abstracts excluding any which were obviously irrelevant we obtained full texts of remaining citations and two authors reviewed these excluding any which did not meet inclusion criteria finally reference lists of remaining papers were hand-searched for additional relevant studies we then compared results from full text screening there were only minor discrepancies which were resolved through discussion with the whole teamthe following data were extracted from included studies authors publication year country of study infectious disease outbreak design and method participants including sample size and demographic information reason for quarantine length of quarantine and key results data extraction was carried out by one authornarrative synthesis was used to analyse the results of the included papers and group results into related themesthere was mixed evidence as to whether demographic and employment characteristics of quarantined people affected adherence to quarantine protocol whether parents employers provided paid leave did not affect adherence to quarantine recommendations during the h1n1 outbreak among children who had been sent home from school11 however where parents nonetheless took time off work to supervise their children adherence to quarantine was higher as the alternative might have involved others supervising children which would have broken quarantine protocol regarding social mixing11 porten et al12 found that during the sars outbreak unemployed or low-waged people were more likely to adhere to quarantine for students however having an additional job alongside being a student did not appear to be a relevant factor13 being a healthcare worker was associated with higher adherence to quarantine during the sars outbreak in canada14 within student populations no differences were found in accordance with gender age full or part-time status residing on or off campus or quarantine location13
one of the major factors affecting adherence to quarantine is knowledge about the infection and the quarantine protocol when five schools in an australian city were closed during the h1n1 pandemic a lack of clear quarantine instructions led some of those affected to invent their own quarantine rules15 seemingly based on what they thought constituted a visible symptom of the disease the acceptable degree of contact with those infected and the risk of being affected or of infecting others parents in an australian city who understood what they were meant to do during the quarantine period for h1n1 had significantly higher adherence to quarantine16 caleo et al17 found that people in sierra leone who were put under quarantine due to ebola also had problems adhering to protocols because they did not understand what isolation meant adherence to quarantine in taiwan during the sars outbreak was significantly associated with higher awareness of the pandemic18
however in some cases too much perceived knowledge might be a hindrance residents of villages that were quarantined during the ebola epidemic who were health professionals often had more knowledge about ebola than the volunteers sent in to support the village they believed they knew more about the risk of infection than volunteers but unlike the latter did not always adhere to the quarantine measures as they thought the restrictions were too overprecautionary19
one study looked at the effect of where people got their knowledge of quarantine protocols from finding no difference in adherence rates between those that sourced information from official vs unofficial sources16
social norms play an important part in adherence to quarantine protocols many individuals quarantined during the sars outbreak in canada reported social pressure from others to adhere to quarantine20 desclaux et al19 noted that residents from villages in senegal which quarantined during ebola said that if there was favourable opinion for engaging in quarantine from the head of household it was expected the rest of the household would follow suit and adhere residents also acknowledged a respect for the collective commitment to protect the community against ebola which they did not want to be seen to be disrespectinghowever social norms can also reduce adherence to quarantine as rumours that others were breaking quarantine began to surface among australian school communities quarantined during the h1n1 outbreak in australia those affected explained they were more likely to break quarantine protocols themselves15 volunteers who were supporting villages in senegal during quarantine for ebola also mentioned relaxing their principles and allowing non-adherence to quarantine at certain times to avoid direct challenges to containment which would then be seen by the rest of the village19
cultural values also play an important part in decisions to adhere to quarantine residents of villages in west africa quarantined during an ebola outbreak often did not adhere to quarantine as it was inherent in their culture to care for people when they are sick rather than abandon them17 conversely two studies noted that participants quarantined during sars explained that they adhered to quarantine as it was their civic duty and they wanted to be a good citizen20

21
two studies noted that following the law was a reason for adhering to quarantine during the ebola outbreak in sierra leone17 and the sars outbreak in canada20 in these circumstances if individuals were found breaking quarantine rules they faced paying fines relatedly where the term voluntary was used to describe quarantine in canada during the sars outbreak residents correctly understood this meant that adherence was at their discretion rather than enforced by the government something which then reduced adherence21
people who perceive a benefit of quarantine are more likely to adhere to it for example as village residents began to notice a slowing in the spread of ebola their attitudes changed and adherence to quarantine protocols increased17 toronto residents affected by quarantine for sars explained they adhered to protocols because they believed this would reduce the risk of transmission to others21 similarly soud et al13 found that perceived higher importance of avoiding others during isolation was associated with adherence to quarantine during a mumps outbreak at a university in the united statespeople who perceive a disease outbreak to be riskier in terms of disease transmission and severity of disease outcomes are more likely to adhere to quarantine cava et al20 found that those who adhered to quarantine for sars had higher perceptions of risk for the disease residents in senegalese villages quarantined due to ebola adhered because they thought transmission could happen even when asymptomatic19 higher perceived fear of sars was associated with adherence to quarantine measures in taiwan18 conversely reasons for non-adherence to quarantine in australia during the h1n1 pandemic included belief that the disease was not serious22 when comparing quarantine adherence during two separate outbreaks of sars in canada adherence was higher during the second outbreak14 indeed this may be due to the second outbreak increasing the perceived severity of the outbreak as it had not receded or it could be due to people being more knowledgeable about the disease and quarantine protocol the second time around relatedly increased adherence to quarantine in australia during the h1n1 pandemic occurred when there was an influenza case in the household which again may be associated with increased perceived risk of disease transmission now that the disease is amongst family members or an increase in knowledge of the disease and quarantine protocol23
one study looked at the effect of the objective severity of disease on adherence to quarantine finding no effect of the total probable cases of sars or number of quarantined people on likelihood of adherence18
two studies reported the need to work and fear of loss of income as reasons for not adhering to quarantine protocols21
22 in teh et al22 participants also mentioned factors relating to life carrying on outside of quarantine as reasons for not adhering examples included needing to attend an important event or visiting family and friendsthree studies reported that participants needed to break quarantine protocol to get supplies21

22

24 or to seek medical attention22
sometimes factors relating to the household situation during quarantine influenced adherence this could be due to people being preoccupied with the ill health of a loved one such that they did not adhere to quarantine protocols themselves20 similarly if quarantined children were able to be cared for by adults within the household rather than by outside family friends or hired help coming to the house this made it easier for families to adhere to quarantine protocol23
there was no evidence of healthcare workers experience or beliefs surrounding the outbreak affecting adherence to quarantine protocol hsu et al18 found no effect of healthcare workers years of experience or perceived severity of the epidemic on individuals adherence to quarantine protocol during the sars epidemic in taiwan however there was some evidence that the good functioning of health centres in taiwan that were helping to control the sars outbreak were associated with increased adherence hsu et al18 found that if health centres were functioning well and received adequate resourcing this was associated with increased adherence by people in quarantine what did not seem to influence adherence was whether the help came from volunteers or trained staffthere was mixed evidence for whether the length of prescribed quarantine affected adherence to quarantine protocol there was no effect of the length of prescribed quarantine for households during the h1n1 pandemic in australia23 conversely a quarantine duration of one to four days was associated with higher adherence than a duration of five to nine days during a mumps outbreak at an american university13
people in senegal who had a pre-existing positive appraisal of the healthcare system and had trust in the national response to ebola were more likely to adhere to quarantine19
given the rapid and evolving nature of the coronavirus outbreak and the need for guidance to support quarantine efforts this rapid review was limited to peer-reviewed publications of primary data without searching grey literature and did not include a formal quality assessment of included studies as such it important to note the review is not exhaustive and may have missed key articles in the search results and relevant articles may have been excluded as they were published in languages other than english italian and french in addition readers should read our interpretations of the evidence with caution as the quality of the studies is not known we did however search reference lists to identify articles that may not have been found in the initial search and engaged multiple members of the team in the screening process to improve methodological rigourour recommendations are primarily based on results from studies of small groups of people in home quarantine owing to a small selection of infectious disease outbreaks in a limited number of countries whilst we anticipate that many of the risk factors for adherence would likely be similar for larger quarantine approaches such as for whole towns or cities and for other types of infectious disease outbreaks there are also likely to be differences in such situations that mean the recommendations presented in this article should only be applied to such situations cautiously however although this review cannot provide recommendations that will encourage adherence in every future quarantined population the lessons from our review may be a good starting point for those considering these situationspeople vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks adherence depends on the psychological and practical factors associated with infectious disease outbreaks and quarantine when quarantine is deemed necessary public health officials should take should steps to minimise the risk of non-adherence by providing a timely clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols emphasising social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour increasing the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health in particular to those at heightened risk of the disease and ensuring sufficient supplies are providednone declaredthe research was

sars-cov-2 and previously termed as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has spread out from its first reported epicenter and quickly become a pandemic 1 2sars-cov-2 causes a generally mild but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection known as coronavirus disease covid-19 currently there exist no effective vaccines or drugs that can effectively prevent or treat covid-19 patients as such global public authorities have so far relied upon behavioral non pharmaceutical interventions npis such as use of masks social distancing self-isolation quarantine and even lock-down of entire territories and communities to contain or at least mitigate the burden of the ongoing pandemic 3 4 5 despite the unprecedented nature of some of these measures western countries have found it difficult to fully suppresseradicate the outbreak and have preferred to mitigate it deciding to opt for a short-period of npis which will be followed by gradual reopening the economy and return to a new normal resumption of daily working and social activities is expected to cause further outbreak waves due to the re-increasing of contact ratesin 6 sajadi et al provided the evidence that covid-19 could perhaps prevail at low levels and begin to rise again in late fall and winter in temperate regions in the upcoming year since covid-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season this would be particularly challenging from a clinical standpoint it would be difficult to distinguish between the two infectious agents with the definition of covid-19 cases rather problematic moreover diagnostic tests as well as human resources are limited furthermore currently commercially available rapid diagnostic tests are characterized by a good specificity but have a limited sensitivity as such not enabling a quick and reliable diagnosis of covid-19 altogether this would significantly impact downstream public health efforts to properly identify covid-19 cases and contain the outbreak overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems particularly in resource-limited contexts and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmissionwhen the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak caused by the coronavirus sars-cov-1 occurred in mainland china in 2002 the world health organization who has recommended to increase influenza vaccination considering that the actual coverage rate is still sub-optimal and below the threshold in particular the who recommended a campaign targeting high-risk groups such as healthcare workers the elderly and disabled people to be able to differentiate more quickly between the two infections and to be more effective in counteracting the outbreak 7 8 9a similar strategy would be valuable also for covid-19 to test such a hypothesis we devised a mathematical model incorporating the treatment of people complaining of ili symptoms potentially at risk of contracting covid-19 or other emergingre-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting where the competition of the detection resources between the covid-19 infected population and individuals with ili symptoms is considered the main purpose of this study is using the model to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination and public health interventions on the spread of covid-19 in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza seasonwe obtained the data of covid-19 cases in china from january 23rd to march 29th 2020 from the national health commission of the peoples republic of china 10 the data information includes the cumulative number of confirmed cases the cumulative number of death cases the cumulative number of cured cases and the cumulative number of suspected cases shown in fig 1 it should be mentioned that the number of suspected cases includes the number of quarantined covid-19 exposed cases the number of quarantined covid-19 infected cases but not confirmed yet and the number of quarantined individuals with clinical fever symptoms who are susceptible to covid-19
based on the epidemical progression of covid-19 and the intervention measures we extended the classical seir model by including social distancing measures and including cross-infected individuals those who are having clinical fever symptoms and are considered as covid-19 suspected and thus quarantined due to their exposure to covid-19 infected individuals the transmission diagram is shown in fig 2 in the model we divide the total population n into ten compartments susceptible s exposed e symptomatic infected i asymptomatic infected a quarantined susceptible sq quarantined susceptible with fever symptoms sf quarantined exposed eq quarantined infected iq confirmed and hospitalized h and recovered r
with the implementation of contact tracing a proportion of q of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined let the transmission probability be  and the contact rate be c then the quarantined individuals can move to compartment eq or sq at a rate of cq or 1cq if they are effectively infected or not effectively infected while the other proportion 1q missed from the contact tracing will move to the exposed compartment e at a rate of c1q once effectively infected or stay in the susceptible compartment s otherwisenote that due to clinical fever or illness-like symptoms susceptible individuals may also be quarantined and move to the compartment sf at a transition rate of m and they can be infected by the quarantined infected individuals at a rate of fcf based on the above assumptions and previous studies 5 11 12 the transmission dynamics is governed by the following model 1sctctqt1sinactsanmtssqfsfect1qtsinactsaneief1iiqsftia1eaasqctqt1sinsqsfmtsfcfsfiqfsfeqctqtsinfcfsfiqqeqiqqeqf2iiqsftiqhf1iiqsff2iiqsfthhthraahththe detailed definitions of all the parameters and variables are listed in table 1
a significant difference between the covid-19 transmission dynamics model in our previous studies 11 12 14 and the current study is the introduction of two saturated functions f1iiqsfii1tiiqsfand f2iiqsfqiq1tiiqsfto describe the impact of cross-infection on the diagnose rate of the infected class i and the detection rate of the quarantined infected class iq with limited testing capacity respectively i and q are the fastest diagnose rate of infected individuals and quarantined infected individuals respectively that the medical resources permit 1t is the maximum number of individuals who can be tested per unit time day limited by the maximum testing kits and staff to administrate the test with limif1iiqsfit and limiqf2iiqsfqt in other word 1t measures the testing capacity per day here we set the daily capacity as an increasing function of time t because of the increasing production of detection kits and the improvement of detection techniques the function of 1t is of the following form 1t101bert1bwhere 10 is the total number of available detection kits at the initial time ie january 23rd with 00 1b is the maximum number of available tests permitted with limttb0 and r is the exponential increasing ratethe saturation functions f1iiqsf and f2iiqsf are decreasing functions with respect to sf this is because the quarantined covid-19 susceptible individuals with fever symptoms belong to the covid-19 suspected population and will be tested to confirm if they are covid-19 positive or not these individuals will consume the detection kits and require staff time resulting in a slower detection rate of the covid-19 infected casessimilarly to the previous studies 12 14 as a result of the improvement of medical treatment and the implementation of a series of strict control interventions adopted by the chinese government since january 23rd we assume that the contact rate c the quarantine rate q the quarantine rate of susceptible population with clinical fever symptoms m disease-induced death rate  and recovery rate of confirmed individuals h are time-dependent functions in more details the contact rate ct is a decreasing function with respect to time t which is given by ctc0cberctcbwhere c0 is the contact rate at the initial time with c0c0 cb is the minimum contact rate under control measures and self-isolation with limtctcbc0 and rc is the exponential decreasing ratethe quarantined rate q is an increasing function with respect to time t due to the strengthened contact tracing which takes the following form qtq0qberqtqbwhere qb is the quarantined rate at the initial time with q0q0 qb is the maximum quarantined rate under control measures with limtqtqbq0 and rq is the exponential increasing ratethe quarantined rate of susceptible population with clinical fever symptoms mt is a decreasing function with respect to time t given by mtm0mbermtmbwhere m0 denotes the quarantined rate of susceptible population with fever symptoms at the initial time with m0m0 mb is the minimum quarantined rate of susceptible population with fever symptoms with limtmtmbm0 and rm is the exponential decreasing ratedue to the improvements of medical treatments and the strengthening of the production and supply of prevention and control products 15 disease-induced death rate t decreases with respect to time t and the recovery rate of confirmed individuals ht increases with respect to time t thus t and ht take the following forms t0bertbandhth0hberthbwhere 0 is the disease-induced death rate at the initial time with 00 b is the minimum disease-induced death rate with limttb0 and r is the exponential decreasing rate h0 denotes the recovery rate of confirmed individuals at the initial time with h0h0 hb denotes the maximum recovery rate of confirmed individuals with limththbh0 and r denotes the exponential increasing rateusing the next generation matrix we can define and calculate the effective reproduction number rt as follows rtmaxr1tr2twhere r1tct1qtstti1tsftn1actstanand r2tfcfsfttq1tsftwithststandsftsftnote that r2t represents the effective reproduction number of cross-infected individualsin order to fit the model to the data we firstly fixed some parameters of our model from previous literature to reduce the complexity in particular the contact rate and the quarantined rate at the initial time are fixed as c014781 11 and q010104 12 respectively the incubation period is fixed as 5 days 13 ie 15 the releasing rate of quarantined susceptible individuals is fixed as 114 11 while the recovery rate of the asymptomatic infected individuals is fixed as a013978 11 in addition we fix the initial quarantined susceptible population confirmed and hospitalized population and recovered population as 7374 771 and 34 respectively according to the data informationby simultaneously fitting the proposed model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases cumulative number of death cases cumulative number of cured cases and cumulative number of suspected cases we first estimated the rest parameters and initial conditions using the least square method the best fitting curves are marked as red in fig 3 with the blue circles representing the data from january 23rd to march 29th 2020 the detailed estimated values of the parameters and initial conditions are listed in table 1
its worth mentioning that we use four time series of data to fit the model simultaneously which can cross-validate the estimation results furthermore based on the available information the least squares method with a priori distribution for each parameter is used in this study in another word we implicitly utilize a penalized least square method to select reasonable parameter values falling in the ranges which were estimated in other published studies particularly our estimated minimum contact rate with control strategies is 20 which is consistent with contact surveys in study 16 and the transition rate of quarantined exposed individuals to the quarantined infected class is estimated as q02 being in line with the incubation period 13 it was illustrated in 17 that it takes about 2 days from the start of sampling to the return of results indicating that our estimation value of fast diagnose rate of infected individuals i05 is reasonable furthermore the estimated initial number of detection kits per day 102000 is highly consistent with the news reported in the beijing news 17furthermore we use the coefficient of determination r2 to estimate the goodness of fit for our model fitting results given a data set with n observed value y1yn the corresponding estimated values from the model are defined as f1fn and y1ni1nyi is the average observed value then the coefficient of determination value r2 can be defined as r21ssressstot with ssresi1nyifi2 denoting the sum of squares of residuals and sstoti1nyiy2 denoting the total sum of squares therefore we obtain the coefficients of determination for the model fitting results in fig 3a-d being 09905 0988 09884 and 09868 respectively this indicates that the model fits the data very welldetection kits for covid-19 were firstly introduced and used on january 16th 2020 but with very limited numbers since january 23rd 2020 detection kits were delivered to hubei province from other provinces in china since it took time to increase the production of kits and improve the level of production technology there was a serious shortage of detection kits during the initial stage of the covid-19 epidemics to examine the impacts of the limited detection kits on the covid-19 epidemics in terms of the cumulative number of confirmed cases the cumulative number of cross-infected cases and the infected population it we vary the increasing rate of the available detection kits r in fig 4 it follows from fig 4 that reducing r will significantly increase both the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases and the infected population of it and daily cross-infected population at the peak time particularly the cumulatively confirmed cases and cumulatively cross-infected cases will increase 35 times about 2084105 cases and 47 times about 1483104 cases respectively if the exponential increasing rate r decreases by 80 percent this means that deficiency and delay of detection cause more serious outbreaks in another word speeding up the production of detection kits and improve the detection capability play an important role in reducing the final size of infections
when faced with limited detection kits supply we show the impacts of public health interventions on the outbreak of covid-19 as seen in table 2 in particular increasing rc or rq remarkably reduces the cumulative number of confirmed cases specifically when r is very small r01r0 ie the testing kits production increases very slowly then 1 if rc increases by 5 times the cumulative number of confirmed cases will decrease by 936 2 if rq increases by 5 times the cumulative number of confirmed cases will decrease by 787 in addition comparing the results in table 2 we find that the impact of increasing rc or rq on mitigating the epidemics weakens as r increases this implies that rapid implementation of public health interventions such as reducing contact rate and enhancing quarantined rate is a good way to compensate the shortage of detection kits and it is more indispensable for countries with severer limited resource of detection kits
it is also interesting to observe from fig 5a that the estimated effective reproduction number the blue curve will first experience a short-period increasing before it decreases below the threshold 1 however we further observe that if we increase the rate of r by 5 times the red curve in fig 5a the effective reproduction number will decrease below the threshold 1 directly this indicates that due to the limited resource of the testing kits the fast-increased infected population will result in more infections as they are not confirmed and hospitalized and the situation will become worse if r is smaller shown in fig 5a as well furthermore it follows from fig 5b and c that increasing rc or rq can avoid the magnification of the effective reproduction number and make the threshold value reduce to 1 ahead of time which implies that reducing the contact rate quickly and increasing the quarantined rate can effectively avert the short-term intensification of the outbreak caused by the limited detection kitsthe covid-19 outbreak in china coincided partially with flu season and it was difficult to distinguish covid-19 accurately and rapidly from influenza-like-illnesses as a result individuals with clinical fever symptoms required medical treatment in high risk settings of covid-19 and the risk of cross-infection increased here we seek to use our transmission dynamics model to explore the impact of mass influenza vaccination prior to the onset of flu season on controlling the transmission of covid-19note that in our model we assumed that due to the influenza-like-illness ili the susceptible individuals s can be quarantined at a rate of m move to sf which is proportion to the susceptible population further we assume that the susceptible population is vaccinated against influenza with an effective vaccination coverage rate vr thus the vaccinated population will not be quarantined because of the clinical fever symptoms consequently the rate at which the susceptible population is quarantined due to the ili becomes 1vrms based on the above assumptions we evaluate the impact of the mass influenza vaccination on the transmission dynamics of covid-19
in fig 6 by changing the vaccination coverage rate of vr and fixing all the other parameters as the estimated baseline values we examine the impact of vaccination against influenza on the covid-19 epidemics in china in terms of the final size and the peak values it follows from fig 6 that increasing the vaccination coverage rate against influenza can remarkably reduce the cumulative number of covid-19 confirmed cases and cross-infected cases and also reduce the peak number of it and daily cross-infected population in more detail we find that by a vaccination coverage rate of 90 the cumulative number of confirmed cases can reduce by 230 about 19062 total cases moreover the cumulative number of cross-infected cases can reduce by 929 about 3700 cases this implies that mass influenza vaccination could contribute significantly to the control of the outbreak of covid-19 and significantly reduce the risk of cross-infection
in addition in fig 7 we illustrate the impact of getting vaccine against influenza on the reduction of the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases incorporating the effect of limited testing kits and public health interventions that is with different increasing rate of available detection kits r or different decreasing rate of contact rate rc as shown in fig 6 vaccination against influenza could reduce the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and cumulative cross-infected cases hereafter referred as the reduced confirmed cases and reduced cross-infected cases respectively it follows from fig 7a1 and a2 that getting vaccinated against influenza could significantly reduce the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases with respect to r we give the specific reduction rate with respect to different r and vaccination rate in table 3 specifically when the vaccination coverage rate was 90 the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases could reduce by 515 and 914 with r01r0 respectively we can further observe that the effects of getting vaccinated against influenza weakens as r increases it means that getting vaccinated against influenza could effectively control the outbreak of covid-19 moreover mass influenza vaccination is more necessary when detection kits are severely limited and under seriously shortage of supply in another words mass influenza vaccination can be a much more effective control measure in mitigating the covid-19 epidemics in the early stage with a rapid growth and the countries or areas with limited testing kits
similarly fig 7b1 and b2 illustrate the impact of getting vaccinated on reducing the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases with respect to rc and the detailed reduction rate with respect to different rc and vaccination coverage rate is given in table 4 specifically for a 90 vaccination coverage rate the cumulative number of confirmed cases could reduce by 308 and the cumulative number of cross-infected cases could reduce by 920 with rc01rc0 showing that if the contact rate was not be fast controlled and reduced mass vaccination could effectively aid the containment of covid-19 outbreakin the present mathematical modeling study we have tested the hypothesis that a mass influenza vaccination campaign would have a positive effect on the management of people with non-specific symptoms and complaining of ilis potentially at risk of developing the covid-19 or other emerging respiratory infections during their admission at the health-care setting our findings show that increasing influenza vaccination coverage rate to an optimal threshold would facilitate the efforts of containing the covid-19 outbreakaccording to some researchers the sars-cov-2 had already been circulating much earlier than late december 2019 but its correct identification was hindered by a considerable amount of people complaining of influenza-like-illness ili symptoms in the case of the implementation of a mass influenza vaccination campaign well before the onset of the influenza season the exposure of emergingre-emerging respiratory pathogens would be unmasked facilitating their identification and the design of ad hoc public health interventions this would significantly alleviate the pressure on health-care facilities reducing the total number of people complaining of ili symptoms and decreasing the transmission probability of covid-19 or other emerging infectious agents both among healthcare workers and subsequently among people under investigation for their diseaseinfluenza generates a relevant burden worldwide both in terms of healthcare resources consumption and socio-economic impact despite the existence of effective vaccines and their importance as cost-effective preventative tool vaccination coverage rate still remains suboptimal with respect to the general population healthcare workers are at a higher risk of exposure to circulating respiratory pathogens including influenza potentially threatening their own health and compromising patients safety influenza vaccine uptake is suboptimal also among other targeted categories including the elderly and disabled people an inadequate disease risk perception a low health literacy perception of the societal effects of vaccination and alleged side-effects are among the drivers of vaccine hesitancyinfluenza vaccination would enable to better control and contain the spread of covid-19 or other emergingre-emerging pathogens in case of coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season mass influenza vaccination prior to the onset of the peak influenza season would significantly decrease the number of ilis among the general population and specifically the elderly with fewer persons with ilis seeking for medical advice particularly those in high-risk settings with frailty underlying co-morbidities or disabled as such this would minimize the probability of not quickly and accurately identifying circulating respiratory pathogens as well as the possibility of ongoing nosocomial transmissionhowever how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging mandatory policies for targeted categories are under debate in several countries also in this study we did not consider explicitly the efficacy of the influenza vaccine and the vaccination coverage should be a effective vaccination rate however we believe that this study provided a fundamental framework for quantitatively evaluating the impact of vaccination against influenza on mitigating the covid-19 epidemics public health decision- and policy-makers should adopt evidence-informed strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake given its impact on respiratory pandemic outbreaks coinciding with the peak influenza season and the shortage of medical personnel and equipment including diagnostic teststhe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthe covid-19 outbreak was treated as a case of pneumonia with unknown etiology appeared in the wuhan city of china at the end of december 2019 which spread across the country to worldwide with a high rate 1 the prc peoples republic of china centre for disease control cdc analyzed the respiratory samples and declared that the pneumonia was caused by a novel coronavirus which named the pneumonia as novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp 2 the coronavirus is one of the major virus that target the respiratory system of the human 3 the chinese researchers named the virus as 2019-ncov 4 later the international committee on taxonomy of virus named the novel coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 5 on the same day february 11 2020 the world health organization who name the pneumonia as coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 6the world health organization who declared the covid 19 outbreak as sixth public health of emergency services sphec on january 30 2020 7 this was not the first outbreak of the coronavirus the previous coronavirus outbreaks include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov outbreak and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak 8 the covid-19 thought the third outbreak of the coronavirus which affected more than 209 countries including pakistan according to the world health organization who total of 1093349 confirmed cases with 58620 mortalities to date the number of highest positive cases encountered in usa followed by italy and spain 9the border countries of pakistan highly affected including china where the covid-19 outbreak experienced first time in the west italy with highest number of covid-19 mortalities while in the north iran a high number of mortalities after the italy 10 in pakistan the first case of covid-19 has been confirmed by the ministry of health government of pakistan on february 26 2020 in karachi sindh province on the same day another case confirmed by the pakistan federal ministry of health in islamabad 1112 within fifteen days the number of total confirmed cases covid-19 positive reached to twenty 20 out of 471 suspected cases with highest numbers in the sindh province followed by the gilgit baltistan all of the confirmed cases had recent travel history from iran syria and london and currently these cases increase by high rate and the situation is worst 13the geographical location of pakistan with the continuous increases in the number of cvoid-19 positive cases need a high level of action planes and management on 12th of february the ministry of national health services regulation  coordination pakistan presented a plane national action plan for preparedness  response to corona virus disease covid-19 pakistan the aims to control the spreading of virus and to strengthen country and community emergency preparedness in order to ensure a timely efficient and effective response to potential events due to covid-19 including the local regional and national outbreaks that can have a significant impact on the health of pakistani population and society 14 to date different steps have been taken by the government of pakistan against covid-19 outbreak in this review we highlighted the different steps taken by the government of pakistan against covid-19 such as designated hospitals quarantine centers testing facilities treatments public awareness and the response of local community against covid-19 outbreakaccording to the ministry of health government of pakistan there are total of 3277 confirmed positive cases in the country with 18 critical and 50 mortalities on monday april 6 2020 the

cases 20the quarantines being used to restrict the activities or separation of persons in a non-health care facility who were not ill yet but who might have been exposed to an infectious agent or disease such as covid 19 with the objective of monitoring symptoms and early detection of cases the places use for quarantine of covid-19 people was widely disturbed in provinces the total number of quarantines 23557 in 139 districts of the pakistan which arise the good gesture which being use in this scenario throughout pakistan to control the outbreak of covid-19 in islamabad the capital of the country have allotted the two quarantine facilities in the baluchistan there were 10 khyber pakhtunkhwa 52 punjab 6 sindh 2 while gilgit-baltistan 63 quarantine facilities were being functional as showed in the fig 3 in ajk there were 4 quarantine facilities were being functional in the various districts 21globally pcr is used for covid-19 test which are the best and easy method so pakistans

have been equipped with free pcr system facilities for covid-19 test pakistans testing capacity has been increased from 30000 to 280000 and would be further enhanced to 900000 since the outbreak the country has carried out nearly 15000 coronavirus tests in order to improve the testing efficiency national disaster management authority ndma works with national institute of health nih to rise the current number of coronavirus testing laboratories from 15 to 50 the new testing labs would be set in different cities across the country pakistan is also launching a training program for paramedics and laboratory staff to resolve the deficiency ndma would recruit 100 lab technicians with expertise in molecular biology 22the covid-19 coursed by sars-cov-2 in the wuhan city of china which rapidly spread in 208 countriesregions including usa uk italy spain and pakistan the current scenario of pakistan is not satisfactory as pakistan is much populated country where required more facilitation pakistan is a developing country where the financial position is not better as compared to china usa uk russia to combat with covid-19 outbreak the number of hospitals and quarantine facilities being not fulfilled as required if these medical facilities improved then it will not be difficult to control the transmission of viruses and treatment of patients currently the testing facilities are much lower than the required target the testing facilities could increase by five to ten 5to 10 folds the right steps should be taken to control the situation more worst such as staying at homes lockdown social distancing using sanitizers face mask when necessary pakistan needs more screening facilities for the arrivals as well as for the departures it is hoped that pakistan will overtake the

increased stress5 in these unprepared situations6 the current quarantine conditions have shut down schools and universities and have suspended face-to-face teaching and learning sessions this has affected the physiological phases of lives and induced many individual and collective health socioeconomic psychological and educational concerns the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of two weeks quarantine on medical students mental wellbeing and learning behaviors during this period of social isolationthe present questionnaire based observational study was conducted in the department of physiology college of medicine king saud university during the period april 2020the details of the medical students including names addresses phone numbers email addresses age gender and levels of the medical school education was obtained from the vice dean office and student council college of medicine king saud university riyadh the selection of students was random and students information was kept confidential we employed a power formula to calculate the sample size7 the sample size was obtained by using simple random sampling in this study undergraduate medical students were invited to participate from medical school of king saud university riyadh saudi arabiathe questionnaire was designed based on the information taken from earlier studies and edited to suit the objectives58 a pilot study was conducted to test the validity of the questionnaire the final version of the questionnaire contained 20 questions divided into three main parts the first part was about demographic features the second was designed to assess psychological wellbeing and the third section was based on learning behaviour queriesonline questionnaires were distributed among the medical students through emails to collect the required information we used a questionnaire with five point likert scale to collect the information the five point likert scale is a well-known and highly accepted scale that can help to assess the qualitative magnitude of targeted outcomes910the survey included an opening page for informed consent and an opening paragraph that asks whether or not they agree to participate in the study the participants were given the option to choose whether to participate or not by clicking on the box corresponding to their responses students who opted to participate were led to a series of questions no reward of any kind was given to the participants the collected information was kept completely confidential the electronic questionnaire was distributed among the 625 medical students through their emails and 530 848 of the medical students responded thus the total number of participants was 530 and out of this total 294 5547 were female and 236 4453 malethe findings were analyzed by using spss software version 220 for microsoft windows the numbers and percentages were calculated a p-value 005 was considered to be significantethical

medical students felt depressed during the quarantine period of two weeks table-iiwhile inquiring about feelings of hopeless exhausted or emotionally unresponsive during this quarantine period 116 3946 female and 86 3644 male agreed that they felt hopeless exhausted or emotionally unresponsive during the quarantine period the total number of these students was 202 3811a total of 08 items related to the quarantine impact on students learning behaviors used are shown in table-iii 165 5612 of the females and 103 4364 of the males strongly agreed with a statement describing deterioration in work performance and studying subjects contents it was noted that 181 6156 of the females and 117 4958 the males had experienced decreased in overall study period the combined percentage of students who felt that their study period was decreased was 298 5622 while enquiring about concentrating on the studies 83 2823 of the female medical students and 89 3771 of the male students having difficulty in performing mental calculations table-iiihealth is a state of physical mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity11 human health and wellbeing are discretely rooted in being surrounded by a functioning society the covid-19 outbreak has induced a global public and mental health crisis as well as a huge psycho-social experiment we have noticed that quarantine due to the covid-19 pandemic has caused stress and changes in the learning behaviors of medical students both male and female participants exhibited deterioration in their study and work performancewith the current worldwide trend of quarantine and isolation due to covid-19 this deterioration in mood seems to have occurred sooner than one might have expected hawryluck et al5 conducted a study on psychological effects of quarantine and reported that quarantined persons exhibited a high prevalence of psychological distress posttraumatic stress disorder 289 and depression 312the world has witnessed that because of the coronavirus disease outbreak in december 2019 many countries have been asking their residents to isolate themselves at home or in quarantine premises for example authorities in the kingdom of saudi arabia reacted to the pandemic as a responsible nation and on march 25 2020 decided to enact a lock-down on capital city riyadh as a part of the fight against covid-19 outbreak on thursday 26 march the saudi authorities imposed a total lockdown in the city riyadh along with makkah and medina islams two holiest cities as part of tighter constraints to counter the virus during the current covid-19 pandemic with the current lockdown situation medical students in saudi arabia are living in a quarantine inside their residence facilitiesmore recently rhr et al12 has demonstrated that quarantine measures during covid-19 outbreaks have severe negative consequences for mental health in another study lei et al13 identified high prevalence of anxiety and depression among people who quarantined during covid-19 outbreak in southwestern china similarly in the present study we found that 125 235 medical students felt disheartened and depressed the most probable reasons for negative consequences for mental health during quarantine are that people considered it an unpleasant experience because of having to depart from fellows friends and family losing the ability to move about freely experiencing doubts about the spread of disease and developing intense feelings and reactionsthe quarantine phase is a complex intervention within the jurisdiction of public health14 our results demonstrate two important characteristics related to the covid-19 quarantine namely an increase in stress and an increase in dysfunctional learning behaviors although medical students believe that quarantine has not much affected their learning and psychological wellbeing the students whom we interviewed stated that quarantine has caused them to feel emotionally detached from family fellows and friends and has led to a decrease in overall work performance and duration of studyin the past the quarantine compliance rate has been positive studies have indicated high levels of acceptance of quarantine among samples of toronto-area residents 97 and us citizens 93 during a sars 1 pandemic quarantine1516 in the current study a good number of responses were also recorded where participants have a difference of opinion the female and male medical students showed a sense of being emotionally detached from family fellow professionals and friends feel depressed and decreased in their overall study work performance and study periodthe literature had consistently reported differences occurring concerning stress among males and females this is constant with preceding research indicating that female physicians are more likely to be emotionally fatigued at the commencement of exhaustion compared to male physicians17 similarly female students in the present study were found to be motivated in handling their learning especially when it came to performing two tasks simultaneously brooks et al18 reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms confusion and anger due to the covid-19 outbreak quarantine the authors concluded that during a long duration quarantine fear frustration inadequate information and financial loss are the main causes of negative psychological impact similarly the present study findings suggest that the reported alterations in attitude and mood may be due to the threatening situation of the covid-19 pandemic medical students in particular may feel differently once this situation is over and explicit research should explore such differencessam research

person-to-person transmission was established quickly while viral transmission prior to the appearance of symptoms remains controversial 2 3 from the same family as the sars and mers coronaviruses 10 and 35 fatality rates respectively 4 5 2019-ncov has also led to serious cases of pneumonia albeit with a lower estimated fatality rate of 2-3 at the present time 6 given that a vaccine cannot be developed and deployed for at least a year preventing further transmission relies upon standard principles of containment two of which are the isolation of known cases and the quarantine of persons believed at high risk of exposure with the latter extended inside china to prevent travel to or from wuhan and globally via the cancellation of air travel to and from chinawhat follows are some probability models for assessing the effectiveness of case isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals within a community during the initial phase of an outbreak with illustrations based on early observations from wuhan the good news is that in principle case isolation alone is sufficient to end community outbreaks of 2019-ncov transmission provided that cases are detected efficiently quarantining persons identified via tracing backwards from known cases is also beneficial but less efficient than isolationto begin suppose someone has just become infected absent intervention assume that this infected person will transmit new infections in accord with a time-varying poisson process with intensity function t denoting the transmission rate at time t following

communities and afflicted large numbers of people the united nations un health
agency has declared the virus as an epidemic however on 11 march 2020 and after
the virus has made its way to infect even larger numbers in countries around the
globe such as italy iran and spain which have the highest numbers of cases and
fatality rates the world health organization who has officially declared the
communication of covid-19 as a pandemic which means that it has the characteristics
to qualify as an international phenomenon this press conference raised the voice
regarding the alarming levels of the coronavirus spread severity and inaction
where who officials stated that theyre expecting numbers of cases and mortalities
to further increase bogoch et
al 2020the initial case of coronavirus lebanon was recorded on 21 february 2020 which after
20 days the government have decided to enforce a partial embargo closed public and
private institutions including the airport where flights from and to italy south
korea iran and china were banned and lebanese citizens abroad were given a
duration of 4 days to return before the travel ban becomes effective tuite et al 2020 to
date the country has recorded 333 cases and 5 deaths where those numbers are
actually on 15 of the actual cases thus the numbers amount to more than the ones
officially documented where each person can infect two or three people on average
who 2020in light of the pressing economic crisis that has been intensifying constantly and
impeding lebanons ability to properly respond to this health crisis the outbreak
has triggered a state of panic among the public the spread of covid-19 has taken
the health care system off guard in lebanon especially that the hospitals are not
properly equipped to receive large numbers of cases and it is not doable to dedicate
full hospitals to the treatment of the covid-19 cases as lebanese hospitals whether
governmental or private take on around 8000 patients on a daily basis some of
which are serious cases lebanon also has about 750 functional ventilators only 250
of which have been dedicated to coronavirus cases which adds to the pressure of the
issue ministry of public health
moph 2020health professionals have become the most vulnerable population to contract the virus
and represented over 20 of those who actually contracted the disease contracting
covid-19 became a major worry for health care staff with the rising number of
covid-19-infected personnel in that regard the order of nurses in lebanon has
indicated in a recent report which showed that at least 15 nurses have caught the
infection this has contributed to the skepticism of insufficient preventive
measures moph 2020
the pandemic has been posing a huge responsibility and a heavy psychological hurdle
to stay safe and keep their loved ones safe as well while still fulfilling their
duties conflicting accounts of health care professionals readiness to carry out
high-risk tasks maunder et al
2003 schull 
redelmeier 2003 prompted revived controversy about whether health care
personnel had a right to decline to operate in high-risk conditions most workers
feel torn in their positions as health care professionals and parents they feel a
moral obligation but they still expressed anxiety and worry for their children
being afflicted with the virus because of them the nurses exposed to the virus have
placed themselves in quarantine in order to prevent further outbreak especially to
their families thus they have started renting out flats and apartments next to the
hospitals which they are barely even affordingsimilar challenges that have arisen due to covid-19 outbreak have led to various
psychological and emotional disorders and illnesses among many health care
professionals in china united states canada taiwan and hong kong who were caring
for patients with the disease chen et al 2020 duan  zhu 2020 the psychiatric illness most frequently
correlated with disaster-related events in the previous research is post-traumatic
stress disorder ptsd but reports have also shown that comorbid depression is
prevalent in people after a disaster geng et al 2019 zhen et al 2019lebanese health care professionals are faced with a demanding reality that is might
also give rise to psychological symptomatology in the long run therefore a
qualitative evaluation associated with the repercussions of the risk of exposure to
the virus may reveal a variety of perspectives where the psychological and
emotional viewpoints of them might be more significantly correlated to consequential
mental afflictions than the objective aspects nonetheless past covid-19 disease
research did not analyze the relationship between contextual expectations of
outbreak-related danger and corresponding rates of mood disorders in fact little
has been understood regarding the causes that could be correlated with the
post-disaster prevalent depression although it has been seen that philanthropic
motivation to aid is beneficial against psychological distress navarro-mateu et al
2019 the paucity of research that examined its impact on post-disaster
depression have provided conflicting results thus the aim of the present study is
to examine the psychosocial effects of being quarantined following exposure to
covid-19 among lebanese health care workersthe study has adopted an exploratory qualitative research design to obtain a profound
understanding of the psychosocial experiences of quarantined nurses the sample
included 13 participants acting in the covid-19 teams at lebanese hospitals the
study employed a convenient sampling technique due to the limited number of
available accessible and eligible candidates to be included in this study the
eligibility criterion was set to be health care professionals who were quarantined
due to the occupational exposure to covid-19 cases where they had to take measures
such as leaving their families renting out apartments or staying in separate
specialized hospital dormitories to prevent a possible spread of the virus in case
they have contracted it an email was sent to the possible participants where the
aim of the study was explained and they were asked to provide written informed
consent institutional review board approval was procured as the study has abided by
the ethical guidelines of research irb number eco-r-15 the participants took
part in hour-long semi-structured interviews were due to the strict schedules long
working hours and the need for precautions 11 interviews were done through
telephone while 2 were done face-to-face the researchers have kept carrying out the
interviews until data saturation was reached the researchers have agreed with the
subjects at a convenient time for the interview so that they would be able to freely
express genuine opinions the researchers took alternating turns in moderating the
interviews in order to prevent moderator dominance the researchers thus posed the
following questions how do you describe living through the quarantine
experience how is quarantine affecting you how do you perceive your
situation regarding contracting and spreading covid-19 and how is covid-19
affecting your work as a healthcare professional a phone call recorder
application was used to keep a record of the interviews while a regular recorder
application was used to tape the face-to-face interviews qualitative narratives
were translated into the english language and have been examined by employing an
inductive thematic content analysis which involved reading verbatim open text
labeling establishing classes and abstracting final themes burnard et al 2008 elo  kyngs 2008 hays  singh 2011 the
analysis was carried out separately by each researcher and then they discussed
their findings until a consensus was reached while not involving their own
perception during that process the researchers read them verbatim provided by the
respondents multiple times in order to get a genuine understanding of the experience
lived by the health care professionals the phrases were given a reflective word
that captures the essence of the datum provided and after that the words grouped and
aggregated into themes which were addressed by the two authors to make sure that
they are representative of the studied experience in order to enhance the
trustworthiness of the study and avoid biases multiple processes were undertaken by
the researchers according to what has been described in past literature in the area
of qualitative research krefting 1991 concurrent analysis ensured that emerging phenomena
could be explored in simultaneous interviews to achieve a thorough interpretation of
concepts both researchers had employed the same structure for the interviews and
questions used the authors discussed the concepts formed and did not ignore any
aspect of the findings various verbatim excerpts were used to explain the
researchs outcomes and this provided the respondents with a voice in this research
article additionally coordination with qualified professionals was established
where they used control procedures to check the findings the analysis was conducted
autonomously by two scholars the writers addressed the topic of interpreting and
evaluating observations that culminated in agreement on shared themes speziale et al 2011
besides peer checking the investigators employed the member-checking approach to
developing credibility and validation after reviewing each discussion the
respondents were sent back the themes and descriptions to verify the findings the
investigators did in addition employ the external member-checking method to
guarantee that the study results were transferable to ensure generalizability
through contexts the results of the research were introduced to a variety of health
care professionals who had not participated in the analysis and were requested to
determine the similarity between the findings of the study and their own
experiencesthe research sample comprised 13 health care professionals 9 692 of which
were nurses while 4 308 were physicians where both were caring for covid-19
cases and have been quarantined due to their exposure to active covid-19
patients the results showed that 11 9461 of the participants were married
while 2 1538  of them were single in addition 7 538 of the respondents
had children while 6 462 did not have children where 8 615 of them were
obliged to rent out apartments near their respective hospitals while 5 385
of them were able to stay at hospital-provided dormitoriesthe nurses and physicians have commonly expressed their concern regarding
contracting the covid-19 virus during their duty and spreading it to the
community and most importantly to their families which is making them
follow infection control measures more obsessively and therefore taking
quarantine actions for instance one nurse saidsince the start of the outbreak i have started to be really obsessed
with handwashing and disinfecting everything i touch after i
started serving in the corona unit the fear got even worse as i am
now more vulnerable to catch the virus and spread it to my family 
  that minute i knew i was going to say goodbye to my family for
my safety and theirs i dont want to be the source of their
illness n3another nurse indicatedeven though i take all the precautions needed while caring for a
covid-19 patient theres always this voice at the back of my mind
saying that the virus might have seeped in somewhere    i feel
like its always not enough whatever i am doing it always feels
like i might have contacted the virus and i might spread it to
someone else n6a physician similarly proclaimedthe first few days of serving in the unit i was doing fine but then i
started anxiously checking my vitals    always desperately
looking for any symptoms im showing that might indicated my
affliction as if my mind is always playing tricks on me that i might
be infected and i am not aware of it p1the decision to care for covid-19 patients presented a dilemma among the
interviewed health care providers and brought a sense of frustration between
their duties toward family and obligation to their profession for instance
one of the nurses saidit was a heavy decision at first to isolate myself from the world
and most importantly my family i was torn i could be afflicted i
could even infect my loved ones on the flip side i always have
been dedicated to my patients and didnt want to stop now it was
really hard to tell my family    my husband    my kids    i
was the one to take care of the household cook clean take care of
the children and my husbands needs    it took some time to
reach a consensus but here i am n1also another nurse proclaimedleaving my wife and children at home alone was hard for me
especially that i was the one to make sure everything is set for
them before i leave to work i am a diligent nurse i stand with my
code of ethics however it was the first time i was put in such a
conflicting situation especially that it posed risk for both myself
and my family but they were supportive and i was more than ready to
fulfill my duty n2a physician also shared by sayingbeing a doctor means that you have to deliver optimal care no matter
what    in order to fulfill my obligation i had to talk to other
family members to tend to my mother and father when i told them i
was going to be working with covid-19 patients they freaked out
especially that they were being constantly fed with information
through the tv which they didnt know how to receive    their
reaction was expected but they finally came around    i am doing
my job but sometimes i still get that feeling of guilt that i am
not doing my duty towards them too    to keep them safe and tend
to them p3the participants reported that working in a hospital in the time of the
outbreak gave rise to negative reactions from people at first and when they
knew they were working in the coronavirus unit it was even more
exaggerated one nurse saideven before working in the covid-19 unit my friends and some family
members refused to see me because i might be carrying the virus
when i volunteered the situation got worse especially that i was
quarantined everyone was perceiving me as infected i dont know
how they would receive me after the outbreak    would they still
have the same fear n5another nurse saidat the start of the outbreak i didnt even allow myself to get in
contact with other people especially my old family members like
grandparents they are vulnerable and one never knows    but like
at a certain point my aunt was standing way far from me when i saw
her in the street    she felt like i was infected    treated
me as if i am the virus    it was weird after working in the
covid-19 unit    man it was bad i kept getting whatsapp messages
joking about me being infected with corona n3 p2another physician also had a similar experiencebefore quarantine it was very hard to get a lift    no one
accepted to take me to the hospital they were all concerned and
thought that the area surrounding the hospital is infested and they
would even catch the virus from the air surrounding the hospital
now that i am quarantined for working in the covid-19 unit    my
friends and family do have an inclination to treat me as i am
contagious    it brings frustration and sometimes even anger
really p4the final emergent theme which the participants expressed revolved around the
fact that inaccurate information was circulating among the general public as
well as among health care professionals one nurse saidwe are always bombarded with information through whatsapp and other
social media outlets and you dont know which information is
accurate and which is a rumor we get news about huge numbers of
cases getting transported to the units    other news about
patients being carried on airplanes    we are always on guard and
it works my nerves n7another nurse proclaimedsome pieces of information are being withheld or at least that what
we are hearing across media platforms    that the numbers given
by health officials and government officials are not true    on
the other hand rumors tend to break out that we are receiving
hundreds of cases within hours and we get nervous as of how to deal
with them but they turn out to be fake news    the news
circulates even within the hospital itself n9another nurse highlighted   certain official and needed measures were even subject to
debate    have we closed borders or have we not what are the
measures we need to do by policy    what are we to expect can we
go out or will we be fined    it was all blurry n1a physician also recounted the huge amount of fake news is confusing   
sometimes we get overwhelmed preparing for incoming cases that turn out to
be not true p1in the light of any health emergency health care providers are always at the
forefront putting up their lives for the health of their communities this
personnel especially the ones working in high-risk units are faced with tremendous
psychological challenges let alone the implications being associated potential with
being infected this was prevalent during the sars and then the ebola outbreak
lin et al 2007
lehmann et al
2015 however the covid-19 differs in its geographic and pathogenetic
nature which has infected higher numbers of people in diverse areas of the world and
caused even further panic among the population however health care providers being
at the center of the storm having to risk their health and their families
stability they are expected to deal with heavy psychological stress the results of
this study showed that upon working in the covid-19 and being quarantined due to
exposure health care providers in lebanon started showing symptoms such as severe
stress frustration confliction and anger as a result of separation
stigmatization fear of contracting the coronavirus the clash between the
obligation to family and profession in addition to confusing information and health
policy also a recent study by xu and zhang 2020 had similar findings to this study where nurses were
found to have negative emotional outcomes due to covid-19 and quarantine such as
anxiety depression and fear consistently many nurses have displayed
contradictory responsibilities as public care providers and parents throughout the
sars epidemic however they felt accountable benevolent and proficient yet they
were distressed and were accused of infecting their family members maunder et al 2003
another recent study also found that quarantined health professionals and population
during covid-19 quarantine might lead to anxiety and stress disorders due to fear of
infection and spreading the infection to loved ones frustration inadequate
supplies and information as well as stigmatization of health care providers as
being contagious brooks et al
2020 liu et al
2020 found out that the covid-19 outbreak has exposed possible
vulnerabilities in mental wellbeing programs during crises while also measuring the
effectiveness of health care personnel and health systems duan and zhu 2020 reported the rise in
psychiatric disorders including fear depression and tension during this outbreak
similarly research by nickell
2004 found that nearly 20 of the community experienced mental distress
after sars and the prevalence among nurses in toronto was quite significant
furthermore our results were consistent with khalid et al 2016 which found that
anxiety was prevalent among health care staff during the mers-cov epidemic where
the main sources of stress were fear of infection and transmitting disease to their
familiesthe quarantined health care providers that we have interviewed have expressed a
spectrum of feeling through their lived experience from fear to anger confliction
frustration and anxiety they were first and foremost dedicated to their profession
and to caring for their patients the results of this study showed that health care
personnel are being psychologically challenged through quarantine and need to have
clear health communication from nursing managers leaders and policymakers in
addition proper health communication should be provided to the public so that they
can know the reality of the situation and bypass any misconceptions and
stigmatization moreover moral and financial support should be offered to this
quarantined personnel from governmental and non-governmental health policymakers in
order for them to be able to maintain their health and their families stability
mental health caregivers should raise this issue to health leadership and media in
order to support these professionals in these hard timesin december 2019 a novel coronavirus since named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 emerged in wuhan china 1 causing a respiratory illness that the world health organization has named coronavirus disease covid-19 on january 30 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern 2 by january 31 2020 a total of 192 fatalities and 3215 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in wuhan 8576 additional cases were spread across 300 cities in mainland china and 127 exported cases were reported in 23 countries spanning asia europe oceania and north america the rapid global expansion rising fatalities unknown animal reservoir and evidence of person-to-person transmission potential 34 initially resembled the 2003 sars epidemic and raised concerns about global spreadon january 22 2020 china announced a travel quarantine of wuhan and by january 30 expanded the radius to include 16 cities encompassing a population of 45 million at the time of the quarantine china was already 2 weeks into the 40-day spring festival during which residents and visitors make several billion trips throughout china to celebrate the lunar new year 5 considering the timing of exported covid-2019 cases reported outside of china we estimate that only 895 95 credibility interval cri 2222872 of persons infected in wuhan by january 12 might have had covid-19 confirmed by january 22 by limiting our estimate to infections occurring 10 days before the quarantine we account for an 56-day incubation period and 45 days between symptom onset and case detection appendix 246 the low detection rate coupled with an average lag of 10 days between infection and detection 7 suggest that newly infected persons who traveled out of wuhan just before the quarantine might have remained infectious and undetected in dozens of cities in china for days to weeks moreover these silent importations already might have seeded sustained outbreaks that were not immediately apparentwe estimated the probability of transportation of infectious covid-19 cases from wuhan to cities throughout china before january 23 by using a simple model of exponential growth coupled with a stochastic model of human mobility among 369 cities in china appendix given that 98 of all trips taken during this period were made by train or car our analysis of air rail and road travel data yields more granular risk estimates than possible with air passenger data alone 8by fitting our epidemiologic model to data on the first 19 cases reported outside of china we estimate an epidemic doubling time of 731 days 95 cri 626966 days and a cumulative total of 12400 95 cri 311258465 infections in wuhan by january 22 appendix both estimates are consistent with a similar epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 cases confirmed in wuhan 4 assuming these rates of early epidemic growth we estimate that 130 cities in china have a 50 chance of having a covid-19 case imported from wuhan in the 3 weeks preceding the quarantine figure by january 26 a total of 107 of these 130 high-risk cities had reported cases however 23 had not including 5 cities with importation probabilities 99 and populations 2 million bazhong fushun laibin ziyang and chuxiong under our lower bound estimate of 626 days for the doubling time 190369 cities lie above the 50 threshold for importation our risk assessment identified several cities throughout china likely to be harboring yet undetected cases of covid-19 a week after the quarantine suggesting that early 2020 ground and rail travel seeded cases far beyond the wuhan region under quarantineour conclusions are based on several key assumptions to design our mobility model we used data from tencent httpsheatqqcom a major social media company that hosts applications including wechat 113 billion active users in 2019 and qq 808 million active users in 2019 statista httpswwwstatistacom consequently our model might be demographically biased by the tencent user base further considerable uncertainty regarding the lag between infection and case detection remains our assumption of a 10-day lag is based on early estimates for the incubation period of covid-19 4 and prior estimates of the lag between symptom onset and detection for sars 9 we expect that estimates for the doubling time and incidence of covid-19 will improve as reconstructed linelists and more granular epidemiologic data become available appendix however our key qualitative insights likely are robust to these uncertainties including extensive prequarantine exportations throughout china and far greater case counts in wuhan than those reported before the quarantineborder quarantine procedures are managed by staff from regional offices of taiwan cdc stationed at airports and seaports staff screen all incoming passengers by using no-touch video-recordable infrared thermometers which were installed during the 2003 sars outbreak staff also monitor passengers for specific symptoms provide timely health education and conduct health evaluations including sample collection or testing as needed in addition staff report suspected cases to the centralized database of taiwan cdc and to local health departments for follow-up monitoring or care and refer or transport symptomatic persons to hospitals according to infectious disease regulations when neededbeginning december 31 2019 taiwan cdc implemented enhanced border quarantine measures which included temporary onboard health checks on persons arriving on flights from wuhan as the outbreak spread internationally in late january 2020 taiwan began requiring passengers to manually or electronically complete a health declaration card detailing any symptoms or diseases and travel and contact histories for case investigation or contact tracing if necessary in addition taiwan cdc staff determined the need and gave instructions for self-monitoring or home quarantine depending on current policies and any special situationsthe enhanced border quarantine procedures led to early detection of a suspected case of covid-19 on january 20 a 55-year-old woman reported fever cough and shortness of breath at her airport health screening upon arrival from wuhan she was transported directly to the hospital averting local exposure she reported that she wore a mask and remained in her seat for the duration of the flight the crew and other passengers who had no prolonged direct interaction with her passed the health evaluation at the airport and were directed to complete a 14-day self-monitoring regimen at home during self-monitoring passengers and crew were required to record their temperature twice daily stay home or wear a mask if they had to go out as an extra measure they had to respond to daily telephone checks by infectious disease staffon january 21 the passenger with symptoms was confirmed to have covid-19 the first known imported case in taiwan the same day the united states announced its first case in a 35-year-old man who had returned from wuhan on january 15 and was later admitted to a hospital in washington state on january 19 45with confirmed cases reaching 1400 globally including cases in europe 6 taiwans disease investigation teams worked through the week-long lunar new year holiday beginning on january 24 lunar new years eve all passengers traveling from china hong kong and macau were required to complete a health declaration card and travel history upon arrival in taiwan arriving passengers were given instructions for self-monitoring and a phone number for inquiries or concerns this procedure was later expanded to cover arrivals from all destinations passengers from wuhan and hubei province and persons who had close contact with confirmed cases were mandated to a 14-day home quarantine quarantine involved self-isolation without going out or having visitors recording temperature and symptoms twice daily and if living with others wearing a mask at all times and taking precautions with household membersto support taiwan cdcs surveillance local civil offices were given the contact information of all home-quarantined persons in their jurisdiction local health department personnel or district administrators familiar with the communities conducted daily telephone checks on these home-quarantined persons in their areas persons who were not compliant with home quarantine orders were turned over to law enforcement and tracked by police officers repeat offenders could be fined or confined to designated facilitiesas the number of persons on home isolation in taiwan grew to tens of thousands gps functionality and cameras on personal or government-dispatched smartphones were used for monitoring and case identification recognizing the challenges of the need for seemingly healthy persons to stay home for 2 weeks miss work and school and avoid outside contacts local governments set up quarantine-care centers to provide support and counseling which strengthened the barrier against potential community transmission staff in ppe could conduct home visits arrange meal deliveries and bring essential supplies to persons living alone to help them comply with the quarantine order a 24-hour public epidemic hot line was opened for questions or reporting taiwan cdc upgraded its interactive mobile phone application disease-prevention butler and supplemented it with an artificial intelligence chatbot to provide accurate timely information and gather concerns for analysis and responsegroup tours from taiwan to china were suspended and tours from china and residents of hubei were banned all citizens from china were later banned from entry into taiwan with few exceptions appendix table for groups already in taiwan at the time of border quarantine tour leaders were required to conduct and report daily health checks of their members students enrolled in taiwan colleges or universities who had gone home to china for the winter break and holiday were asked to postpone their return to taiwan for 2 weeks those who arrived early were self-quarantined in separate dormitorieson january 30 who declared a public health emergency of international concern and urged international coordination to investigate and control the spread of covid-19 7 confirmed cases climbed to 7800 globally taiwan had 9 including 1 case of local transmission in a man infected by his wife who returned from wuhan 8other government agencies in taiwan also contributed expertise and increased capacity during the crisis taiwan cecc partnered with civil and law enforcement departments for quarantine monitoring as described in addition the cecc asked the nhi to integrate recent history of travel to china from the database of customs and immigration to supplement the nhis centralized cloud-based health records after customs and immigration data were integrated the nhi system flagged records so medical providers would be aware of patients travel history when they made an appointment or came in later all confirmed and suspected case contacts reported to taiwan cdc also were added to the nhi databasebecause all providers are required to submit claims to the single-payer platform within 24 hours the comprehensive nhi database had nearreal-time information that let clinicians and taiwan cdc track or trace back all doctor visits the nhi patient records included complete health history underlying health conditions and recent progression of symptoms treatments and hospitalization related to respiratory syndrome these data helped pinpoint high-risk patients and persons likely to have had contact with infected cases in addition the nhi database gave taiwan cdc the ability to quickly identify new patterns of symptoms or clustered cases and the source or path of infection the high security and privacy policy of the nhi information technology system permitted data sharing only for purposes of combatting the epidemic and was restricted to 1-way transmission of specific information from other departments to the nhi database no health records or other personal information were available to anyone outside of the health systemthe customs and immigration database also displayed warnings about travel history to wuhan and china within the previous 3 months so border control staff could identify persons who had been to the covid-19 epicenter for additional health screening the ministry of foreign affairs negotiated and coordinated the evacuation of taiwan citizens stranded in wuhan after the city went into lockdown on january 23 9 and later those who were passengers onboard the diamond princess cruise ship docked in quarantine off the coast of japan 10 the ministry of transportation managed charter flight arrangements and the special biohazard cadets from the ministry of defense were called to help disinfect the planes and affected airport areas afterwards repatriated citizens and cruise ship passengers went through health screenings before boarding airplanes and were immediately tested for covid-19 upon arrival in taiwan one person evacuated from wuhan tested positive for the coronavirus and was directly transported to a hospital all others passed a double-negative criterion having 2 negative test results 24 hours apart and went to a government-managed quarantine facility for 14 days where they received check-ups 3 times a day no subsequent cases manifestedafter the 2003 sars outbreak persons in taiwan japan and several other countries in asia began wearing medical face masks during influenza season or in crowded public spaces such as on subways 11 wearing a mask also is considered good practice for persons with a cold and persons with allergies or a weakened immune system are expected to wear a mask 12 therefore many citizens had supplies at home or rushed to acquire masks once the epidemic was announced despite taiwan cdc advising that healthy persons did not need a mask except when visiting hospitals or crowded enclosed placesanticipating a surge in demand taiwans prime minister suspended mask exportation at the end of january news of shortages soon emerged in different parts of the world partially attributed to the delayed and reduced exports from china the largest mask-producing country in the world because dozens of cities in china were on lockdown and demand increased in the country 1314 the taiwan government requisitioned domestically made medical and surgical masks and invested to quickly expand production to accomplish better distribution across the population taiwan introduced a temporary rationing system every residents nhi card which is already linked to thousands of pharmacies and hundreds of local health centers nationwide became their identification to obtain masks in their neighborhood in addition a government-funded mobile phone application mask finder httpsmaskpdisnatgovtw developed through a public-private partnership helped citizens locate supply distribution points and showed updates on availability health promotion messages on indications for wearing a mask and handwashing routine were widely disseminated in all mediastarting in early january 2020 the taiwan cdc laboratory began developing real-time reverse transcription pcr rt-pcr diagnostic protocols by leveraging previous experience sequencing sars and middle east respiratory syndrome coronaviruses china released the full genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus on january 11 and by january 12 the taiwan laboratory team introduced an upgraded 4-hour test kit shortened from the initial 24-hour test the upgraded test had a high sensitivity of 10100 copiesreaction which is comparable to the standard assays recommended by who the laboratory staff continued to accelerate testing speed and capacity developing the ability to test 1100 samplesday by the end of february taiwan was able to test 2450 samplesday by using public and select contracted private laboratoriesin late january 2 strains of the coronavirus were successfully isolated by a university and a government-funded research institute in taiwan research and development of drugs vaccines and a rapid testing kit continued some through public-private or international partnershipsas it became known that persons could have covid-19 and have mild or no symptoms no travel history or no definitive case contact 15 taiwan cdc further widened its testing and reporting criteria to minimize local transmission at the time only 3 cases of local transmission had been identified all contracted from family members with recent travel history to improve case detection on february 12 taiwan cdc conceived a retrospective covid-19 screening scheme the screening encompassed persons who had tested negative for influenza in the previous 14 days but who reported having severe influenza complications were under surveillance for upper respiratory symptoms were part of a cluster of influenza cases or received a diagnosis of pneumonia but did not respond well to treatment using the nhi database the team pinpointed 113 suspected patients 1 of whom case 19 in taiwan tested positive for covid-19 on february 15 and died that evening this discovery triggered the required confirmed-case contact investigation which located and tested dozens of the patients family members and close contacts the patients asymptomatic brother tested positive on the same day and 2 more family members with minor symptoms tested positive in the next 2 days other close contacts tested negative but were stipulated to a 14-day home quarantine and hundreds more possible contacts were put on self-monitoring for 2 weeks the source of infection for case 19 later was identified by using collaborative triangulation of multiple departments databases and disease investigation and traced to a passenger who returned from china without retrospective screening and access to the comprehensive nhi database such cases would have gone undetectedon day 50 of the global epidemic february 18 who reported 75000 cases and 2000 deaths worldwide 16 among the 22 cases confirmed in taiwan local transmissions were limited to 5 primarily between family members despite a credible international report that modeled outbreak dynamics and predicted taiwan would have the second highest case importation outside of china 17 early prevention measures stringent border control and aggressive efforts to combat community spread have continued to be effective as of march 2020with the outlook of covid-19 still unclear health authorities around the world continue to be on high alert since february 2020 the taiwan government and cecc have focused more on detecting and isolating local cases to contain potential local spread while maintaining and updating travel restrictions to limit foreign entry from highly affected areas the experience of sars generated instrumental lessons in disease control measures and policy planning for government agencies and hospitals in taiwan it also improved the publics health behavior and hygiene practices such as increased uptake of influenza and other vaccinations frequent handwashing and use of hand sanitizers and masks 121820 in addition the 2003 sars outbreak had heightened infection transmission awareness and provided better mental preparedness for the new pandemic timely clear communication with the public also has fostered trust and built community capacity for the public to partner with the government in containment and mitigationduring any health crisis a robust health system is crucial to support the surge of medical care and testing needed 21 taiwan has a solid public health medical and insurance infrastructure distributed throughout the country this infrastructure consists of local health departments and centers staffed by healthcare professionals trusted by local residents particularly in the rural areas where private practices are scarce hospitals medical centers and clinics that strongly support a well-coordinated infectious disease network for preparedness and response and a comprehensive nhi that covers 99 of the population with high-quality providers and low out-of-pocket cost the interconnected health system reduces barriers to doctor appointments and follow-up visits which helped capture suspected cases with minor symptoms furthermore the single-payer nhi model affords centralized health records of population-level longitudinal data and the capability of merging information from other government databases this connectivity proved a valuable tool for analysis and case investigation during disease outbreaks including dengue influenza sars and the current covid-19 pandemicinteragency collaboration data sharing and timely mobilization of human capital and resources are equally vital to a response 22 taiwan followed who standards on testing and case definition and shared updated disease information and virus sequences on international health regulations httpswwwwhointihren and other global health platforms with ceccs authority to coordinate works across departments and enlist additional personnel during an emergency taiwan cdc has been capable of handling the growing volume of regular and new tasksin addition the legislature approved emergency funding to ensure disease control efforts did not fall short and to mitigate the economic effects of the outbreak the funding included compensating lost wages for persons working part-time or without paid sick leave during the quarantine compensation also permitted time off for persons with children or elderly family members who were sick or had contact with confirmed cases these incentives modeled after actions taken during the 2003 sars outbreak aided in isolation complianceunlike sars in which patients were only infectious when febrile 23 persons with covid-19 could have no or minimal symptoms remain undiagnosed but contagious and pose a greater threat of local transmissions 24 as the pandemic evolves global cases likely will increase because of community spread expanded laboratory capacity and wider testing criteria the timing locations and policies of travel advisories and entry restrictions in addition to testing and reporting criteria are critical to epidemic control but vary across countries from a public health perspective recognizing the ideal time to institute or terminate these policies and measuring their effectiveness can be challengingtaiwans robust public health and healthcare systems combined with public acceptance of protective policies influenced by the 2003 sars outbreak likely bolstered efficient implementation of policies in the first 50 days of the covid-19 outbreak at the same time taiwans response to covid-19 might have overshadowed other health threats such as seasonal influenza and chronic diseases strategic prioritization of other public health functions and resources and broader government operations will be necessary as the outbreak continues taiwan will need to evaluate associated policy decisions to sustain the systemtaiwan built on lessons learned from sars and some of the successful strategies during the current pandemic could inform policy approaches by other governments in countries that rely heavily on state and local actions intergovernmental and interjurisdictional coordination and adequate funding are needed to assure emergency preparedness and response capacity an integrated approach that incorporates public health human services and healthcare systems can increase resilience and better prepare nations for future eventsthe 20192020 coronavirus disease pandemic is a pandemic started by an outbreak that emerged in late 2019 covid-19 caused by the coronavirus-2 virus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-2 it was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan city chang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 to april 17 2020 there are about 2200000 confirmed cases worldwide csse 2020 this virus in different cities has presented a value of r0 reproductive number of 22 and 35 liu et al 2020 this epidemic has a high rate of spread and a high case fatality rate wang et al 2020to prevent the spread of the virus governments have imposed travel restrictions confinements event cancellations and the closure of establishments and quarantines as described in zhu et al 2020 these restrictive measures have focused mainly on trying to flatten the epidemic curve tobias 2020in this article a systems dynamics model has been developed this methodology is widely known to model and simulate epidemics such as ebola mers and other infectious diseases sds 2020 with this model different quarantine periods were simulated and evaluated and it was possible to see the effectiveness in reducing contacts and deathsthe stock and flows diagram for the covid-19 epidemic is presented in fig 1
 the model was elaborated with the systems dynamics methodology following to sterman 2000 and is composed of four stock variables the susceptible infected recovered and deaths similarly piecewise functions were included to represent the different quarantine scenarios the model also presents auxiliary variables and parameters that were constructed from bibliographic references or some estimated as shown in the table 1
 for the simulation of the model a time limit of 150 days was taken into account and the integration method was the rk-4 established in the vensim ple software see table 2 table 3
from the stock and flows diagram it is possible to obtain the mathematical model complete model and notation in appendix 1 that represents the studied problem as shown below1dsdtciit

the simulation without any type of intervention scenario 0 is presented in fig 2
 where the typical behavior of an epidemic is presented here we start with a daily contact rate of 70 contactsperson and an infectivity rate of 0025 for an r0  25 table 1 shows the initial conditions of the modelscenario a is when only an extended lockdown or quarantine is considered and it is want to try to decrease the contagion curve this could be useful when the local economy is durable and can withstand a long period of confinementscenario b considers two short lockdowns and a smart lockdown between them that is after the end of the first lockdown another period of equal duration is left where activities are resumed but guaranteeing a reduction in daily contacts of at least 50scenario c represents a first medium lockdown of 40 days is implemented then a 40-day smart lockdown is opened guaranteeing in this a limit of contacts of up to 40 of the contacts in ordinary lifefor all initial quarantines isolation effectiveness of 90 was considered that is they reduce contacts by this percentageonce the lockdown scenarios were over a contact restriction of 50 was maintained to prevent future infection so that it can gradually return to normal activities
fig 3
shows the comparison of the behavior of the infected with the different quarantines or lockdowns implemented suddenly it could be said that the three types of quarantine proposed are effective in reducing infected concerning the scenario in which there is no quarantine however scenario b and scenario c may be the best strategies in which the infected do not collapse hospital capacity fig 4
shows the comparison of the number of deaths that could have in the four proposed scenariosa lockdown to prevent the increase of covid infection must be evaluated for well-defined contexts it is different from doing a lockdown in wuhan than buenos aires or bogot or madrid each city has different characteristics such as the population economy transport and health systems this changes the levels of contact that a person can have daily however it is also necessary to evaluate the lockdown for intermediate and small cities since their economic models could have damages that are almost impossible to repairlockdowns are essential to save time and strengthen health systems that can become overloaded the actual contagion data is limited and short so it is necessary to prospectively evaluate each measure that public health authorities and governments wish to implementsystems dynamics models seek to guide the understanding of trends behavior under policies or strategies that are implemented knowing their structure and the relationships that exist are not predictive modelsthrough modeling with systems dynamics successful representation of the coronavirus outbreak was created for a population of 100000 inhabitants the mathematical model has a general structure like that of the sird model presented by fanelli and piazza 2020 however due to the flexibility of the methodology the effects of implemented quarantines have been modeled whether they are long quarantines double quarantines smart or combined quarantinesthe recommendation according to the simulations is to carry out an extended initial lockdown and then gradually return to activities controlling social contacts so that at the end of this period should only be a maximum of 40 of the contacts they had before the quarantinequarantine duration times should be very cautious as they could shift the contagion curve over time and generate a spike with a delay time
danny ibarra-vega writing- original draftthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperprevious articles have described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of coronavirus disease covid-19 16 these mainly reported on early cases diagnosed in hubei province particularly in wuhan the limitations imposed by non-optimal medical conditions at that time had some impact on the outcomes and treatment of covid-19 differences have been noted in the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed inside and outside hubei province 1 one article reported on the early clinical characteristics of 13 covid-19 patients outside hubei province however the number of patients was small and the article only described the early clinical characteristics 7 liaocheng city in the middle east region of china is a prefecture-level city located in shandong province with a population of more than 6 million as a region outside hubei province what are the similarities and differences between the characteristics of the cases diagnosed here and those diagnosed in hubei province and even other countries and regions also are there any special characteristics of patients who cannot be released from quarantine for a long period these are a few of the questions that need to be answered this study thus aimed to identify additional characteristics and features of covid-19 by assessing the clinical courses of covid-19 patients in a region outside hubei provincepatient diagnosis release from quarantine and disease severity among all cases were determined according to the protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia issued by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china and the national administration of traditional chinese medicine 8 9 a confirmed case was defined by a positive result to real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens 2the criteria for release from quarantine for all cases were as recommended in the above protocol starting with the following three 1 body temperature returns to normal for more than 3 days 2 respiratory symptoms improve significantly and 3 pulmonary imaging shows significant absorption of acute exudative lesions based on these criteria quarantined persons could be released if strictly negative nucleic acid test results were obtained after 5 days in the hospital and in tests performed every 2 days individuals for whom nucleic acid tests yielded negative results when instead tested every 24 h could be released from quarantine if three consecutive test results are negative during the dynamic test if cases for whom nucleic acid test results were negative showed positive results the above steps were restarted some patients were kept in the hospital for 14 days after they were released from quarantinesevere cases were identified in accordance with the respiratory criteria excluding those who did not meet the respiratory criteria and required intensive care 10one of the 38 patients a 5-month-old child identified by screening and released from quarantine after 9 days in hospital was excluded from the analysis the other 37 patients were all adults regarding the incubation period and considering the characteristics of the patients in this study it was difficult to tell the precise time of first infection with sars-cov-2 therefore this was not discussedthe present study retrospectively analyzed the general characteristics epidemiological history chronic underlying diseases clinical symptoms complications chest computed tomography ct findings biochemical features disease severity treatment plans and outcomes of 37 patients the results of examinations were reported at study time nodes of 24 h in addition these patients were divided into the 20-day group and 20-day group according to the duration of release from quarantine we compared the similarities and differences between the two groups in the clinical process to identify relevant factors among patients who continued to test positive for nucleic acidcontinuous variables are expressed as means and standard deviations or as medians and interquartile ranges iqrs as appropriate categorical variables are summarized as counts and percentages in each category continuous variables were analyzed using the t-test or wilcoxon rank-sum test as appropriate categorical variables were analyzed

duration from symptom onset to admission ranged from 1 to 10 days among the 37 patients with confirmed disease the shortest length of stay was 7 days and the longest was 32 days the shortest duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine was 8 days and the longest was 34 days the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine was 29 days for one patient with severe disease and 11 days for one critically ill patientaccording to the pneumonia severity index psi on admission 892 17  1637 of patients were classified as at the low risk grades i and ii regarding epidemiological history all of the six patients initially diagnosed had a history of sojourn in wuhan and patients diagnosed subsequently had mainly been in contact with the confirmed cases or their workplaces a high proportion of patients had symptoms on admission including cough fever shortness of breath fatigue sore throat vomiting or diarrhea and 870 of the patients had a low fever no abnormalities in platelets and levels of creatine kinase or creatinine were observed on routine blood biochemistry tests performed on admission table 1 during treatment two patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome ards mild n  1 moderate n  1 11 and received high-flow nasal cannula hfnc oxygen therapy without non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation critically ill patients with moderate ards underwent plasma exchange no patient experienced serious complications such as shock kidney injury pulmonary embolism or diffuse intravascular coagulation regarding treatment one critically ill patient received an antifungal drug and all patients received two or more antiviral drugs the order of the rates of application of other therapeutic measures descending was as follows thymosin oxygen therapy albumin hormone and immunoglobulin a 100 percent of patients received traditional chinese medicine tcm including chinese medicine preparations acupuncture and moxibustion table 2patients in the 20-day group were older and had a longer duration from onset to hospitalization p  005 regarding the clinical symptoms on admission all of the seven asymptomatic patients belonged to the 20-day group the rates of the symptoms of fatigue sore throat and shortness of breath were higher in the 20-day group table 1 these patients were more frequently treated with albumin and thymus peptide table 2 and had longer hospital stays table 3there was no significant improvement in granulocyte counts at the time of release from quarantine compared to the time of admission table 4although the small number of cases included in this study affected the statistical analysis of some of the variables many important characteristics were noteda majority of the 37 patients had mild and moderate disease with only one severe case and one critically ill case all patients were finally released from quarantine without death and the clinical outcome was significantly better than that observed in hubei province 1 5 6 12 the main reasons for this may be that the patients had relatively mild disease and that the availability of adequate medical facilities and personnel made the patients less likely to experience severe or critical conditions after hospitalization all patients were stratified according to psi which may be a better strategy to improve the outcome of covid-19 patients particularly in an outbreak when medical resources are relatively insufficient 13 although the proportion of patients with chronic underlying diseases in this group was 216 it did not seriously affect the outcome since most of the patients were about 44 years old according to the epidemiological histories some of the patients in this study had been in direct contact with patients with confirmed disease some worked at the same workplace and did not meet the conceptual standard of close contact which suggested the existence of a transmission route of covid-19 via aerosol among these patients asymptomatic patients constituted 189 of all patients in some patients a chest ct scan still revealed pneumonia and decreased white blood cell and lymphocyte counts among the first few symptoms recorded on admission the rate of shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms was high which did not exclude the influence of psychological factors in addition the proportion of patients with fever was not high and the rate of fever was low these characteristics were different from those of other highly infectious viral respiratory infections 14 15 among the variables assessed on routine blood biochemistry tests on admission the most common was a reduction in the lymphocyte count in nearly half of these patients the lymphocyte count was 06  109l white blood cell counts were mostly normal less than a third of patients had lower white blood cell counts other abnormalities with relatively high proportions were the levels of esr albumin saa and crp however most of the changes were slight and less specific thus a decrease in lymphocyte count may be the most important feature in routine biochemical tests 1 6 changes in chest ct scans observed in this group were similar to those observed in other covid-19 studies and were significantly different from the characteristics of h1n1 pneumonia 16treatment measures instituted among the patients in this group were mainly performed in accordance with the protocol 8 9 although the patients mainly had mild and moderate conditions their treatment was complicated due to the particularity of the epidemic 17 18 two-thirds of the patients were given antibiotics although there was not sufficient evidence of bacterial infection although no specific antiviral drugs were recommended the patients in this group were given antiviral drugs routinely two-thirds were given two antiviral drugs and one-third were given three antiviral drugs the effects of thymosin glucocorticoid albumin and immunoglobulin on covid-19 need to be investigated further particularly in patients with mild and moderate disease many studies have demonstrated the important role of tcm in inhibiting coronavirus 1921although the patients in this study mainly had mild and moderate disease there were significant differences in the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine the most important basis for release from quarantine is the persistence of negative nucleic acid test results thus the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine reflects the time it takes for the virus to be released from the respiratory tract of the patient the average time from the onset of symptoms to release from quarantine was 20 days patients could only be released from quarantine after three consecutive negative nucleic acid test results tests could be performed at 24-h intervals and the incubation period reported in previous literature was considered 1 thus the average duration of virus release in this study should be similar to that reported by zhou et al 22some items in the 20-day and 20-day groups were significantly different which may explain why the patients could not be released from quarantine for a long time patients in the 20-day group were older and the time from onset to admission was longer suggesting that although there was no specific antiviral drug for covid-19 systematic supportive treatment administered after admission could improve outcomes even among patients with mild and moderate disease there were no differences in psi score underlying chronic disease or epidemiological history on admission between the two groups possibly due to the small number of cases or mild illness regarding symptoms reported on admission seven asymptomatic patients screened recovered quickly which may be related to the viral load and individual differences among symptomatic patients fatigue and pharyngeal pain were more obvious among patients in the 20-day group for unknown reasons in terms of routine blood biochemical examination and pulmonary imaging although the proportions of individual abnormal indicators in the 20-day group were higher than those in the 20-day group the number of samples was not large enough to yield sufficient clinical significance there was no significant difference in the number of patients between the two groups which was related to the fact that almost all the patients had mild and moderate diseases while one critically ill patient was quickly released from quarantine these clinical results may suggest that there is a cross relationship between sustained positive test results for nucleic acid to sars-cov-2 observed in respiratory tract specimens and the severity of the disease 1 22 23 however it was not a linear relationship and the reasons for the sustained positive nucleic acid test results are complex the 20-day group received more drugs which may be related to eagerness to ensure that negative nucleic acid test results were obtainedthere was no significant improvement in the white blood cell and lymphocyte counts at the time of release from quarantine and at the time of admission in either the 20 or 20-day groups the reasons need to be studied furtherthis study had certain limitations first the number of cases in this study was not large it had obvious regional characteristics and the majority of patients had mild and moderate diseases which cannot represent the characteristics of a large number of patients in a large geographical range the study was also not representative of patients with severe and critical conditions nevertheless this study can still provide a reference and help in the prevention and control of covid-19 in other comparable smaller-sized outbreaksmost cases of covid-19 recorded in liaocheng city were mild and moderate the main source of infection was exposure to a patient with confirmed disease or to the workplace of a patient with confirmed disease the main clinical symptoms were cough fever and fatigue however shortness of breath sore throat and gastrointestinal symptoms were also common a chest ct scan showing features of pneumonia and a reduced lymphocyte count were the most important adjunctive examination findings the duration between symptom onset and release from quarantine was related to age the length of time from onset to admission and the presence or absence of symptoms and was not related to the mildness or normality of the type there was no significant improvement in white blood cell and lymphocyte counts at the time of release from quarantine compared to the time of admissionwith the permission of the corresponding author we can provide participant data for further statistical analysisthe study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the declaration of

accordance with article 5 of the quarantine law south korea has been carrying out quarantine management by designating countries with infectious diseases as quarantine inspection required areas to prevent the inflow and spread of new infectious diseases from overseas anyone who enters south korea from a country designated as a quarantine inspection required area is obligated to complete a mandatory health status questionnaire at the point of entry this is followed by quarantine officers assessing for symptoms of a fever in addition to a cough sore throat and dyspnoea based on the answers given in the health status questionnaire quarantine investigations are subsequently conducted for symptomatic individuals 1 further epidemiological investigations are conducted on symptomatic individuals and if diagnostic tests are needed samples are collected and diagnostic tests are conducted in the quarantine laboratory 2following the mass outbreak of pneumonia with unknown cause in january 2020 in wuhan hubei province of china south korea designated it a new infectious disease on january 8th in accordance with the quarantine law the quarantine policy was reinforced for people entering south korea by designating wuhan city as a quarantine inspection required area 3covid-19 was reported as a novel coronavirus the source of infection and pattern of transmission were unknown moreover the rate of transmission and pathogenicity of the virus had not been identified at the time 4 therefore in accordance with the quarantine act south korea strengthened quarantine measures by designating countries with a high prevalence of localized covid-19 as quarantine inspection required areas special immigration procedures were also established and implemented to strengthen quarantine management of individuals from such countriesthis article presents the quarantine system used in south korea which seeks to prevent infectious diseases at the point of entry it links the quarantine system with the infectious disease management system in the community to prevent the influx and spread of covid-19 furthermore this study aimed to elucidate the strengthened and flexible quarantine measures in south korea for people entering the country according to the degree of risk determined by the prevalence of covid-19 in the country from which the individual departed fromthis study utilized the computerized quarantine management system of the integrated health care and disease management system at the korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc to investigate the number of people entering the country via aviation there were 7631 between january 3rd and april 9th cases from overseas presenting with symptoms of a fever and respiratory infection at the point of entry into the country they underwent diagnostic tests in quarantine where epidemiological investigations began there were 352 patients who were confirmed covid-19 positive based on diagnostic tests and were categorized as overseas cases of covid-19 in addition 517 patients who were confirmed to be covid-19 positive based on diagnostic tests after presenting with symptoms in the community and who had an overseas travel history confirmed using epidemiological investigations were also categorized as overseas cases of covid-19based on passenger information from the airlines the smart quarantine information system links information and communication technologies using the roaming records of mobile carrier companies the passport information system of the ministry of foreign affairs the immigration records management system of the ministry of justice and the health insurance review and assessment service which is a health institution for the local community the information of individuals from quarantine inspection required areas could be confirmed and passed onto local medical institutions medical facilities and hospitals during covid-19 monitoring periods figure 1to check the overseas travel history of people entering south korea who presented to medical institutions with symptoms of covid-19 it was necessary to determine whether they had visited countries with a prevalence of covid-19 there were 3 stages where this occurred reception treatment and prescription the centers for disease control and prevention used the qualification inquiry systems of the national health insurance corporation the drug safety utilization review of health insurance review and assessment service and international traveler information system and shared immigration information of all individuals entering south korea including korean citizens and foreign nationals with medical institutions during covid-19 monitoring periods figure 1immigration information for individuals from wuhan city was collected in early january in the wake of the worldwide outbreak of covid-19 by the end of january this was subsequently extended to all people entering south korea from mainland china as covid-19 appeared to spread throughout china and neighboring countries additional immigration information on people entering south korea from hong kong macau singapore thailand vietnam japan taiwan and malaysia were provided to medical facilities in early march the number of covid-19 patients in europe increased and immigration information on those individuals who entered south korea from italy iran france germany spain the uk and the netherlands was also provided to the medical facilities since march 18th as the outbreak of covid-19 spread across the world immigration information on all people entering south korea from overseas was provided to community medical facilities table 1 the monitoring period for covid-19 was 14 days during which information on overseas travel history was provided to local medical facilities however since there were newly confirmed positive cases after the 14-day period immigration records were provided to local medical facilities for 21 days post-entry to south korea to allow for facilities to refer to this information during treatment of patients with covid-19the kcdc designated mainland china the first country that reported an outbreak of covid-19 as a quarantine inspection required area on january 28th and reinforced quarantine measures for people entering south korea who had departed from china considering the increased risks such as the number of confirmed covid-19 cases exceeding 10000 in china february 1st 5 special immigration procedures were implemented for individuals traveling from china after february 4thmoreover following the spread of covid-19 to europe and with more than 10000 confirmed cases worldwide the kcdc implemented special immigration procedures from march 15th for 5 european countries uk germany france switzerland and the netherlands which had direct flights to south korea as the risk of spread of infection from europe increased the prevalence of confirmed cases in europe exceeded china on march 19th and with more than 100 european patients with confirmed covid-19 targeting of all travelers from europe began on march 22nd after 10 days of conducting diagnostic tests for covid-19 on all people entering south korea from europe the total number of confirmed cases reached 202 from april 1st to 9th the number of confirmed cases from overseas decreased to 89 confirmed casesconsidering the rapidly increasing number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in the united states the kcdc conducted a 14-day self-quarantine measure for all people entering south korea from the united states from march 27th of the 869 people classified as covid-19 overseas cases 313 360 traveled from the united states and the number of confirmed overseas cases per 10000 people entering south korea was 45 in the second week of march and 412 in the third week with an increase 109 patients in the last week of march followed by a decrease 951 patients in the first week of april figure 2there was a total of 869 confirmed covid-19 cases from overseas between the 20th january and the 9th april in south korea the patients with confirmed covid-19 arrived from europe 410 cases the united states 313 cases the philippines 38 cases thailand 22 cases china 16 cases indonesia 15 cases and canada 11 casesof the 639 confirmed cases of covid-19 cases that occurred between the second and fourth week of march 333 patients 521 were people entering south korea from europe followed by 216 confirmed cases from the united statesthe number of overseas cases decreased in the first week of april 191 cases compared to the fourth week of march 343 cases however the risk associated with travelers from the united states was considered to be high as the majority of overseas cases arrived from the united states 104 cases compared to europe 58 cases table 2in particular the number of confirmed covid-19 patients from overseas per 10000 immigrants from europe exponentially increased with 498 patients in the second week of march 13th19th 1413 in the third week of march 20th26th  and 1858 in the fourth week of march 27th2nd april from the last week of march during which diagnostic examinations and quarantine measures for all immigrants from europe began until the first week of april 3rd9th the number of confirmed cases decreased to 1271 moreover the number of confirmed covid-19 patients per 10000 people entering south korea from the united states increased from the second week of march 45 cases through the third 412 cases and fourth weeks of march 1090 cases this continued until march 27th following the quarantine measures targeting all people entering south korea from the united states were implemented the number of cases decreased to 951 confirmed cases in the first week of april from the fourth week of march the number of confirmed cases from asian regions such as the philippines indonesia and japan showed an increasing trend per 10000 people entering south korea table 2following the report of a mass outbreak of pneumonia with unknown cause in wuhan city in january 2020 6 the kcdc designated wuhan city as a quarantine inspection required area january 8th 2020 to prevent the spread of infection into the country the quarantine measures for symptomatic patients were strengthened by checking the body temperature of all people entering south korea and requiring individuals from wuhan city to complete a health status questionnaireon march 11th 2020 the world health organization characterized covid-19 as a pandemic special entry procedures for immigrants from china was enforced between february 4th and march 19th to prevent the spread of the infection into the country the special immigration procedures included a process whereby an individual was only allowed to enter the country after installing a self-health check app on their mobile phone which required them to report their symptoms such as a fever or cough every day for 14 days when symptoms were registered using the app a dedicated team was notified to guide the user to medical facilities for examination andor treatment this helped improve the management of the infectious disease within the community by enabling a rapid diagnosis and quarantine treatment of the suspected covid-19 patient who exhibited symptoms such as fever and cough who previously had been asymptomatic due to the incubation period of covid-19 upon entry into the countrysince the outbreak of mers in korea in 2015 the kcdc established and implemented the smart quarantine information system to promptly manage the spread of infectious diseases that may be brought into the country from overseas this was facilitated by linking the quarantine process at the border entry point with the management of infectious diseases within the community the kcdc used the smart quarantine information system to provide information to all medical institutions regarding individuals from overseas who have come into contact with a patient confirmed to have covid-19 and individuals who had covid-19 but no longer required isolation such information was provided to medical facilities in the local community using the drug safety utilization review of health insurance review and assessment service and the international traveler information system so that facilities could confirm overseas travel history upon patient presentation figure 1 by confirming whether the patient had been exposed to covid-19 infection during reception treatment and prescription medical facilities were able to refer to this information during treatment and promptly classify suspected patients to minimize contact with other individuals thereby effectively managing covid-19 in the local communitythe kcdc applied various levels of quarantine measures including the designation of quarantine inspection required areas and the implementation of special immigration procedures considering the covid-19 pandemic and the status of people traveling from overseas to south korea in january 2020 the degree of risk of spread of infection from china which accounted for more than 90 of covid-19 patients worldwide was assessed as high 7 accordingly the quarantine inspection required area was expanded from wuhan city to the entirety of mainland china on january 28th and the quarantine was strengthened for these people entering south korea who departed from china furthermore considering that the number of covid-19 patients exceeded 10000 in china and that numerous exchanges occur between korea and china a special entry procedure was implemented from february 4th in addition the risk of covid-19 was assessed as considerably high in areas where more than 10000 cases of covid-19 were reported therefore the special immigration procedure was also applied for people entering south korea who departed from italy moreover it was essential to consider both direct and multi-stop flights entering korea where multiple destinations in europe may have been visited accordingly the special immigration procedure was expanded from 5 european countries to all european countries in mid-march the enforcement of the quarantine management policy to people from overseas entering south korea was a systematic and flexible quarantine management reinforcement measure taking into consideration the covid-19 infection rate overseas and the level of risk of spread of infection into korea figure 2 during this process there were 7631 diagnostic tests for covid-19 performed between the 3rd january and the 9th april conducted at immigration on symptomatic individuals with confirmed fever and respiratory symptoms during the quarantine procedure into the country as a result by april 9th 352 individuals were diagnosed as covid-19 positive and were transferred to isolation treatment beds this accounted for 46 of symptomatic patients who were diagnosed with covid-19 at point of entry into the countrythe kcdc established the quarantine policy by determining the target and timing of quarantine measures as well as the degree of the quarantine measures this was performed by referring to risk assessments that reflected the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in people entering the country from overseas per 10000 entering the country and the quarantine management performed on individuals entering south korea from countries with a high prevalence of covid-19 for europe there were 498 confirmed cases per 10000 people entering south korea from overseas in the second week of march showing an increasing trend therefore diagnostic tests and imposed self-quarantine were conducted after march 22nd for all people entering south korea who had departed from europe moreover the number of confirmed cases from the united states showed an increase from the third week of march 412 cases therefore all people entering south korea from march 27th from the united states were required to self-quarantine as the total number of confirmed cases from overseas had increased over the third 370 cases and fourth weeks of march 677 cases self-quarantine measures were implemented from april 1st for all people entering south korea worldwide as a result the number of confirmed cases from overseas per 10000 people entering south korea decreased for europe from 1858 to 1271 cases and the united states from 1090 to 951 cases in the first week of april compared with the fourth week of march table 2 consequently the total number of confirmed cases from overseas per 10000 people entering south korea also appeared to decrease therefore the degree of risk from the covid-19 pandemic appeared to show a downward trendhowever of the total number of confirmed cases from overseas the proportion of cases from europe decreased steadily over the second 721 third 548 and fourth weeks of march 463 during this period of the total number of confirmed cases from overseas the proportion of the cases from the united states continued to increase over the second 103 third 320 and fourth week of march 396 in particular the proportion of cases from the united states accounted for 550 of the total number of confirmed cases from overseas in the first week of april which was higher than that of europe 307 although the number of confirmed cases from overseas was decreasing the risk of cases from the united states appeared to be increasing considering the proportion of confirmed cases from the united states of the total number of overseas confirmed cases table 2there are currently 869 cases of covid-19 from overseas as of the 9th april in south korea of which 352 cases 405 were identified at the point of entry into the country and 517 cases 595 were confirmed during imposed self-quarantine within the community the results of this study are an outcome of improving the quarantine information systems and the quarantine and epidemiological investigation methods at the point of entry at the countrys border and quarantine sites following the 2015 mers outbreak in korea it is also considered to be the outcome of expanding the quarantine infrastructure such as conducting diagnostic tests at the point of entry and establishing isolation monitoring facilities in addition to establishing and operating a multi-layered quarantine system to link the prevention of infectious diseases at the quarantine stage upon entry into south korea with the infectious disease management system in the community since the covid-19 pandemic the kcdc has been closely monitoring the overseas trends of covid-19 to prevent spread of the disease into south korea and into the local communities furthermore the kcdc plans to continue to operate a flexible quarantine system based on the degree of risk in other countriessars outbreak took place in 2002 in china and infected 8422 people globally4 the total number of deaths was 916 globally4 as of march 31 2020 the sars-cov-2 has infected over a million and has caused more than 50000 deaths2 one reason why its spread is evidently much wider as compared to sars is the rapid urbanization and the increase in international travel during the last two decades hence the control measures applied at the time of sars are no longer adequate in these days and more vigorous actions are required to control sars-cov-25 another reason is related to a difference in the infectious period between patients infected with sars and those infected with sars-cov-2 while in the former case viral shedding peaks only when the patients illness is advanced and respiratory symptoms occur5 for sars-cov-2 transmission can occur in the early phase of the illness when the patients are completely asymptomatic67 hence isolation after the onset of symptoms might be ineffective in preventing virus transmission and this also makes temperature screening less effective8 finally sars-cov-2 has been proven to hold higher transmissibility and wider community spread than other betacoronaviridae5 despite being highly infectious and having higher transmissibility the severity of sars-cov-2 is much lesser compared to sars5statistical models on the spread of sars-cov-2 suggested that due to lack of herd immunity in the population and the highly contagious nature of the virus 40-70 of the population can be infected unless strong containment measures are timely taken9 based on the past experience with different epidemics and pandemics as well as the current understanding of sars-cov-2 the who suggested frequent hand washing with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water avoiding touching eyes nose and mouth and practicing respiratory hygiene2 the use of face masks by everyone is still controversial though who does not recommend its use by everyone2coronavirus can survive on different surfaces for a long time  plastic 72 hours stainless steel 48 hours cardboard 24 hours and copper 4 hours1011 as regard to contact spreading the virus can be effectively inactivated by surface disinfection with 70 isopropyl alcohol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite1011 hence thorough cleaning with disinfecting solutions in health facilities and public places is warranted health care facilities are advised to use personal protective equipment ppe with triple-layered masks or n95 masks and to educate the staff about the proper disposal of the equipment2 respiratory precautions during aerosol-generating procedures are also recommended2 anyone with fever cough and difficulty in breathing is advised to seek medical attention2 social distancing minimum one meter is recommended both at individual and community levels2at the community level the most important measures for reducing infection spread rely on case detection isolation and contact tracing of positive cases followed by quarantine for those exposed other strategies include the closure of places of mass gathering like schools libraries places of worship malls and cinemas and the suspension of all social events as sports celebrations and meetings temperature screening has been introduced at airports railway stations and bus stations as well as the entrance of the main community buildings like hospitals banks or law courts the limitation of temperature screening is that it misses a significant number of asymptomatic carries which has been estimated at around 468 in countries with a worse rate of infection more restrictive measures have been put in place like travel bans reduction or interruption of both internal and overseas flights and boundary closure curfew and lockdown are also implementedall the aforementioned measures aim at reducing the rate of infection transmission thus delaying the timing and lowering the height of the epidemic peak these allow from one side gaining time for the healthcare system to prepare an efficient response to the pandemic and from the other side the development of potential new treatments and vaccines in wuhan it has been calculated that physical distancing with a staggered return to work at the beginning of april instead of march was the most effective strategy with a projected reduction of the median number of infections by 92 interquartile range iqr 66-97 and 24 iqr 13-90 in mid-2020 and end-2020 respectively12a range of strategies has been adopted worldwide based on the population structure as well as the health care infrastructure of each country one of the problems that have been faced is the delay in the implementation of measures a model simulation by lai shengjie and andrew tatem predicted that if china had implemented control measures a week earlier 67 of all cases could have been prevented if implementation had been done at the beginning of january it would have cut infection rate to 513 the events in wuhan show that for at least three weeks after the first cases were reported city authorities had been informed about the virus spreading but they issued orders to suppress the news for instance on january 18th roughly six weeks after coronavirus started to spread in wuhan they allowed the citys baibuting district to organize its traditional annual mass banquet of the 40000 families attending more than 28000 got infected and more than 560 succumbed to the virus in the later weeks just a few days later more than 5 million people had traveled out of wuhan for the upcoming spring festival just before wuhan imposed lockdown thus spreading covid-19 across other provinces of china and abroad the elevated connectivity of wuhan with other international airports such as singapore japan and thailand facilitated the rapid spread to bordering countries1415on january 23rd a 3-week lockdown was ordered to the entire hubei province along with some major cities like beijing and shanghai16 outdoor activities were limited with each citizen being permitted to go out for 30 minutes only on every second day17 all transports in and out of the city were prohibited mobile-phone data location from chinese internet giant baidu was used to track peoples moments as well as person to person contacts18 in wuhan where the infection rate was the highest residents were required to measure and report their temperature daily the mild and asymptomatic cases were quarantined in fangcang hospital as well as in public spaces such as stadiums and conference centers which have been repurposed for medical care19 a 1000-bedded hospital was built in a matter of 10 days to take care of patients with coronavirusthanks to all these measures a decline in the number of infected growth rate and an increase in its doubling time from 2 to 4 days was eventually achieved the median daily reproduction number declined from 235 of january 16 to 105 of january 3020 tian et al estimated that the wuhan shutdown slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by 291 days 95ci 254-329 delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in china21 other chinese cities that early implemented preventive control measures reported 333 fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later21 the correlation between domestic air traffic and covid-19 spread became weaker following lockdown17 nevertheless a study from italy china and the united states found that the wuhan travel quarantine delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland china but had a greater effect at the international scale where case export was reduced by nearly 8022 however with all these measures china prevented cases from increasing by 67-fold ie without these measures there would have been 8 million cases by the end of february13 however replicating the chinese model elsewhere turned out to be extremely challenging as the measures implemented in wuhan and the entire hubei province of china far exceeded the classical definition of local confinement lockdown and isolation fig 217some of the other countries were successful in flattening the curve including singapore taiwan hong kong and south korea one of the key factors in the success of these countries was continuous testing isolation of infected and quarantining of contacts in singapore temperature screening at the airport of all travelers arriving from wuhan was started on january 3rd even before identification of sars-cov-2 sequence aggressive contact tracing and quarantine of contacts of confirmed cases travel advisories and entry restrictions on people who had traveled to china in the preceding 14 days were implemented at a community level people were encouraged to work from home and to record their temperature twice a day to make quarantine less onerous the government offered self-employed people sgd  100 per day respiratory and hand hygiene and social distancing were followed rigorously23temperature checking in all clinics and provision and use of ppe by medical staff were ordered as compulsory strict visitor controls cohorting of patients with pneumonia or respiratory infection and restriction of movement of patients and doctors between different healthcare institutions were also set up to prevent disease spread across multiple institutions a network of 800 public health preparedness clinics phpcs was activated to enhance the management of respiratory infections in primary care settings all pneumonia cases severely-ill patients in intensive care units deceased people with a possible infectious cause and influenza-like illness ili in primary care clinics were tested1624since february 7 2020 the country has been in disease outbreak response system condition dorscon orange the second-highest alert signifying more relaxed measures of containment25 besides singapore also taiwan and hong kong were found well prepared before the outbreak thus making a rapid and vigorous response to the first cases closure of places of mass gathering travel restrictions and case detection isolation and contact reducing quarantine of exposed were widely practiced in south korea authorities called for voluntary social distancing and isolation apart from this testing was scaled up aggressively nearly 18000 per day and contact tracing was done through cctv and credit card transactions the general community was also encouraged to inform about infected people16in contrast countries in europe like italy spain the united kingdom and the united states delayed implementing containment measures and failed in anticipating the impact of the pandemic in their own boundaries italy has recorded the highest number of deaths globally2 before the outbreak was detected the virus had been circulating into the country for at least 4 weeks in just a matter of weeks february 21 to march 22 2020 italy went from the discovery of the first official covid-19 case to a state of complete lockdown26 within this brief period the impact on the country was nothing short of a tsunami the health care system was literally overwhelmed with new pneumonia cases with a considerable number of them in critical conditions in the red zone ie the regions of lombardia and veneto the most hit by the pandemic the situation had become so grim that the risk of treating only those with a better prognosis younger and healthier population to the detriment of older people became almost reality27 the shortage of hospital beds ventilators and health professionals became a concrete threat health professionals from different disciplines including ophthalmology were converted to covid-19 patient care and who came in contact with sars-cov-2 patients were encouraged to work until they show symptoms28at the social community level there was a delay in the implementation of restrictive measures the lockdown started with places of mass gathering but restaurants and bars were left open for one more week and travel within and outside italy were not restricted a total lockdown was imposed in northern italy the red zone but not in central and southern italy concurrently only on march 10 national lockdown was proclaimed this led to the movement of cases to southern italy and subsequently spreading the infection across the entire country26 one other fact facilitating the diffusion of the virus and the lack of homogeneity in the national response is that the italian health system is decentralized and different regions tried varying policy responses most notably lombardy and veneto two neighboring regions with a similar socioeconomic profile and number of cases tried two different approaches26 veneto tested extensively both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and proactively traced the potential positive cases if someone tested positive everyone in the family as well as neighbors were tested and if testing kits were unavailable they were asked to self-quarantine whenever possible samples were collected directly from home and processed in the laboratory in contrast lombardy conducted only half of the tests done in veneto and focused more on symptomatic cases there was a limited investment in proactive tracing home care and monitoring and protecting healthcare workers recently the epidemic curve flattened and the number of new cases and deaths stabilized started decreasing only when enormous measures of containment were accomplished social media campaigns movement tracing by the police and closure of all non-essential activities were finally working on the other hand conversion of public places and existing hospitals into intensive care units contributed to the reduction of the fatality ratealthough the italian experience might have been a teaching example for the other european countries a steep increase in the number of cases has been recorded in spain france and the united kingdom just a few days later like italy the spanish government reacted late to the pandemic on february 19th 2500 valencia soccer fans mingled with 40000 atalanta supporters for a champions league game in bergamo which was described as the gamechanger a week before the shutdown on march 8th several mass events such as sports events political party activities conferences and a massive demonstration for the international womens day took place three days later about 3000 athletic fans flew together for another champions league match in liverpool when the regional government of madrid closed universities and schools it provoked a holiday atmosphere with crowded bars and parks and many people moved to their beach homes29 the poor coordination and the delay in implementation of restrictive measures led an abrupt surge of cases in spain before they enacted the lockdown on march 14 2020 only after lockdown a decline in the number of new cases have been reported fig 3 we expect a steep decline in new cases in 6-8 weeks provided it is vigorously implemented to face the burden of the case boom the government took over all the private healthcare facilities and converted them to covid-19 care due to the shortage of testing kits laboratory testing was done only for patients needing admission for severe acute respiratory infections sari and the essential service personnel such as health workers in those departments16in the united states us there was a lack of coordination in the national response with an unclear message from the us president with often a variance with information from the us national institutes of health nih and the centers for disease control cdc early and severe outbreaks in washington state and new york state prompted the six counties in the san francisco bay area to impose stay-at-home orders on march 17th 2020 in response to initial cases two days later the entire state of california was placed under these orders to flatten the curve of new severe cases the 50 us states and many localities within them individually imposed measures ranging from tight provisions as in california to more lenient approaches such as bans on gatherings and curfews there was no consistent national policy this chaotic pattern included a wide variation in travel restrictions and even quarantines for travelers from one state to another and travel restrictions30 even in the absence of enforced restrictions social distancing was emphasized and those feeling ill were urged to stay home early in the epidemic policy on investigating contacts and quarantining them varied from city to city for example in denver colorado when there were 49 confirmed cases on march 19 health officials reached out to people who might have been exposed only if they were elderly or had underlying health conditions31 health departments in at least two counties in california  sacramento and placer counties  decided not to quarantine contacts who did not show symptoms despite growing evidence that asymptomatic carriers might transmit sars-cov-231 in seattle washington the health department was no longer routinely investigating contacts because cases were proliferating rapidly and contact tracing was labor-intensive31 there was also an issue with testing due to a shortage of testing kits163233 if the country had accurately tracked the spread of the virus hospitals would have had the opportunity to be prepared and executed their pandemic plans effectively and on time suddenly the system was faced with a virus that had been left to spread untracked through communities around the country34 new york country reported at least 83712 total positive cases of covid-19 and more than 1941 related deaths on april 2nd 2020 making it the state with the most us coronavirus cases new york city hospitals were straining under the onslaught of novel coronavirus cases worsened by a shortage of ppe such as gloves gowns and masks and limited availability of ventilators and intensive care beds27 this stress on the us healthcare system is likely to increase as cases are projected to peak in some areas during mid-april to late-april and some thereafter in fact to track the virus citizen crowd-sourcing methods have been devised including wwwcovidnearyoucom which enables anyone to view the reported healthillness of residents aggregated by postal zip codeamong the middle-income countries iran was the worst hit the iranian government was aware of the outbreak quite early but only little measures were applied to stop it the connections between iran and china were not interrupted until january 31st 2020 in the attempt to maintain strong diplomatic ties35 however the iranian airlines continued their flights between the two countries up to february 23 202035 the outbreak was officially acknowledged following only on february 19 2020 letting the disease spread in the preceding weeks35 iran did not impede the arrangements for the parliamentary elections scheduled on february 21st35 furthermore it also resisted quarantine measures the deputy health minister iraj harirchi publicly opposed it saying quarantines belong to before world war i for diseases like plague and cholera and even chinese are not satisfied with the quarantine they had put in place35 ironically he later tested positive for coronavirus in summary iran lost multiple opportunities to respond to their worst public health crisis35 there were also issues related to a lack of transparency in their reports1636a few data on the impact of traveler screening lockdown travel restriction and quarantine is available these days as the results of these measures have been analyzed only in these days37 however compared to travel restrictions improved detection isolation of cases and social distancing are likely to have a greater impact on the containment of the outbreak social distancing also needs to be continued for several months to have a lasting impact it has been predicted that by reducing the human to human contact by 90 we can stop the epidemic38 countries that have implemented social distancing earlier had a greater doubling time south korea singapore japan hong kong as compared to countries that did not us france italy39 the use of face masks by everyone is still controversial though who does not recommend use by everyone other agencies do recommend it4041in india the first case of covid-19 was reported on january 30th 2020 followed by two similar cases on february 2nd and 3rd all three had a travel history to wuhan china a month later on march 2nd two new cases were reported  one each from new delhi and hyderabad a sharp increase in numbers then followedto contain the spread the ministry of health and family welfare mohfw immediately took action and issued a travel advisory as travel restrictions had previously demonstrated efficacious on outbreaks of sars ebola and bubonic plague all international travelers entering the country were asked to self-quarantine for 14 days all travel visas to other countries were canceled until april 15th 2020 all the states were asked to invoke the epidemic disease act which allowed officials to quarantine suspected cases and close down public places an intensive campaign was rolled out and guidelines were developed for personal hygiene surveillance contact tracing quarantine diagnosis laboratory tests and management people were advised not to visit farms live animal markets or places where animals are slaughtered and to avoid mass gatherings all the health care facilities were asked to stop regular out-patient and in-patient services and to continue with solely emergency services doctors were encouraged to use telemedicine services arogya setu app was also launched to connect essential health services with people of india to fight against covid-19 this app will reach out and inform the users of the risk best practice and relevant advisories pertaining to containment of covid-19 amenities like hotels colleges railway train coaches etc were converted into quarantine facilities and large public places as stadiums were converted into isolation wards to handle an anticipated increased number of cases some of the states converted existing hospitals to exclusively handle covid-19 patients on march 22nd prime minister narendra modi initiated the lockdown process with a 14-hour janta curfew followed by lockdown in 75 covid-19 affected districts and a nationwide lockdown for the 3 weeks a containment plan involving the state and twenty ministries was set up a round-the-clock control room was set up at the headquarters of the general director of health service dghs to address the virus-related queries the countries of the south asian association for regional cooperation saarc were invited to fight jointly against this pandemic and 10 million us dollars were allocated for saarc countries a huge evacuation program of many indian nationals was done from the covid-19 affected areasall the measures implemented in india are revealing efficiency in flattening the curve nevertheless a small effort has been addressed to the identification of asymptomatic and mild cases this might have detrimental effects on the indian economy in the long term a long duration of the lockdown might be more devastating in india than in wealthier countries like the united kingdom or australia and it could result in serious economic damage increased hunger and poverty and it might reduce the populations resilience to handle the infection therefore if these cases remain unidentified there is a possibility of another peak of covid-19 cases once the lockdown is lifted and indias healthcare system might be not able to handle it properly hence moving ahead india should have staggered exit from the lockdown especially in the covid-19 hotspot areas and use this lockdown period to screen and identify as many cases as possible isolate them and quarantine their contacts as compared to other countries worldwide a very low number of tests have been run in india fig 4 with the highest number done in kerala table 1 testing is done in 122 government labs and 44 private laboratories however it is likely to increase in the near future42 at the time this article is being written 158 districts in india have recorded at least one covid-19 case42 hence this opportunity should be taken to screen the high-risk areas in these districts using the mid-level personnel both from the government and private sectors at the same time the capacity for rapid diagnostic testing at the primary level should be implemented to identify cases earlier and limit the transmission this period should be also utilized for producing a large supply of ppe for the safety of health care workers and increasing the number of available ventilators in case the outbreak worsensin conclusion india and the world have a long legacy of successful efforts to prevent or cure widespread infections recalling the successful smallpox eradication campaign of the 1970s we are reminded of the pivotal role of leadership and sound management to stop the killer disease43 hence india has the opportunity to reverse disease predictions with stringent containment measures social distancing increasing case detection isolation and quarantining the contacts efforts should be made to enlist community support and ownership so containment measures do not depend exclusively on administrative measures critical situations like a mass exodus of laborers from the major cities to the rural areas as well as mass gatherings like nizamuddin markaz event which happened recently should be avoidedas the impact of covid-19 is not limited to human infection and death other associated issues should be addressed like social discrimination for instance healthcare workers are increasingly looked at as someone who can spread the virus in the community furthermore asian americans have been experiencing a rising number of episodes of violence and hate after us president made hurtful and misleading comments as china is to blame and calling covid-19 the chinese virusthe impact of covid has been also affecting sectors like entertainment tourism restaurants and the travel industry with a tremendous escalation of job losses44 disrupted supply chain and declining stock markets are the final consequences of these social changes thus hitting the global economy44 finally a greater incidence of panic disorder anxiety depression and other psychosocial issues has been reported45looking into the near future containing the covid-19 epidemic is likely to take several months public health interventions will be directed towards social distancing and improving hygienic practices these interventions will be effective in delaying the onset of wide community transmission reducing peak incidence and its impact on public services5 testing contact tracing isolation of infected and precautionary self-isolation of contacts is critical in reducing the number of new cases46 an exceptionally high degree of understanding in the population and acceptance of these measures is also critical46 these interventions have to be balanced with getting back to normal life and everyday activities to the best extent possible until a reversing the trajectory of the pandemic is traced47a little knowledge is available so far on alternate routes of transmission namely via sewage contaminated water or air conditioning systems it is also poorly known if those who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection would be protected from reinfection but evidence to confirm this is yet to be generated antibody testing has to be implemented on a large scale to identify who is already immune to the virus the effect of temperature season and humidity on covid-19 also has an impact on the covid-19 outbreak however results from other parts of the world are awaited4849multiple trials are currently underway to develop novel treatment options as well as a vaccine to treat the respiratory syndrome but results are still awaited50 moreover months are needed before a vaccine is developed and approved even though herd immunity develops over time vulnerable groups as the healthcare workforce and elderly people should still be preserved smart working and staggered shifts may have to be adopted to mitigate covid-19 transmission in the future digital didactic and online learning can be protracted for months telemedicine and in particular teleophthalmology needs to be implemented also in the future infectious diseases will be probably included amongst the most important health hazards along with anti-microbial resistance51 in addition timely identification efficient diagnosis rapid isolation and clinical management would remain in the forefront51one of the last concerns regards the second wave of covid-19 outbreak asian countries and cities that seemed to have brought the coronavirus epidemic under control are suddenly tightening their borders and imposing stricter containment measures fearful about new imported infections hong kong suddenly saw new cases spike as high as 65 in one day and ordered a new closure of non-essential activities in japan where infections have remained relatively controlled cases started to rise in march as travelers returned in the home country new cases of local transmission have also been detected similarly singapore again announced one-month lockdown in view of increased local transmission this portends a worrisome sign for the united states europe india and the rest of the world regarding the second wave of the virus spreading once the restrictive measures are relieved52nilthere are no conflicts of interestnovel coronavirus sars-cov-2 the virus causing covid-19 emerged in wuhan china but rapidly spread to other regions in china this led to the quarantine of wuhan city and the recommendation of a number of precautious behaviors by both the world health organisation who and the chinese centre for disease control cdc mortality salience increases distress greenberg et al 1986 and previous studies reported increased psychological distress during the previous sars-cov coronavirus lee et al 2007 hawryluck et al 2004 anxiety can motivate people to adopt preventive measures during a pandemic leung et al 2005 drawing on health belief models weinstein and nicolich 1993 research conducted during h1n1 swine flu and sars-cov positively associated distress with internationally recommended health behaviours leung et al 2005 however anxiety may also encourage non-recommended avoidant behaviours rubin et al 2009 to date no empirical study to date has examined associations between psychological distress quarantine and the use of recommend and non-recommended behaviors understanding this may be crucial for comprehending the psychological drivers of important behaviors at a time of national crisis as well as the avoidance of behaviors with negligible or negative impact on health outcomeswe used an internet panel in china to recruit a national sample n  1134 between 4-10 march 2020 using a random and stratified sampling with oversampling of hubei region and the city of wuhan we employed a survey company specializing in east asia asia opinions which uses a panel of participants across east asia including china participants are sent invitations to participate in the study and given small incentives for participation the mean age of these participants was 3101 years sd  681 range  18-59 535

an electronic informed consent form the response rate for the survey was 427being in quarantine was measured by the question are you currently in quarantine because of the coronavirus for our study we took recommended behaviours to include those showing appropriate actions to mitigate infection risk as suggested by international health bodies these included three items selected from who guidelines coronavirus disease covid-19 advice for the public 2020 1 i am making sure that i ventilate the house regularly to help contain the risk of the virus 2 when i get a chance to go out i keep a distance of at least a meter from others when i go outside 3 i try to avoid people who show cold or flu-like symptomsnon-recommended behaviors were health behaviours that provide little protection against infection or economic action that contradict national guidelines for returning to normal activities once the pandemic risk is reduced we measured non-recommended health behaviours using two items from the who mythbusters list coronavirus disease covid-19 advice for the public  mythbusters 2020 1 i am taking some vitamins to help protect me safe from covid-19 2 i have taken traditional medicines to keep me safe from covid-19 non-recommended economic behavior was measured by the item 3 when my work reopens i will take a few extra days off just to be on the safe sidetranslations of all items in

for more informationpsychological distress was highest amongst those at the original epicenter of the outbreak hubei region wuhan city as well as those in quarantine respondents in quarantine were faced with a range of challenges both physical eg financial loss and psychological stigma absence of psychological support services brooks et al 2020 wang et al 2020 over 90 of the participants reported adhering to the who guidelines regarding recommended behaviors lower psychological distress was evident amongst those following these guidelines suggesting that effective preventive action coupled with high levels of trust in the information received wang et al 2020 may play an important role in distress reduction while this may suggest potential social desirability bias krumpal 2013 high levels of recommended behavioural compliance were also reported in other chinese work during this pandemic wang et al 2020 as well as previous pandemic outbreaks in china goodwin and sun 2013 consistent with earlier work on h1n1 rubin et al 2009 higher distress was also associated with non-recommended behaviors taking vitamins reluctance to return to work while adhered to by a lower percentage of respondents from 28-64 such behavior may result from a belief in misleading scientific information often presented online the primary route of information about the pandemic in china wang et al 2020 social media use has been associated with mental health risk during covid-19 holmes and perry 2020 the use of traditional medicine was also consistent with a chinese culture of traditional medicine also evident during h1n1 and often favored when there is no clear treatment for an emerging riskwe recognize several limitations our study was cross-sectional and responses were self-reported as is common with research on-line wang et al 2020 our sample was predominately a young one while we recognize that many respondents may have had personal experiences of epidemic threat during the h7n9 avian influenza outbreak goodwin and sun 2013 we had no information on past medical or psychological conditions nor we did have information regarding number of days in quarantine type of information received about the effectiveness of preventive measures the level of awareness or health literacy at the individual or community level we did not include other significant predictors of risk perception significant during h1n1 eg personal values goodwin et al 2011 or other proximal factors significant in a variety of health belief models eg attitude towards the behaviour perceived behavioural control and social pressure to perform from others armitage and conner 2000 broader cultural influences on community health responsibilities and the minimization of risk may also be particularly important in a collective society such as china hofstede 2001 finally we did not consider additional psychological consequences of anxiety such as the stereotyping and prejudice reported during sars washer 2004however this to our knowledge is the first study to empirically examine the association between psychological distress quarantine and recommend and non-recommended behavior during covid-19 findings suggest that authorities should address the mental toll of quarantine over time and reduce anxiety in order to limit unnecessary or costly actionsnoneas a result of the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection in the chinese city of wuhan a situation of socio-economic crisis and psychological distress rapidly occurred worldwide although social activities have been restricted in most countries almost all not essential individual movements were prohibited due to quarantine while the local hospitals received suddenly thousands of critically ill covid-19 patients and were forced to implement their emergency protocols in this context the general population as well as most of the front-line healthcare workers became vulnerable to the emotional impact of covid-19 infection1 due to both the pandemic and its consequences worldwide23many psychological problems and important consequences in terms of mental health including stress anxiety depression frustration uncertainty during covid-19 outbreak emerged progressively4 common psychological reactions related to the mass quarantine which was imposed in order to attenuate the covid-19 spread are generalized fear and pervasive community anxiety which are typically associated with disease outbreaks and increased with the escalation of new cases together with inadequate anxiety-provoking information which was provided by media5 the psychological reactions to covid-19 pandemic may vary from a panic behavior or collective hysteria6 to pervasive feelings of hopelessness and desperation which are associated with negative outcomes including suicidal behavior2 importantly other health measures may be compromised by abnormally elevated anxiety7as the general population became increasingly exposed anxiety-provoking topics related to this emergence of the health and socio-economic crisis need to be rapidly identified to early detect dysfunctional processes and maladaptive lifestyle changes potentially leading to the onset of psychiatric conditions8given this background this work aimed to comprehensively review the current literature about the impact of the covid-19 epidemic on the mental health in the general populationthe modern world in which all individuals are able to rapidly travel and communicate has been rarely forced to the current social isolation and restrictions which are linked to feelings of frustration and incertainty this unprecedented situation related to covid-19 outbreak is clearly demonstrating that individuals are largely and emotionally unpreparated to the detrimental effects of biological disasters that are directly showing how everyone may be frail and helplesssocial distancing and important lockdown restrictions have been carried out first in china and later in most european countries where italy and spain experienced a tragic growth of the number of positive cases9 although government regulations are necessary to maintain social balance and guarantee the safety of all individuals a direct strategy aimed to manage the psychosocial issues related to covid-19 crisis and its consequences in the community is currently lackingthe psychological outcomes for subjects who have been quarantined compared with those who did not have been examined by both cross-sectional1014 and longitudinal studies1516table 1 summarized the most relevant information about the psychological impact of lockdown restrictions and quarantine included in these studiesother studies reported a higher prevalence of subjects with psychological symptoms17 emotional disturbance18 depression19 stress20 mood alterations and irritability insomnia21 post-traumatic stress symptoms15 anger22 and emotional exhaustion5 among those who have been quarantined notably fear anger anxiety and insomnia confusion grief and numbness have been identified as additional psychological responses to quarantine long-term behavioral changes like vigilant handwashing and avoidance of crowds as well as a delayed return to normality even after many months after the quarantine were also reported23 thus the quarantine period seems to have important and dysfunctional psychological consequences on the individuals mental health not only in the short-term but even in the long-term periodexisting evidence clearly showed the most relevant and profound psychological impact of the outbreaks on the general population2427figure 1 summarized the most relevant psychological reactions in the general population related to covid-19 infection although aspecific and uncontrolled fears related to infection pervasive anxiety frustration and boredom loneliness have been hypothesized to impair subjective wellbeing and quality of life resilience and enhanced social support are protective factors that may help with regard to lifestyle changes and re-adaptation mechanisms2425this is commonly one of the most frequent psychological reaction to pandemics several existing studies demonstrated that those who have been exposed to the risk of infection may develop pervasive fears about their health worries to infect others and fear infecting family members10232728 jeong et al27 reported that these individuals are more vulnerable than others to manifest worries if they experienced physical symptoms potentially linked to the infection and fear that symptoms are directly associated to actively having the infection even several months after the exposure other studies reported that pregnant women and individuals with young children are the most at risk to develop the fear of becoming infected or transmitting the virus29social isolation related to restrictions and lockdown measures are linked to feelings of uncertainty for the future fear of new and unknown infective agents resulting in abnormally increased anxiety25 anxiety may be directly related to sensorial deprivation and pervasive loneliness in this case first insomnia but later depression and post-traumatic stress occurred in addition anxiety is closely associated with fatigue and reduced performance in healthcare workers while boredom and loneliness are directly related to anger frustration and sufferings linked to quarantine restrictions26 furthermore additional tragic effects associated with pervasive anxiety in a pandemic period may include the perceived lower social support separation from loved ones loss of freedom uncertainty and boredom30distress boredom social isolation and frustration are directly related to confinement abnormally reduced socialphysical contact with others and loss of usual habits151920232829 as reported by jeong et al27 frustration and pervasive loneliness seem to derive by the inhibition from daily activities interruption of social necessities not taking part in social networking activities unfortunately in this context hopelessness together with other individual characteristics such as the experience of childhood maltreatment as well as extreme sensory processing patterns may significantly and independently predict suicidal behavior3132 but even the unbearable anger related to the imposition of quarantine may lead to negative outcomesthe final effect of social isolation is pervasive loneliness and boredom which have potential dramatic effects on both physical and mental individual well-being pervasive loneliness may be significantly associated with increased depression and suicidal behavior23 unfortunately the isolation is progressively enhanced by anxiety panic or collective hysteria cognitive functions and decision making are firstly impaired by hyperarousal and anxiety and later by disabling feelings of loneliness in addition social isolation and loneliness are also associated with alcohol and drug abuse14 both frustration and pervasive loneliness seem to derive by the inhibition from daily activities interruption of social necessities inability to take part in social networking activities enhancing the risk of hopelessness and suicidal behavior in this specific context33 overall it is well known that long periods of social isolation or quarantine for specific illnesses may have detrimental effects on mental well-being34the risk of related quarantine distress may be also due to the presence of alexithymic traits which may reduce psychological resilience in some subgroups of individuals3537 alexithymia may be literally defined as no words for mood and was initially identified to describe cognitive and affective features in patients with psychosomatic disorders alexithymic individuals may show significantly higher levels of anxiety depression and psychological distress than non-alexithymics in summary the alexithymia construct applied to major depressive disorder mdd subjects showed a significant correlation between alexithymia traits mdd severity and increased risk of suicidal behaviorimportantly feelings of frustration and incertainty tend to occur even in relation with inadequate basic supplies eg food water clothes etc during the quarantine period which is a major source of worries and anxietyanger even after 46 months from quarantine27 there are studies demonstrating that supplies provided by public health authorities in order to address the outbreak may be inappropriate or their release may be carried out too late to successfully address the needs for instance thermometers or masks may be received too late while water and food were only inconsistently distributed23 digiovanni et al20 reported that during the 2003 sars outbreak in toronto the government was unable to meet needs for groceries and other routine supplies needed for daily livingexisting evidence202329 suggest that the poor or inadequate information from public health authorities may be a significant stressor because it provides inappropriate guidelines concerning call for actions or leads to confusion about the purpose of quarantine or the importance of measures needed to interrupt the pandemic spread confusion may be directly related to different approaches contradictory health messages and poor coordination during the toronto sars epidemic as a result of the involvement of multiple jurisdictions and different levels of government20 braunack-mayer et al29 clearly referred to the perceived lack of transparency from health and government authorities concerning the severity of the outbreak finally reynolds et al15 stated that post-traumatic stress symptoms may be related to perceived difficulties in interpreting quarantine protocols as well as the lack of clear rationaleguidelinespsychological resilience may be generally defined as the ability to support or retrieve psychological well-being during or after addressing stressful disabling conditions although the interconnectedness increased dramatically over the past decades similarly the vulnerability of billions of individuals across the world to existing or novel pathogens tragically increased without a corresponding enhancement in coping abilities24 historically different indices have been adopted to measure resilience and individual ability to react to social economic and political threats including public health emergencies unfortunately being less resilient to social threats such as pandemics may enhance the risk of developing psychiatric conditions25 notably a general message of hope and social protection given by healthcare regulatory authorities and scientists not only about the risk of being infected but even about the existence of containment measurements that may be implemented in the hospitals and in the community as a whole may enhance resilience and individual abilities to successfully react to social threats30a higher and significant perception of social support is associated with a reduced likelihood to develop psychological distress and psychiatric conditions conversely according to a recent online survey conducted in south korea30 most 720 of the respondents reported they could get someone elses support if they were isolated due to covid-19 and 280 clearly reported they would not have social support adequate social support for the general population with regard to specific at risk populations eg infected patients quarantined individuals and medical professionals should be provided by offering targeted tailored messages according to the most reliable scientific evidence relevantly a variety of mental health supporting strategies are required in pandemic areas in order to facilitate lifestyle changes and re-adaptation activities required after the occurrence of invalidating outbreaks124specific preventive strategies at the community level such as i implementing effective communication and ii providing adequate psychological services should be carried out in order to attenuate the psychological and psychosocial impact of covid-19 outbreak health education needs to be enhanced using online platforms social fear related to covid-19 needs to be correctly addressed while stigma and discrimination need to be recognized as major challenges able to reinforce the feelings of uncertainty in a period of social crisis hospitals protocols linked to the early and effective management of health emergency need to be implemented while healthcare professionals need to be supplied by adequate protective facilitiesscientific community should provide appropriate information to attenuate the impact of anxiety frustration and all the negative emotions which represent important barriers to the correct management of social crisis and psychological consequences related to pandemic unmet needs should be rapidly identified by medical staff who need to communicate frequently and in a timely manner with most of patients to understand the risk to develop new symptoms or worsen a preexisting psychological distress furthermore telephones helplines internet access active social networks dedicated blogs and forums should be implemented in order to reduce social isolation and loneliness as well as allow to specific populations eg infected subjects in hospitals or quarantine settings the successful communication with their loved onesmarginalized populations such as elderly individuals or those with psychological problems should be able to actively consult with clinical psychotherapists to rapidly detect warning signs finally telemedicine should be really implemented especially in areas where mental health services are poorly represented or severely impaired by the rapid spread of pandemic and lockdown restrictions importantly symptoms related to initial psychological crisis together with the need to perform effective interventions using personalization and monitoring of adverse drug reactions related to psychoactive medications should be detected by psychiatrists24implementing community-based strategies to support resilience and psychologically vulnerable individuals during the covid-19 crisis is fundamental for any community38 the psychological impact of fear and anxiety induced by the rapid spread of pandemic needs to be clearly recognized as a public health priority for both authorities and policy makers who should rapidly adopt clear behavioral strategies to reduce the burden of disease and the dramatic mental health consequences of this outbreak the world health organization who declared in january 2020 the outbreak of covid19 a new coronavirus disease the who indicated that there was an elevated risk of coronavirus spreading globally and indeed in march 2020 the situation was characterized as a pandemic 1 in spain the government declared the state of alarm late on 14 march 2020 as a consequence since march 15 an absolute quarantine was imposed and individuals were only allowed to leave their homes under certain circumstances such as to buy medicines food or travel to health centers this also implied closing all nonessential services and stores including restaurants 2 it has been recently argued that quarantine will boost mental health problems in the population and several authors have anticipated that anxiety depression and anger will be frequent 34 thus since quarantine and mobility restrictions have become more and more frequent globally institutions researchers and clinicians have made an effort to provide the population with guidelines on how to manage quarantine in a more effective manner for their mental wellbeing an example of the previous was a rapid review published in the lancet as early as march 14 in which past research on the psychological consequences of quarantine due to similar circumstances eg severe acute respiratory syndrome influenza ebola and middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus and their correlates were investigated 5 the authors concluded that quarantine has important psychological effects on individuals and pointed to a number of stressors such as mobility restriction duration fear of infection frustration boredom inadequate supplies and inadequate information however the crosscultural generalizability of the findings and applicability to the covid19 situation was put into question because previous sample sizes were generally small the majority of studies had been conducted in canada and china and many only included specific populations ie students or healthcare workers while acknowledging the aforementioned stressors many local and global entities and agencies have provided their own psychological recommendations to better manage the quarantine for instance in march 18 the who addressed a message to the population and suggested some best practices such as minimizing seeking news about covid19 that increased anxiety or distress and being supportive to others eg checking by telephone on people in the community 1 other entities such as the centers for disease control and prevention the american psychiatric association the national health service and spanish institutions spanish government and general council of the official college of psychologists to name some examples have made similar efforts 6789 in general these guidelines have recommended limiting covid19 news exposure taking care of the body eg exercising eating healthy and at regular times getting enough sleep avoiding drug and alcohol use planning a daily routine getting involved into pleasant activities and connecting with trusted others to share concerns and feelings which is consistent with recent opinions from researchers in the field 101112 to what extent are these and other recommendations that have been frequently posted in the media associated with a successful adaptation to quarantine in the current covid19 crisis psychological interventions in the face of the covid19 crisis should be based on sound scientific advice 13 however current evidence is insufficient to confirm to what extent the recommended lifestyles reviewed in the previous paragraphs are associated with a more successful adaptation to the quarantine in the present pandemic additionally because research in the field has been conducted in china the crosscultural generalizability of findings is unclear therefore the goal of the present study is to investigate the emotional impact of the covid19 pandemic as well as to the extent to which a comprehensive set of sociodemographic behavioral and personalitycognitive correlate with wellbeing just at the beginning of the quarantine in spain first three days according to the reviewed literature we expect to find low mood as a result of the first days of quarantine we also hypothesize that we will replicate most of the proposed correlates of wellbeing indicated in guidelines expert opinions and the scarce literature from chinathis is a crosssectional observational investigation with 2683 participants who completed an online qualtrics survey disseminated using a virtual snowball sampling approach with different social media resources eg twitter whatsapp instagram and facebook specifically social media accounts were used to disseminate the study online and respondents were asked to disseminate the study in their own social media this is a nonprobabilistic sampling strategy that can help increase the number of responses and the representativeness of the sample yet with some bias eg only people who have access to the internet can respond and certain online populations might be more likely to participate survey dissemination started late in the evening on 15 march 2020 the day the quarantine officially started in spain even though it was officially announced the day before this means that the population in spain knew about the quarantine onset already on 14 march responses were obtained during the first three days of quarantine 15 march n  713 16 march n  1332 and 17 march n  638 the fact that data was obtained during three consecutive days should not be interpreted as this being longitudinal data data represents responses from different individuals and is the study is therefore crosssectional data was obtained from all 17 regions in spain the exact details are not provided for readability reasons but the proportion of responses per region was consistent with the population in that region eg the majority of responses that is 586 were obtained from the four most populated regions in spain which represent 578 of the adult population in the countryall obtained responses were anonymous and no personal data was collected from any of the participants the informed consent was obtained for all participants in the same online platform qualtrics before allowing participants to complete the survey first the online survey showed an information sheet for the study and then informed consent had to be provided by clicking on a button where they confirmed that they were over 18 years of age and were willing to voluntarily participate in the investigation the study and its procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the university of murcia the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki eligibility included being over 18 years of age understanding spanish living in spain and consenting to participate in the online consent formthe primary outcome was mood which was measured with the reduced 30item version of the profile of mood states 14 this questionnaire evaluates six dimensions of mood namely depression anxietytension anger vigor fatigue and friendlinessthe selection of predictors was based on the literature review and the recommended lifestyles from several institutions described in the previous paragraphs these included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics quarantinerelated behavior and personalitycognitive factors see table 1 and table 2 for detailssociodemographic covidrelated and behavioral factors were created ad hoc and were dichotomous ordinal or continuous depending on the content assessed all behavioral variables referred to behavior in the past 24 h for the measurement of frustration intolerance the 7item emotional intolerance scale from the frustration discomfort scale was used because this is the scale that mostly correlates to negative mood states 15 for personality the ten item personality inventory was selected because it is a valid and very brief measure of the big five personality dimensions 16 high scores in these scales should be interpreted as indicating poorer tolerance to unpleasant emotionscognitions and higher neuroticism extraversion openness to experience agreeableness and conscientiousness following a descriptive analysis of itemsscales the levels of the main outcome mood will be compared against previous scores from the general population in spain obtained before the covid19 epidemic 17 an independent ttest was computed and the cohens d estimate was calculated as a measure of effect sizefinally a set of linear regressions was calculated for each predictor and each outcome separately to obtain a measure of the strength of the relationship between every predictor with an outcome table 3 similar to recent research 18 univariate regressions are presented first to show the relationship between each predictor and outcomes additionally though we also propose an additional multivariate model that can help identify the more relevant predictors for each outcome due to the large number of predictors and the risk of multicollinearity problems a back-elimination procedure was selected in the multivariate regression in this type of regression all variables are entered in a first step and then variables are sequentially removed based on partial correlation this provides a parsimonious model based on the data but not on theory linear regressions assume that the relationship between the predictor and the outcome is linear thus we first tested whether this type of relationship was feasible for the ordinal variables we calculated a series of analyses of variance anovas and investigated whether mean scores in outcomes across categories in the ordinal predictors suggested a linear relationship between both variables this was the case for all predictors except for exercising frequency the anova findings suggested that those that exercised were generally in a better mood irrespective of the amount of exercise they performed therefore a dichotomous version of this variable which was labeled as exercised was createdbecause the administration of measures was completely online we checked the time spent to complete the survey and included several control items to control for fake or inconsistent responding to the survey ie select option never true in the current itemdue to the large number of analyses made and to reduce the risk of false positives and unimportant associations the alpha level was corrected for multiple testing and set to 0001the results of the descriptive analyses are either presented in table 1 and table 2 behavioralcoping or described in the following lines for readability reasons the average age of participants was 3486 years sd  1374 range  18 to 80 the majority of them were women 777 at the time of assessment most respondents were in a relationship 764 and had completed postsecondary education studies 635 a significant number of individuals indicated having lost their job due to the covid19 pandemic 237 while 458 of respondents reported working at the time of assessment the representation of students in the sample was high 277 only a small percentage of participants did not cohabitate at the time of assessment 88 and cohabitation with an infected person was even more infrequent 08 the majority of participants did not cohabitate with children 289 house size and income were relatively similarly distributed across the sample monthly home income was very diverse and ranged from less than 1000 88 to more than 3500 176 the percentage of individuals reporting a monthly income of 10011500 15012000 20012500 and 25013000 was 173 174 126 and 94 respectively house sizes also largely varies across participants with some living in homes of  70 m2 210 or 7190 m2 223 and other living in houses of 91110 m2 239 111130 m2 133 or 130 m2 195 the majority of respondents perceived that they had a moderately or extremely low risk of covid19 infection 680 and indicated that they did not have a relative that would be considered as vulnerable to the covid19 such as patients with immunosuppression cancer or severe respiratory conditions 743 only 18 of participants reported taking psychotropic medication at the time of assessmentmore than half of participants reported having changed their usual sleeping patterns due to the quarantine 549 however the majority of participants were somewhattocompletely satisfied with the quality of their sleep in the previous night 675 participants reported having slept an average of 731 h sd  125 the previous nightparticipants interacted with an average of 240 individuals sd  178 in person and 171 individuals sd  195 using videoconferences daily certain activities ie sittinglaying text messaging internet surfing seeking covid19 information and watching tvseriesmovies were very frequent and were only never performed by less than 6 of respondents other behaviors such as exposing to sunlight none  190 and exercising none  484 were less common when trying to cope with emotional distress and boredom the most frequent activities were eating not at all  15 watching tv not at all  114 and cleaningtidying not at all  135 workingstudying not at all  383 videoconferencing not at all  394 playing games with others not at all  513 and exercising not at all  566 were less frequently used as coping strategies almost half of participants did not plan or only slightly planned their daily activities in advance 494 up to 484 of respondents did not exercise at all during the past 24 h see table 1 and table 2 for more details on behavioralcoping items and responsesas indicated in table 3 participants in the present study reported more depressed mood t  579 p  0001 d  030 and anger t  481 p  0001 d  025 as well as less vigor t  1249 p  0001 d  069 and friendliness t  941 p  0001 d  047 compared to data from the general population previous to the current covid19 crisis 17 by contrast the fatigue levels were lower in the present study sample t  575 p  0001 d  034 anxiety levels were comparable across samples t  029 p  0774 d  002the results of the univariate regression analyses are reported in table 4 some variables were significantly associated with all or almost all four out of six outcomes these included younger age 39  r

out of six mood states the use of videoconferencing to cope with distress was singular as it was sometimes associated both with poor ie depression and anxiety and positive mood states ie vigor and friendliness the remaining variables were less consistently associated with mood states and are not described here in detail due to space limitations see table 4 only a reduced number of variables were not related to any of the mood state ie job loss due to the covid19 crisis number of pets and cohabitation with a covidinfected personas shown in table 5 the results obtained with the results of the multivariate analyses were in the same direction as those reported in the univariate regression analysis in particular the majority of variables that were consistently and more strongly larger r2 associated with outcomes in a bivariate manner ie age sleep quality time spent internet surfing frustration intolerance and neuroticism were also uniquely associated with several outcomes even after controlling for the contribution of the remaining predictorsseveral calls for mental health investigation during the covid19 pandemic have been made and numerous behavioral guidelines have been developed to try to minimize the emotional impact of the current crisis on the population 119 thus this study aimed at investigating the emotional impact of the covid19 pandemic and included an important comprehensive set of sociodemographic behavioral and cognitive correlates of wellbeing a key strength of the current study refers to the fact that data was obtained just after the onset of the covid19 quarantine in spain first day during the evening to the end of the third day of quarantine as anticipated the mood of a sample of individuals at quarantine onset was generally poorer compared to a sample of individuals from the general population recruited before the current covid19 17 additionally we generally confirmed the majority of expected associations between sociodemographic clinical behavioral and cognitivepersonality factors and individual differences in mood status during the early phase of adaptation to quarantine first three daysso far most studies on the mental health consequences of quarantine and its correlates have been letters to the editor or commentary articles and a reduced number of original investigations have been conducted in china 19 these studies suggest that the covid19 crisis is indeed impacting negatively on the mental wellbeing of individuals for example one study with 1210 chinese respondents revealed moderate to severe depression anxiety and stress in 165 288 and 81 of respondents respectively 18 another investigation during the covid19 outbreak in wuhan china reported prevalence rates of depression anxiety or both of 483 226 and 194 respectively 20 it is important to note that the aforementioned prevalence rates of mental distress do not imply that depression and anxiety problems were a consequence of covid19 and could have existed before the crisis to address this limitation the present study compared mood levels of participants in the present study with those from past research before the covid19 crisis began our findings support the aforementioned idea that the current crisis or at least quarantine might exert a negative influence on the severity of depressed mood in the general population although the obtained betweengroup differences were only small in relation to anxiety and anger the results only support the impact of quarantine on the latter while this is only speculative it is possible that anxiety which could have been higher before quarantine due to infection risk was actually reduced when confined at home ie when risk of infection was low in fact note that only 107 of respondents perceived that they had a higherthanaverage risk of infection on the contrary while the onset of quarantine might mitigate the impact of the covid19 crisis on anxiety levels it has been repeatedly shown that quarantine negatively impacts on anger 5 which might be explained by the frustration associated with the consequences of restricted mobility in achieving important personal goals the present study also evidenced that vigor and to a lesser extent fatigue and friendliness might be diminished during the onset of quarantine or as a consequence of the covid19 crisis at first glance the results on vigor and fatigue might seem contradictory of course it is possible that the sample used for comparison was very fatigued at the time of assessment which might explain why our sample indicated being less fatigued however a distinction between fatigue eg tired exhausted and weak and vigor items eg full of energy lively and active might also shed light on the rationale behind the different direction of findings in this sense note that the most frequent activities indicated by individuals in the present study during quarantine onset were largely passive ie sittinglaying text messaging internet surfing seeking covid19 information and watching tvseriesmovies this together with the fact that quarantine onset started on a sunday and imposed resting at home for many participants note that half of them were not working might explain why participants in our sample might have been less fatigued but also less energetic vigorous one last finding in relation to mood status was that friendliness was lower in our sample than in the comparison group friendliness is composed of adjectives like kind considerate of others and sympathetic thus the fact that this mood state was low in our sample might be problematic in a situation where prosocial behavior eg respecting governmental recommendations in attempt to decrease the risk of spreading the disease is of utter importance while one would expect that this should have been enhanced in the face of the current situation our results indicate that this mood state might be challenged during quarantine which could explain why so many antisocial behaviors have occurred since the quarantine onset in spain over half a million fines issued and almost 2000 arrests for violating confinement in one month only 21 regarding the correlates of wellbeing it has been argued that collecting highquality data during the current covid19 crisis is crucial to update existent guidelines 22 the present study might be an important step in this direction overall our results supported the majority of recommended lifestyles indicated by guidelines and experts eg sleep selfcare exercising planning some daily activities and minimizing the time spent seeking covid19 information and emotional eating 6789101112 we also replicated the results from a study in china indicating that students and women were at higher risk for low mood 18 overall however the contribution of these variables on mood states was modest generally less than 5 explained variance by a single variable exceptions to this were cognitivepersonality characteristics namely frustration intolerance and neuroticism which explained up to 202 and 158 respectively of mood states on the one hand frustration intolerance refers to an inability to acknowledge cannot stand the existence of discomfort in life 23 in particular the intolerance of emotions component taps into the difficulties in accepting difficult thoughts and feelings 15 on the other hand neuroticism is a personality trait characterized by a tendency to experience negative emotions in the face of threat loss or frustration 24 both psychological factors have been consistently associated with poor mental and often physical health status of individuals and argued to predispose individuals to psychopathology 2526 in the light of the previous and the large explained variance obtained in the present study both frustration intolerance and neuroticism might be important factors to be considered to detect vulnerable individuals to quarantine onset while changing neuroticism might require more structured interventions one straightforward recommendation for the general population in the direction of increasing tolerance of emotions might be to acknowledge difficult emotions as part of the current situation ie quarantine without trying to get rid of them eg by eating emotionally or seeking covid19 information excessivelythe present study limitations include the focus on crosssectional data only the limited number of days ie only three and the fact that analyses are based on linear regressions which poses the question of whether we are leaving out of sight possible nonlinear or interaction effects however none of the guidelines take nonlinearity into account when making their recommendations but this exceeds the scope of this paper and should be addressed in future studies additionally answers from three consecutive days were collapsed which prevents us from exploring whether the correlation between study variables differed across days this was done to reduce the already large number of statistical comparisons and because measures were obtained in three consecutive days as opposed to very different moments during quarantine however an important question for future research might be to explore whether the importance of correlates of mood remains unchanged or not at different stages during quarantine eg whether frustration tolerance is not only important at the beginning of quarantine but also when individuals have been under quarantine for several weeks note also that data from the general public used to compare average mood in the present study was obtained in 2013 and in a single region of spain therefore it is possible that the differences in time and place of data collection might have affected the results in relation to generalizability of findings it is also important to note that despite answers were obtained from almost 2700 participants from all 17 regions in spain and the proportion of responses per region were consistent with the population numbers per region the overrepresentation of females and young adults in the sample should be taken into account when considering the generalizability of the results finally it is important to consider that in the study we present correlates between several sociodemographic behavioral and personalitycognitive factors and mood status during the first three days of quarantine only thus because the strength of the obtained correlations was not compared against data before the quarantine or before the covid19 crisis we cannot assume that the correlations found are due to quarantine or the covid19 crisis therefore it is possible that the correlations found are a general phenomenon rather than a consequence of confinement or the covid10 crisiswhile acknowledging the previous shortcomings the present study might as well add to the existing literature on the impact of the covid19 crisis or quarantine on wellbeing and its correlates an important finding was that the majority of recommendations made by renowned institutions and experts for adaptation to quarantine were supported even though not all of them might be related to all mood states or at least to the same extent in this sense the study pointed to frustration intolerance and neuroticism as the most important vulnerability factors for low mood during quarantine onset additionally and consistent with guidelines behaviors like having a good quality of sleep exercising and planning daily activities were found to be associated with better mood while the opposite relationship was found with spending a lot of time internet surfing seeking coronavirusrelated information and sittinglying for long periods also interestingly a novel finding was that younger participants young adults presented poorer mood status as a final remark it is important to note the contribution of the majority of these variables on outcomes particularly age sleep quality internet surfing videoconferencing frustration intolerance and neuroticism remained significant even after controlling for the role of all the other factors this suggests that the previous variables might be relevant riskprotective factors to be considered together for prevention and treatment purposes ultimately these results might be important to guide psychological interventions in the face of the covid19 in a more effective way which is crucial in the current situation 13the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 has spawned a pandemic due to coronavirus disease -19 covid-19 that is now a worldwide crisis1 2 3 the spectrum of covid-19 includes acute lung injury that may progress to adult respiratory distress syndrome circulatory shock renal failure and death3 4 5 6 the surge in health care demands for patients with severe covid-19 across the united states has been overwhelming due to multiple factors including viral transmission patient volume patient acuity and the requirements for strict infection control7 8
the purpose of this freestanding editorial is to highlight the significant effects of the coronavirus crisis on fellowship training in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology across the united states this perspective will describe this landscape and suggest solutions for the program leadership to navigate this crisis successfully in a flexible and resilient fashion the references provide further detail for program directors and their teams to manage the demands of the pandemic in their respective fellowship programsthe severity of a health systems response to the covid-19 crisis has been classified into one of three stages by the accreditation council for graduate medical education acgme full details available at wwwacgmeorgcovid-19 last accessed april 2nd 2020 stage 1 has been termed business as usual reflecting a time period during which the health system is not significantly affected by the coronavirus crisis in this stage there has been little disruption of patient care or fellow educational but the hospital and departmental leadership have begun planning for the anticipated increased clinical load while the fellowship is still governed by the usual common and specific program requirements certain acgme activities will be suspended including surveys the self-study and site visits9 10
the duration of the first stage is determined by the local trajectory of the pandemic in a given health system and region11 12 as the number of infected patients and subsequent clinical demands increase the health system will enter stage 2 during which some educational activities are suspended and some fellows are shifted to patient care duties outside of their fellowship area to help shoulder the clinical burden of the health systems pandemic response although the fellowship continues to be governed by the existing common and specific program requirements the acgme has also added some qualifiers including the provision of adequate resources and training adequate supervision the maintenance of professionalism standards and the preservation of existing work hour limits full details available at wwwacgmeorgcovid-19 last accessed april 2nd 2020 board-eligible fellows may apply for and receive emergency credentialing from their respective health system so that they may function as attendings in anesthesiology to further aid in managing the increased clinical workload however the amount of time they spend outside of the clinical area of their fellowship may not exceed 20 of the fellowship year while surveys self-study and site visits will be suspended in stage 2 fellowship programs should do their best to continue with educational activities while accommodating for adequate social distancing and other local rules and policies regarding the size meetings or gatherings thankfully there are a variety of technology-based solutions that allow for the continuation of educational activities under such restrictions including remote video- and audio-conferencing technology internet-based resources and similar innovative toolsas clinical demands surge along with the local covid-19 positive population the health system will enter stage 3 the acgme has termed this phase pandemic emergency status which they define as the deployment of most fellows to patient care areas outside of the normal fellowship scope and the suspension of most educational sessions full details available at wwwacgmeorgcovid-19 last accessed april 2nd 2020 in this crisis mode the fellowship is governed by the following four overriding requirements respect for work hour limits the provision of adequate resources and training maintenance of adequate supervision and the potential for fellows to function as attendings in their core specialty of anesthesiology the other requirements for stages 1 and 2 as well as for the fellowship subspecialty are waived during stage 3this road map provided by the acgme allows the health system to plan a phased response to the covid-19 pandemic depending on its local intensity the fellowship leadership can then synchronize accordingly at all levels as outlined in the sections belowthe designated institutional official and the graduate medical office will lead the navigation through the response phases to the pandemic as outlined by the acgme and thus serves as always its vital central oversight function across the training landscape at a given institution13 this central leadership from the institutional graduate medical education gme team will likely consider the following recommended principles to engage and support the graduate medical community through the covid-19 crisis a clear strategy to cope with patient volume and acuity protecting and supporting the fellows on the front lines of patient care a transparent and fair strategy for allocation of health care resources and the deployment of an adaptable and open communication policy with weekly townhall-style meetings that take advantage of innovative platforms such as remote conferencing technology8 the fellowship program director should be very familiar with all this content to guide the fellowship faculty and trainees successfully through the ups and downs of the coronavirus crisis with focused planning training and teamwork in a fashion consistent with the phased acgme response to covid-198

9
the director and broader leadership team of the fellowship program should strive to maintain consistent and transparent communication not only with the educational leadership at the institutional level but also at the departmental level this includes the leader of the core anesthesiology residency program other fellowship directors the vice-chair for education and the departmental chair8

15 this regular dialogue will facilitate a seamless synchronization of the adult cardiothoracic fellowship with the departments integrated response to covid-19 especially in stages 2 and 3 this communication will help to ensure that the fellows have adequate training in the clinical area to which they are deployed are appropriately credentialed and receive the necessary supplies and equipment to protect themselves as they aid the department and health system in caring for covid-19 positive patients11

16 17 18
the normal fellowship timeline with its goals and activities should be managed as best as possible in stages 1 and 2 but will have to largely sacrificed in stage 3 depending on the intensity of the local covid-19 outbreak as outlined by the acgme19

20 this dynamic educational landscape offers multiple opportunities to mentor educational leaders including aspiring program directors to develop creative and collaborative solutions for the challenges of the coronavirus crisis for both the graduating and incoming fellows19 20 21 the phased response to the crisis intensity at the departmental level will be greatly enhanced with an integrated response from the fellowship leadership21 22 23
the program leadership should endeavor to maintain an open and approachable leadership style with the faculty and fellows the interpretation and implementation of the information and policies from the acgme institutional graduate medical office and the department leadership can be led and facilitated at the fellowship level by the program director13

15

19 a regular series of townhall-style meetings will allow the fellows to be heard and express their concerns and ideas for addressing the impact of the coronavirus crisis including the clinical educational and emotional considerations2 3 4

24 of note fellows should be re-assured that the clinical minimums set by the acgme are a means to evaluate programs themselves not individual fellows thus the decision as to whether an individual fellow will graduate from a training program is up to the program director and larger clinical competency committee irrespective of whether all minimum case numbers have been met10

13

15 the acgme has also stated that the covid-19 crisis and its effects on fellowship case logs will be taken into account when program reviews eventually restart full details available at wwwacgmeorgcovid-19 last accessed april 3rd 2020another aspect that program directors must take into consideration is the psychological and emotional consequences of quarantine24 25 the psychological effects of quarantine are significant and may affect fellows who are quarantined due to exposure to or infection with covid-19 or who are well but live in an area of community lockdown with social distancing to minimize the risks of viral transmission24 25 these effects include confusion anger depression burn-out and post-traumatic stress disorder24 given the significant effects of quarantine on psychological well-being program directors should be aware of these issues and be constantly vigilant for their signs in the fellowship classfurther stressors that fellows or faculty may be facing include known psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression which are commonly exacerbated during times of crisis additional factors that may aggravate stress include marital status number of children and perceived level of exposure although the evidence is not consistent about these issues24 25 26 clinical investigation about factors that may negatively impact psychological wellbeing during periods of quarantine has revealed several triggers including the duration of quarantine anxiety levels about infection levels of frustration and boredom inadequate supplies and personal protective equipment and disordered communication24 25 26 27 after quarantine has ended ongoing stressors that may slow psychological recovery include financial losses and the effects of social stigma24
since the effects of quarantine may occur through all phases of the covid-19 response program directors should consider processes to recognize and manage these issues in their fellows interventions that may minimize the effects of quarantine and social distancing include a focused approach to the fellows with regular open communication frequent information sharing adequate supplies and personal protective equipment as well an emphasis on collective responsibility and teamwork24 25 26 27 the fellowship team can manage these challenges with due cognizance of these factors in concert with departmental institutional and national guidancethe coronavirus crisis has challenged fellowship training in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology the magnitude of this challenge is proportional to the intensity of the covid-19 crisis the program leadership should coordinate their strategies in concert with input from the institution department faculty and fellows the successful navigation of this crisis should focus on patient care as well the physical and psychological safety of the fellows

nonethe perception of the covid-19 pandemic in my homeland croatia has been based on two main sources of information over the past three weeks on the one hand our civil protection headquarters as well as all of the experts and scientists to whom media space has been provided called for caution but without any panic they emphasized that this was not a cataclysm but an epidemic involving a serious respiratory infectious disease the cause of this disease is the new coronavirus for which we do not have a vaccine therefore it can be expected that the disease will be very dangerous for the elderly and to those who are already ill so it was an unknown danger worthy of caution but our epidemiologists remained calm they knew that they would be able to estimate the epidemics development using data and then control the situation with anti-epidemic measures and through several lines of defence 1on the other hand the people of croatia also followed the events in italy from there day after day apocalyptic news came with incredibly large numbers of infected and dead daily reports from italy seemed completely incompatible with what the experts and scientists in croatia were saying some have concluded that a scenario similar to that in italy if not worse is inevitable for croatia the population was in a very confusing situationin this text i will try to penetrate the very core of the infodemia that has been present in the media across many european countries as well as on social networks over the past three weeks i will explain how that disturbing situation arose and offer a scientific explanation for it this seems important at this point because the italian tragedy with the covid-19 epidemic has unfortunately hindered the credible and scientifically-based communication of the epidemiological profession to the population of croatiain my article 20 key questions and answers on coronavirus posted on the 9th of march 2020 on indexhr 1 in answer to question number 18 with the effectiveness of quarantine in china can we draw some lessons from this pandemic i statedif the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the public health systems of individual countries are functioning these will be very important lessons in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerouswe are now slowly entering a phase where many countries have been exposed to the pandemic for sufficiently long to be able to make some first estimates of their results from these days up until the end of the pandemic we will see that covid-19 will divide the world into countries that have relied on epidemiology and followed the maths and the logic of the epidemic as well as those in which this isnt the case and many sadly probably quite unnecessarily  will sufferan epidemic is a serious threat to entire nations during which citizens interest in other topics may vanish quite rapidly we could see that happening quite clearly in the past several weeks the task of epidemiologists is to constantly have tables in front of them with a large number of epidemic parameters reliable field figures and formulas to monitor the epidemics development and to know the laws of epidemics in order to organize the implementation of anti-epidemic measures in a timely manner and thus protect the populationnow lets look at the countries that we can already point out as being successful in their response to this new challenge first and foremost there is china it has completely suppressed the huge epidemic in wuhan which spread to all thirty of its provinces in doing so it relied on the advice of its epidemiologic legend 83-year-old zhong nanshan twenty years ago nanshan gained authority by suppressing sars although surprised by the epidemic they managed to suppress covid-19 throughout china through expert and determined measures they did so over just seven weeks with the death toll eventually coming to a halt at less than 4000 2 by comparison it would be as if the number of deaths in croatia as a result of this epidemic was kept at around 14 in totalfurthermore if at some point you find yourself caught up in the uncertainty surrounding the danger of covid-19 you should be able to learn more if you look at the state of things in singapore despite intensive exchanges of people and goods with china since the outbreak of the epidemic singapore has a total of 732 infected people as i am writing this article with two dead and 17 more in intensive care 2 for a long time this city-state has been nurturing the ambition to lead the world in all measurable parameters from this it must be concluded that the developments in singapore are a likely reflection of the real danger of covid-19 in a country that is based on knowledge technology good organization and general responsibility also singapore had a relatively recent sars experience and learned from it so they built capacity and ensured speed in their response to future challenges the situation in singapore therefore is an indicator of the effects of the virus on the population to the extent that it is truly unavoidableany deviation towards something worse than the singaporean results will be less and less of a consequence of the danger of the virus itself and increasingly attributable to human omissions in doing so human errors that can lead to the unnecessary spread of the infection are 1 omission to properly understand the epidemic parameters 2 reluctance to make decisions based on the changes in those parameters and 3 the irresponsible behavior of the population in complying with instructions from the authoritiesto confirm the statements about singapore lets look at the current situation in other countries that rely on knowledge and expertise and have good organization they were also the most common destinations for the spread of the epidemic from china in the first wave hong kong japan south korea the united arab emirates and qatar there were only 519 infected people in hong kong at the time of writing this article with 4 deaths and 5 more people in a serious condition in japan 1499 were infected 49 were dead and 56 were in a serious condition in south korea which had a severe epidemic behind its first line of defence 9478 were infected 144 died and 59 were seriously ill in the united arab emirates 405 were infected 2 died and 2 were seriously ill and in qatar 562 were infected 6 were seriously ill and still no one had died from covid-19 2fortunately croatia is now up there with all of these countries with 657 infected 5 dead and 14 more seriously ill 2 as you can see pretty clearly from all of these figures in countries that rely on the knowledge and the profession and properly applied anti-epidemic measures covid-19 is a disease that should not be life-threatening for more than a tiny percentage of all infected people this conclusion can still be reached if it is properly understood that the information on the number of cases and deaths at the website httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus 2 is based on positive tests and not on everyone who is actually infected we need to do further research to understand the denominator for the case-fatality rate properlywhat then is happening in italy as well as in spain but to a good extent also in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and portugal i did not include germany sweden the netherlands the united kingdom and the united states in this group of countries for now this is because at least for some time during the pandemic they have clung to the idea of intentionally letting the virus spread and infect at least part of the populationgiven all of the previous examples of a successful epidemiological response and what is now practically the coexistence of people with the new coronavirus in asias most developed countries how is it possible for italy to have nearly 85 000 infected people and over 9000 deaths at the time of this article or that spain has 72 000 infected people and more than 5600 deaths and france has almost 33 000 infected people and 2000 deaths or that even switzerland which everyone would expect to see among the most successful countries in any of these world rankings could already have 13 250 infected people and 240 deaths with 203 more critically ill people 2 the causes of all of this are however becoming increasingly clear to sciencefirst of all there was probably a premature relaxation around the real danger of covid-19 in europe the epidemic development by the end of february was already quite similar to the one seen previously with sars and mers in both of those epidemics the primary focal point was suppressed then the virus was stopped using the first line of defence  identifying all those infected tracing their contacts and isolating them all  in more than 25 countries by the end of february 2020 it was already clear in the case of covid-19 that it would be successfully suppressed in its primary focal point  wuhan it was also already stopped using the first line of defence in another thirty chinese provinces and surrounding countries in asia then on the 28th of february the first estimates of death rates were published suggesting that it was a disease with a death rate significantly lower than that of sars and mers 34 at that time it was reasonable to expect that the epidemic could soon be stopped as a result the world health organisation delayed the declaration of a pandemic until the 11th of march and the world stock markets increased by about 10 percent from the 27th of february to the 3rd of march 56 but for any unknown virus premature relaxation is very dangerous as will be shown later with covid-19second it is possible that chinese tourists from wuhan were visiting northern italy in january and february 2020 fever does not accompany all covid-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission is possible so infected tourists could have been allowed to enter italy even where proper checks at the airports were in place 4 italy cancelled flights linking it directly with china on january 31 following the news of the epidemic spread 7 some investigative journalists hypothesized although this has not been confirmed that it may be possible that the phenomenon of the mass immigration of chinese workers to northern italy may have contributed to the early introduction and spread of the virus 8 tens of thousands of chinese migrants work in the italian textile industry producing fashion items leather bags and shoes with the brand made in italy they worked in conditions where they were cramped closely together which would facilitate the spread 8-10 reuters and the reporter d t max wrote about this phenomenon back in 2014 and 2018 respectively 910 partly as a result of this development direct flights between wuhan and italy were introduced previous reports claimed that there may be many illegal migrants among those workers 910 whether through chinese tourists textile workers or through some other route the novel coronavirus has triggered an epidemic behind the back of the italian first line of defence which remained unrecognized in the first few weeksthird infected people from northern italy spent their weekends at european ski resorts although we do not know if the arrival of the warmer weather will stop the transmission of coronavirus what we can assume is that the cold helped it to spread that is why european ski resorts became real nurseries of coronavirus in late february and in early march as many media reported 1112 in this way more infected people emerged behind the front lines of defence in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and spain their first lines of epidemiological defence focused on air transport from asia not on their own skiing returnees where indeed no one would expect a large number of chinese people from wuhan to befourth although spain may not have had as many skiers as other european countries in this cluster the virus may have been introduced to them through a biological bomb on the 19th of february a champions league football match was held between italys atalanta and spains valencia atalanta is a team from a small city of bergamo italy which has 120 000 inhabitants this was possibly the biggest game in atalantas history as it progressed through group stages to the last 16 in the european champions league the local stadium was not large enough for everyone who wanted to attend the game so it was moved to a large san siro stadium in milan the official attendance was 45 792 meaning that a third of bergamos population with around 30 busses travelled from bergamo to milan and then wandered the streets of milan before the game 1314 unfortunately for spain nearly 2500 valencia fans also travelled to the match as atalanta scored four goals a third of bergamos population was hugging and kissing in the cold weather four times and spent the day closely together this is likely why it became the worst-hit region of italy by some distance moreover at least a third of valencia football squad also got infected with a virus and later played alaves in the spanish league where further players of that team got infected this football game has certainly contributed to the virus making its way to spain 14fifth it is very important for the early development of the epidemiological situation in each country to look at which subset of the population the virus has spread among northern italy has a very large number of very old people in the early stages of the epidemic the virus began to spread in hospitals and retirement homes 1516 they did not have nearly enough capacities to assist in severe cases among already sick elderly and immunocompromised people the virus spread more easily and faster and had a significantly higher death rate in some other countries such as germany most of the patients in the early stages were between the ages of 20 and 60 and were returning from skiing trips or were business people 17 therefore such countries have a significantly lower death rate among those first infectedsixth this is likely the most important factor required to explain the current situation in italy and other european union eu countries there must have been either the omission to monitor the mathematical parameters of the epidemic or perhaps the lack of clear communication of the dangers or the indecisiveness to adopt isolation measures for the population it is difficult to know at this time which of these three causes is the most important  a combination of them all is entirely possible however the nature of the omission largely explains the terrible figures on infections and deaths that are being reported from italy and other eu countries on a daily basisto understand the tragedy in italy and europe we must first return to wuhan when the epidemic broke out the chinese first had to isolate the virus then they needed to read its genetic code and develop a diagnostic test it all took time as the epidemic spread rapidly throughout the city when they began testing for coronavirus between the 18th and the 20th of january they had double-digit numbers of infected people 3 those numbers apparently stagnated so the epidemiologists did not know what that might mean but on the 21st of january the number of newly infected people jumped to more than 100 on the 22nd of january it jumped to more than 200 3 this was a clear signal to chinese epidemiologists that an exponential increase in the number of infected people was occurring at that time they had nothing further to wait for or to think about if the virus breaks through the first line of defence  and the chinese didnt even have any since the epidemic started there unannounced  then a quarantine measure needs to be triggered this prevents the virus from spreading further and generating a large number of infected people through the exponential growth of the epidemicafter such a sudden declaration of quarantine in wuhan the huge epidemic wave had actually just begun to show everyone who was already infected began to develop the disease in the next several days the maximum daily number of new infected cases was reached on the 5th of february on that day alone as many as 3750 new patients were registered in wuhan 3 this means that the jump from about 125 to about 250 newly registered infected persons signals to epidemiologists that they should expect an epidemic surge in 14 days with as many as 3750 newly infected people at the peaklet us now explain the time delay between people getting infected with a virus and the health systems ability to detect those infected based on their symptoms the new coronavirus kills primarily because it spreads incredibly quickly among humans as a result it creates a gigantic number of infected and sick in a very short time period table 1 among those who are sick about 5 will require intensive hospital care if all of them could receive optimal care we would be able to save nearly everyone but if they all get very sick at the same time then we cannot offer adequate care to everyone as a result most critical cases will die this is the main reason why this virus kills so many people in those countries which allowed it to spread freely for too long this is shown in a simple way in this table based on day-to-day growth in a number of cases by 26 which was a very realistic scenario for most eu countrieswith this in mind let us now look at the italian and other eu countries reaction to their own epidemic in view of what croatia did in the early stages of infection spreading in a country one or two infected persons are usually detected dailypersonally i advised the croatian authorities and public through social networks to start seriously thinking about social exclusion measures when they noticed a first notable shift from the first 10 confirmed infections towards the first 20 infected people on the 12th of march i posted a facebook status entitled contrast is the mother of clarity which was viewed and shared by many thousands of my fellow croatians who have been following my popular science series on the pandemics  the quarantine of wuhan this status has also been shared by many online and printed newspapers and media in croatia including radio stations 18 in that status i suggested that croatia should consider a large quarantine because we had already jumped from 14 to 19 infected people the day before however i also warned them to weigh this decision carefully against economic implications and their expected long-term effects on health the very next day on the 13th of march a decision was made in croatia to close the schools 1819that meant that up to that point croatia completed two of the most important tasks in this pandemic the first task was to hold its first line of defence this was being achieved through the identification of infected cases imported from other countries and their isolation and that of all their contacts croatia completed this first task better than the other eu countries based on an average percentage increase of cases between the 3rd of march and the 17th of march then from march 13th croatia also began to introduce social exclusion measures at the right time thus successfully carrying out the second key task in controlling its own epidemic many credits for this should be attributed to its epidemiologists who work at the croatian institute for public healthbut what went wrong with these two measures in italy and other eu countries on the 21st of february the number of confirmed infected cases in italy jumped from 3 to 20 as italy is a more populous country than croatia it might have still been too hasty to send all of lombardy into quarantine based on this but on the 22nd of february the jump was from 20 to 62 cases and this should lead to some serious thought about social isolation measures a couple of days later on the 24th of february they reached a situation very similar to that in wuhan before a strict quarantine the number of confirmed infections jumped from 155 to 229 this was particularly worrying in italy because they did not seem to proactively test at that time eitherthe jump from 155 to 229 in combination with the wuhan experience should have suggested that they would have at least 50 000 infected people under the predicted curve of the epidemic wave and they were just seeing its early beginning of it such a large number would imply that about 2500 affected would require intensive care units at the time lombardy had only about 500 such units in governmentstate facilities and another 160 in private health care facilities 20 as early as the 24th of february it was clear that there would be many deaths in lombardy weeks later with epidemics everything goes awry because the infected get sick a week later and some of the patients then die ten to twenty days later this time delay is a critically important factor that needs to be taken into accounthowever even then the italians did not declare a quarantine they did not do so on the 29th of february either when the total number of infected people rose from 888 to 1128 those figures implied that in mere days they would be having about 15 000 newly infected people each day they did not declare quarantine on the 4th of march either when the number of infected people exceeded 3000 and when the world stock exchanges started to fall again it had then become clear to most epidemiologists who have been advising global investors that an unexpected tragedy was about to unravel in italy and this was now inevitable at that point italy already had at least 30 000 infected people spreading the infection the quarantine was declared for lombardy on the 8th of march 7 the day before the number of cases had already risen and exponentially so to as many as 5883to appreciate the problem with epidemic spread in the population behind the first line of defence this is similar to borrowing 1000 from someone on the 29th of february with an interest rate of 26 each day meaning an interest rate of 26 on top of that the next day and so on furthermore there did not seem to be enough clear and decisive communication with the public the news of the quarantine for lombardy was in fact leaked to the media before it was officially announced this led to a quick escape of many students to the south of the country to their homes carrying the contagion with them as a result on the 10th of march all of italy had to be quarantined 7in an already difficult situation where every new day of delay meant another thousand or more people dying as we can all notice these days there were numerous media reports warning that the population may not have taken those measures as seriously as the chinese when they introduced orders to their population in wuhan 2122 any indiscipline under such grave circumstances could have allowed the virus to take yet another step quite easily with each new step another 26 of interest was added to everything before that and then 26 on everything on everything before that again that is the power of exponential growth characteristic of the free spread of the virus in the populationmany italians and then spaniards as well as residents of several other wealthy countries in europe had their lives cut short by their lack of recognition of the dangers of exponential function during the spread of the epidemic delaying quarantine for a week made the epidemic ten times worse than it should have been delaying it for two weeks made it a hundred times worse and after two weeks of it being finally proclaimed all those who may have not taken the orders seriously enough would have made the epidemic several hundred times worse this means that in italy and possibly in spain too we are now observing the covid-19 epidemic that is more than a hundred times worse than it should have been in a country that was much better prepared for the response such as singapore taiwan hong kong or the united arab emiratesto appreciate what is happening in italy it is enough to think of this sentence alone at least 100 times fewer people would die each day if quarantine had been declared 2 weeks earlier and had the population stuck to the recommendations during those fourteen days between 23rd of february and 7th of march they allowed the virus to spread freely and infect a huge number of people  maybe even up to a million or perhaps more it is very difficult to know at this point this would mean tens of thousands of people in need of intensive care with about ten times fewer units available nationwide about half of those who fall seriously ill will not survive without the necessary support at this point whenever we hear that 1000 people died in italy in one day we should know that the casualties would only add up to 10 had the quarantine been declared just a couple of weeks earlier i appreciate that it seems implausible that the delay of a political decision like the introduction of quarantine by just two weeks may mean the difference between 100 deaths and 10 000 deaths in the 21st century however i am afraid that this is unfortunately the reality of the exponential growth of the number of infected during an epidemicwhat does this mean for the public in countries like croatia who were confused and in awe of the events in italy they should know that they did not observe what the covid-19 epidemic should actually look like in a country where the epidemiological service and its communication with those in power works well as it does in singapore taiwan or south korea in italy we have unfortunately noticed the consequence of a free spread of the epidemic for too long such a development was not predictable the biggest surprise of this pandemic to date to the community of epidemiologists is undoubtedly the lack of response by the authorities of many eu countries to the apparent spread of the pandemic at an exponential rate for weeks leading to a very large numbers of infected people in a very short time it is even more surprising that although the italian example exposed this problem quite clearly a similar scenario is now happening in several other european countrieshow and why could this happen in italy and then in other countries in the european union eu i will try to offer at least some hypotheses first eu countries have been living in prosperity for decades focused mainly on their economies aside from the economic questions they have not had any challenges that theyve had to answer to swiftly and decisively that would measure up to this one back in the 1960s vaccines were introduced against most major infectious diseases especially childhood ones malaria is no longer present in europe and tuberculosis has been treated similarly for decades the challenge of hivaids in the 1980s is now being successfully controlled with antiretroviral drugs liver inflammation is treated mainly by clinicians the impact of influenza is controlled through vaccination while rare zoonoses are resolved with immunoprophylaxis even sexually transmitted infectious diseases stds are no longer as significant since the vaccine for human papillomavirus hpv was licensedthe last real epidemic that concerned europe was the hong kong flu which occurred back in 1968 and 1969 the broad field of biomedicine offers such a wide range of exciting career paths to all those students who study it these days but the epidemiology of infectious diseases is not really one of them  or at least it hasnt been in europe for a very long time it has probably begun to seem like an archaic medical profession to the majority of students and young medical doctors it seemed to belong to the past for the european continent which made it one of the least attractive things to specialize ineven the rare epidemiologists who specialized in infectious diseases have begun retraining for chronic non-communicable diseases due to the aging of europes population which is particularly the case in italy and spain it seems that at least some eu countries may have fallen victims to their own decades-long success in the fight against infectious diseases they faced this unexpected pandemic with few experts that could have had any experience in these events asian countries as well as canada have had enough recent experience with sars and mers but some european countries seem to have forgotten how to fight infectious diseases if it were not for the legacy of the great croatian epidemiologist social medicine expert and global public health pioneer dr andrija tampar and the relatively recent war in croatia it is difficult to say whether or not croatia would be as ready as it has proven itself to beanother factor that would understandably undermine the italian response was that no one before italy in fact could have observed how fast covid-19 was spreading among the population the greatest danger of covid-19 is its accelerated exponential spread when it breaks through the first line of defence but before italy only the chinese in wuhan and the iranians had experienced the free spread of the infection among their population after five days of monitoring the number of infected the chinese had to quarantine the entire wuhan and then further 15 cities a day later in order to contain the virus they did not know how many infected people were there outside of wuhans hospitals for iran however only a few knew exactly what was happening as that country is significantly isolated internationally due to political reasons the koreans however had a limited local epidemic but not an uncontrolled free spread  they caught the virus using their first line of defencethat is how the italians ended up becoming the first country in the highly developed world to monitor their epidemic spreading uncontrollably among the population the only estimate of the rate of spread of the virus to date has been in the scientific work of li et al from the 29th of january 23 however it was difficult to subsequently determine r0 parameter on the first 425 patients in wuhan the estimate of the r0 for covid-19 in their article was 22 but with a very wide confidence interval  from 14 to 39 it is a bit of tough luck for the italians again that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 14 exactly this figure is well known to all epidemiologists its the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community it should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that with more data r0 for covid-19 would start converging more towards 14 unfortunately the more recent data suggests that r0 is more likely to lean towards 39 implying an incredibly fast spread thus the greatest danger of covid-19 remained unrecognized in italy until the 8th of march quarantine measures at least 100 times fewer people would be dying in italy these days had they declared a quarantine for lombardy two weeks earlier than they didjust a few days ago an extremely useful piece of scholarly work authored by onder et al became available 24 their contribution finally provided answers to the three great unknowns about covid-19 many hypotheses have been presented in the media to explain the developments in italy since the very outbreak of the epidemic but thanks to just one simple table we can now dispel most of themthe first is the question that has plagued us for a long time  how dangerous is covid-19 for younger age groups it is clear that the media will tend to single out individual cases of death in younger people as they are of most public interest however it is interesting that until recently we didnt really have decent data on this in the public domain the first reason was that the chinese centre for disease control reported all deaths in the chinese epidemic using age groups structure that contained a very large age group of 30-79 years it only separated children up to 10 years then adolescents up to 20 years then 20-29 year-olds followed by this broad age group 30-79 years and those who were 80 years or older that is why the work of onder and colleagues is commendable as they subdivided this large group from china into 10-year age groups this finally allowed a comparison between the first 1023 deaths in wuhan up to the 11th of february with the first 1625 deaths in italy up to the 17th of march the comparison is shown in table 2it gives us some very important insightsfirst in italy more than half of the deaths initially were among people who were older than 80 years of age and a total of 88 of the deaths occurred among the persons over 70 years of age so contrary to the impression that individual media reports can easily make covid-19 is a very dangerous disease mainly for old people moreover a recent study by a and g remuzzi 25 showed that among 827 deaths in italy the vast majority of those people were already severely ill with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease diabetes and malignancies this is what epidemiologists expected because a more severe flu would have had a similar effect if there was no vaccine available however i doubt that the general public has the proper insight into this issue from the prevalent media reportssecond it was suggested in the media across europe that the virus in italy may have mutated and become much more dangerous however table 2 shows that death rates by the age of 70 are practically the same in china and italy then although the case fatality rate appears to be about 50 greater in italy than in china for the age group 70-79 this does not suggest that the virus may have mutated it is known that in wuhan many of the affected with a severe clinical presentation of covid-19 could rely on the two newly built hospitals and respiratory aids that the military had brought in from other parts of china 26 they also had medical teams coming in from other provinces 26 in italy however there were not enough respirators for this age group and there werent enough doctors either as many of them themselves became infected 1620 for those two reasons i would in fact expect even a larger difference between italy and china than the one we are seeing so i would not attribute this observed difference to the impact of the virus itself and finally the reported difference in case-fatality rates for the oldest age group should also not be attributed to the virus it is more likely a consequence of the fact that italians of lombardy live on average longer than the chinese of wuhan 27 therefore there are significantly more people in the oldest age group in italy ranging to much higher ages so the two oldest groups are not really comparable the average age of the italians in the age group 80 years or older is significantly greater than the average age of the oldest chinese age group therefore the table shows practically equal death rates across all age groups on sufficiently large samples meaning that the virus did not mutate in italy from the virus we see from wuhan at least not until the 17th of march 2020third and perhaps most importantly  this chart has now made it quite clear that covid-19 does not in fact kill people under the age of 50 unless they have some sort of underlying disease or some unknown achilles heel in their immune system that makes them particularly susceptible to the virus there are such cases with every infectious disease they are also present during the flu epidemics but they are extremely rare this suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses here after this table it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available however at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years toothere is another strangeness to the situation in italy that will not be intuitive to the general public the actual number of deaths attributable to covid-19 in italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends namely at present due to the sole focus on the epidemic most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to covid-19 however once the epidemic is over it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years it could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month or a year even without being infected with the new coronavirus it is possible that among some of them covid-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels and those above expected levels will then be attributed to covid-19this article provides an explanation from the epidemiologists point of view for most of the events reported so far in italy and then followed in spain and other european countries a combination of an early relaxation over this epidemic systematic lack of expertise in the field of epidemic infectious diseases in europe likely inexperience in containing epidemic spread in this generation of health workers relaxed immigration regulations for workers in certain industries champions league football event and a series of further misfortunes and omissions have all been implied so far in the media as contributors to the late withdrawal of lombardy into quarantine this allowed through exponential growth for a large number of people to be infected in a very short time  far too large for health systems of italy and other eu countries to cope with severe forms of illness led to many deaths due to respiratory failure in 88 of cases people over 70 years of age died who had underlying illnesses in the large majority of cases this viewpoint is based on the first 1625 deaths in italy and by the time of this writing there are now more than 10 000 dead given the size of the population this would correspond to 670 deceased in croatia if croatia manages not to follow the numbers of deceased seen in italy this will mostly be attributable to social exclusion measures being introduced early enough for its health system to come with severe casesthese days the people of italy spain and other european countries are suffering large losses a significant underlying cause may be the problem that the human brain simply cannot intuitively grasp the power of exponential growth nor that two weeks of delay could make the difference between 100 and 10 000 deaths any physics enthusiasts will know the quote attributed to the great albert einstein who is often cited saying that compound interest which leads to exponential growth is the most powerful force in the universe or the eighth wonder of the world he who understands it earns it he who doesnt pays it 28on december 31 2019 the wuhan municipal health commission informed the world health organization who china country office about cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in wuhan city hubei province of china 12 on january 9 2020 the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported that 15 of the 59 cases of pneumonia were caused by a novel coronavirus later named sars-cov-2 the virus causing covid-19 3 on the same day information about the new coronavirus was presented to the international community through the international health regulations ihr alert system immediately after receiving this announcement the chief sanitary inspectorate which is a public administration authority involved in public health services in poland established a response team responsible for developing guidelines and evidence-based strategies for controlling the sars-cov-2 epidemic 4 the present study aimed to 1 present public health interventions aimed at mitigating the early spread of sars-cov-2 implemented in poland between january 9 and march 29 2020 and 2 analyze the potential impact of these regulations on the early phase of the covid-19 outbreak in polandstarting from january 9 2020 the chief sanitary inspectorate has analyzed the epidemiological data and international recommendations published by the who the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the ihr and early warning and response system ewrs messages on january 20 the first travel warning for the novel coronavirus pandemic was released 8 this travel warning provided brief information on 205 cases of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus as well as recommendations for travelers planning to travel to wuhan china on january 22 the committee on epidemiology infectious diseases and vaccinations developed a case definition of suspected covid-19 9 moreover healthcare professionals were informed about guidelines for dealing with suspected covid-19 casesthe first european case was reported from bordeaux france on january 24 2020 10 in response to the occurrence of the first imported covid-19 case in europe the chief sanitary inspectorate prepared a standard of passengers location cards and leaflets about covid-19 for returnees from east and southeast asia 11 on january 25 2 days after the wuhan city lock-down the first group of polish students on an academic exchange in wuhan returned to poland all students returning from wuhan city were hospitalized in the infectious disease wards and laboratory tests excluded sars-cov-2 infection 12 on january 27 germany declared its first confirmed covid-19 case 13 this was the first case of covid-19 in a country neighboring poland the key activity in the last week of january was constant monitoring of the sanitary and epidemiological situation at the border administrative regions voivodships airports and seaports all airport procedures were regularly updated to reflect the current epidemiological situation 14 on january 30 the who declared the coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern pheic 15on february 2 a group of 30 poles was evacuated from wuhan china the operation was conducted under the leadership of france in cooperation with the european union eu 16 after landing in france polish citizens were transported by military plane from marseille to wroclaw and then hospitalized in a military hospital at the

deaths related to covid-19 40 globally more than 600 000 covid-19 cases and over 30 000 deaths were reported as of march 29 2020 40in poland compared to other european countries far-reaching solutions were implemented relatively early to reduce the spread of infection six days after the first laboratory-confirmed covid-19 case all mass events in poland were banned all schools and universities were closed 8 days after the first covid-19 case after 11 days significant travel restrictions and the 14 days self-quarantine obligation for travelers were introduced due to the ongoing epidemic it is too early to forecast the impact of the adopted policies on the spread of sars-cov-2 in poland further studies should compare the impact of different public health interventions intended to mitigate the spread of coronavirus across the eu countriescoronavirus is a large family of viruses with a variety of hosts some types of coronavirus circulate in humans and result in mild illness such as the common cold other members of the coronavirus family have zoonotic origins and cause severe illness when contracted by humans examples of zoonotic coronavirus types causing severe illness in humans are severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus sars-cov transmitted from civet cats and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov transmitted from dromedary camels there are several other strains of coronavirus known in animals that have not yet been reported to have infected any humans covid-19 is spread from person to person through droplets2 and there are indications it may also be airborne3

the current world outbreak of covid-19 is caused by a new coronavirus that emerged in 2019 called sars-cov-25 although patient zero has not been determined 9 cases of covid-19 are now suspected of having come to medical attention in wuhan china in november 2019 the number of cases increased rapidly reaching 27 suspected cases by december 15 and 60 by december 20 20196 current estimates are the number of infected persons worldwide doubles every 2 to 3 days7 as of march 25 2020 there were 438749 confirmed cases and 19675 confirmed deaths due to covid-19 throughout the world covid-19 has been reported in 172 countries as of march 25 2020 at the time the overall death rate in the world was 448 but ranged from 985 in italy to 051 in germany and 123 in the united statessince the 1970s approximately 40 emerging infectious diseases have been identified including sars mers ebola zika avian influenza and swine influenza with increased travel on a global and regional scale and urban expansion there is significant potential for the rapid spread of emerging infectious diseases and pandemics another possibility is the deliberate introduction of diseases into human animal or plant populations as part of a terrorist act known weaponized agents include anthrax smallpox and tularemiamultiple factors lead to the emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases some are natural processes and others are the result of human behavior these factors also contribute to the rapid worldwide transmission of these diseases in fact the close proximity of gatherings in addition to environmental factors during air and sea travel appear to hasten the spread of respiratory viruses such as sars-cov-2 the limited available space on both ships and airplanes not only creates confined spaces for airborne droplet transmission but also provides abundant fomites for disease transmission because of large groups of people sharing common areas such as dining areas and restrooms door handles serving utensils and other objects are repeatedly handled and hand hygiene may not be consistently performed cruise ships appear to be an extremely high-risk environment for virus transmissionin 1984 the ndms was formed as part of the public health service in hhs as a partnership between the federal emergency management agency the dod and the department of veterans affairs the purpose of the ndms was to provide medical evacuation and definitive care of evacuated military and civilian casualties from overseas war contingencies with a secondary mission to supplement state and local medical resources during disasters and emergencies8 in 2003 after 911 the convening authority over the ndms was granted to the federal emergency management agency within the department of homeland security after hurricane katrina the ndms was reorganized under the hhs as legislated by an act of congress to provide administrative and operational control as outlined in the public health service act of 2006 and amended by the pandemic and all-hazards preparedness act of 2006 and the pandemic and all-hazards preparedness reauthorization act preparedness and advancing innovation act of 20199
forward thinking in conjunction with an increased tempo of military operations resulted in a diverse focus that included the need to assist with air medical staging and broader humanitarian efforts this initially led to the development of the mobile acute care strike team which was intended to serve as a critical care resuscitation and stabilization unit to hold patients awaiting departure from a disaster air medical staging facility dasf patients would arrive from their point of injuryillness to the dasf to await dod flights to definitive care the dasf is often collocated with a us air force medical group which provides care to less acute patients and serves as a liaison for military air transport during a busy hurricane season in 2017 the need for nonmilitary critical care air transport was identified and the concept behind the hhs aet was born the hhs ae team is composed of active critical care and air transport providers who have received training through 2 pathways the us air force school of aerospace medicine critical care air transport program 2-4 weeks or the hhs partnership with florida international university air medical evacuation course 1-2 weeks after training these providers have participated in ongoing validation with multiple air medical transport teams nationwidein the late 1970s the us army medical response institute of infectious diseases created the air aeromedical isolation team it was designed to safely care for and evacuate contagious patients in high-level containment conditions it was primarily intended for bioterrorism response and extraction of scientists or health care workers with infections in foreign countries early missions focused on hemorrhagic fevers and although it was deployed only 4 times the team also was used in an advisory capacity for respiratory illnesses to include sars and multidrug-resistant tuberculosisa cooperative development effort between the us government and the world health organization resulted in phoenix air developing the airborne biological containment system this single-patient negative-pressure isolation unit was designed for use on their gulfstream iii aircraft during the 2014 ebola outbreak this system was used to transport 41 patients to medical facilities in the united states and europe the need for increased capability led to the development of the containerized bio-containment system which is able to transport 4 infectious patients in an intensive care unit environment in conjunction with the dos contract the containerized biological containment system was used on overseas repatriation missions inside a boeing 747-400 aircraft which was reconfigured for mixed passengercargo work fig 1
because of the complex setting of air medical evacuation for a highly contagious infectious disease especially found in repatriation missions that often involve long distances patients must be optimized before transport only patients likely to survive transport will be evacuated especially in the case of pulmonary insult which is predominant in sars patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may need to complete therapy before air medical evacuation the physiologic effects of flight and confinement can be difficult for healthy patients much less those with extensive pathology dependent on the specific platform used for the mission mechanical ventilation may not be possible further necessitating stabilization before transport additionally patients with hemodynamic instability severe anemia and conditions that may be aggravated at altitude eg a pneumothorax bowel obstruction and pneumocephalus should be treated before transporton january 29 2020 a chartered boeing 747 transported the first american citizens and their immediate family from wuhan china to march air force base riverside county ca10 in early february 4 additional flights transported the remainder to several other military sites a total of approximately 800 passengers were repatriated via charter flights from wuhan to the united states these flights represented a joint effort between the dos hhs and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in-flight medical monitoring was provided by dos medical teams supplemented by an infectious disease specialist from wuhan to us military bases in california two of those flights continued from travis air force base ca miramar marine corps air station san diego ca lackland air force base tx and camp ashland ne carrying several hundred of the wuhan evacuees with hhs aets on board to provide medical monitoring and support at those military bases the evacuees were screened for signs and symptoms of covid-19 and placed into medical facilities or quarantinecruise ships have long been recognized as a potential hotbed during infectious events in the past they were primarily associated with gastrointestinal disturbances such as norovirus covid-19 demonstrated the ease of transmission and highlighted additional areas of concern with the general demographic found on cruise ships the average age of passengers is 469 years with a median age between 60 and 69 years11 this increased age is associated with multiple comorbidities that have proven to be a hallmark of covid-19 mortality12 early outbreaks on the diamond princess and the grand princess delivered a grim realitythe close quarters of the cruise ship environment allowed covid-19 to spread almost unchecked quickly increasing among crew and passengers recognizing the inherent danger to passengers and threat to public health during this epidemic cruise lines international association the worlds largest cruise industry trade association announced on march 13 2020 that it was following cdc guidance and temporarily suspending ocean-going cruise operations from us ports of call for 30 days13
on february 4 2020 while off the coast of japan the diamond princess cruise ship was identified as having multiple covid-19positive patients and placed into quarantine of the 3711 persons on board the ship all were tested 712 returned as positive and 12 later died there were 338 us citizens evacuated by dos medical crews on 2 boeing 747s to quarantine centers in california and texas where they were received by hhs personnel there were 14 known positives who were transported on hhs-contracted air flights in an isolation area of the aircraft and an additional 5 patients were placed into isolation during the flights after developing a fever known or suspected positives were taken to local medical treatment facilities upon arrival and 13 were taken to a treatment facility in nebraska those who became positive or symptomatic during quarantine were also transported to local area hospitals after local hospital evaluation some cruise ship evacuees in california were flown via learjet to medical treatment facilities closer to their home with hhs aetson march 9 2020 the grand princess made an early return to the port of oakland with 3533 persons on board including 21 known to be covid-19 positive most american passengers were debarked from the ship and transferred to federal quarantine centers most foreign nationals including many crewmembers were returned to their home country as coordinated between the dos foreign governments and the cruise line the remainder of the crew and a few foreign nationals would remain quarantined on the ship until repatriated to their home country by the cruise lineafter the us citizens disembarked from the grand princess they were transported by hhs aets using boeing 737s to federal quarantine centers in california texas and georgia after disbursement to federal centers the patients were decompressed by a 737 learjet or regional jet to their state of residence for screening and home quarantine during these flights 2 patients became symptomatic requiring hospital transfer upon arrival at the destinationwith the unheralded scale of known covid-19positive patients and puis requiring air transport first from china and later from the 2 princess ships new methodologies were adopted from previous recommended techniques14

15 the cdcs guidance for air medical transport of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients16 and guidance on air medical transport for middle east respiratory syndrome patients17 were used as the primary reference document this document was used on the initial dos flights from china and only slight modifications were made over timeefforts were made to transport known positives only with known positives and cohort puis with puis the hhs aet crew was limited to the minimum necessary staffing for the various airframe used in accordance with federal aviation administration regulations and ndms care standards infection control precautions focused on the following source and engineering controls personal protective equipment ppe safe work practices to limited contamination and containment of the area of potential contaminationsource control to limit potential droplet transmission distance was used by offering all passengers masks and ensuring that known positive patients wore n95 masks and puis wore at least standard surgical masks another source control measure taken by passengers on initial repatriation flights from china was the wearing of diapers in order to avoid potential fecal exposure during transportengineering controls used plastic sheeting fig 2
 to isolate an area to segregate and treat patients who developed symptoms while airborne this was primarily at the rear of the plane to allow a separate egress to avoid additional exposure to the nonsymptomatic patients for long flights an additional area was created if possible in the forward section of the aircraft to allow crew to doff ppe for hydration and lavatory use although use was discouraged because of the nature of the enclosed cabin airflow concessions were madeidentical ppe was used for known positive and pui flights for those in close proximity of patients  6 ft crews used tyvek suits with booties and a hood a double layer of gloves either taped in place or secured with a thumbhole technique to prevent sleeve gap and either a powered air-purifying respirator or an n95 mask with a face shield fig 3
 for those outside the 6-ft range pilots and flight attendants a fitted n95 mask and gloves were worn at a minimum oftentimes a gown and face shield were also wornsafe work practices were used which included mandatory aircraft surface decontamination airflow exchanges between flights and lavatories inside the protected area identified for crew use only attempts were also made to not recirculate cabin air during the flight finally frequent hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution was usedmultiple fixed wing platforms were used throughout the operation on flights performed by the hhs aet during the early operation patients returned from asia on boeing 747 cargo planes that were configured with seating after arriving in the united states passengers who were identified as puis or tested positive for covid-19 were transported to medical facilities near the quarantine sites to decompress these facilities they were later flown via medically configured lear 35 jets to identified biocontainment centers because of the low acuity and ambulatory nature of these patients who were considered stable for air transport to the designated biocontainment centers they were seated in the rear of the aircraft providing the maximum isolation from flight and hhs aet crews in addition these patients always wore a barrier maskduring the later operations patients were initially flown from the point of cruise ship disembarkation to federal quarantine facilities via a boeing 737 after the establishment of state reception processes the quarantined evacuees were then transported to their state of residence for home quarantine via a boeing 737 regional jet learjet 35 or charter buswhile transporting patients on the boeing 737 patients remained in surgical masks and physical barriers with plastic sheeting were used there were 2 patients who developed symptoms during transport requiring sequestration in the identified isolation area evaluation and transport to medical facilities upon arrival and both tested positive for covid-19 the fixed wing aircraft used in the later flights have airflow patterns from rear to front there are 747 models with front to rear airflow this is obviously problematic when the potentially infectious patients are located at the rear of the aircraft of note rotor wing transport was not used but generally lacks consistent airflow patternsthere are specific considerations when evaluating an airframe for the transport of a potentially infectious patient as mentioned previously cabin airflow is a primary concern additionally the use of high-efficiency particulate air filtration the location of air outlets the directional airflow capabilities and the ability to isolate air mixing between the cockpit and patient care cabin should be considered aircraft with reduced postmission airing out time offer an added benefit it is essential that cabin ventilation remain on at all times including ground delays in aircraft with poorly controlled interior airflow such as rotor wing or other nonpressurized fixed wing aircraft physical barriers are essential all personnel should wear n95 or higher respiratory protection or use tight-fitting face pieces capable of delivering oxygen that has not mixed with cabin airideally the patient should be positioned as far downwind as possible unfortunately this is not possible in most civilian aircraft separate lavatory facilities should be identified for patients and crew with the patient location contained inside their area of occupancy if using stacked litters the patients of concern should be positioned in the lowest position in the tier ambulatory patients should be seated against the cabin sidewall and all should wear a surgical mask to reduce droplet contaminationthe medical equipment used was standardized for all patient flights the ndms uses a mobile lifesaver kit composed of an advanced life support medical kit airway bag and multifunction monitordefibrillator it is designed to manage 1 to 2 critical patients during initial stabilization and resuscitation because of its diverse capabilities this kit was sometimes used with an augmented pharmaceutical component for flights with planned returns to the base of operations the hard storage cases were often left behind to reduce load for flights anticipated to require a commercial return the cases were taken to facilitate secure transport clinicians identified ppe requirements before the flight and generally insured they had a minimum of 3 complete sets for unanticipated needsstaffing for flights was varied dependent on airframe and patient requirements teams used a rolling call list as flight operations for the day varied they were primarily composed of a physicianadvanced practice provider critical care nurse and respiratory therapist for learjet flights a combination of 2 clinicians was usedfatigue is a known stressor of flight in addition to altitude noise and vibration several other factors contributed to fatigue for the hhs aet members duty days were long with preflight preparation unanticipated delays and long flights many approached and occasionally exceeded 24 hours some crews required an additional day of charter or commercial flights to return to the original base of operations steps to mitigate fatigue included adding crews to the staffing rotation to maintain mission tempo and sustain operations postmission crew rest periods ranged from 8 to 12 hours before crews reentered the call rotation paying special attention to ppe doffing at mission completion to avoid contamination was essential this was accomplished with a spotter when staffing allowed as a result of the sustained high operational tempo crews were generally only on deployed rotation for 14 daysduring the initial hospital decompression involving americans who had been on board the diamond princess patients were primarily transported to treatment facilities in nebraska and washington state regarding passengers disembarking from the grand princess the first phase involved those reported as needing medical care before the ship arriving in port they were received by ambulance and transported by ambulance to medical facilities for further care the second phase involved screening by medical providers for signs and symptoms of active infection and then being taken for further quarantine at military facilities in california texas and georgia or to a medical facility for further evaluation and treatment for the third phase patients were transferred to their home states where reception protocols were as diverse as the states by which they were received some patients were released to a private vehicle to drive home for isolation whereas others were escorted by public health officials or law enforcement in georgia 14 kentuckians were picked up by a chartered bus sent by their state government and returned for home quarantinedry or fluid saturated waste and sharps containers should be collected in biohazard containers and disposed of as regulated medical waste ideally at the destination medical facility18 this can become problematic if the flightdecontamination terminates at a nonmedical facility or the patient is transferred to a ground service for transport in that scenario waste should be retained for disposal at the earliest appropriate location a suction device or ventilator exhaust should not be vented into the cabin without in-line high-efficiency particulate air or equivalent filtration excretions urinefeces may be disposed of in the aircraft toilet but careful consideration should be taken because there are concerns about viral shedding especially with fecesafter transporting a sars-cov-2covid-19 patient exit doors should be closed and the aircraft air conditioning turned on at maximum capacity for several minutes to allow at least 1 completed air exchange nonpressurized aircraft should be aired out with doors open long enough to insure a completed air exchange blowers and high-powered fans should not be used because they could potentially reaerosolize infectious material19 cleaning should be postponed until after the aircraft has been allowed to adequately air out cleaning personnel should wear gloves eye protection and isolation gowns or coveralls at a minimum an n95 mask may be beneficial because of concerns over reaerosolizationthere are limitations of this article a large volume of known positive and puis were transported but the overall acuity was low transport of higher-acuity patients may require different methods as found in previous operations20 the comprehensive literature review found in the septemberoctober 2019 issue of air medical journal was coupled with current cdc recommendations for protocol development in lieu of a formal review finally this review focuses primarily on fixed wing transport and as noted rotor wing or ground transport may require different techniquesthis concept recommends the best practices to be used while transporting patients with the continued evolution of an infectious respiratory virus which has stressed global medical systems although most patients transported were stable to the best of our knowledge this represents the largest repatriation of potentially infected patients in history after the dust has settled time will allow for careful analysis of these actions and those of the health care system in general we hope at that time to gather additional knowledge and insight to allow for further revision this represents the movement of over 2000 distinct patients flown on 39 missions without infection of any transporting hhs air medical evacuation crewsthe world is currently facing a pandemic of a novel coronavirus covid-19 which started as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in wuhan city of china in december of 2019 1 2 3 as of april 14 2020 covid-19 caused by the novel sars-cov-2 coronavirus has spread to over 210 countries and territories causing about 19 million infections and 125000 deaths 4 5 6 7 the united states is now the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic recording over 613800 confirmed cases and 26000 deaths within a short time with new york state bearing the brunt of the us burden over 203000 confirmed cases and 10800 deaths 4 5 6 7 the first documented confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the us a resident who had recently visited wuhan city in china was reported on january 20 2020 8 while the first confirmed case in the state of new york was reported on march 1 2020 most of the covid-19 related deaths and severe cases occur in the elderly 65 years of age and older and people with underlying medical conditions 9 younger people and frontline healthcare workers are also at high risk of acquiring covid-19 infectionas with two other coronaviruses that caused major outbreaks in humans in recent years namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome and the middle eastern respiratory syndrome 2 10 covid-19 is transmitted from human-to-human through direct contact with contaminated objects or surfaces and through inhalation of respiratory droplets from both symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious humans 11 there is also limited evidence that the virus can be exhaled through normal breathing 12 the incubation period of the disease ranges from 2-14 days 3 13 14 15 most infections over 80 show mild or no symptoms 16 common symptoms of the disease include fever coughing and shortness of breath for mild cases and pneumonia for severe cases 1 2 7 in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a safe and effective vaccine for use in humans and a covid-19 anti-viral efforts aimed at containing covid-19 are focused on the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing using face-masks quarantine of suspected cases isolation and hospitalization of confirmed cases contact-tracing and quarantine mass testing etcin particular since the novel coronavirus is transmitted among people who come in close contact with each other the implementation of strict social-distancing measures has been the primary tool for curbing the spread of the pandemic as of april 7 2020 stringent social-distancing mechanisms mandatory lockdownsstay-at-home orders have been imposed in over 42 states of the united states together with washington dc guam and puerto rico representing over 95 of the us population involving approximately 316 million americans 17 the state of new york the current epicenter for covid-19 has even imposed a fine against people who fail to comply with its stringent social-distancing measures that took effect march 22 2020 common social-distancing measures or guidelines being employed in the us include temporary closures of schools and non-essential businesses avoiding crowded events and mass gatherings moving in-person meetings online etc the city of wuhan lifted its 76-day strict lockdown on april 8 2020 this was done in a phased way with the first relaxation of measures on february 9 2020contact-tracing is another major public health strategy for combating the spread of covid-19 contact-tracing involves searching for or identifying individuals with whom the confirmed case has closely interacted within a certain time frame eg two days prior to the onset of symptoms 18 interviewing testing and isolating or hospitalizing them if they have the disease 19 20the use of face-masks in public by members of the general population has historically been a common practice to try to limit or combat the spread of respiratory diseases dating back to at least the 1918 h1n1 pandemic of influenza 21 22 23 24 25 26 face masks may have been instrumental in limiting the community spread of the 20022003 sars epidemic in asia particularly in china singapore hong kong and taiwan 27 28 as well as the containment of the covid-19 pandemic in taiwan 29 face-masks have dual purposes if worn by a susceptible individual the mask offers efficacy against the acquisition of infection on the other hand if the wearer is already infected but is asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic and unaware heshe is ill the face-mask offers efficacy against their ability to transmit infection to susceptible individuals 12 30 31 32 33predicting the course or severity of a pandemic such as covid-19 as well as the realistic assessment of proposed public health intervention strategies for combating them in real time is a major challenge to both the public health and the scientific community a number of models have been developed and used to study covid-19 dynamics ferguson et al 34 used an agent-based model to investigate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on human deaths from covid-19 and in reducing burden on healthcare facilities and equipment they projected that in the absence of control measures over 81 of the populations of the us and great britain might become infected and covid-19 may cause up to 22 million deaths in the us mizumoto and chowell 35 used a mathematical model and incidence data to study changes in covid-19 transmission potential as the outbreak progressed through the diamond princess they obtained a higher reproduction number and noticed a substantial decrease in the effective reproduction number after improved quarantine was instituted hellewell et al 36 used a stochastic model with covid-19 data to examine the impact of contact-tracing and isolation on disease control and suggested that for most instances covid-19 spread can be contained in 3 months if these measures are highly effective using a stochastic model kucharski et al 37 examined the covid-19 trajectory in wuhan from januaryfebruary 2020 showing a reduction in transmission a 13 reduction in the associated effective reproduction number of the model when travel restrictions were implemented consequently there is a need to examine the combined impact of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions applied together or in sequencethe present study is based on the development of a new mathematical model for studying the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic in the us particularly in the state of new york the epicenter of covid-19 the model takes the form of a kermackmckendrick compartmental deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations 38 it incorporates features pertinent to covid-19 transmission dynamics and control such as the quarantine of suspected cases and the isolationhospitalization of confirmed covid-19 cases similar to the models developed in 39 40 41 the model parameterized using available covid-19 mortality data more reliable than case data provides a realistic real-time assessment and estimate of the burden of the pandemic in the us state of new york in addition to assessing some of the main intervention strategies being implemented in the state in particular quarantine isolation contact-tracing social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public
we designed and analyzed a novel kermackmckendrick-type mathematical model for the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a population 38 the model which incorporates the main non-pharmaceutical interventions being implemented to curtail covid-19 transmission in a community such as social-distancing quarantine of suspected cases isolation of confirmed cases contact-tracing testing and use of face-masks in public is formulated based on stratifying the total human population at time t denoted by nt into the mutually-exclusive compartments of non-quarantined susceptible sut quarantined susceptible sqt non-quarantined exposed ie newly-infected individuals who do not yet show symptoms of the disease and cannot transmit infection eut quarantined exposed eqt symptomatically-infectious iut asymptomatically-infectious iat hospitalizedisolated iht intensive care patients iicut and recovered rt so that ntsutsqteuteqtiutiatihtiicutrt
it should be mentioned that the asymptomatically-infectious compartment ia also includes those with mild symptoms of covid-19 data from the world health organization shows that about 80 of covid-19 confirmed cases show mild or no symptoms 16 and that individuals in this category particularly those who are in the 65 age group or those with pre-existing health conditions can develop a mild form of pneumonia that might require self-isolation or hospitalization 42 43 44 45 furthermore some individuals in this compartment particularly those who show no clinical symptoms 46 can be detected via testing andor tracing and testing of the contacts of confirmed covid-19 cases and sent to self-isolation or hospitalization it is worth mentioning that although the self-isolation or hospitalization of individuals in the ia class is associated with contact-tracing the ia to ih transition can also result from improvement in or scaling up of testing as is the case in iceland 47 in fact in our study contact tracing is very much inter-linked with testing contact tracing is carried out after a confirmed case is diagnosed following testingdiagnosis of a confirmed case furthermore individuals in the quarantine class sq or eq are those who have been traced following the positive diagnosis of someone they have had close contact with ie a confirmed covid-19 case they have been exposed to people in quarantine can be susceptible or newly-infected but unaware of their infection status and are continually monitored tested to determine their status those who test positive are moved to the eq class and those who remain negative after the incubation period are returned to the su class thus the process of quarantining individuals suspected of having had close contacts with an infectious individual can be interpreted as contact-tracing in addition to contact-tracing of contacts of confirmed cases people can be placed in quarantine because of other factors such as having traveled to areas with high covid-19 transmission eg new york italy china spain uk etc quarantine and isolation can either be at home self-quarantine and self-isolation or at designated healthcare facilities furthermore hospitalization in the context of this study includes self-isolation at home and isolation at the hospital hence hospitalization and isolation will be used interchangeably in this studythe model is given by the following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations where a dot represents differentiation with respect to time 21su1p1qpqpsuqsqsq1psujqsqeu1qpsuuueueqqpsuueujsqqeqiuf1ueuuuuiuihf2ueurqequiuaiahhhihia1f1f2ueu1rqeqaaaiaiicuhihicuicuiicuruiuhihaiaicuiicuwhere force of infection
 is defined as 1mcmiuaiahihnqeqihiicuwhere  is the effective contact rate ie contacts capable of leading to covid-19 transmission 0cm1 is the proportion of members of the public who wear face-masks correctly and consistently in public and 0m1 is the efficacy of the face-masks low values of cm imply limited use of face-masks by members of the public while values of cm that are closer to unity imply widespreaduniversal use of face-masks in the community furthermore values of m that are closer to zero imply that the face-masks are not very effective in preventing acquisition if worn by a susceptible human or transmitting infection if worn by a symptomatic or asymptomatically-infectious human while m close or equal to unity implies that the face-masks used by the members of the public are of near or perfect efficacy against the acquisition or transmission of infection reduction in the contact rate parameter  can be thought of a measure of effectiveness of strategies that limit contacts between people to avoid community transmission notably social or physical distancing the parameter 0a1 measures the relative infectiousness of asymptomatically-infectious humans in the ia class in relation to symptomatic individuals in the iu class similarly 0h1 is a modification parameter accounting for the relative infectiousness of hospitalizedisolated infectious humans in the ih class in relation to individuals in the iu class the parameter 0q1 is a measure of the effectiveness of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission to prevent infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection in particular q0 implies that infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients mix freely with the rest of population and can transmit at the same rate as other infectious individuals on the other hand q1 implies that the efficacy of quarantine hospitalizationisolation and icu admission in preventing infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated individuals and icu patients from transmitting infection is perfect in other words q1 means infected quarantined hospitalizedisolated infectious humans and icu patients are no longer part of the actively-mixing population hence do not contribute to disease transmissionin the model 21 the parameter 0p1 is the probability of infection per contact while q is the proportion of non-quarantined individuals that are infected at the time of quarantine the parameter q measures the rate at which quarantined-susceptible individuals revert to the wholly-susceptible non-quarantined class su at the end of the quarantine period the modification parameter 0j1 is a measure of the efficacy of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection by quarantined-susceptible individuals during quarantine it should be mentioned that in the formulation of the model 21 the quarantine rate is defined as a function of the proportion of infectious individuals in the community in particular the quarantine rate of susceptible individuals is 1p while that of newly-infected exposed individuals in the eq class is qp where  is the force of infection in other words the more the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in a community the more the number of residents of that community that are quarantined the parameters uq is the rate at which exposed non-quarantined quarantined individuals progress to the symptomatic hospitalized class ie 1u and 1q is the intrinsic incubation period of non-quarantined and quarantined exposed individuals respectively a proportion f1 of exposed individuals move to the iu class at the end of the incubation period at the rate f1u similarly another proportion f2 moves to ih class at the rate f2u and the remaining proportion 1f1f2 moves to the ia class at the rate 1f1f2u noting that f1f21 the parameter a represents the rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized the parameter a represents the rate at which asymptomatically-infectious humans are detected via contact-tracing and hospitalized a proportion r of exposed quarantined individuals move to the ih class at the end of the incubation period at a rate rq while the remaining proportion 1r moves to the ia class at a rate 1rq the parameter u represents the rate at which exposed non-quarantined individuals are detected by contact-tracing and placed in quarantine the parameter uahicu is the recovery rate for individuals in the iuiaihiicu class while h is the rate at which hospitalized individuals are placed into icu furthermore the parameter uahicu represents the covid-induced mortality for individuals in the iuiaihiicu class it is worth mentioning that in the formulation of the model 21 the community transmission rate  is assumed to be the same for both the symptomatically-infectious iu and the asymptomatically-infectious ia classes it may be possible that the community contact rate for asymptomatically-infectious individuals is higher than that of symptomatically-infectious individuals this is due to the fact that the former are less sick or are not even aware that they are infected and may therefore be having more contacts and causing more infections the assumption for the homogeneity in the community contact rate allows for a more tractable assessment of the impact of social-distancing and other community contact reduction strategies as well as mathematical tractabilitythe model 21 is an extension of the quarantine model for ebola viral disease developed by denes and gumel 39 by adding epidemiological compartments for asymptomatically-infectious humans and hospitalized individuals in icu as well as incorporating contact-tracing of suspected cases and the use of face-masks by members of the general public to the authors knowledge this may be the first deterministic model for covid-19 that incorporates five non-pharmaceutical interventions quarantine isolation contact-tracing use of public masks and social-distancing in addition to allowing for the assessment of the impact of asymptomatic transmission on the trajectory and burden of covid-19 by adding a compartment for asymptomatic-infectious humans a flow diagram of the model is depicted in fig 1 and the state variables and parameters of the model are tabulated in table 1 table 2 to keep track of covid-19 related deaths required for calibrating our model with cumulative death data for covid-19 and for quantifying and predicting the public health impactburden of disease we define the book-keeping state variable dt to measure the number of covid-deceased individuals it then follows from some of the equations of the model 21 that the rate of change of the population of deceased-individuals is given by 22duiuhihaiaicuiicu

we estimated the baseline epidemiological parameters of the model from available covid-19 data and sources from the published literature since the generally recommended period for quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is 14 days 6 16 we set the rate at which quarantined susceptible individuals revert to the non-quarantined susceptible class q to be q114
per day further while some studies have estimated the incubation period for covid-19 to range from 214 days with about 975 of infected people developing disease symptoms within 115 days of infection 13 14 15 other studies have estimated the incubation period to be 56 days 3 we consider an average incubation period taken from these ranges of 51 days so that uq151
per day 13 similarly we set the progression rate from the asymptomatically-infectious class ia to the isolatedhospitalized class ihto be a14
per day following 34 48 we consider an infectious period of about 10 days so that the recovery rate from covid-19 infection  is set to uicu110
per day ferguson et al 34 estimated the average time covid-19 patients spent in hospital for infections that do not lead to complications requiring icu admission to be about 8 days therefore we set h18
per day furthermore following ferguson et al 34 it is assumed that there is a short time lag of about 5 days between the onset of disease symptoms in non-quarantined humans and hospitalization hence we set the hospitalization rate u to be u15
per day some studies have suggested that most covid-19 infections over 80 show mild or no symptoms about 14 show severe symptoms but without requiring icu admission and 6 show critically-severe symptoms requiring icu admission 16 49 50 consequently we set f202 and assume that half of the 80 of cases that show no or mild symptoms are asymptomatic hence we set f104 and 1f1f204 the modification parameter for the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic people a was estimated from 34 51 to be 05 further li et al 51 estimated this parameter to be between 042 and 055 hence we set ah05 since about 15 of covid-19 patients die 34 we estimated uh0015
per day to obtain estimates for a and icu we assume that a05u so that a00075
per day and icu15u so that icu00225
per day 52 the parameter for the efficacy of quarantine to prevent acquisition of infection during quarantine j is estimated to be j05we estimated the efficacy of face-masks m based on the results of a number of clinical trials for instance data from driessche et al 53 shows that surgical masks reduced p aeruginosa infected aerosols produced by coughing by over 80 in cystic fibrosis patients a similar study by stockwell et al 54 shows that surgical masks reduced colony-forming unit cfu count by over 90 these two studies in 53 54 show that the n95 masks respirators were more effective similarly van der sande et al 55 show that home-made tea-cloth masks had an inward efficiency between 58 and 77 over a 3-hour duration of wear while inward efficiency ranged 7285 and 9899 for surgical and n95-equivalent masks consequently following eikenberry et al 52 we estimate inward mask efficacy to range widely between 2080 for cloth masks and at least 50 for well-made tightly fitting masks made of optimal materials and 7090 for surgical masks and over 95 typical for p in the range of properly worn n95 masks based on this we set m05 we set the proportion of quarantined exposed individuals who are hospitalized r to be r07 there is no good data for the efficacy of isolationhospitalization to prevent disease transmission by symptomatic individuals in isolationhospital nonetheless it seems plausible to assume that at the later stage of the pandemic such as at the present moment the public health system capacity has been greatly improved to the extent that such transmission do not occur hence we set q1 the parameter h for the rate of icu admission is estimated to be h0083
per day based on data from 56 it is in the range of 612 the remaining parameters of the model 21  cm a and u were estimated from the mortality data for the state of new york and the entire us 4 5 6 7 based on the fitting of the state of new york data in fig 2a and data for the entire us in fig 2b the estimating process involved minimizing the sum of the squares of the difference between the predictions of model 21 cumulative deaths and the observed covid-19 cumulative deaths data from new york state for the period from march 1 2020 to april 7 2020 in particular the fitted values obtained using the state of new york mortality data were 08648

the quantity c is the control reproduction number of the model 21 it measures the average number of new covid-19 infections generated by an average infected individual introduced into a population where basic public health interventions quarantine isolation social-distancing testing etc are implemented the quantity rc is the sum of the constituent reproduction numbers associated with the number of new covid-19 cases generated by symptomatically-infectious humans cu hospitalizedisolated individuals ch and asymptomatically-infectious humans ca the epidemiological implication of theorem 31 is that a small influx of covid-19 cases will not generate a covid-19 outbreak if the control reproduction number c is less than unity it is worth mentioning that for kermackmckendrick-type mathematical models with no vitaldemographic dynamics ie births or natural death processes or waning immunity to continuously feed the susceptible class such as the model 21 it is instructive to compute the final size of the epidemic 40 59 60 61 62 the final epidemic size relations which are natural quantities associated with the dynamics of epidemic models with no vitaldemographic dynamics allow for the realistic quantification of disease burden and can be used to assess the impact and effectiveness of various intervention and mitigation strategies 40 the final size relations for the epidemic model 21 are calculated in section 32
in this section the final size of the covid-19 pandemic will be calculated using the notation in 59 let xr6 yr2 and zr represent the sets of infected susceptible and recovered components of the model thusit follows from the model 21 that xt

using the above change and variables and definitions the model 21 reduces to 32xdyxyzbxvxydyxyzbxzwxwhere w is a kn matrix with the property that the ij entry represents the rate at which individuals of the jth infected compartment transition into the recovered ith z compartment upon recovery and the matrix v is as defined in section 31 it is worth stating that the reproduction number c of the model 21 or equivalently 32 can be recovered using the definition c0y0z0bv1dy0 given in theorem 21 of 59 it should be noted that this theorem also allows for recovering the local asymptotic stability result for the family of disease-free equilibria of the model 21 given in section 31 furthermore the results below for the final size relations of the model 21 or equivalently 32 can be established using theorem 51 of 59

we simulated the model 21 using the baseline parameter values tabulated in table 3 unless otherwise stated to assess the population-level impact of the various control and mitigation strategies against the spread of covid-19 in the us state of new york discussed in section 21 we also simulated the model using the calibrated parameters in table 4 together with the other estimated parameters in table 3 to assess the population-level impact of various control measures in the entire us it should be mentioned that in all the simulations carried out the various non-pharmaceutical interventions are maintained at their baseline values unless otherwise stated
we simulated the model to first of all assess the impact of social-distancing which in our study extends beyond individuals staying 2 meters or 6 ft apart to include school and non-essential business closures staying at home avoiding large gatherings etc further in our study we measured the effect of social-distancing by the overall reduction in the baseline value of the community contact rate parameter  the simulation results obtained depicted in fig 3 show a projected 66300 patients in hospital or in self-isolation at the pandemic peak expected to be attained on may 5 2020 fig 3a and 105100 cumulative number of deaths fig 3c for the state of new york under the baseline scenario ie for the baseline level of social-distancing similarly the projections for the entire us under the baseline nation-wide social-distancing scenario are 115000 daily hospitalizations at the pandemic peak fig 3b and 164000 cumulative number of deaths fig 3d it is noteworthy that our projection for the cumulative mortality for the entire us of 164000 falls markedly below the 22 million mortality projected by ferguson et al 34 our us-wide mortality projection however falls within the range of 38243162106 estimated by murray et al 65 when social-distancing is improved above the baseline effectiveness levels ie increase in efficacy and adherencecoverage of social-distancing fig 3 shows a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden for both new york state and the entire us in particular for a social-distancing regimen that reduces the contact rate parameter  by 10 from its baseline value the expected number of daily hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases to 50380 corresponding to a 24 decrease in hospitalizationsisolation from baseline for the state of new york similarly nation-wide hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the peak of the pandemic decreases by 21 to 89930 furthermore for a highly-effective social-distancing strategy such as a social-distancing strategy that results in at least 40 reduction in the baseline value of  the peak hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases for new york state and the entire us dramatically reduce to 5000 and 14000 respectively this represents a 92 and 88 reduction in peak hospitalizations for the state of new york and nationwide respectively similarly for this scenario the cumulative mortality for new york state and the entire us reduce respectively to 20700 and 59600 thus implementing a highly-effective social-distancing strategy which can reduce the baseline community contact rate  by at least 40 will avert over 80 and 64 of the predicted baseline deaths in new york state and nationwide respectively the effectiveness levels and coverage of social-distancing in new york state and the entire us has greatly improved by april 2 2020 66 67 68 69 to the extent that it is plausible to assume that 40 reduction in the baseline value of  has already been achieved in both the state of new york and nationwide therefore this study shows that the state of new york and the entire us could have recorded catastrophic covid-19-induced mortality between 100000 to 200000 if not for the high effectiveness levels and coverage of the strict social-distancing measures implemented in the state and nationwide our study suggests that if the current level of social-distancing effectiveness and coverage is maintained through may or june 2020 in the state of new york and nationwide covid-19 can be eliminated from both the state and the entire nation extending the simulations for fig 3 shows that the current level of the social-distancing regimen in the state of new york should be extended until late september 2021 to guarantee the elimination of covid-19 in the context of fig 3 covid-19 elimination is measured in terms of when the cumulative mortality stabilizes similarly for the entire us social-distancing needs to be maintained until march 2021additional simulations were carried out to assess the population-level impact of the duration and timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols for the best-case scenario where the current strict social-distancing protocols were assumed to be implemented right from the very beginning of the covid-19 pandemic in new york state march 1 2020 and the entire us january 20 2020 and maintained until early december 2020 the results obtained for the cumulative mortality recorded for new york state and the entire us are 25000 and 60000 respectively this represents 76 and 63 reductions respectively in the cumulative mortality for new york state and the entire us in comparison to the baseline scenario ie worst-case scenario where the social-distancing and other community contacts-reduction strategies have not been implemented at the stringent levels blue curves in figs 4af furthermore if the social-distancing regimens were implemented on the days they were officially implemented in new york state march 22 2020 and the entire us march 16 2020 but maintained until early december 2020 the cumulative mortality to be recorded will be 55000 and 75500 this represents 48 and 53 reductions respectively in the cumulative mortality from the baseline magenta curves in figs 4afthe effect of the timing of when to terminate the current strict social-distancing protocols was also monitored our simulations show that terminating the current strict social-distancing by the end of april 2020 ie the 40 reduction in the baseline value of  is now lost due to the termination of the social-distancing measures a significant rebound of covid-19 burden will be recorded in as early as july 2020 in particular new york state will record 144000 deaths representing a 37 increase from the baseline scenario fig 4a while the entire us will record up to 156000 deaths this represents a mere 5 reduction of cumulative mortality in relation to the baseline scenario fig 4d in other words the early termination of the current strict social-distancing measures by the end of april 2020 will result in catastrophic covid-19 burden similar to the dire projections made for the pre-social-distancing period ie all the gains of the social-distancing and other control and mitigation measures will essentially be lost however if the strict-distancing measures were to be terminated by the end of may 2020 the cumulative mortality figures are projected to be 91800 for new york state and 118300 for the entire us this represents a 13 and 28 reduction respectively in the baseline cumulative mortality figs 4b and e finally if the social-distancing measures are terminated at the end of june 2020 the projection for the cumulative mortality figures are 33200 for new york state and 50300 for the entire us this represents 68 and 69 reductions respectively in the baseline cumulative mortality figs 4c and f these projected mortality numbers for the early termination of social-distancing fall within the range given by murphy et al 65 our study clearly shows that the clamor to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures that have proven to be hugely successful in both the state of new york and the entire us as part of the move to re-open the state and the country would undoubtedly trigger a devastating rebound of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us data has already shown that certain countries that have relaxed the successfully-implemented social-distancing measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea are now witnessing a rebound of covid-19 70 in particular hong kong announced 84 newly-confirmed cases on march 28 followed by over 70 new daily cases in the next three days further taiwan reported more than 20 newly-confirmed cases per day in mid-march up from barely 5 cases per day late in january south korea reported 83 newly-confirmed cases on april 3 2020 70
it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned simulations for the effect of social-distancing were carried out for the case where other interventions contact-tracing quarantine face-mask usage etc are also implemented at their baseline values in table 3 table 4 if face-masks are not used then the above cumulative numbers will be even more catastrophic for instance if the strict social-distancing protocol is terminated in new york state by april 30 2020 and no face-mask-based intervention is implemented about 150800 deaths will be recorded by july 2020 furthermore terminating the social-distancing protocols by end of may 2020 or end of june 2020 will result in projected 108500 and 44300 deaths respectively in the state the corresponding numbers for the entire us for the case where mask-based intervention is not implemented are projected to be 167000148000 and 91900 respectively thus this study strongly suggest that utmost caution should be exercised before terminating the current strict social-distancing protocols being implemented in the state of new york and nationwide at the very least a careful state-by-state or county-by-county phase withdrawal based on the updated covid-19 incidence mass testing data and proximity to covid-19 hot spots should be carried outthe effect of quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 is monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values and various levels of effectiveness of quarantine to prevent the acquisition of infection during quarantine j the results obtained depicted in fig 5 show that quarantine of susceptible individuals has only marginal impact in reducing covid-related hospitalizations for both new york state fig 5a and the entire us fig 5b in particular at the baseline quarantine efficacy j05 the state of new york will record 66000 daily hospitalizations the implementation of a perfect quarantine in the state ie j0 reduces the number of hospitalizations marginally to 60000 the numbers for the entire us for the baseline and perfect quarantine are 115000 and 97000 respectively the marginal effect of quarantine in minimizing covid-related hospitalizations is even more pronounced when the isolation strategy is perfect figs 5c and d that is for the epidemiological scenario where the isolation or hospitalization of confirmed cases is perfect that is individuals in isolation at home or in hospital are not part of the actively-mixing population so that q1 the community-wide implementation of mass quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to covid-19 will have very marginal impact on covid-19 burden measured in terms of reductions in covid-19 hospitalizations this result is consistent with that reported in 71 thus this study suggests that since self-isolation and isolation in hospitals have been implemented at high effectiveness levels in both the state of new york and in the entire us the mass quarantine of suspected cases may not be a cost-effective public health strategy for combating the spread of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us figs 5c and d illustrate the dynamics of the model 21 for various effectiveness levels of quarantine and isolation for both new york state and the us further emphasizing the marginal nature of quarantine even for the cases where isolation was not implemented at a perfect level in minimizing covid-19 hospitalizationsthe effect of contact-tracing measured in terms of the detection of asymptomatic cases following testing diagnosis of a confirmed covid-19 case they may have had close contacts with or random testing on the transmission dynamics and control of the covid-19 pandemic is also monitored by simulating the model 21 using the baseline parameter values in table 3 and various values of the contact-tracing parameters u and a in particular the simulations are run by increasing the values of u and a simultaneously and by the same amount from their respective baseline values fig 6 depicts the solution profiles obtained showing the worst case scenario of 49400 cases in the state of new york and 64600 cases nationwide on the day the pandemic peaks on april 26 2020 if no contact tracing is implemented if implemented at its baseline rate contact tracing reduces the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases by 27 for the state of new york and by 22 nationwide while a 75 improvement in contact-tracing will reduce the predicted number of confirmed cases to approximately 31300 for the state of new york and 41200 nationwide this represents 13 and 10 reduction from baseline and shows that while contact-tracing implemented even only at baseline is important in reducing the size of the pandemic peak number of new covid-19 cases investing much resources towards contact-tracing beyond the baseline rate might not be cost-effectivesimulations were further carried out to assess the population-level impact of the widespread use of masks in public by running the model 21 with various values of mask efficacy m and coverage cm the results obtained depicted in fig 7 show a marked decrease in the number of hospitalizations for both new york state figs 7a b and c and the entire us figs 7d e and f with increasing values of the mask efficacy and coverage further using an efficacious mask such as a mask of efficacy 50 can greatly flatten the pandemic curve in addition to significantly reducing the burden of the pandemic measured in this case in terms of hospitalizations however such a mask will fail to lead to the elimination of the disease fig 7b it is worth emphasizing that although the use of masks with low efficacy may not lead to disease elimination they still are highly useful by causing a significant decrease in the burden of the pandemic ie significantly reduce hospitalizations if a significant proportion of the populace wear them for instance if 75 of the populace in new york or the entire us wear masks with efficacy as low as 25 ie cloths masks the number of hospitalizations will be reduced by 63 and 64 respectively compared to the scenario were masks were not used figs 7a and d a contour plot of the reproduction number of the model c as a function of masks efficacy m and compliance cm is depicted in fig 8 if masks of higher efficacy such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy 70 are used in the state of new york disease elimination is indeed feasible if at least 70 of the populace wear the masks figs 8a and b similar results were obtained for the entire us figs 8c and dadditional simulations were carried out to assess the combined impact of public face-masks use strategy and strict social-distancing strategy which reduces the baseline value of the community transmission parameter  by 40 on the control of covid-19 in new york state and the entire us the results obtained depicted in fig 9 show that combining the strict social-distancing strategy with a strategy based on using moderately-effective face-masks with efficacy m05 in public will lead to the elimination of the disease in new york state if only 30 of the population use face-masks in public fig 9a this clearly shows that disease elimination in new york state is more feasible if the face-masks-based strategy is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy similar results were obtained for the entire us fig 9b where in this case only 10 compliance in mask usage in public will be needed for covid-19 eliminationin summary the above simulations show that the use of face-masks even those with low efficacy but with high coverage in public offers significant community-wide impact in reducing and mitigating the burden of covid-19 in both new york state and the entire us in other words the use of low efficacy face masks with high coverage is always useful further combining the face-masks use strategy with a strategy based on the implementation of strict social-distancing is more effective in curtailing and eliminating covid-19 in comparison to the singular implementation of either strategythe world is currently experiencing a devastating pandemic of a novel coronavirus caused by sars-cov2 that emerged in wuhan city of china in december of 2019 the deadly covid-19 pandemic has spread to over 210 countries causing over 3 million cases and 230000 deaths worldwide by the end of april 2020 with some parts of asia europe and now the us suffering the brunt of the burden there is currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans against covid-19 there is also no safe and effective antiviral consequently control and mitigation efforts against covid-19 are limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing which involves keeping a physical distance of at least 6 ft from other humans in public lockdowns of communities closure of schools malls places of worships and other gathering places quarantine of suspected cases contact-tracing isolation at home or in hospital of confirmed cases and the use of face masks both low quality cloth masks and the higher quality surgical masks in public this study is based on the design analysis and simulations of a new mathematical model for providing deeper insights into the transmission dynamics and control of covid-19 in a community specifically the model designed in this study was parameterized using covid-19 data from the us state of new york and the entire us population the model was used to assess the population-impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation interventionswe parameterized the model using covid-19 data from new york state and the entire us and extensive numerical simulations were carried out using the parameterized model to assess the population-level impact of the various intervention strategies with the baseline levels of the four main intervention strategies considered social-distancing quarantineisolation contact-tracing and the use of face-masks the state of new york is projected to see a peak of the pandemic around mid april 2020 with 66300 number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 105100 deaths at the peak while the entire us will see its peak around end of april 2020 with 115000 hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and 164000 deaths at the peak our projections for baseline worst-case mortality for the us are much lower than the 22 million deaths suggested by ferguson et al in the absence of interventions 34 but fall within the range estimated in 65 our projected numbers for covid-19 burden morbidity and mortality dramatically decreases if strict social-distancing measures are implemented at high adherence levels for instance it was shown that strict compliance to the statewide lock-down in new york state which corresponds to reducing the baseline contact rate in our model by at least 40 will reduce the peak values for hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases and mortality by 92 and 80 respectively similarly the peak values for cases and mortality in the entire us if a nation-wide lockdown capable of reducing baseline contact rate by at least 40 will decrease by 88 and 64 respectivelythe duration and timing of the termination of strict social-distancing measures are critically-important in the battle to effectively combat pandemics of respiratory diseases such as the devastating covid-19 pandemic while the rapid implementation of strict social-distancing measures during the early stage of the pandemic maintained over a relatively long period of time eg until the summer will undoubtedly effectively combat the burden of the pandemic early termination of these measures will cause catastrophic outcomes for instance our study shows that relaxing or terminating the strict social-distancing measures in the state of new york and the us as a whole by end of april 2020 will trigger a devastating second wave generating covid-19 burden similar to those obtained during the pre-strict-social-distancing time in the state and in the entire nation by the end of july 2020 with cumulative mortality numbers in the range reported in 65 for both new york state and the entire us in particular up to 144000 and 156000 cumulative deaths will have been recorded in the state of new york and the entire us if the social-distancing measures are shut down by the end of april 2020 extending the termination of social-distancing such as to end of june 2020 significantly reduces the likelihood of a second wave in addition to significantly reducing the associated burden of the pandemic consequently a great deal of caution must be exercised before decisions are made to relax or terminate the existing highly-successful social-distancing protocols in both the state of new york and the entire us it is noteworthy that countries that have recently relaxed these measures such as taiwan hong kong and south korea have already started seeing a rebound of covid-19 our study suggests that the decision to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures should by on a case-by-case ie state-by-state or county-by-county basis and should be informed by updated covid-19 incidence and mortality data number of covid-19 tests both antibody and surveillance tests and proximity of a locality to covid-19 hot spots in particular our study shows that strict social-distancing should be maintained until the year 2021 up to late september 2021 for new york state and early march 2021 for the entire us to eliminate covid-19quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to a respiratory disease is perhaps the oldest public health control measure in human history our study shows that widescale implementation of quarantine intervention may not be very effective in minimizing the burden of covid-19 if the strategy of isolating confirmed cases is effective in other words our study suggests that if isolation can be implemented effectively high efficacy and coverage then quarantine of people suspected of contracting covid-19 may not be necessary this result is consistent with what was reported by day et al 71 tracing the contacts of confirmed cases known as contact-tracing was also shown to only be marginally-effective in minimizing the burden of the pandemic in particular even if contact-tracing is implemented at the highest possible level represented in our study based on increases in the contact-tracing parameters by 75 the decrease in the burden of the pandemic recorded was only marginal 13 and 10 for cases in new york state and nationwide respectively and 5 and 3 for mortality for new york state and nationwide respectivelythe use of face-masks in public in times of outbreaks of respiratory diseases has a rich history although quite popular in some parts of the world notably asia the use of face-masks in public is somewhat controversial this was more evident in the us during the covid-19 leading ultimately to the recommendation to use face-masks home-made cloths masks in public by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc on april 2 2020 our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of at least 70 will lead to a dramatic reduction of covid-19 burden if its coverage is high enough at least 70 in fact our study shows that even face-masks of low efficacy home-made cloths masks will lead to a dramatic reduction of disease burden albeit this will not lead to the elimination of the disease for example even face-mask efficacy of 25 can lead to a 63 and 64 reduction in the number of hospitalizationsisolation of confirmed cases at the pandemic peak in new york state and nationwide if 75 of the population wear face-masks in public these results are consistent with those reported by eikenberry et al 52 furthermore by generating contour plots for the control reproduction number of the model 21 c as a function of mask efficiency m and coverage cm our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks such as surgical masks with estimated efficacy of 75 will indeed lead to the elimination of covid-19 in both the state of new york and in the entire us nation if the coverage is high enough about 80 this study shows that the use of face-masks in public is always useful and their population-level impact increases will increases efficacy and coverage in particular even the use of low efficacy masks will greatly reduce the burden of the pandemic if the coverage in their usage in the community is high enough furthermore our study shows that combining the masks-based strategy with the strict social-distancing strategy is more effective than the singular implementation of either strategy for instance our study shows that covid-19 can be eliminated from the state of new york if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are combined with a face-masks strategy using a moderately-effective mask with efficacy of about 50 if only 30 of the residents of the state wear the masks the masks use compliance needed to eliminate the disease nationwide under this scenario with strict social-distancing nationwide is a mere 10in summary our study suggests that like in the case of the other coronaviruses we have seen in the past namely sars and mers 10 covid-19 is a pandemic that appears to be controllable using basic non-pharmaceutical interventions particularly social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public especially when implemented in combinations the factors that are obviously critically-important to the success of the anti-covid-19 control efforts are the early implementation and enhancement of effectiveness of these intervention measures and ensuring their high adherencecoverage in the communitythe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthe worldwide spread of a novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars proceeded with unprecedented rapidity overwhelming many hospitals and public health systems in a matter of weeks1 2 as of 11 july 2003 a total of 8437 cases were reported from 32 countries3 in many locations the introduction of the disease by ill travellers was soon followed by spread to health care workers and household contacts4 5
this report describes the epidemiology of the sars outbreak in taiwan and proposes strategies for addressing response operations after any emerging outbreaks in the future further the lessons learned from the response to this outbreak may help to improve current strategies for preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases and for distributing resources efficiently during response operationstaiwan has a population of approximately 22549292 the main island is divided into 22 cities and counties taiwan with its close proximity to the sars epicenters of guangdong and hong kong and its extensive business and cultural ties has many travellers from the most affected areas each year more than four million taiwanese visit mainland china for business and tourism bureau of immigration ministry of the interior and the vast majority of flights return through hong kong although taiwan was removed from the list of affected areas on 5 july 2003 it will remain at risk from the importation and spread of sars should it re-emerge3 6
on 14 march 2003 the day the first cases were reported taiwans department of health initiated a system to respond to the potential spread of sars resulting from the cases a task force committee established medical aid teams to address disruption in the quarantine system to conduct rapid assessment by reviewing every reported sars case within three days after the first case was reported and to implement a legislative procedure for reporting sars on 28 march all suspected sars cases were required by law to be reported to the department of health and health authorities were required to deliver protective equipment including n-95 masks to the sars hospitals immediately and to equip all healthcare workers with enhanced protective equipmentbeginning with the recognition of the first sars case on 14 march taiwan moved aggressively to isolate all suspect or probable cases in negative pressure rooms and to equip all healthcare workers with enhanced protective equipment specially designed isolation rooms with hepa filtered air negative pressure under continuous electronic monitoring and separate bathrooms and anterooms are commonly available in larger referral hospitals until 22 april most of the probable cases were cared for in such hospital settings from 23 april to 8 may the 277 new cases overwhelmed the capacity of the hospital system to care for all patients in negative pressure roomswhen a sars case was reported local public health workers pursued a case investigation and confirmed adequate home quarantine of all contacts the case investigation reviewed the patients history of exposure to patients with sars or sars-affected areas reviewed the signs and symptoms as compared to the who case definition of sars7 and collected information on the patients recent close contactsdeath certificates were obtained from the statistics division of the ministry of interior in taiwan information from death certificates was used to determine the cause of death mortality was estimated by dividing the number of deaths by the total number of probable cases it was based on cases with a known outcome and was irrespective of the immediate cause of death8
nasopharyngeal swab or stool specimens were obtained from reported patients and tested for sars-co-v by the laboratory of the center for disease control at the department of health in taiwan the viral rna was extracted and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr was completed for targets specific to various rna viruses including the influenza a and b viruses and sars-co-v a specimen was considered rt-pcr-positive for sars-co-v if at least two different clinical specimens were positive eg nasopharyngeal and stool the same clinical specimens collected on two or more occasions during the course of the illness were positive eg sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates or if two different assays or repeat pcr using a new rna extract from the original clinical sample on each occasion of testing were positive7
quarantine was implemented on 18 march for persons meeting one of two sets of criteria designed as class a or class b class a included healthcare workers exposed outside isolation settings family and other close contacts and those on airplanes with ill sars patients if seated within three rows in front or three rows behind the patient initially the duration of quarantine was 14 days but after 10 june this was revised to ten days in accordance with the incubation period for sars1 5 6 hospital staff and patients who had been in contact with a sars patient were quarantined in a healthcare facility all others were quarantined at homefrom 28 april to 4 july those who returned from a who-designated sars-affected area were considered class b resulting in compulsory home quarantine for ten days6 9 passengers arriving could choose to be quarantined in an airport transit hotel at home or at a quarantine site designated and paid for by their employer if these options were not available the traveller was quarantined at a government quarantine center located at a military base on 9 june quarantine regulations were eased for the staff of taiwanese companies based on mainland china who were returning to taiwan for business travellers in this category were allowed to conduct business if they wore a surgical mask public health nurses from local health departments delivered food to the home three times a day body temperature was self-monitored three times a day and reported by telephone to the public health nurses a surgical mask was worn whenever the quarantined individual entered a communal area within their own home if heshe became sick during the home quarantine period the driver of the ambulance took the patient to hospital dressed in a tyvek suit n-95 respirator and gloves there were several hundred such ambulance trips for fever patients between mid-may and july in taiwanafter 10 april all airline passengers outbound and inbound were requested to have their body temperature taken at the airport people whose body temperatures were higher than 375 c were examined further by a physicianmobile sars containment teams mobile teams a joint program by the center for disease control in taiwan and various teaching hospitals were initiated three days after the first suspected sars case was reported seventeen mobile teams comprising infection control physicians infection control nurses rotating staff from the county department of health staff from the center for disease control taiwan and staff from the centers for disease control and prevention in the usa were deployed from 16 march to 10 may 2003 they observed and demonstrated the recommended sars infection control practices and also provided personal protective equipment ppe to hospitals actively evaluating patients for sars infection each team was equipped with an infection control checklist personal protective equipment ppe blood specimen tubes nasopharyngeal swabs culture media and a specimen cooler mobile teams evaluated infection control practices through observing hospital personnel questioning current practices and detecting the negative pressure of the isolation room using a strip of tissue paper at the entrance of a patients isolation roomin this study the who case definition as published in may 2003 was used the results were later compared with those obtained by using the case definition published in august 2003 in may a probable case of sars was defined as a person presenting after 1 february 2003 with a history of fever higher than 38 c and one or more of the following symptoms lower respiratory tract illness cough breathing difficulty shortness of breath or radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome rds or autopsy findings consistent with pneumonia without identifiable cause the person also needed evidence of one or more of the following exposures during the ten days prior to the onset of symptoms to have had close contact with a person who is a suspect or probable case of sars to reside in an affected area7 a suspect case was a probable case without chest radiograph or pathological confirmation patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis could fully explain their illness7
on 14 august 2003 who proposed a new case definition including laboratory confirmation a clinical case of sars was defined as a person presenting a history of fever higher than 38 c and one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness cough breathing difficulty shortness of breath and radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome rds or autopsy findings consistent with pneumonia without an identifiable cause patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis could fully explain their illness10 a laboratory case was a clinical case with positive laboratory finding for sars-co-v10
statistical analysis was conducted using spss software spss 1005 windows version11 univariate analysis was used to identify factors associated with outcome in the univariate analysis the association between illness and categorical risk factors was assessed for statistical significance by the chi-square test the association for continuous variables was assessed using t-test a two-sided p-value at a level of less than 005 was considered statistically significant odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals 95 ci were also calculatedthe first two suspected cases were diagnosed in a couple on 14 march 2003 the man was a 54-year-old businessman who had travelled to guangdong province china on 5 february and returned to taipei via hong kong on 21 february on 25 february he developed fever and myalgia and later a dry cough but was not hospitalized until 8 march several hours after admission he was intubated and required mechanical ventilation for 13 days his wife and son were exposed during the period before full protective measures were in place and both developed sars with a requirement for mechanical ventilation the infections in the wife and son were confirmed by rt-pcr testing to be associated with the novel coronavirus associated with sars worldwide12 13 14 on 26 march a resident of hong kongs amoy gardens flew to taiwan and took a train to taichung the mans brother became taiwans first sars fatality between 14 march and 19 april 51 people met the criteria for a probable case figure 1
suddenly in the last ten days of april the number of cases began to increase steadily the first increase was in patients and staff at hospital h and was attributed to a laundry worker employed at the hospital aged 42 years with diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease on 12 april he had a fever and diarrhea and was evaluated in the emergency department the laundry worker remained on duty and interacted frequently with patients staff and visitors he had sleeping quarters in the hospitals basement and spent off-duty time socializing in the emergency department on 16 april because of worsening symptoms this worker was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of salmonellosis infectious enteritis and pulmonary edema on 18 april he became short of breath a chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates and the patient was transferred to an isolation room in the intensive care unit with suspected sars this was a potential index patient because he had been symptomatic for six days before sars was diagnosed the number of potentially exposed persons was estimated at up to 10000 patients and visitors and 930 staff on 24 april hospital h was contained and all patients visitors and staff were quarantined within the building15 during the period from 29 april to 14 june a total of 151 sars patients were transferred to 11 hospitals mainly eight hospitals in taipei citycase clusters at eight additional hospitals in taiwan have been linked to the initial outbreak at hospital h preliminary data suggested that many of these clusters occurred when pre-symptomatic patients or patients with sars whose symptoms were attributed to other causes were discharged or transferred to other healthcare facilities sars later spread to multiple cities and regions of taiwan including several university and private hospitals four of these hospitals including a 2300-bed facility in southern taiwan discontinued emergency and routine services15
between 14 march and 30 july 2003 a total of 3032 patients were reported to the department of health in taiwan as having possible sars among them 668 22 patients met the may who criteria for a probable case among these probable cases 53 8 were reported to have travelled to mainland china and hong kong in the ten days before the onset of illness 41 6 were close contacts of a known case 376 56 were hospital-related of whom 120 19 were health care workers 17 doctors 63 nurses and 40 allied health care workers and 256 38 were in the same medical ward or had visited their relatives there table 1

 between 16 march and 10 may mobile teams assessed a total of 86 hospitals fifty-three percent of the study hospitals had triage and segregation of possible sars case-patients but 24 2186 did not prohibit visitors from patients rooms and 31 2786 did not restrict traffic outside the patients roomsof the study hospitals 87 7586 had hand-washing facilities immediately outside patients rooms or anterooms at the other 11 hospitals hand-washing facilities were at a location further from the anteroom seventy-nine 92 had private rooms for sars case-patients and 72 6286 had n-95 or better respirators in stock seventy-two percent used at least one layer of protective gown and had access to eye protection head covers and foot protectionoverall at the time of the mobile team visits 46 53 hospitals implemented recommendations of triage and segregation of possible sars case-patients private negative pressure isolation rooms minimal ppe for all staff entering patients rooms and effective visitor policies visitors restricted from patients rooms16 17
this reported outbreak of sars in taiwan caused 668 probable cases with severe deterioration of pulmonary function and 181 deaths consistent with other findings18 19 healthcare workers in taiwan were at higher risk of infection from sars within three months sars developed in 120 healthcare workers after exposure at work in the medical ward where the index patient was hospitalized all had unremarkable medical histories recent reports suggest that infection control practices can be effective in some settings20 21 just over half 53 of taiwanese hospitals had implemented recommended infection control practice at the time of the mobile team visits however as with another report22 an outbreak occurred among hospital healthcare workersas more becomes known about the transmission of sars-associated coronavirus infections infection control practices at hospitals evaluating patients for sars will need to evolve even as the sars epidemic appears to wane23 being prepared for sars infection control remains important among hospitals future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of specific infection control practices as well as assess the implementation of effective measures in countries affected by sarsin this study a substantial difference was documented in both the number of cases and the mortality rate after applying the who definition proposed in august 2003 it is important to note that the later definition published after the outbreak was over was developed to serve a different purpose in may 2003 the case definition focused on the clinical picture and was deliberately sensitive in order to identify most suspected cases and implement control measures for sars the case definition in august was modified to increase specificity by focusing on laboratory confirmed cases in addition the new definition allows for the calculation of a low mortality mainly by permitting deaths in sars patients to be attributed to other underlying diseases and therefore not contribute to the numerator including sars patients regardless of etiology would prevent subjectivity and provide more uniform data for comparison across countriesquarantining the contacts is a new challenge to the public within this period between 28 march and 30 july a total of 151270 persons 07 of the population of taiwan were quarantined only 46 class a 34 class b 12 were subsequently classified as probable cases in humans infected with the virus there is a wide range of reported incubation periods from five to 15 days before patients become symptomatic18 19 this lag time allows apparently healthy people to travel by air almost anywhere in the world after they have been exposed once they become symptomatic the disease is most likely spread through person-to-person transmission24 as expected based on the known transmission patterns for sars19 20 the fact that transmission appeared to occur from patients in the symptomatic phase of illness but not from those who were in the pre-symptomatic phase suggests that the risk of transmission varies by the phase of illness it is likely that persons who were in contact with patients with the pre-symptomatic phase were at low risk the fact that transmission has been limited to only close contacts of patients such as healthcare workers and family members who were not using contact or respiratory precautions suggests that either droplet secretions or direct contact probably played a role4 sars patients should limit interactions outside the home and should not go to work school out-of-home childcare or other public areas until ten days after the resolution of fever in taiwan family and other close contacts those on airplanes with ill sars patients if seated within three rows in front or three rows behind the patient and those returning from sars affected areas were given strictly compulsory home quarantine for ten days it must be considered whether in the future household members or other close contacts of sars patients need to limit their activities outside the home as recommended by the usa cdc25
epidemiologic investigation and laboratory studies suggest that most patients with illnesses meeting the case definition of sars in taiwan were linked to a common source to date 375 of cases identified in this report were confirmed positivein this study some clinical and laboratory features were identified on presentation that were associated with death advanced age being male and coexisting underlying medical conditions were independent predictors of mortality from sars information on hepatitis b status was not systematically collected a risk factor reported elsewhere26
sars has already become a global health hazard and its high infectivity is alarming the decrease in worldwide incidence is gratifying but it may simply reflect the seasonal variation in the transmission of the virus24 some experts have predicted the return of sars in the cool season containing an outbreak at an early stage affords a greater chance of success than does a later response and clearly puts less strain on the healthcare system future strategies to control the spread of sars need to emphasize the greater risk to certain populations health care workers older people and people who have chronic diseases isolation of cases stringent infection control measures in hospitals and vigilant surveillance at both community and population levels are imperative26 27 28
quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease the primary purpose of quarantine is to prevent transmission of an infectious agent from those potentially incubating it persons are usually quarantined in their homes but they may also be quarantined in community based facilities 1 the scientific use of quarantine was began by united kingdom in response to plague but this word was first used by venice italy in 1127 with regard to leprosy 2 most recently quarantine has been widely used worldwide as a tool to prevent transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19india is using quarantine as a tool to fight covid-19 since the first case of covid-19 was diagnosed in january 2020 in view of rising number of cases government of india imposed nationwide lockdown since 25th march 2020 to break the transmission chain 3 with the enforcement of lockdown a very large number of migrant workers from cities along with their families started to return back to their homes such susceptible and exposed individuals may act as super-spreaders at their native places as it will be difficult to track them and their contacts ministry of health and family welfare in its advisory directed them to be placed under quarantine at their respective states either at home or at quarantine centres for 14 d since the last exposure 4 the quarantine requirements following exposure to covid-19 were designed to minimise transmission to the community as well as to protect household membersfor normal psychological development and wellbeing of children companionship and social interaction is an essential component there is an increased risk of psychiatric disorders whenever there is separation of children from their caregivers 5 6 more importantly the age of initial separation is known to be relevant to psychological development 7 it has been realised that quarantine like measures might have adverse psychological effect on childrenthere are many articles which compare adult and healthcare workers under quarantined to those who were not quarantined but there are very few comparable studies on children and adolescents regarding their quarantine experiences especially from india this study describes understanding compliance and psychological impact of quarantine on children and adolescents in the age group of 9 y to 18 y during covid-19 outbreakduring covid-19 outbreak ministry of health and family welfare released its guidelines regarding quarantine at home and at facilities centres local public health units were responsible for identification and quarantine of contacts of potential covid-19 cases complying with the government order all persons placed under quarantine were to be provided with mask thermometer if necessary and instructions about quarantine requirements these supplies were to be delivered to the individuals residence or at quarantine centres all quarantined adolescents were to undergo daily medical examination for appearance of symptoms suggestive of covid-19 quarantined persons were encouraged to remain in contact with their family members through phone to avoid anxiety 1 4children and adolescents in the age range of 9 y to 18 y who were placed either at home quarantine or facility quarantine who remained well and were followed by healthcare workers after discharge from quarantine centres were included in the study with these criteria 121 children and adolescents were eligible to participate comparable groups were taken from the neighbourhood of quarantined children and adolescents with the same family background number  131 all children and adolescents were attending either government or private school before this period children and adolescents were interviewed in detail along with their parents regarding their knowledge of quarantine facility compliance during quarantine and psychological effect of quarantine this interview was based on a preformed questionnaire which assessed adolescents understanding of rationale of quarantine quarantine behaviors as well as socioeconomic and psychological impacts during quarantine required behaviors included mask usage living in separate room with door closed and restriction of activities designed to prevent covid-19 transmission to the household and to the communityethical approval was taken from the institutes ethics committee written informed consent was taken from children and their parents in statistical methods first descriptive analysis was done which includes frequency percent mean and standard deviation students t test for continuous variables and pearsons chi square test for categorical variables were used to compare quarantined and non-quarantined groups level of significance was set at p 005 data entry and statistical analysis were performed using the statistical package for social science spss version 260the age range of children and adolescents was between 9 y to 18 y with a mean age of 154 y most of the adolescents were males 8512 thirty seven 3057 were quarantined at home and rest 7768 at quarantine centresmost adolescents 7355 identified correctly that quarantine had been imposed to protect the community whereas only 5123 of adolescents understood that the use of quarantine restrictions was also to protect members of the household less than half 4463 reported that quarantine would not protect themselves only 1652 of adolescents were able to understand all rationale based questions table 1 compliance with quarantine behavior varied from 2561 slept in a separate room by themselves to 9256 did not go out to socialise the proportion of adolescents who adhered and were compliant with all the household protective measures was only 1071 n  13 whereas compliance with all the community protecting measures combined was higher 1735 when compliance to all the behaviors was taken as a whole it reduced to 743 only it means only 9 743 children and adolescents were correctly following all the instructions related to quarantine the most difficult 6526 activity for children and adolescents to comply with was not going out of the house to socialise to visit friends and relativesthis study also assessed qualitative indicators feelings of psychological impact associated with quarantine worry 6859 helplessness 6611 and fear 6198 were the most common feelings experienced during quarantine children and adolescents who were under quarantine had statistically significant more psychological problems than those who were not quarantined fear p 00001 nervousness p 00001 and annoyance p 0001 were most significantly seen in the quarantined group anxiety related insomnia isolation boredom not statistically significant and sadness was also more common in the quarantine groupwhen asked in detail these high levels of psychological problems like worry helplessness and fear were mainly associated with loss of fathers job financial losses of family and unavailability of basic life needs some children and adolescents were concerned about infecting others whereas a few thought that they had covid-19 p 005 it was very surprising that children and adolescents who were quarantined felt that people reacted differently to them than the non-quarantined group with statistically significant difference p 00001 these children and adolescents also avoided people having fever and cough p 005pandemics like other disasters have been a part of human history for centuries however response to pandemics necessarily differs as it requires separation isolation and quarantine beyond the potential community protective effects attributed to quarantine the risk to quarantined individuals needs to be identified 8this study in children and adolescents raises important concerns regarding the effectiveness and applicability of quarantine in recent era ministry of health and family welfare of india directed in its advisory that asymptomatic contacts of potential covid-19 patients were required to remain in quarantine for 14 d after their last exposure 1 4 it is obvious that implementation of quarantine for preventing transmission at community level will be only effective when we adhere to its compliance but there are many limitations of such hypothetical agreement of quarantine adherence as this study shows compliance with all requirements was as low as 743 indicating that quarantine in its present form would be of limited value in controlling transmission family members were at a higher risk since the compliance was only 1735 compliance in relation to preventing community transmission was significantly higher 1735 than household transmission 1071 as a whole most of the children and adolescents were non-compliant potentially putting their family and community at risk results of present study in relation to compliance of quarantine requirements are lower than the previous studies 9 10 unfortunately almost half were supposing that they were protecting themselves in quarantine table 1here it is observed that there remains a significant chance of improvement in compliance this can be achieved by improved knowledge about the disease and a better understanding of quarantine measures a previous study reported that when asked about specific problems related to quarantine the two most frequently cited major problems were emotional difficulties related to the confinement and not getting paid because they had to miss their duty 9 in the present study the most common difficulty for children and adolescents was not going out to socialisechildren who were quarantined at facilitycentre might be more susceptible to mental health problems than children who were quarantined at home because of their higher risk of infection and fear caused by parental separation 11 12 however the authors did not analyse these relationship in their study so beyond the potential community protecting effects attributed to quarantine the risk of quarantined children needs to be identifiedthe consistency of the psychological problem in children and adolescents is very high in the present study group in this study most around 68 of quarantined children showed some or other form of psychological distress which is much higher than the non-quarantined group with statistically significant difference in most of the feelings table 2 other studies related to psychological impact in quarantined adults generally reported a high prevalence of symptoms of psychological distress like the present study these studies reported emotional disturbance depression stress low mood irritability insomnia posttraumatic stress symptoms anger and emotional exhaustion quarantine studies also found a range of other feelings such as confusion fear anger grief numbness and anxiety related insomnia 8 9 13 14 a study on children also found that the mean post-traumatic stress scores were four times higher in children who had been quarantined to those who were not quarantined 8 long term behavior changes after the quarantine period such as vigilant hand washing and avoidance of crowds have been reported 15however point to be noted here is that non-quarantined children also show a higher level of stress during covid-19 period previous studies from india have reported psychological distress in 13 to 45 of school children and adolescents 16 17 higher level of psychological problems in these children can be attributed to restriction of activity school closure and confinement at home due to nationwide lockdown so this study also provides comparable data of psychological impact of pandemic within the non-quarantined groupthe distribution of different feelings and emotions in this study matches with previous studies 8 9 though frequency of worry helplessness and fear was much higher in the present study on detailed interview the authors found that children and their parents were more concerned about financial loss loss of fathers job future uncertainties and unavailability of daily needs like food and water here most children were related to families of migrant workers thus socioeconomic and financial status of parents also has a significant role as a stressor in quarantine period financial loss as a result of quarantine was found to be a risk factor for symptoms of psychological disorders anger and anxiety 18 19although great efforts have been made by the government of india across country it is almost impossible to provide psychological interventions nationwide because most local support focuses only on meeting basic needs of children in one study inadequate basic supplies like food water and clothes during quarantine was a source of frustration anxiety and anger even after four to 6 mo after release 18 to minimise the psychological effects we should increase childrens access to disease information via comic books and videos and timely referral to psychiatrist social media could play an important role allowing people who are quarantined to update their loved ones about themselves so having a working mobile phone is now a necessity not a luxurythere are several limitations of this study the sample size was small but it included wide range of adolescent age group socioeconomic details such as education and household income were not collected in the comparable group which could be helpful in planning future requirements in respect to quarantine furthermore analysis of the quarantined household members and household composition was not done this study relies on childrens adolescents and their parents retrospective perception of feelings and behaviors associated with stressful experiences which could be flawed due to recall bias and social desirabilityin conclusion this study suggests that understanding compliance and knowledge regarding quarantine behavior is poor in the reported group also the psychological impact of quarantine is wide ranging and substantial quarantine in its present form requires further research to its utility for assessing transmission of covid-19 especially in a resource-limited country like ours revised requirements improved preparation along with collaborative network of psychiatrists psychotherapists researchers and community volunteers can minimise the psychological impact of quarantine experiencessince the 2019 novel coronavirus covid-19 pneumonia outbreak previously referred to as wuhan pneumonia that originated in wuhan china on december 1 2019 spread to korea an arduous march has just begun in korea 1 after the spread of the atypical covid-19 pneumonia from wuhan china to korea by a patient was first reported 2 a community-based spread has occurred in korea although the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 pneumonia in china have been rapidly reported 3 its early phase characteristics prediction of progress from upper respiratory infection to pneumonia and other information have not yet been clearly understood based on the information regarding the outbreak cases upgraded quarantine and isolation measures has been suggested to resist the spread of the covid-19 in korea 4an outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-ncov infection between may and december 2015 in korea resulted in 186 cases of infection 38 deaths and 16692 exposed individuals who were quarantined despite the elapsed time since this outbreak a high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were reported by healthcare workers who treated the mers-ncov infected patients and by hemodialysis patients in quarantine 5 additionally the negative emotion and stress experienced by the healthcare workers who treated the mers-ncov infected patients were characterized by trigger events categorized into mistake missing delay due to communication failure and others therefore the identification of the trigger events was suggested as an important hospital management guideline during an infectious disease outbreak 6 moreover among the exposed individuals in quarantine not diagnosed with the mers-ncov infection 76 and 166 presented anxiety and feelings of anger symptoms respectively during the quarantine period even four to six months after the end of the quarantine period 30 and 64 patients persistently presented with symptoms of anxiety and anger respectively 7 thus after the mers-ncov infection outbreak ended in korea it was proposed that the infected patients quarantined individuals healthcare workers and public require emotional care and support during an infectious disease outbreakto the best of our knowledge the detailed mental health problems of the patients infected with covid-19 pneumonia and healthcare workers treating the infected patients have not yet been reported however it is suggested that both confirmed and suspected covid-19 patients may experience the fear of the consequences of this infection including death and severe physical disability furthermore boredom loneliness and anger could be experienced by individuals in quarantine it is also suggested that anxiety symptoms and distress may be worsened not only by the infection symptoms but also by the adverse effects of the treatment the infectious disease outbreaks commonly cause anxiety and fear uncertainty and stigmatization that can be prevented by medical and psychiatric treatment 8 the need for mental health care during the covid-19 outbreak has been emphasized in korea since 528 and 173 koreans who escaped from wuhan due to the covid-19 outbreak in china have been quarantined in asan and jincheon respectively in korea the mental health professionals including psychiatrists from the national mental health center have been deployed to provide psychological counseling to individuals in quarantine moreover mental health care services for the covid-19 outbreak are being provided by national hospitals and community mental health centers throughout the country the national center for disaster trauma distributed leaflets promoting mental health care against the distress caused by infectious disease outbreaks 9 according to this leaflet 9 somatic symptoms insomnia anxiety anger rumination decreased concentration low mood and loss of energy are listed as the warning symptoms that should be evaluated and managed by mental health professionals especially focusing on the reliable information permitting the expression of your negative emotions keeping in touch with family friends and colleagues maintaining regular life activities participating in pleasurable activities and maintaining your pride are listed as the coping skill recommendations for the individuals in quarantine it is of utmost importance that this information is disseminated to the masses on a larger scale it is also necessary that the detailed mental health problems of the confirmed or suspected covid-19 patients healthcare workers treating the infected patients and public should be collected to update the information regarding the distress caused by infectious disease outbreaks and provide more advancedmental health care for covid-19 pneumoniain terms of the mental health care response to the covid-19 outbreak in china xiang et al 8 suggested three important factors 1 multidisciplinary mental health teams psychiatrists psychiatric nurses clinical psychologists and other mental health professionals 2 clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the covid-19 outbreak and 3 establishment of secure services to provide psychological counseling eg electronic devices and applications these suggestions by xiang et al 8 could be a good reference for providing mental health care in response to the covid-19 outbreak in korea furthermore following the 2014 sewol ferry disaster 2015 mers-ncov outbreak and 2017 pohang earthquake the mental health care system to combat distress caused by national disasters has been gradually established and improved 10 thus the covid-19 outbreak raises the question of how provision of psychological support during national disasters has increased and what is still lacking in koreain december 2019 an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was reported in wuhan china 1 by march 11 2020 the outbreak had spread to over 100 countries and was classified as a pandemic by the world health organization 2 the united states us was the most severely impacted country with more than 2 million confirmed cases and over 110000 deaths in the first three months 3because the coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person even when the carrier is asymptomatic physicalsocial distancing is required to limit the spread of the disease 4 to encourage social distancing the us white house declared a national emergency on march 13 prompting widespread closings of schools and businesses 5 by march 24 shelter-in-place or stay-at-home policies were ordered for 175 million americans figure 1
 6 these policies dramatically changed residents lifestyles work commitments social opportunities and caregiver responsibilities for many individuals the pandemic led to financial stress food insecurity and fear of becoming ill or transmitting the virus to others 7the present work investigated how covid-19 impacted the sleep health of americans during the first couple weeks of the pandemic declaration figure 1 this question has translational health implications poorer sleep quality is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections 8 reduced efficacy of vaccinations 9 and worsened mental health 10 when people are sleep deprived they show greater anxietystress reactivity 11 greater tendencies to blame and punish others for mistakes 12 poorer job performance 13 and lower cognitive functioning 14in addition to translational implications the covid-19 social isolation policies provide an opportunity to test how ones environment influences sleep patterns if poor sleep health is primarily driven by stress then the covid-19 pandemic should be linked to poorer sleep quality due to increased financial food and health stressors that cause pre-bed cognitive arousal 15 alternatively if poor sleep health is primarily driven by demanding workschool obligations then the covid-19 pandemic should be linked to better sleep quality due to reduced early morning requirements lessened time-sensitive workschool demands and simplified to-do lists 16 17 it is also possible of course that people will show resilience in their overall sleep quality to the covid-19 pandemic 18the procedure timeline relative to the covid-19 pandemic spread is illustrated in figure 1 baseline-phase data collection occurred on february 17 2020 at baseline there had been 0 deaths and only 15 confirmed cases in the us 19 there were no business or school closings and the national leading experts eg anthony fauci had not advised lifestyle changes in response to covid-19 20 in addition at the time of baseline assessment no formal concerns were expressed by the us white house or local governments 20 the baseline survey assessed demographic information global sleep quality vulnerability to stress-related sleep disturbance sleepiness intraindividual variability in sleep2
chronotype overall health and music listening habits1 music data are reported elsewhere 21quarantine-phase data collection occurred from march 25 through march 27 2020 which was approximately two weeks after the us declared a national emergency and social distancingquarantine policies began at least one week before the march 25 assessment forty-one states had mandated state-wide school closures and many schools in the remaining 9 states had closed voluntarily a similar pattern existed for non-essential businesses eg there was local school closures before statewide school closures in texas 22 we launched the survey at approximately 230pm cdt which was the same time of day as the baseline survey data collection concluded at 440pm cdt on march 27 2020 the questions included in the survey were the same as at baseline but we replaced the questions on music listening surveys with questions regarding covid-19-related stressorsexperiences as well as retrospective recall questions on sleep patterns prior to versus during the covid-19 quarantinethe primary sleep measure was the pittsburgh sleep quality index psqi 23 the psqi is a 9-item questionnaire assessing sleep habits and sleep difficulties over the past month the questionnaire yields a widely-used global sleep quality index in which higher scores indicate worse sleep quality primary dependent variable to better capture the covid-19 quarantine time interval we modified the psqi to refer to sleep over the past two weeksvulnerability to stress-related sleep disturbance was measured by the ford insomnia response to stress test first 24 the first has participants rate the likelihood of experiencing difficulty sleeping in 9 stressful situations on a 4-point scale from not likely to very likely eg how likely are you to have difficulty sleeping after a stressful experience during the day total first scores range from 9 to 36 and higher scores indicate greater vulnerability to sleep disturbances in stressful situationsdaytime sleepiness was measured by the stanford sleepiness scale sss 25 participants rated how sleepy they felt at the moment from 1 feeling active vital alert or wide awake to 7 no longer fighting sleep sleep onset soon having dream-like thoughts participants additionally reported their coffee consumption number of cups that day chronotype from definitely morning to definitely evening and their overall health 5-point scale ranging from poor to excellentin addition to the aforementioned questionnaires during the quarantine phase we additionally had participants attempt to retrospectively recall how they slept before the covid-19 pandemic relative to how they were sleeping currently participants were asked to estimate their bedtime risetime sleep duration sleep onset latency and the number of nighttime awakenings for before and during the quarantineto examine moderators of sleep health during the quarantine phase we asked questions that focused on covid-19 experiences participants indicated whether their local government had issued shelter-in-place orders or stay-at-home orders whether they or people around them had shown symptoms of covid-19 or been tested positive for covid-19 and whether their caregiver or work responsibilities had changed during the covid-19 quarantine moreover participants rated the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with ten statements related to covid-19 and reported whether they experienced changes in how well-rested they have felt during the quarantine on a 7-point likert scale these statements can be seen in table s1 we analyzed participants responses on these statements by conducting factor analysis with varimax rotation to reduce the number of dimensions factor analysis revealed that the ten statements loaded onto three factors that we labeled adverse life impact worrystress and pro-actions we summed the scores on the items in each dimension to constitute a dimensional score last participants completed a free response question in which they were invited to comment on how the quarantinesocial distancing had affected them responses are available at httpsosfioey3fz at both baseline and quarantine phases participants reported standard demographic eg age gender raceethnicity and work information employed shiftwork at the quarantine phase we also had participants report their geographical location by doing so we were able to match participants location to the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in their state of residence as of midnight march 24 2020 the geographical distributions of participants and covid-19 cases at the time of data collection are displayed in figure s1 johns hopkins university 26 note that the number of confirmed cases may be inconsistent with daily data reported by the who because the johns hopkins database extracted state-level data from multiple publicly available sources and updated the results in real time 27participants who met any of the following criteria did not pass data quality control 1 reported impossible values eg sleeping for 25 hoursday 2 responded to free response questions in an identical manner as other participants suggesting a bot 3 demographic information at follow-up did not match demographic information at baseline of 791 survey responses 699 passed data quality control and were included in analyses figure

study hypotheses study design power analyses and dependent variables were pre-registered to open science framework we used spss version 26 to conduct all statistical analyses all tests were two-tailed and results were considered significant if p  05 effect sizes were estimated using cohens d for t-tests  for chi-square tests and correlation coefficients for pearsons correlation analysesfor the cross-sectional analyses we used independent-samples t-tests to compare the sleep measures across participants who completed the study in mid february baseline and participants who only completed the study in late march quarantine phase we then supplemented the t-tests with independent samples bayesian analyses for the longitudinal analyses we used paired-sample t-tests to assess changes in sleep measures in participants who completed the survey both in mid-february and late-march supplementing these t-tests with related-samples bayesian analyseswe first examined whether there were demographic differences between participants at the baseline assessment n  199 and participants who only completed the quarantine assessment n  500 table 1 the groups were similar in proportion of females 1  013 p  722   01 raceethnicity 1  120 p  273   04 proportion of employed participants 1  004 p  844   01 and proportion of participants living in a state with more than 1000 confirmed covid-19 cases 1  129 p  256   05 relative to baseline participants quarantine-phase participants were 292 years older t696  300 p  003 d  025 however because chronological age was not related to the primary sleep measure psqi r577  004 p  914 it will not be discussed further see figure s2the only other demographic difference across the two groups was that the quarantine phase included fewer shift workers than the baseline phase 1  767 p  006   11 one possible explanation for this change was that shift workers were more likely than non-shift workers to be classified as essential workers during the pandemic meaning they were likely less available for study participation shift work is known to influence sleep quality and was associated with worse psqi sleep quality in the current study figure 3
a therefore we will address the influence of shift work below using sensitivity analyses in addition 768 of participants reported having symptoms or testing positive for covid-19 which was associated with considerably worse sleep quality figure 3b we accounted for this potential confound to the cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons via sensitivity analyses see also study on frontline healthcare workers 28 29
table 2
shows the cross-sectional comparison between participants who only completed the survey during the quarantine n  500 and participants who completed the baseline survey n  199 the two groups slept very similarly as measured by the primary dependent measure psqi global sleep quality t678  151 p  130 d  013 and the secondary measures first t697  125 p  211 d  011 sss t697  124 p  216 d  010 bayes factor bf analyses indicated moderate to strong evidence for the null hypothesis for psqi scores bf10  021 first scores bf10  014 and sss scores bf10  014 sensitivity analyses that excluded shift workers and participants who tested positive or reported symptoms of covid-19 figure 3 30 31 showed a nominal though nonsignificant leaning toward improved sleep quality during the pandemic table 2 this was an interesting initial finding running counter to the notion that stress-induced heightened arousal globally worsened sleep quality during the covid-19 pandemicwe next repeated the sleep measure analyses using participants who completed both the baseline and quarantine phase assessments the data are presented in table 3
 this longitudinal analysis converged with the cross-sectional findings in showing no significant changes in the primary dependent measure psqi global score t82  188 p  064 d  021 bf10  048 or the secondary dependent measures first scores t85  068 p  497 d  007 bf10  011 sss scores t85  056 p  577 d  006 bf10  010 as we initially observed with the cross-sectional data table 2 the longitudinal data showed nominal improvements in sleep quality during the quarantine period table 3 for example it can be seen from figure 4
a that 47 of participants had improved psqi scores from baseline to quarantine a significantly larger proportion than the 29 of participants who had worsened psqi scores 1  576 p  016the sensitivity analyses on non-shiftworkers without covid-19 positive tests or symptoms provided additional evidence for these sleep improvements participants psqi sleep quality scores improved significantly from the baseline to the quarantine phase table 3 t50  261 p  012 d  037 bf10  253 given the significant overall effect we more closely examined why psqi scores were improving with the data detailed in table s2 during the quarantine phase participants showed increased sleep duration t51  208 p  043 d  029 with delayed bedtimes t51  236 p  022 d  033 delayed risetimes t50  230 p  026 d  032 and fewer sleep disturbances t50  271 p  009 d  038the cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence has thus far indicated that for many us adults sleep quality was not changed early in the covid-19 pandemic interestingly when excluding shiftworkers and symptomatic individuals longitudinal analyses indicated that sleep quality improved early in the pandemic in us adults at the end of the survey we asked participants to retrospectively recall how they thought they slept before the pandemic in comparison to their current sleep those reports are provided in table 4
 when asked to retrospectively recall their sleep participants estimated that they had slept much better prior to the covid-19 quarantine including greater ease falling asleep sleep onset latency t574  583 p  001 d  24 bf10  1000 fewer awakenings in the middle of the night t574  656 p  001 d  27 bf10 1000 earlier bedtimes t428  391 p  001 d  19 bf10  1000 later wake times t434  676 p  001 d  32 bf10 1000 and feeling more rested t580  830 p  001 d  034 bf10  1000 no changes to sleep duration t568  184 p  066 d  08 bf10  018one interpretation of the retrospective recall data is that they indicate rosy retrospection ie remembering the past as being more positive than it actually was andor an expectancy effect such that when covid-19-related changes are queried participants are biased toward negative responses 32 33 such psychological reporting tendencies have previously been noted when sleep was measured during wartime 34 this explanation was supported in the longitudinal sample shiftworkers symptomatic individuals excluded they showed rosier remembering of their pre-quarantine sleep when using their actual values at baseline for comparison for example at baseline these participants estimated that they slept 670 hoursnight sd  115 but during the follow-up they retrospectively recalled their pre-quarantine sleep duration to be better than that m  695 h sd  104 h t48  268 p  010 d  038 bf10  296 figure s3 furthermore at baseline these participants stated it took them 2979 min to fall asleep sd  3410 but during the follow-up they retrospectively recalled their pre-quarantine sleep latency to be 23 better than that m  2296 min sd  2244 min t50  172 p  092 d  024 bf10  045 participants bedtime t48  067 p  509 d  009 bf10  014 and risetime t49  062 p  540 d  009 bf10  013 estimates did match the values they reported at baseline providing greater confidence in participants reports of circadian delays during the covid-19 pandemic
figure 4 indicates that there was individual-level variability in changes to sleep during the pandemic to understand the sources of this variability in change we controlled for baseline psqi global scores and tested whether quarantine psqi global scores were related to demographic psychological or quarantine-related social factors changes in sleep quality were not significantly related to demographic factors age r

has taken the lead by calling the saarc the south asian association for regional cooperation nations to act unanimously by setting up an emergency fund in defense against the covid19 the idea has been backed by all saarc nations with a further proposal for the establishment of the integrated disease surveillance portal on its own india is following a twodirectional approach by observing lockdown and ramping up the healthcare infrastructure however policymakers and health care administrators are striving hard due to the limited testing infrastructure for covid19 cases they are looking up to epidemiologists for realtime case reporting to install policies at large the longer incubation period and reproduction value r0 of 22 render policymakers exposed to a higher rate of asymptomatic positive covid19 cases and community spread at a very high speedthe ultimate goal of policymakers and health care professionals lies in the containment of novel coronavirus to mitigate the fearful economic and psychological effects primarily we focus on two research objectives one we aim to understand the challenges from the covid19 pandemic for south asia and two we investigate the strategic and operational responses to this pandemic by policymakers and healthcare professionals respectively in south asia in dealing with the policy interventions with an aim to limit the loss of human capital in the region due to this pandemic our findings are classified at strategic and operational levels at the strategic level we analyse the strategies being employed by policymakers while at operational levels we investigate the actions being taken by health administrators our analysis covers various parameters such as surveillance and contact tracing virus carriers travel restrictions and evacuations of the citizens abroad research activities for understanding the health care emergencies and longterm economic consequences diagnostics isolation and quarantine methods and facilities clinical management of patients training and safety of health care providers creation of saarc emergency fund trade and economy insulation and other awareness activities by doing so we make both theoretical and practical contributions theoretically we contribute to the body of knowledge in diverse fields of pandemic and disaster management health policy public policy and sociology hadjimanolis  boustras 2013 jain leka  zwetsloot 2018 in practical terms we inform the governments across the world on dealing with pandemics at both strategic and operational levelsthe paper is organised as follows section 1 introduces the rationale behind this study section 2 reviews the related literature section 3 discusses the methodology section 4 highlights the findings and the development on policymaking front section 5 presents the policy implications and section 6 concludesthe contagion of covid19 arising from wuhan city china has spread it wings throughout the world in the past various diseases have emerged in different corners of the world with viruses such as ebola virus avian h7n9 sarscov or merscov and major pathogens as ebola zika nipah and coronaviruses cov dhama et al 2020 however covid19 has created an alarming public health emergency situation as its estimated spread and reproduction value r naught r0 is 22 cascella rajnik cuomo dulebohn  di napoli 2020 higher competence rate of covid19 humantohuman transmission dictates the policymakers for finding problemcentric and scalable solutions so as to decrease the value of r0 to less than 1 however tackling covid19 contagion remains a challenge for policymakers especially because the transmission rate is misleading due to such factors as an unclear mechanism of transmission the gestation period of virus till its clinical symptomatic manifestation and falsenegative cases cascella et al 2020in line with moore et als 2008 framework considering surveillance quality and timeliness as pillars for pandemic preparedness policymakers and medical administrators need to have more streamlined preventive measures in the first go baekkeskov 2016 advocated scienceled policymaking based on epistemic deliberation and ideational trajectories where the former relates to the translation of new information into policy and the latter projects the path dependency and change of trajectory after assimilation of new information during pandemic 2009 h1n1flu based on past studies the current situation demands more novelty in dealing with covid19 the preemptive measures to be learnt from sars emergency followed by h1n1 influenza pandemic suggest the transcending nature of pandemics and imposition of travel and trade restrictions in the interest of global public health mackey  liang 2012 however reinforcement of strict policy measures for the containment of covid19 pandemic requires strong epidemiological evidence in terms of confirmed reported and unreported suspect probable undiagnosed cases which may lead to a community spread in more populous regions of the world this makes saarc countries more vulnerable due to huge population poor infrastructure and lack of health care professionals policymakers across the southasian region have started to work in unison for adjudicating a more diligent approach in dealing with covid19through this paper we study the role of policymakers and health care administrators in controlling the pandemic the important point to bring out here is the significant role of epidemiologists and health care workers to provide essential data regarding the spread of novel coronavirus there are key unknown factors causing problems for the mitigation efforts of policymakers these include case fatality rate cfr

 which is 031 in this case secondly the incubation period of covid19 being 56 days a large number of asymptomatic cases duration of an infectious period lasting for more than 10 days anderson heesterbeek klinkenberg  hollingsworth 2020 anderson et al 2020 p934 opine that minimising morbidity and associated mortality avoiding an epidemic peak that overwhelms healthcare services keeping the effects on the economy within manageable levels and flattening the epidemic curve to wait for vaccine development and manufacture on the scale and antiviral drug therapies are the key challenges for policymakers during this pandemic governments have suggested restrictions on travel massgatherings maintaining social distancing selfquarantine measures keeping up with hand hygiene and so onour study uses the interviews and opinions of doctors and policymakers from the south asian region involved in tackling the covid19 crisis for this purpose interviews of 8 saarc leaders table 1 and 7 healthcare professionals table 2 were textually analysed with the help of nvivo 12 a qualitative analysis software godau 2004 the input data of saarc leaders were taken from the video conference meeting which was held on march 15 2020 as initiated by mr narender modi pm of india to propose a covid19 emergency fund this study shall be textually analysing the transcribed interviews of different government leaders policymakers doctors and scientists who have played an active role in laying the important administrative measures during the outbreak before importing the data we transcribed the audiovisual interviews of saarc leaders whereas the remaining interviews of healthcare professionals are directly picked from blogs newspaper articles and other social media platforms all the interviews are kept in english language to maintain the uniformity and are further structured in order to separate the interviewee and interviewer texts these interviews were analysed to identify common themesfigure 1 exhibits the frequently used words in the video conference meeting of saarc leadersthe transcribed text derived from the video conference of saarc leaders is grouped for determining the words based on the frequently used words or phrases from the transcribed text of the saarc leaders to understand the measures being taken and the commonality amongst thosetable 3 shows the word frequency table of 20 most frequently repeated words including synonyms by the saarc leadersfigure 2 presents the frequently used words in the interviews of healthcare professionalstable 4 shows the word frequency table of 20 most frequently repeated words including synonyms by healthcare professionalsthe rising rate of transmission of covid19 creates an alarming situation in the south asian region and hence it is necessary to put the citizens of the country on surveillance and tracing some important annotations were observed in this regard most of the saarc leaders agreed and have followed strict surveillance on the activities of the citizenswe have set up an integrated disease surveillance portal to better trace possible virus carriers and the people they contactedshare this surveillance software with saarc partners and training on using this nmappropriate measures are being taken through a systematic consultative review process the national disaster management authority has been mandated to lead the interagency effort and command and control centers have been established at the federal and provincial levels effective coordination and surveillance at all levels zmas the covid19 has spread due to international travels various countries in the initial months made screening points mandatory at the sea and airports for tracing any infected persons the saarc leaders made provisions for the same for their respective nationswe started screening entry into india from midjanuary itself while also gradually increasing restrictions on travel the stepbystep approach has helped avoid panic nmhealth screening measures at entry points by member states we are following who guidelines and implement exit health screening for travelers in the region to avoid crossborder spread zmmany citizens had traveled internationally for different purposes like education business tourism etc and got stuck at covid infected countries so there was a need to evacuate them and bring them to their own countrywe also responded to the call of our people abroad we evacuated nearly 1400 indians from different countries we have now built up a protocol for such evacuations including carrying out testing by our mobile teams deployed abroad nmbefore evacuating the afghans from wuhan they would undergo screening procedure for infection only those who pass the screening will be eligible for evacuation this should minimize the risk of infection within afghanistan agthere was a requirement to evacuate 34 sri lankan students and their families back to sri lanka this was done by the national sri lanka airlines which flew from colombo to wuhan and back to colombo with all 34 passengers another 750 sri lankans were studying in various universities in different provinces of china and the government facilities they were returned to sri lanka grthe governments also started restricting travel by canceling visa appointments and eventually curbing airline services nationally and internationallywe have restricted international movements visa on arrival facility for all foreigners and nonresidents movement of thirdcountry nationals via land rules has been suspected a health certificate is made mandatory to obtain visa from nepalese missions abroad for essential travels to nepal kpsochina and italy are the most severely affected countries of the virus and they are also the number one and number three source markets for maldives tourists since the beginning of february in the case of china and march in the case of italy arrivals from these two countries have been restricted imsto avoid the transmission the infected patients have to be kept in isolation and the ones who are suspected or have the potential to get infected must be quarantined for a few hours or weeks as instructed by the doctors all the saarc leaders have made necessary arrangements to isolate or quarantine their respective citizens since these countries are densely populated it becomes a challenge to provide such facilities to the masseswe have made special efforts to reach out to vulnerable groups were we have developed protocols for each stage of managing this pandemic quarantine and management of isolation facilitiesthe ministry of defence has set up seven more quarantine facilities for covid19 patients recently nmthere are provisions for selfquarantine for certain categories of travelers we are strengthening quarantine facilities in all provinces hospitals and arranged isolations kpsowe managed to send all the contact users and surveillance team to their respective places and inform them of the importance of house quarantineand bring them to the formerly identified quarantine facilities ltdue to the sudden outbreak of covid19 there falls a shortage of expertise and medical arrangements but still in a short span of time nations have coped up to take measures in case of diagnostics and treatments south asian policymakers have been working in close coordination with each other for a collective responsewe could create a common framework for telemedicine for diagnosis of related issues and as advances take place how to be able to coordinate agextremely costly and puts enormous pressure on an overstretched team of healthcare workers for tertiary hospitals in the regions are currently under development shortage of healthcare professionals in general and shortage of specialist doctors imswe have kept four newly built hospitals in dhaka dedicated exclusively to deal with public scientist patients we have also earmarked separate beds in every hospital in all the districts to treat covid19 patients a few vacant buildings have been identified where makeshift hospitals can be established shthe doctors nurses and other healthcare providers are the ones testing or treating such patients it is the utmost priority to keep them safe from this virus by providing ppes masks etc the nations are facing a challenge due to the sudden requirement of these thingswe are assembling a rapid response team of doctors and specialists in india along with testing kits and other equipment they will be on standby to be placed at your disposal if required nmwe have stockpiles of testing kits infrared thermometers isolation gowns and masks students and teachers of the faculty of pharmacy at the university of dhaka have started making lowcost hand sanitizers due to market shortages in the wake of coronavirus fears shthe health workers are being provided with personal protection equipment and the necessary incentives to motivate them we need to ensure a smooth supply of essential medical equipment and sanitary materials in the region kpsoduring these difficult times saarc leaders have joined hands to share their resources expertise and disseminate information to deal with this disease they have proposed strategies regarding the same for quick response and treatment of this newfangled viruswe could create a common research platform to coordinate research on controlling epidemic disease within our south asian region we propose to have ehealth platform which will serve to be a multipurpose vehicle to further discuss and conduct activities such as online training for emergency response personnel knowledge partnerships sharing of expertise in disease surveillance etc nmto ensure rapid response and sharing of experience and expert expertise we should create space for closer cooperation between the health emergency agencies to ensure that the countries in saarc have unhindered exchanges of information about the virus and best practices imswhile tracing testing and treating the patients parallel awareness activities for the whole nation is of due importance for this the government has responded to alert everyone about the symptoms precautions selfquarantine etc through social media podcasts celebrity endorsingthe department of health started giving out health warnings and advice on precautionary measures needed to be followed for prevention of the spread of the virus this is done through mass media press briefings bulletins etc grwe have also undertaken massive awarenessraising campaigns everywhere in bangladesh through all available media including social media shmost of the south asian countries have implemented actions to curb social gatherings so that transmission of coronavirus is curtailed for this purpose all schools universities large events like summits conferences weddings etc are postponed until further noticeto restrict social gatherings we have advanced the usual april school holidays to commence from 11th march further we have closed all universities and other educational institutes also with the aim of minimizing social interaction grwe have to open to our people to avoid attending mass gatherings and other largescale events kpsodealing with the widespread of covid19 sealing the national boundaries locking down the nonessential economic activities have affected the trade and economy of every country adverselynationally and internationally the pms and the presidents also exchanged thoughts on their respective trade and economic situationswe can insulate our internal trade and our local value chains from its impact this can help to prevent such infections from spreading across our region and allows us to keep our internal moments free nmany significant decline in tourist arrivals has a ripple effect on the maldives economymaldives will be looking at a shortfall in government revenues between usd 1359 million and usd 4466 million this year imscovid19 will cause great disruptions to the global economy and bhutan will not be an exception the economic repercussions will not just impact a select few sectors but each and every one of us ltthe questions were related to who should get tested for coronavirus people with symptoms or without symptoms each interviewee agreed that since testing kits are limited so only symptomatic cases should be tested the availability and implementation of the tests was the challenge in the preliminary weeks initially the case was defined as the ones who had traveled abroad in the last 14 days especially to a country where an outbreak of novel coronavirus is happening or had close contact with a laboratoryconfirmed case of covid19no indiscriminate testing for covid19 testing only symptomatic people in india 80 percent of the people will experience coldlike fever and they will recover 20 percent may experience cough cold fever and 5 percent get admitted to the hospital are given supportive treatment and in some cases new medicines are being given bbwhile an interviewee argued that asymptomatic may also have equal chances of getting infected by the virus by testing only possible cases we might miss many of those who are asymptomatic during screening the best strategy is to test among the sari severely affected respiratory infections admitted in the hospitals and the opds outpatient departments of these areas grbwhile developing the testing infrastructure few interviewees gave their expert opinion on the current situation the process of testing and the time consumed by the testing processthe testing time for each sample was close to 1214 hours currently the testing time for each sample is a maximum of four hours we have a screening assay and also additional realtime pcr assays to confirm the presence of the virus pathe test for the coronavirus uses a nucleic acid amplificationbased assay called polymerase chain reaction pcr and a more sensitive form called realtime polymerase chain reaction rtpcr bbthe other experts also mentioned the status of the infrastructure for conducting the covid19 tests the availability of hospitals beds ventilators etc and also the involvement of the private sector for the samewe are ready we have isolated wards aiims india in placewe have to convert icus and wards into facilities to manage a large number of patients prepare isolation rooms special care we have an adequate number of labs in the country to detect the virus screening facilities are sufficient quarantine establishments are working 247 at full capacity to treat those afflicted rgwe have conducted 1500017000 tests so far we have the capacity to conduct 10000 tests per day it means that we can conduct 5000070000 per week the central government on saturday recommended that the maximum charge for each covid19 test by private laboratories should not exceed 4500 bb51 vrdls testing labs with a plan to further support and equip yet another 56 vrdls have been set all across this country paaround 17500 beds are available at various government facilities at the central and state government level further around 14000 quarantine beds have also been made available the facility for collection and testing of clinical samples has been established in 51 laboratories across the country additionally 56 laboratories have been identified as sample collection centers hvtracing surveillance should be stringent as the infected patient must have spent time or shared space with many other peoplefamily colleagues etc the persons coming from covidinfected countries were screened at the airports or seaports the ones with travel history were asked to report all the cases of contacts made by themregular contact surveillance has been initiated across the country for all cases having travel history from covid19affected countries and for people having contact with such persons andor having symptoms hvbefore the travel restrictions were imposed and even afterward there are many who might have been tested negative in incubation period or missed by the system they should be tracked and every symptomatic patient should be tested grbthere were certain shortfalls of thermal screening at such ports which caused missing out the casesa the individual might be in the incubation period which may result in a passenger being asymptomatic at that moment or b the individual might have taken antifever medicine to suppress fever during travelthe novel virus has left all the medical institutions into a race against time with the growing rate of virus spread and deaths of the infected patients discovering drugs and vaccines are of the utmost importance to cure these patients until now there are no foolproof or scientific tested drugs or vaccines available in the market all the interviewees agree that it will take at least a year to develop a vaccinesome drugs which were used to fight h1n1 and also hivrelated drugs are being tried as of now though we have isolated the virus it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine rgindia is the fifth country to have isolated the virus from patient samplessarscov2 strain matches 9899 percent with the wuhan strain this will help expedite the development of drugs vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits in the country the icmr is working closely with the serum institute of india to develop a vaccine bbwe are using both monkeys and transgenic mice that have ace2 the human receptor for the virus the mouse model is widely used in china for drug and vaccine assessmenti can tell you that our monkey model works many scientists consider remdesivir to be the most promising drug now being tested gga worldwide trial called solidarity trial is going on across the globe its a new study led by who and partners which will compare treatments across the world in order to find what is most effective in fighting the coronavirusfour major countries russia china germany and the usa are working overtime for finding and developing a vaccine for the virus rwthe coronavirus is spreading rapidly all over the world leading to an exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases the affected countries have certainly seen a cumulative rate of deceased patients airports have been considered as the major source of this spread the governments of affected countries initially commenced with the screening at the airports subsequently moving to restrict the international flights and eventually banning domestic flights to stop this widespread of covid19wuhan health officials linked a large cluster of cases to the huanan seafood market and closed it on 1st january the assumption was that a virus had jumped to humans from an animal sold and possibly butchered at the marketyou can only control covid19 if you can remove the source of the infection ggthe reasons behind the spread are identified as droplets due to cough or sneeze and the close contact with such surfacethe virus spreads through dropletswhen a sick person coughs or sneezes tiny droplets hang in the air and when another individual inhales these droplets he may get infected also the incubation period of the virus is 214 days by the time the person realises that he has the disease he has already spread the virus to other people it may even survive 68 hours on the surfaces the elderly group with the age of 60 and people with comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension chronic heart or respiratory diseases are at high risk of catching the virus rgthe big mistake in the us and europe in my opinion is that people arent wearing masks this virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact droplets play a very important roleyouve got to wear a mask because when you speak there are always droplets coming out of your mouth ggthe transmission of this disease is categorised into 4 stages where stage 1 is getting imported cases stage 2 is the local transmission stage 3 is community transmission and stage 4 is the epidemic stage community transmission happens when a person gets infected even without being exposed to any infected person and has not traveled to any covid19 affected country aggressive random testing of the population is the only way to detect this given that covid19 is contagious even when asymptomatic ie the disease does not produce any visible symptoms in the infected especially the young but they are still able to pass on the infectionthe healthcare providers have continuously been the pillars in the fight against coronavirus periodically with the help of government they have set certain guidelines for the public which if followed will help everyone aggressively defeat this disease these guidelines relate to selfdiscipline hygiene quarantine isolation social distancing etcthe best way to avoid the spread of the risk is to follow simple public health measures at all times observing good personal hygiene monitoring your health practicing frequent handwashing or use of an alcoholbased hand sanitizer following respiratory etiquettes etcscreenings travel restrictions shutdowns social distancingis a precautionary measure which must necessarily be based on the number and nature of confirmed cases hvsocial distancing is an essential strategy for the control of any infectious diseases especially if they are respiratory infections we used nonpharmaceutical strategies because you dont have any specific inhibitors or drugs and you dont have any vaccines you have to make sure you isolate any cases close contacts should be in quarantine suspend public gatherings and restrict movement which is why you have a lockdown ggthe policymakers and healthcare providers have been showing efficient teamwork while dealing with this pandemic the healthcare administrators being at the operational level convey the challenges they face to the policymakers who then respond to them at a strategic levelthe covid19 outbreak has inflicted a direct cost on human health that poses the most important effect on society this direct cost can be further worsened by flawed economic and policy structures and the indirect loss caused by the disease can enhance the economic ripple effects therefore the policymakers ought to take all possible measures to neutralize the negative effect bivens 2020 many experts assert that people are linked via an invisible transmission network connected by the physical contacts between individuals the inhalation of common air which contains the particles that are coughed sneezed or even just breathed out and in by any number of sick people as well as between individuals and physical objects that may transfer the deposited viral particles the network of transmission is active all the time as we engage in daily activities the risk lies in the interconnectivity of the individuals resulting in contracting and transmitting the disease to others the government has been working on breaking this tough network although there is room for more measures to be taken shen  baryam 2020the findings of this study lay out some policy implications at strategic and operational levels first there is a need to formulate a divide and contain strategy including limited transportation from country to country also between parts of a country requiring at least 14day quarantines for those transferring from region to region although many countries have been put on lockdown governments must ensure strict adherence to the orders the reported cases are much more than the ones that are visible tip of the iceberg as they continue to multiply the experts warn that even if people are encapsulated in a sterile bubble the cases shall continue to grow which is due to the delay between transmission and symptoms owing to the postponement of all prevention effects by 4 days shen  baryam 2020second this outbreak has compelled even the superpowers like the usa to reconsider the healthcarerelated and wellbeing policies forcing them to increase the investment in these areas to provide aid to the general public as well as the patients there has been a global shortage of masks ppe personal protective equipment masks and ventilators in most of the countries due to which many health professionals are experiencing high rates of infection and death ranney griffeth  jha 2020 the governments can encourage companies in the local communities to ramp up or shift to the production of masks ppe and other important devices the governments can also ask smaller regional companies to play a key role in filling the gap as the elements of ppe and masks do not require intensive capital as compared to the ventilators publicprivate partnerships will take ingenuity meaningful resources and relaxation of less essential regulatory norms apart from increasing the supply a vital role for the government is to coordinate efforts for ensuring that the hotspots or the areas hardest hit at any given time are getting the equipment when needed ranney et al 2020third the government must focus on the accommodative fiscal policy for the shortterm to help cushion against the potential economic impact of the outbreak one of the key steps is the reduction of the benchmark interest rate that has already been done by australia japan malaysia thailand and the philippines allan 2020 the monetary conditions can be set loose for an extended period and such fiscal measures can provide relief to businesses by providing cushion to the demand reduction and mitigating some downside risks the outbreak can hugely impact the real estate market that shall prevail for a longer time period rather than being immediately apparent this can be curbed by tax cuts that may assist landlords in lowering expenses or covering revenue lost via the extension of rent rebates to tenantsthrough this paper we studied the challenges and responses to the covid19 outbreak in south asia south asia is one of the most populous regions of the world which is considered highly vulnerable to any largescale outbreak of an infectious disease due to its low level of development average health infrastructure and dense population although all countries took individual actions it took the collective political leadership of saarc almost 2 months to put aside political differences and meet to discuss the dangers to the region posed by covid19 the video conference as held on march 15 2020 was then followed by the video conference of the healthcare professionals at the directorgeneral of health services dghs level on 26th march to discuss a framework for cooperation as agreed in the video conference to draw common strategy by involving all saarc nations to deal with the current outbreak of covid19 a shared electronic platform for the sharing of information knowledge and expertise was proposed community engagement and participation were identified as an important element in any anticovid19 strategy to augment the largescale emergency measures undertaken by the governments in the saarc region public health experts note concerns about a deficit of testing detection and reporting in the region where access to medical and sanitation systems is inadequate and populations are dense the doctors nurses police etc are still struggling the access to personal protective equipment there is a shortage of body coveralls and n95 masks in the country the government of each south asian nation has announced to set aside certain funds to purchase equipment necessary to fight covid19 such as ventilators personal protective equipment and masksour analysis shows that the policymakers and healthcare experts have commonly agreed that testing tracing and treating the covid19 is the need of the hour the common covid19 emergency fund as created by the saarc leaders would be used to tackle and mitigate the risks associated with the coronavirus pandemic in the south asian countries as on april 9 2020 the fund has accumulated a sum of 218 us as contributed by all the eight nationsalthough the study provides a comprehensive analysis that would help formulate policy guidelines it has several limitations that could become avenues for further research we have collected interviews that are publicly available on social media blogs and newspapers which may lead to selection bias the sample includes only south asian countries hence the conclusion could not be generalized to the entire world and the recommendations provided may be applied to a small group only however through adaptation our findings may be helpful to understand the challenges and responses elsewhere as wellthis study confers two types of contributions to the body of knowledge including theoretical and practical contributions we make a theoretical contribution to the literature of pandemics and health economics by understanding the impact of the pandemic and the measures taken to address the issues to combat the effect of covid19 on individuals and communities in various ways the practical contribution deals with the steps taken by the saarc leaders and health care professionals at a strategic and operational level respectively at the strategic level policymakers work on the captive policies to prevent the adverse impact of covid19 on peoples health hadjimanolis  boustras 2013 their lives and the economy as a whole whereas at the operational level policy implementation as well as execution is focussed upon by involving estimation of the resources required and keeping track of realtime epidemiological data by the healthcare professionalsthe authors declare no conflict of interestthe key legal issue on quarantine revolves around individual versus societal rights in the uk the legal structure of quarantine powers are covered by domestic laws and the european convention on human rights echr the 1984 public health control of disease act also gives the secretary of state powers to make regulations including the power to enforce quarantine measuresin february 2020 in reaction to the current coronavirus outbreak the secretary of state enacted the health protection coronavirus regulations 2020 which enables the authorities to quarantine individuals at risk of the transmission of covid19 who are considered to constitute a serious and imminent threat to public health the powers are effective immediately confirmed infection with the covid19 virus is not required to enact these measures lawfully and clinical suspicion or other justifiable circumstantial suspicion that individuals may have been exposed to the virus would be sufficient grounds for quarantine legal advice has confirmed that the new regulations are echr compliantstudies show that the shortterm negative psychological impact of quarantine includes frustration boredom anger and confusion2 some smaller studies also show that longterm impacts such as ptsd symptoms can be a result of quarantine  although they do not always necessarily meet criteria for ptsd diagnosis3
the key factors that influence the impact of quarantine on the individual are its duration an understanding of the risks frustration and boredom availability of supplies and activities clarity and availability of information financial loss and the inequity of financial impacts between individuals for example individuals who can work from home versus those who cannot and social stigma how people react to individuals who have completed their quarantine periodalthough quarantine may be successful from an epidemiological perspective in controlling transmission it is important to remember that authorities have previously been accused of overreacting such as with the h1n1 swine flu pandemicusually it is the role of the police to protect the public in the domestic societal sphere however this is not realistic at such a significant scale a selfpolicing public would help greatly but the military could provide logistical and infrastructure support to help enable police powers it will require broad cooperation between the public and enforcement agenciescontinued public trust in government institutions like the nhs is vital of equal importance is the role of news agencies and the impact of key opinion leaders on public opinion science journalists for example have generally been well briefed in the uk during this outbreak however experience with zika virus has shown that countries can place different political steers on interpreting and implementing the scientific evidencethe challenge is to maintain public trust while coherently communicating a dynamic situation providing clear correspondence about adapted public health guidanceequally important will be citizentocitizen trust termed social trust public willingness to engage in protective behaviours including selfisolation will depend on beliefs that others are doing so as such it is hypothesised that low social trust countries such as in southern europe will have more difficulty in containing a spread than high social trust countries such as the nordic states the uk is currently a midrank social trust country4 campaign activity that signals that members of the public are cooperating with behaviour guidance and for altruistic reasons will likely increase complianceif the nhs has to turn patients with other clinical needs away due to increased service demand in response to the covid19 outbreak then the challenge would be to communicate how the nhs is shifting priorities while managing public perception that the nhs is not copingincreased support for digital technologies could successfully enable a higher uptake in consultations progressed online and by telephone if managed appropriately these could also offer longterm benefits for the sustainability of the nhscommunication with the public needs to offer clear practical guidance that reflects uptodate information there is a need for more clarity on transmission risks so that questions can be addressed with clear advice for example should i wear gloves if so in what circumstances advice will also need to be segmented  it will be different for those in hospital than for those selfisolating and for the wider general publicwhen senior medical figures are speaking in the media or when poster campaigns are being run messages should aim to be clear one useful example is to specify the situations in which individuals should wash their hands following a journey for example with the bmj recently publishing a table to outline proper hygiene behaviours see table 11 the aim is to embed hygiene behaviours by encouraging people to build the practice into current routinescurrent data suggests that children are at low risk of serious morbidity and have low rates of mortality from covid19 however children may be a source of asymptomatic transmission of the infectionthe decision for school closure has significant ramifications for societal functioning not least with police and hospital staff needing to stay at home as carers as well as impacting the life chances of individuals taking key examinationsthere is limited evidence available to support general school closures as a public health measure there are currently a range of socialdistancing measures such as banning largescale gatherings like football matches and concerts that are being considered by decisionmakerspanic can be a societal response to trauma and crises and should be differentiated from goaldirected behaviour for example stocking up on essential supplies or a desire to leave an atrisk area is not necessarily an irrational response to a situationat present most sections of the public seem more likely to underestimate the risks and there are great efforts being implemented to encourage the public to develop improved infectioncontrol hygiene related behaviourshorizon scanning to realise the short medium and longterm opportunities that this crisis presents may be valuable this could involve identifying the benefits of embedding new systems such as effective systems for remote working for a wider range of activities including phonedigitised clinics for the nhs for some outpatient interactions and behaviours such as reducing travel while increasing the demand and supply of local resources5

behavioural medicine and behaviour change epidemiology history psychology and ethicscoronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause infection ranging from a usual cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 1 according to the world health organization the current coronavirus disease covid-19 was first reported in wuhan china on 31 december 2019 general symptoms of this infection are respiratory symptoms such as cough fever breathing problems and shortness of breath in more critical cases pneumonia kidney failure severe acute respiratory syndrome and even death have also been reported 2 given that covid-19 is an unknown disease it is understandable that its development and spread cause nervousness and fear as a result we decided to represent a more complete model than the other works used 1 and control the infection with an optimal control strategy according to 3 that presents a new seiar model for influenza in the present paper we introduce a related and also new model with a difference since the coronavirus or any similar infection does not have a vaccine yet in our new model in addition to susceptible exposed infected asymptomatic and recovered individuals seiar we added a new group of people called people in quarantine in addition to continuous-time systems system dynamics can also be described by discrete-time seir epidemic models 4 5 to furthermore study about discrete-time seir epidemic models with time delay readers are referred to 6it is obvious that transportation among regions has also a strong impact on the dynamic evolution of a disease which can spread the infection on a large scale thus 7 considers an seir epidemic model and investigated the impact of transport-related infection between two cities generally the number of the population may grow because of travel or immigration during a period therefore impulsive change of population should be considered which is generates an impulsive epidemic model the phenomena of impulsive epidemic model has important biological meaning in epidemic models impulse is included in epidemic disease models which greatly improves biological background 8 there are some studies examining this subject including 9 where a system of impulsive functional differential equations is studied by using new computational techniques for impulsive differential equations and 10 that investigated the stability of impulsive delayed nonlinear hybrid differential systems accordingly in this paper we consider a number of susceptible infected asymptomatic and exposed individuals as an impulsive additive population to the community on a daily basis which describe the fact that the coronavirus is spread by the travel of people unaware of the disease that is added to the population impulsively among these models which have used impulsive strategy impulsive control has attracted many interests which in this article can be seen as an example of this impulsive control 11 12 13 14 optimal control methods are used to control numerous kinds of models especially dynamic epidemic models 15 16 17 18 19 20 the adaptability and relative simplicity of optimal control methods can lead to the improvement of the strategies to control the different kinds of diseases 21 22 human mobility is a critical issue in epidemic models thus for studying the transmission of infectious diseases and improving epidemic control we also can use the large-scale systems we refer to 23 that deals with the application of optimal control in large-scale systems that can also be used in epidemic systems therefore in this paper the optimal control strategy is applied to the sqeiar model to decrease the number of susceptible infected exposed and asymptomatic individuals in the optimal time it has been proved that as a result of this that the number of people in quarantine and the total population is increased china where the virus first began to spread in late 2019 has seen an obvious reduction in its rate of new cases and people known to be infected have since recovered this is only for strict quarantine and treatment of infected people also spain is another country hit by covid-19 therefore in this study the accuracy of the controller designed on the estimated parameters using real data of china has also been examined and the process of controlling covid-19 in both countries will be investigated accordingly in this paper it was decided to compare the results of the study with the actual data to evaluate the performance of this controllerthis paper is divided into 7 sections in the first section we introduce and explain the seiar model in detail after that the optimal control strategy is applied to the sqeiar dynamic model in section 2 also an impulsive sqeiar epidemic model is introduced in section 3 in section 4 the proposed controller applied to impulsive sqeiar epidemic model in the following and in the fifth section the results of simulations under different cases are presented the comparison of the results of this study with other diseases and actual data is mentioned in section 6 and finally in section 7 the article ends with conclusionssince the vaccines that we have against the virus do not work and recovery depends on the strength of the immune system many of those who have died were already in poor health so at the moment the best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to quarantine susceptible people against the infection therefore in this section we want to use optimal control theory to eradicate the epidemic within the shortest pre-defined period of time for example 10 days by quarantining susceptible people and by applying antiviral therapies to infected people a number of susceptible people must become quarantined at the rate of t that means they move to a group called quarantined people described by qt after eradication of the disease the total size of people almost includes the quarantined and recovered peoplertqtntbecause a percentage of infected people will die because of infection and not all of them recover figure 2

remark 1considering that stttst then we can write sttst in which t  0 because of the positivity of parameters and states therefore st changes are subtractive since s0  0 then st converges asymptotically to zero in the finite time by zeroing st it can be concluded thatstt0 and eq2c turns into etet where   0 and e0  0 thereupon et converges exponentially to zero and so on atat   0 a0  0 then it will become zero over time according to the zeroing of at and et the eq2d rewrite as itutit in which ut0 therefore it  0 also the change of qt is also zero and remain at its maximum value as a result of zeroing st rt converges to its maximum value as well indirectly because of zeroing the infected and asymptomatic people consequently the control objective is attained

remark 2to control the pandemic diseases disease time control has more priority and we should be able to drive the disease model to the disease-free equilibrium point in the shortest possible time our purpose is to minimize the number of susceptible exposed infected and asymptomatic people in the optimal time therefore we considered the cost function with a free terminal optimal time control by minimizing the cost function the rates quarantine and treatment rates computed that give us input optimal controls that is if we quarantine the people at the rate t and treat them at the rate ut then we can eradicate the disease in the shortest possible time
in this section an impulsive seiar epidemic model is introduced due to sudden change that may occur for any reason including travel and immigration for the whole population of the study area figure 3

remark 3travel or immigration is the reason for this sudden change in population to groups s e i a that is modeled as impulsive action in the model system these individuals are added to the groups of the population once a day in the real world the people who are added include susceptible infected exposed and asymptomatic people as a result this population affects most of the groups and they add a population to each of these groups on a daily basis the controller must also be able to counteract the effects of this sudden and daily increase in this population
in this section the controller design equations for the new model are modified also figure 4

 if we can prove foralltkforallttt2t then t1t2etdt0 and et2et10 also since t

proof of
remark 5 if23ktt2tand knowing that in each part of a day not a whole day ttk then tt0 therefore eq changes to k  0 and in every day one single day t  tk then tt1 therefore eq 23 changes to k  
2tif we add up eq for all t ttk and t  tk for w days that we have w sections per day then we can write24wkwi1w2i

eq can be written as25ki1w2iww
in the worst case 2i1 for all i then i1w2iw and the eq 25 rewrite as26kwww1w
since the sqeiar dynamic is in continuous time then the number of parts of a day is a large number w   then k  0 that is always true as a result the eq 24 exist in whole period then it can be concluded that the change of et is also decreasing and converges to zero if27ktt2t
we need to examine the validity of the following equation28wkwi1w2i
if 2i0 then i1w2i0 therefore wkw  0 which is never true because of all three parameters are positiveif 2i1 then i1w2iw therefore wkw  w thereupon kw  1 and since w   and k is positive as a result kw  1 is never truefrom a and b eq is not trueso it can be concluded when eq is not true then eq is definitely and always true
remark 6as a result of this the change of et is also decreasing and converges to zero et  0 since we proved the number of susceptible and exposed coverage to zero therefore the dynamics of the asymptomatic eq20e changes as follows29attt4tat
 in similar way if tt4t or tt4t therefore wwi1w4i and the change of at is also decreasing and converges to zero at  0
remark 7since at and et converged to zero then it is possible to deduce eq 20d reformed as30ituttt3tit

if we can prove uttt3t then the change of it is decreasing and converges to zero in similar way for susceptible people
proof of
remark 7according to positivity of parameters therefore if ttk then ut0 therefore this equation is always trueif t  tk then ut3tsince ut is the control input and 0  ut  1 then umaxt1 so in the worst case maxt1 we can write 11 therefore this equation is always truewe proved the number of infected i susceptible s exposed e converged to zero then the eqs20b and 20f reformed as qt0rt0 it is noticeable that when the change of them is zero then they remain on their maximum valueafter investigating the effect of the proposed controller on sqeiar and impulsive sqeiar model we should simulate our result therefore we outlined the results of our work in the next section as simulation resultthe figures below show the difference between the number of people from all of the groups in the both cases of absence and presence of the controller over the period shown the plot of people without any control of them is illustrated in red while the plot of people with control are shown in blue
figure 5
compares the number of asymptomatic people without any control applied and the number of them with control including quarantining the susceptible people and antiviral treatment of infected people it is clear that the number of asymptomatic people decreased rapidly to zero in approximately 20 day also the peak difference between the number of people when the infection is uncontrolled by the time we applied the controller on the dynamics is almost 1400 this indicates that the controller has been able to reduce the number of asymptomatic people involved as shown in figure 6
the number of infected people increased from 500 to just over 2200 only in 10 days when there wasnt any control of them but when we applied the controller the infected people have also been going down and converge to zero in about 15 days and the process of control has not caused to exceed the number of infected over 500in figure 7
 from the first day to day five there was a big increase in the number of exposed people by contrast there was a big fall in the number of them controlled by the proposed controller in almost ten days figure 8
gives information about the number of susceptible people with and without control in 15 days it is noticeable that control the infection by quarantining susceptible people has been effective therefore the number of susceptible people fell by 8000 to zero in around five days
figure 9
compares the number of recovered individuals with and without the applied controller we can see a decrease in the number of recovered individuals with the controller over the 35-day period it is noticeable that in almost 15 days only about 2500 of them are recovered and remained at 2500 the reason for this is obvious because when people are quarantined against the infection fewer people will get infected then fewer people will recover which is discussed in greater detail in figure 13 figure 10
also shows when there was no control over the infection the number of quarantined individuals was zero and with the control of them the number gradually increases which is normallooking at figure 11
 when the controller applied to the dynamic more people survive because the total number of the population equals the number of recovered and quarantined people the reason that the total number of people is not exactly equal to 10000 people is that 35 of infected people die from their infection figure 12
shows the absolute difference between nt with and without the controller it can conclude the difference between them reaches to a constant value approximately 315 meaning the controller has managed to keep 315 more people alivein figure 13
 there are two separate cases with no control and with control in the case of people under control more than half of the recovered people went down while quarantined people are almost 7200 therefore a total of them is approximately 100009970 it is noticeable that the majority of susceptible people are quarantined and there are fewer infected people to become recovered while in the case of people without the controller the number of recovered people rose to around 9660 and there are any quarantined people therefore a total of them is about 9660 as a result the total number of alive people with control is more than the case without control approximately 200 more people have survived from infection when the infection is under control which is very significant in a community of 10000 peoplethe following figures compare the number of people from different groups introduced before with and without the controller the difference between these figures and the figures of section 5a is that in this section some people are being added at variable rates it to susceptible exposed infected and asymptomatic individuals every day this fact means the number of these people will never be zero but the controller has been able to overcome this population growth and eradicate the diseasethere is a number of asymptomatic people that is added to the asymptomatic group of travelers and migrants entering the society every day at variable rates and they do not allow declining the population of asymptomatic individuals they are also causing the epidemic to continue so with proper and optimal control we must prevent it from spreading in the community figure 14
illustrates the number of asymptomatic people decreasing daily and it eventually reaches 250 and remains stable this is because populations that come into society every day change suddenly and prevent this decline on the other hand the blue line shows that the controller has been able to overcome this population stagnation and reduce their numberssince those who are added to the society by travel or immigration also include the infected individuals which cause the outbreak daily injections of people on to the whole population under study have a profound effect on the number of infected people too the controller was also able to reduce the number of infected people because if the infected population was not controlled approximately 500 people in the community would infect and spread the disease daily but the reason for the population staying constant is that as infected people are added to the population daily some of them recover and go to the recovered group and some die from the infection then the population almost reaches stability and remains constant that is controlled by the controller and finally the number of infected people has fallen to zero shown in figure 15
in fig 16 fig 17
 it can be observed the impact of the sudden population increase on the number of exposed and susceptible individuals respectively the controller reduced the population of susceptible individuals to zero within five days and the population of exposed individuals to the lowest possible extentas previously mentioned the number of individuals in quarantine is equal to zero when there is no control over the disease but when we implement the controller the number of people in quarantine increases it is noticeable in figure 13 that the number of people in quarantine when no population enters the community is approximately 7200 but in figure 18
when people come into the community that included susceptible people too the same number must also be quarantined daily thus there was about 700 increase in numbers and the number of people in quarantine went up to approximately under 8000 the number of recovered people has also increased compared to the time when there was no sudden injection of the population because those who enter the community include infected people who go to the recovered group after the recovery and increase the number of recovered people while some people are adding to the population and there is no control over it the number of recovered people is greater than when the population is controlled because in a controlled case because the susceptible individuals are rapidly quarantined and fewer people get infected and eventually recover the total number of people in the quarantine plus the recovered ones in the controlled case is higher because in the uncontrolled case there were no quarantined people at all but in the controlled case the people in the quarantine are all healthy and have a large share in society the reason for the daily increase in the rtqt plot is that the population of the community is dynamic not closed and a number is added to the population every day nt0

figure 19
shows the number of changes in the total population size each day when there is no control over dynamic compared with the number of them under proposed optimal control as shown we were able to keep more of the population alive with the controller compared with when the infection was spreading without any control figure 20
shows the absolute difference between the whole population with and without the controller the difference between them is a constant value equal to 350 meaning the controller has managed to keep 350 more people alive per unit of timethis section is divided into four sub-section in the first and second sub-section a and b respectively the results of the controller applied to the impulsive epidemic model are compared for two different diseases ebola virus disease evd and influenza in the following sub-section c the simulation result for three types of diseases covid-19 ebola and influenza are compared together finally the comparison of simulation results with real data of china and spain is also given in the last sub-section the parameters of each disease are represented in table 3
as it can be seen in figure 21
 the number of susceptible people is reduced in only 5 days when the controller is applied to the impulsive epidemic model there is a big fall in the number of exposed people when the controller is applied to the dynamic and this reduction is acceptable for ebola disease because the rate of  is low that is the exposed people go to the infected and asymptomatic group at a lower rate also since the population is considered dynamic some people are added every day whether traveling or migrating and it prevents the population of groups from declining rapidly despite the ebola virus disease is a severe often fatal illness in humans and its case fatality rate is 90 the controller was still able to reduce the number of infected significantly when recovered people were controlled the number of them is increased by almost 550 people and reached to almost 1300 in 40 daysaccording to figure 22
and as stated in detail in the preceding sections the controller was able to properly control the susceptible individuals and move them to the quarantined people group also the number of infected and exposed people converged to zero in only 10 days with the controller the number of asymptomatic people with the controller has also reached its lowest level and the reason it takes longer to reach zero is that there is no direct controller on it and zeroing of this is as a result of zeroing of the other groups which are discussed in detail in remark 6 recovered people in the presence of controller are reduced compared to when there was no control over them because when there is no control over the disease the number of infected people is higher so the number of recovered will be more also the death rate in influenza is less than ebola in the end the number of people in quarantine with controllers has reached its peakas it can be seen in figure 23
a the controller was able to control the dynamic and the susceptible individuals are quarantined in all three disease groups in figure 23b the number of exposed people in both influenza and corona groups are converged to zero by the controller in ten days but the number of exposed people in the ebola disease group is reached to zero later because the rate of  in this disease is lower than the other group and prevents exposed individuals from joining groups a and i rapidly in remark 5 it is proved that e eventually reaches zero figure 23c shows the number of infected people went down by controller and according to figure 23d in every three groups the number of asymptomatic people converged to zero later because there was no direct controller on them but in the end according to the evidence in remark 6 they eventually got to zero since exposed people have a higher rate of infection  in coronavirus according to table 3 so more of them get infected and eventually more of them will be recovered which is quite evident in figure 23e the number of recovered people in ebola is lower than the other two groups this reduction is acceptable for ebola disease because the mortality rate f is very high therefore there are fewer infected people as a result fewer recovered people finally in figure 23f the susceptible individuals are well quarantined and the number of people in the quarantine group is increasedin this sub-section divided into two prats 1 and 2 the accuracy of the designed controller is examined by the actual data of china then the controller whose parameters were estimated using actual data of china is applied to the actual data of spain to show the applicability of quarantine and treatment policies in both countriesin this part similar to part 1 process the results obtained from applying the desired controller to the disease and the actual data are compared in part 1 unknown parameters are estimated using real data from china in figure 26
 2 diagrams are compared the diagram in blue shows the number of confirmed cases in spain which is based on actual data extracted from the health alert and emergency coordination centre from 24 feb to 29 may 2020 32 the red graph shows the number of declining trends in the number of infected people when the controller is applied the controller parameters are estimated by the actual data from china as it is known if spain had taken the process of controlling the covid-19 it could have controlled the disease well and within about 20 days in the case that the desired controller applied to the model the number of infected people has finally reached approximately 62500 but in the case without the controller the number of infected people has reached 100000 and has an upward trend after 85 days which has reached zero in the shortest time in the controlled case it is essential to note that the evidence in this paper given from modeling studies proves how quarantine affects the covid-19 outbreak putting quarantine in place early and combining it with medical treatment is critical if it is to be effective to control the spread of covid-19 also the quarantining of travelers from a country involved with covid-19 reduces disease transmission and deaths and also makes greater cost-savings however if the government enact strict laws to ban rallies and quarantine and other different ways to getting people away from rallies like isolation social distancing community containment driving ban and etc in the shortest possible time it can be expected that the covid-19 prevalence will decline in the next few monthsin this paper the seiar dynamic epidemic model was improved with a new group of people called quarantined people sqeiar the goal of this article was to eradicate the infection by decreasing the number of infected exposed and asymptomatic and quarantining the susceptible people with optimal control that applied to the sqeiar model two control actions are employed to achieve this objective quarantine and treatment of infected individuals the pontryagins maximum principle was used to describe the optimal controls and the optimal final time also an impulsive epidemic model was considered to indicate the sudden growth in population and that model was controlled by optimal control strategy the presented approach is suitable to describe models for infectious diseases caused by a group of viruses called coronavirus for which there is no vaccine yet thus the theoretical results were illustrated for the case of covid-19 our simulation results of the covid-19 were compared with ebola and influenza also numerical simulation corroborated our theoretical results then the system parameters were identified using actual data of china eventually the process of quarantine and treatment of china and spain was compared by applying the controller with the estimated parameters using actual data of chinafirst confirmed on 20 may 2015 the latest outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infections in korea accounted for 186 laboratory-confirmed cases including 36 deaths 138 recovered individuals discharged from hospitals and 12 remaining in hospitals up to 28 july 2015 a de facto end date of the outbreak ministry of health and welfare  moh it spread remarkably fast in hospitals which has caused the largest mers outbreak outside the middle east the case fatality rate of 194 is however much lower than the reported rate of 377 prior to the outbreak in korea according to the world health organization who the mers-cov is a novel betacoronavirus which was first identified from the sputum of a 60-year-old man in fall 2012 zaki et al 2012 clinical features of mers range from mild illness to fatal conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure resulting in death especially in patients with underlying comorbidities zumla et al 2015 although it is initially known as a zoonotic disease human-to-human transmission occurs in health care settings and now is linked with significant morbidity oboho et al 2015 this outbreak of the mers-cov infection including the index cases roommates their caregiver and even the healthcare workers in what is called as a super-spreading event kupferschmidt 2015 raised several important issues for global public health surveillance and raised several issues regarding infection control policies including the control of nosocomial transmission to avoid a repeated outbreak keeling and rohani 2008in this study we carry out an epidemiological assessment of the mers-cov outbreak in korea in order to provide a mathematical framework for understanding the complex dynamics of the pathogen spread and establishing efficient guidelines for implementing quarantine and isolation strategies more specifically we propose a class of nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined siq models for analyzing and controlling the mers outbreak in korea the proposed siq model is innovative in that the mers transmission probability is time-dependent monotone decreasing and squashing-type more specifically it is initially almost flat then decreasing rapidly and finally gradually reaching a saturation point which is reasonable because this can reflect the change in individuals hygienic behaviour with time recently there has been much interest in investigating some aspects of the time-dependent nature of the disease transmission probability in particular several methods have been considered to model the time-dependence due to the impact of media coverage cui sun zhu 2008 liu wu zhu 2007 sun yang arino khan 2011 xiao tang wu 2015 however these studies have mostly focused on only a single factor under consideration in this paper we consider all relevant factors that can affect the mers transmission probability eg media coverage increased awareness etc collectively and try to model the resultant time-dependent transmission probability using a sigmoidal function note that the sigmoidal functions are quite popular in the field of machine learning when one needs to address monotone and squashing-type phenomena for the proposed siq model we perform the task of parameter estimation and apply optimal control theory to the controlled siq model with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies simulation results show that the proposed siq model can explain the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the mers outbreak very well and the number of the mers cases can be controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach finally in the last two sections of this paper discussion and concluding remarks are given along with brief descriptions of data treatmentin this section we will propose a nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined siq model for analyzing the mers outbreak in korea the siq model is a generalization of an epidemiological population model involving susceptible infectious and quarantined compartments hethcote zhien shengbing 2002 keeling rohani 2008 lenhart workman 2007 xiao tang wu 2015 in the siq model the four compartment populations are used as the models state variables st the number of individuals that are susceptible to the mers disease at time t it the number of individuals that are actively infectious at time t sqt the number of quarantined susceptible individuals at time t and cqt the number of confirmed cases at time t note that in the siq model

 also note that cqt is a collective sink-type compartment which includes the number of the mers patients under treatment the recovered cases and the dead cases altogether at time t as shown in fig 1 the siq model considers two kinds of non-pharmaceutical interventions quarantine of the susceptible and infected individuals and isolation of the infectious individuals following contact tracing as a result of a contact tracing a proportion q of individuals who are contacted in connection with a mers patient is quarantined the quarantined individuals can move to compartments cq or sq depending on whether they are exposed to the mers coronavirus or not hence the quarantined individuals if uninfected move to the compartment sq at a rate of c1tq where c is the contact rate ie the average number of contacts of the whole population per unit time and t is the probability of the mers transmission per contact at time t note that in the siq model the mers transmission probability t is time-dependent monotone decreasing and squashing-type obviously using time-dependent transmission probability is more reasonable than using the constant one because it can reflect the change of individuals hygienic behavior with time as shown in fig 1 if infected the quarantined individuals move to the compartment cq at a rate of ctq also the remaining proportion ie the proportion missed from the contact tracing 1q can move to compartment i or stay in compartment s depending on whether they are exposed to the mers coronavirus or not the transmission dynamics of the siq model is illustrated in fig 1 and its state equations are as follows
1stc1tqstitctqstitct1qstitsqtitct1qstititsqtc1tqstitsqtiqtctqstititthe first equation of 1 describes the rate of change of the susceptible compartment population with four terms on its right-hand side its first term concerns the transition from s to sq due to quarantine of susceptible individuals this term can be explained in terms of a bilinear incidence law having a contact rate c together with t the probability of the mers transmission per contact at time t and q the probability of quarantine per contact the second and third terms model the transition from s to cq and the transition from s to i respectively the fourth term represents the transition from sq to s and this transition means the release from quarantine into the wider community in the second equation of 1 the rate of change of the infectious compartment population is described by two terms the first represents the transition from the susceptible state to the infectious state and the second term denotes the transition from i to cq due to detection and isolation of the infectious patients the remaining equations of 1 describe the rates of change of sq and cq in the super-compartment q respectively and the exact meaning of their terms can be explained similarly the natural birth and death rates are not considered in the siq model and this omission allows us to focus on the core theme of the paper note that consideration of these additional aspects is relatively straightforward and would lead us to some further related observations for example if the natural birth rate of a susceptible population  and the natural death rate d are considered the resultant reduced siq system1
with a constant transmission probability 
0 would have the disease-free equilibrium point e0d00 which is locally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number r
0  1 where r0c01qddas previously mentioned the mers transmission probability t of our siq model is time-dependent monotone decreasing and squashing-type since many factors eg media coverage increased awareness etc can alter individuals hygienic behavior we employ the squashing-type function of fig 2
for t2
more specifically we utilize
2t0sttwhere  is the logistic sigmoidal function bishop 2006 defined as x11expx t is the inflection point of t s is the parameter determining the slope of t at its inflection point note that the use of logistic sigmoidal functions is quite popular in the field of machine learningbishop 2006 when one needs to represent monotone and squashing-type phenomena also note that using the logistic sigmoidal function of 2 lead to the following simplification when we compute its derivative
3tsstt1sttthis property can be utilized effectively in further studies on the qualitative properties of the siq model eg study of the global stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the siq model an explanation of the siq parameters is given in table 1
by fitting the siq model to the reported data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases we obtain the following parameters3
4s0161004c7210030651003331003s078t2181001q2310015461002381001we performed simulations based on the estimated parameters simulation results fig 4 show that the proposed siq model can explain the observed data fig 3
 for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the mers outbreak very well our parameter estimation results show that the mers transmission probability t is initially almost flat then decreasing rapidly and finally gradually reaching a saturation point see the solid line of fig 5
 this has a natural interpretation in that as information on the mers outbreak becomes more widely known with the passage of time health authorities and individuals efforts against the epidemic intensify accordingly which results in the mers transmission probability decreasing in the squashing-type fashion as in fig 5 in retrospect if the initial effort to reduce the mers transmission probability were more effective the magnitude of 
0 could be decreased further in order to investigate this aspect we additionally performed simulations for a scenario with 
0 reduced to 90 of its estimated value see the dashed line of fig 5 fig 6
shows that the infectious population could be reduced significantly if the aforementioned effort were successful in order to clarify why it is important to consider the incidence rate of the type shown in 2 we also considered the constant beta case and provided the corresponding simulation results fig 7
 comparing figs 4 and 7 shows the superiority of using the time-dependent since quarantine and isolation strategies are the most important and effective measures against the outbreaks of disease when one does not have valid medicines and vaccine see eg castillo-chavez castillo-garsow yakubu 2003 day park madras gumel wu 2006 yan zou 2009 yan zou li 2007 one can view the efforts of implementing quarantine and isolation strategies as the actions that control the entire model in this paper we utilize optimal control theory lenhart workman 2007 lewis syrmos 1995 for the possibility of improving our control efforts note that recent applications of optimal control theory are increasingly used in communities of biological systems eg buonomo messina 2012 joshi lenhart li wang 2006 jung lenhart feng 2002 kirschner lenhart serbin 1997 de pillis gu fister head maples murugan neal yoshida 2007 and in particular they have been widely used and discussed in the control of epidemics eg
caetano yoneyama 2001 feng yang xu zhang mccauley glasser 2009 gupta rink 1973 joshi lenhart li wang 2006 lenhart workman 2007 by incorporating the control inputs qt and t into our siq model 1 one can obtain the following state equations for the controlled model
5stc1tqttstitsqtitct1qtstittitsqtc1tqtstitsqtiqtctqtstittitnote that for the optimal control of 5 it is enough to consider the first three variables only hence we consider the following controlled siq c-siq model
6stc1tqttstitsqtitct1qtstittitsqtc1tqtstitsqtfrom the data fitting based on the siq model we have already obtained the estimation results for the quarantine probability q and the isolation rate  in retrospect however control-theoretic investigation is desirable for the purpose of improving our response to the outbreak in the following we consider the problem of improving the quarantine probability and isolation rate further with additional efforts qt and t by minimizing an objective function in the form of j0tfgitqttdt note that in this problem the quarantine probability and isolation rate at time t are represented by
7qtqqtttand the control inputs to be determined via optimal control theory are the additional efforts described by qt and t here g   should be reasonably chosen to reflect the relative importance of the quarantine and isolation efforts over the infection more precisely in order to minimize an objective function comprising the infection cost ie the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing quarantine and isolation strategies we consider the following optimal control problem
8minu0tfitcqqt2ct2dtsubject to the c-siq state equations 6in the cost rate of this problem cq and c are the trade-off constants defining the relative importance of the implementation costs over the infection cost note that the cost rate considers quadratic cost terms for the control inputs which is a commonly used strategy in related control problems dealing with epidemic-model-based systems eg lenhart and workman 2007 also note that the existence of an optimal control and corresponding optimal state trajectory comes from the convexity of the integrand of the objective function with respect to the control and the lipschitz property of the state system with respect to the state variables see eg fleming and rishel 1975 and based on the existence we can now rely on the pontryagin maximum principle pmp pontryagin et al 1987 for an optimal solution as is well known the necessary conditions for an optimal solution of 8 can be obtained via the pontryagin maximum principle for this the hamiltonian h of the optimal control problem 8 is defined as

cq1 the initial conditions for the simulations were also taken from the estimation results ie s016000
i01 and sq00 the simulations considered two scenarios the first scenario does not have bounds on the control inputs while the second scenario has the bounds of qmax0007 and max005 with the goal of keeping the infection level low with reasonable control efforts we solved the boundary value ode problem 13 using bvp4c the matlab function to solve boundary value problems for ordinary differential equations
fig 8 fig 9 fig 10
show the simulation results for the first scenario
figs 8 and 9 show that under the optimal control of the first scenario the best method of fighting the infection is to initially enter large amounts of qt and t and later after 30 days to slowly reduce them to zero the resultant state trajectory of it the dashed line of fig 10 shows that with the optimal control strategy the infectious compartment population can be reduced significantly compared to the original case the solid line of fig 10 to consider the robustness of the quarantine and isolation control we also conducted sensitivity analysis for the following cases 1 when c is 10 lower and 10 higher 2 when  is 50 lower and 50 higher for each case we simulated the resultant controlled system and the results on the number of infectious individuals are shown in figs 11
and 12
 respectively for cases 1 and 2 comparing figs 11 and 12 shows that c is more important for the quarantine and isolation controlsimulation results for the second scenario which deals with the bounded input case are shown in
fig 13 fig 14 fig 15
 figs 13 and 14 show that under the optimal control of the second scenario the best method of fighting the infection is to apply the maximum amounts of the control inputs from the start and then to slowly reduce them after 30 days to zero the state trajectory of it resulting from the optimal control is shown in fig 15 note that the infectious compartment population can be reduced significantly even with the bounds on control inputs from the simulation results fig 8 fig 9 fig 10 fig 11 fig 12 fig 13 fig 14 fig 15 we can conclude that the mers disease spread can be properly handled by the optimal control approach and we can obtain a practical guideline whereby quarantine and isolation efforts in the early stage are critically important in effectively controlling the mers outbreakin recent years global pandemic viral infections including the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome the 2009 h1n1 influenza and the 2014 ebola outbreak have been devastating but provided valuable experience in outbreak responses for public health control increased vigilance by health professionals and voluntary compliance by the public are essential in implementing rapid effective response interventions in this study we carried out an epidemiological assessment of the mers-cov outbreak in korea in order to provide a mathematical framework for understanding the complex dynamics of the pathogen spread and establishing efficient guidelines for implementing quarantine and isolation strategies the following have been observed by the assessment
by fitting the siq model which employs a squashing-type function of fig 2 for t to the real data on the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases we obtained reasonable performance as shown in fig 4 also it turned out that the resultant estimated parameters belonged to plausible ranges by comparison the conventional siq model utilizing a constant transmission probability could not explain the observed data wellour nonlinear epidemiological models showed that the mers transmission probability decreased in the squashing-type fashion and then approached a saturation point in a time-dependent manner as information on the mers outbreak became widely known in the nation efforts against this epidemic including individuals hygienic behavior and interventions by health care facilities and by authorities were accordingly strengthened in our siq-based analysis the inflection point for transmission probability was found to be t218 corresponding to a couple of days after 7 june 2015 interestingly 7 june 2015 was the day when the korean government revealed the names of 24 mers-affected hospitals to the public after releasing the names of affected medical facilities the rate of increase in new confirmed cases abated as a practical guideline to avoid another similar unexpected outbreak we draw the conclusion that combined efforts in the early stage are critically important and sharing information including the names of affected hospitals or countries clinical situations and prevention methods might be important for global public health controlwe applied optimal control theory to the controlled siq model with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies simulation results show that the number of the mers cases can be controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach
in conclusion this paper proposes a nonlinear epidemiological ode for the mers outbreak in korea the siq model in which the state variables are defined as the populations of four compartments st it sqt and cqt and the mers transmission probability t is modelled by the time-dependent sigmoidal function we performed the task of parameter estimation for the siq model and the data fitting results explained the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the mers outbreak very well we also applied optimal control theory to the controlled siq model with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies our simulation results show that mers propagation was controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach in future work we will conduct further simulation studies with the aim of revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method and investigate stability and control issues for its various extensions including a stochastic differential equation sde approachwe retrieved publicly available data ministry of health and welfare  moh from the centers for disease control and prevention and the ministry of health and welfare in the republic of korea the data included information on the cumulative number of reported cases the first mers case in korea was confirmed on 20 may 2015 and the numbers of newly confirmed cases and suspected patients who had been quarantined to prevent possible spread of the mers have reached 186 cases and 16693 cases respectively as of 28 july 2015 the data also included a brief description of each confirmed case with exposure date and onset of symptoms and they were sufficient to estimate our siq model for the mers outbreak epidemiology in this model we assumed mers is unlikely to spread to another regionwe implemented the parameter estimation procedure as a matlab programwe used fminsearch a matlab function for unconstrained nonlinear optimization along with some changes of variables in order to carry out the data fitting procedure for the siq model 5 with the time-dependent variable t specified in 2 the performance index pi used in the optimization for parameter estimation was defined as follows
14piw1squarederrorofcqw2squarederrorofsqthe objective function of 14 pi was based on the numbers of the confirmed mers cases and the quarantined cases between 20 may and 07 july the weight values w1104 and w21 were obtained empirically via a tuning process based on the training data simulation results show that the above set of weight values yielded reasonably good fitting results finally note that a more sophisticated markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm eg rasmussen et al 2011 could be used for parameter estimation of the siq model however the use of fminsearch which was simpler and more transparent was sufficient for the purposes of this paperpublic health circles are now debating the impact of pets in human quarantines a state of enforced isolation particularly as it applies to zoonoses1 currently there are over 400 viral zoonoses in the world in addition there are numerous bacterial zoonoses fungal zoonoses and the emergence of variant creutzfeldtjakob disease avian influenza h5n1 was detected in a domestic cat eating a bird carcass the authors expressed concern regarding disease transmission to people from household cats2in the united states pets are present in 58 of the households which includes about 69 million cats and 62 million dogs3 owners of cats and dogs are likely to have as much contact with their pets as with people of the emerging diseases 75 are zoonoses when the disease is known to be a zoonosis and the species of origin understood the role of animals is fairly straightforwardunfortunately when an emerging disease first appears the origin is uncertain the potential for household transmission through pets is now being considered in any new disease when information is incomplete regarding potential hosts and the risk for interspecies transmission is unknownseveral reports exist regarding bilateral transmission of viral and bacterial pathogens between humans and pets47 typically transmission of pathogens from domestic pets focuses on the household members however many other persons also have regular or sporadic contact with household pets owned by friends or family or through animal visitation programsthe potential role of household pets in disease transmission in community-based quarantines has previously been overlooked for example the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was first detected in china in 2002 sars spread to numerous countries mainly in southeast asia but also to canada and the united states the outbreak is a recent example of an emerging disease for which a human quarantine was implementedthe cause was determined to be a previously undiscovered coronavirus it appears to have been transmitted to humans through contact with wild masked palm civets that are eaten in china subsequent cases were spread person-to-person mainly through infected respiratory secretions8 the ease of travel between continents contributed to the pandemicoutside of asia the country most affected by sars was canada most cases and all the deaths were in the greater toronto area in the 2003 sars outbreak in toronto canada at least 23 000 persons participated in voluntary quarantine in their homes because of possible exposure to control the spread of sars public health officials held large numbers of their residents in quarantine for an average of 10 days the incubation period of sars9 quarantined persons were told to remain at home not allow anyone to visit wear a mask when in the same room as other members of the household and sleep in a separate roomtoday we know that domestic cats and ferrets are susceptible to experimental infection by the sars coronavirus and that they can transmit this virus to other cats and ferrets10at times imposition of a quarantine seems like a logical response but there may not be enough facts to make an evidence-based decision the united kingdom has been rabies-free since 1922 which was thought to be in part due to the strict laws requiring that imported cats and dogs be vaccinated and quarantined for 6 months immediately on entry into the country however at the end of 2002 dogs and cats from mainland america and canada meeting the travel scheme requirements were able to forgo the 6-month quarantine the pet travel scheme pets also has requirements for bringing other types of pet animals into the united kingdom for additional information about requirements for traveling with pets to the uk visit wwwdefragovukanimalhquarantineindexhtma quantitative risk assessment of the uks pets that assumed 100 compliance determined the probability of importing rabies was lower than what would be obtained with the quarantine11one statistical study found that for a quarantine to be effective a large proportion of infections generated by an individual must be prevented through quarantine according to researchers the use of quarantine will be most beneficial only when there is significant asymptomatic transmission and if the asymptomatic period is neither very long nor very short12in planning community-based human quarantine protocols more emphasis will be placed on companion animals clinical and epidemiological studies concerning the potential role companion animals play in disease transmission will hopefully be undertaken human medicine may also become more aware of the role pets play as sentinel species this will require a coordinated effort between human and veterinary medicinefractional calculus can provide a promising tool in modeling biological phenomena as reviewed recently by lonescu et al 1 for example fractional-derivative equation fde models have been applied to capture complex dynamics in biological tissues 2 tumor growth 3 dna sequencing 4 drug uptake 5 and salmonella bacterial infection in animal herds 6 most recently the fde models have been applied to model the pine wilt disease 7 the human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv disease 8 the harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass 9 human liver using caputo-fabrizio fractional derivative 10 11 and tumor-immune surveillance 12 motivated by these successful applications this study tests whether the fdes can be applied to model the dynamics and mitigation scenarios of coronavirus an emerging and critical research area that has not been focused by the fractional calculus community beforethe novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak a respiratory illness that started first detected in late december 2019 is a pandemic infecting 336000 people in more than 140 countries with the average fatality rate of 44 globally data up to 3222020 13 the covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating almost every aspect of life damaging global economy and altering both man-made and natural environments urgent actions have been taken but further effective and efficient strategies are promptly needed to confront this global challenge to address this challenge and promptly guide the next efforts it is critical to model the covid-19 outbreak mathematical models are among the necessary tools to quantify the covid-19 and therefore testing the applicability of such fde models under this new global pandemic is the primary objective motivating this studythis study aims to model the covid-19 evolution dynamics ie transmission infection recovery and death evolution for representative countries with apparent coronavirus cases including china the united states us italy japan and south korea using mathematical models most specifically the fde models described previously it should be noted that the covid-19 spread in these countries experienced different starting initiation and detection times an important fact to consider when applying these models for example china had passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak finally reaching a milestone with no new local infections on 3192020 79 days from the onset 12312019 in wuhan china while the us coronavirus cases soared past 10000 on the same day this study will apply the core characteristics of the covid-19 outbreak obtained in china to estimate the covd-19 spread in the us as well as other countries where the number of affected people has not yet reached its number of peak casesin addition this new pandemic may last for a relatively longer time than expected 14 no vaccine against sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is currently available 15 indeed a vaccine for prevention and infection control may not be ready before march 2021 for the covid-19 considering a minimum of 45 weeks for trials and at least 1 year for safety evaluation and final deployment efficient strategies are therefore needed to mitigate the covid-19 outbreak possible non-pharmaceutical scenarios such as isolation of cases and contact tracing can be evaluated using mathematical models 16 in order to identify the most efficient mitigation strategies going forward this is another major motivation and the secondary task of this study using the fde modelsto address the questions mentioned above this study is organized as follows section 2 proposes an updated seir model with an fde-based component for covid-19 where s e i and r stand for susceptible exposed infectious and recovered people respectively 17 this model is then applied to fit and predict the covid-19 spread in various provinces and major cities in china resulting in abundant datasets to derive the core characteristics of the covid-19 dynamics in evolution section 3 predicts the spread of covid-19 in the other countries using the knowledge that is gained from the china case study section 4 proposes a fully lagrangian approach with the time fde to model the spatiotemporal evolution of covid-19 and then applies it to evaluate non-pharmaceutical scenarios to mitigate the virus spread section 5 reports the main conclusions specifically the feasibility of fdes for capturing covid-19 evolution in the appendix the impacts of the non-singular kernel and fractional derivative type on model results are further discussed for readers particularly interested in these fractional calculus techniques the main contributions of this work therefore include 1 the first application of fdes in modeling the evolution of the covid-19 death toll 2 an updated seir model with a transient recovery rate to better capture the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic within china and for other countries and 3 a particle-tracking approach based on stochastic bimolecular reaction theory to evaluate the mitigation of the spread of the covid-19 outbreakthe classical seir model containing four populations s e i and r takes the form 291adsdtrpisn

2 is the rate for the healthy susceptible person to be transferred to an infected one from exposed persons note that covid-19 patients in the incubation period might be contagious too and r
2 is the number of healthy susceptible people that are contacted by exposed people daily now the infection rates can change with time and the infected persons are removed from the risk of infection via a time-dependent rate term of t if the recovered individuals can return to a susceptible status due to for example a loss of immunity then the partial differential equation pde 2d for the time rate of change of r requires one more sink term r where  is the rate of the recovered individuals returning to a susceptible statuswe replace the integer-order derivatives in the classical seir 1 by the fractional-order derivatives in 2 to capture the possible nonlocal impact such as the memory impact or any apparent delay in the covid-19 outbreak herein we use the death evolution 2e as an example hence the fde 2e containing the death probability of  while the other patients are cured is modified asdddt110tdtd which is the caputo fractional derivative 30 31 with order  0     1 note that all the other indexes

3 and 
4 in model 2 are in the same range of 0 1 the caputo fractional derivate was selected here because the initial condition for caputo derivative takes the same form as that for the integer-order pde particularly the caputo derivative allows the utilization of initial values of the integer order with known physical interpretations when the order 1 model 2e reduces to the classical integer-order pde for the death evolution the fractional pde 2e is used here for two reasons first the evolution of deaths and cures may be characterized by a random process due to the fact that the exact time for the recovered person to be initially infected is unknown ie the patient that died or was cured today may have been diagnosed yesterday or last week second some patients may not be treated in time after being infected making the death toll evolve with a time memory therefore we extend the classical mass-balance equation of death cases using the fde to characterize the random property and memory impact embedded in the temporal evolution of mortality the fractional pde 2e and its classical version will be compared below using real observed dataother complex seir models were also applied to model covid-19 spread such as the one proposed by tang et al 32 which has 12 ratesprobabilities and 8 groups of people in seir numerical results show that compared with the seir model 2 the complex model proposed by tang et al 32 with solutions shown by the dotted lines in fig 1
a accurately fits the observed data at the early stage but then overpredicts the spread of covid-19 observed after 2122020 the dynamics of transmission for covid-19 especially the recovery rate therefore changed over time in china likely due to the time-dependent conditions ie improvementsadjustments in medical care as mentioned above a dynamic time-local seir model therefore may be preferred for modeling covid-19 spread in chinain addition compared to the fde 2e the best-fit solution using the classical pde dddti for death evolution see the black dotted line in fig 1
a slightly overestimates the late-time growth of mortality the actual death toll in hubei province grew slower than that estimated by a constant rate model indicating that the memory impact may affect the late-time dynamics of death and can be better captured by the fde 2ethe best-fit solutions using model 2 fit the evolution of the infected and recovered populations well for the data recorded from hubei province and three large cities closely related such as in transportation or economic cooperation to wuhan china fig 1 the model was also shown to predict well the observed time series of covid-19 spread from 382020 to 3222020 for most places except for shanghai city fig 1
d this is likely due to the number of overseas covid-19 cases imported into shanghai whereby the number of cases were observed to increase rapidly after 332020 causing inconsistency in the affected population and failure of the model shanghai pudong international airport one of the two airports located in shanghai city is the eighth-busiest airport in the world and the busiest international gateway of mainland china when excluding the coronavirus cases imported from overseas model 2 predicts the covid-19 spread evolution data in shanghai fig 2
 therefore model 2 works well for various places in china that may not be experience a significant influx of imported cases as external sources can easily break the internal evolution especially the asymptotic status of covid-19 in chinathe resultant time-dependent recovery rate t is depicted in fig 3
 where the rate fitted by the latest observation data point within the fitting period ie 372020 remains stable in the following prediction period the best-fit recovery rate is the highest for shanghai except for the impulse of t for wenzhou as discussed below which is expected since shanghai has the best public health system of all of these cities contrarily hubei shows the lowest recovery rate likely due to its delayed response and the relatively limited public health capability at the beginning of the outbreak compared with shanghaiwenzhou exhibits an impulse in the infection and recovery dynamics of coronavirus fig 1
b different from that observed for the other places studied herein on february 27 2020 the number of wenzhous infected people suddenly declined combined with the sudden increase of the number of people cured this abrupt change can be effectively captured by the seir model 2 with an impulse in the recovery rate t this recovery impulse is most likely due to a new hospital the no 2 affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university recently built in this city in early february which significantly improved the public health system the first discharged cases of coronavirus from this hospital appeared in late february 2020 resulting in the sudden increase in the total recovery rate in addition a relatively large number of people working in wuhan returned to wenzhou in late january and it appears that the improved efficient screening process successfully identified the number of infected cases the new cases were 29000 from 1242020 to 1312020 in wenzhou with an average of 3600 new patients per day who were then immediately centralized for treatment it appears that this fast response helped to alleviate the spread of coronavirus in wenzhouthe best-fit parameters of model 2 are listed in table 1
 and the initial values for each group of people are listed in table 2
 we reveal three behaviors in model parameters first the best-fit s-shaped recovery rate t fig 3 can be described by the sigmoid function ta1ebtc where a b and c are factors showing that the recovery rate increases exponentially before reaching a stable condition this increase is likely due to the fact that healthcare facility capabilities improved with time with an accelerating rate before reaching their asymptote or maximum capacitysecond the rates and probabilities r r
2 p and p
2 affecting the covid-19 transmissioninfection evolution slightly change in space and remain stable for a given site table 1 the small spatial fluctuation of these rates may be due to the similar strategies implemented by local governments for intervening and mitigating covid-19 spread ie full lockdowns across the country the time-invariant transmissioninfection rates for a given site indicate that the spreading rate of covid-19 may not significantly change over a short period of time for a given area with consistent intervening policies enactedthird the model predictions show that it may take 47 14 25 and 11 days from 3142020 for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population for hubei province and the cities of wenzhou shenzhen and shanghai respectively notably since the best-fit t increases in time the prediction using a constant  may overestimate the long-term future infection cases and underestimate the future recovery trend for covid-19we also introduce an index c to quantify the infection severity of covid-19 at different places3cnimax where imax is the maximum number of cumulative infected people at the given site a smaller c represents a greater infection severity of coronavirus there is a power-law relationship between the regional population n and the maximum cumulated number of infected people imax fig 4
 this empirical formula may be used to approximate the largest cumulative number of infections which will be applied in the subsequent section for predicting the covid-19 evolution outside of china where the coronavirus infection has not yet reached its peak number of casesto decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread the uss main propagated mode up to 3222020 has been the use of social distancing actions the predicted covid-19 spread in the us is plotted in fig 5
 there is a high uncertainty in the prediction of covid-19 evolution within the us considering the recent dramatic fluctuations in the number of infected people and the delayed screening during the beginning stages of the outbreak thus we must make assumptions and can only estimate the future coronavirus evolution in the us under specific scenarios based on the index of infection severity c in the representative areas of china we predict the us covid-19 evolution dynamics under two scenarios as shown in fig 5
fig 5
a shows the possible spread of covid-19 in california us assuming that the coronavirus dynamics including the infectionrecovery rates and the infection severity are similar to those observed in hubei china the solid lines representing an optimistic scenario or can change quite differently the dashed lines representing a longer-term severe scenario the estimated total population of infection in california varies from 50000 to 200000 with the peak number of cases occurring around 20 to 50 days from 3222020
fig 5
b shows the possible spread of covid-19 in the us solid lines represent model solutions assuming that covid-19 spreads similarly to that as observed in hubei china while the dashed lines are model solutions that assume covid-19 spreads differently the results show that the estimated total infected population varies from 700000 to 3000000 with the peak number of cases occurring 2050 days and the covid-19 outbreak lasting for 50 days from 3222020 respectivelyto decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread italys mode is now similar to china lockdown of the full population the predicted covid-19 spread in italy is plotted in fig 6
a although italy has followed chinas mode of national isolation the number of infected people increased rapidly from 3142020 to 3192020 495 new cases per day to account for the delayed national quarantine compared with china we decrease the c index while also increasing the upper limit of the cumulative infection the covid-19 evolution prediction results show that there may be a turning point in the next two weeks when the current infected cases begin to decline we also separate the death toll from the number of recovered casessouth koreas mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is through fast detection and tracking of the disease south korea is using efficient mobile diagnoses tests and accurate tracing of infected cases to maintain a low death rate even with a large infected population the mobile method can test 20000 people per day the maximum capability on 3122020 and apps for cell phones andor credit cards can accurately track the routes of infected people with the help of local government without an invasion of privacy so that warnings can be immediately delivered to the general population to obviate the places with high risk the current infected population may have passed its peak number of cases around 3202020 and the prediction shows that the covid-19 outbreak may be well controlled in 35 days from 3222020 fig 6
bjapans mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is compatible with that of the us in addition to other changes such as enhanced educationoutreach and rapid treatment of the infected cases specific policies include social distancing which might be a key barrier to the spread of the novel coronavirus personal hygiene and quarantine of the infected cases the current data and modeling results fig 6
c show that japan has an efficient way so far to limit the maximum population infected and slow the spread of covid-19 while this outbreak may last for a whilethe random walk based stochastic model for covid-19 spread is analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction-based mechanismcondition 35 when a reactant a particle representing a susceptible individual a meets a reactant b particle representing an infectious person b a chemical reaction may occur if the collision energy is large enough to break the chemical bond meaning that the susceptible person a may be infected if satisfying additional criteria such as a and b are close enough and b touches hisher face after receiving coronavirus from a therefore the condition of a being infected is not deterministic but rather a random probability-controlled process this probability is related to various factors such as the duration that a and b are in contact the infectivity rate and the distance between the two people which may be characterized parsimoniously by the interaction radius r that controls the number of reactant pairs susceptible  infectious in a potential reaction infection 35 hence the core of the random walk stochastic model to simulate covid-19 spread is to define the interaction radius rthe analogous development and similarities between bimolecular reactions and the sir model can also be seen from their governing equations the time-dependent sir model takes the form 364adstdttstitn

scenario 1 no special constraints assuming a city with 10000 people and 4 initial coronavirus cases this scenario does not put any constraints for any population we assume that the population distributes in the city randomly at the beginning and then moves randomly the spread of covid-19 is then simulated using the stochastic model proposed in section 41
scenario 2 social distancing this scenario assumes that all people in the city maintain a social distance significantly decreasing the probability of infection
scenario 3 attempted quarantine this scenario creates a forced quarantine for infected individuals before the outbreak which is expected to be the most efficient way of quarantinein the stochastic model we assume that 10 days after being infected the person will be removed because of being cured or expired dead this is because the median disease incubation period has been estimated to be 51 days 39 for simplicity purposes the interaction radius r 6 remains constant since the constant interaction radius was found to be able to efficiently capture the temporal variation of effective reaction rates in mixing controlled reaction experiments or simulations 35 37 the initial number of a and b particles is 10000 and 4 respectively the lagrangian solutions of the covid-19 outbreak for the three scenarios are depicted in fig 7
modeling results for scenarios 1 2 and 3 show a peak in the curve of newly infected people at time t28 65 and 32 respectively demonstrating that the virus spreads the fastest for the scenario without mitigation constraints ie scenario 1 where the number of the total infected people or cases increases by one order of magnitude every 10 days in the rising limb as expected however the value for this peak scenario 1 198 people is lower than that for scenario 3 267 people although the total number of the infected people for scenario 1 9336 is slightly larger than scenario 3 9322 this may be due to a greater separation of infection cases for the higher number of initial coronavirus carriers in scenario 1 which causes a lower and relatively flatter covid-19 evolution peak compared to that of scenario 3 scenario 2 has the lowest peak value 121 people and the most-delayed peak in the curve for new cases and the total infection time is almost doubled compared to the other two scenarios indicating that people living with strict social distancing may also suffer from a much longer period of covid-19 threat it is also noteworthy that the overall trend of the solution simulation of scenario 1 initial surge without special constraints fig 7
a is similar to that for italy which had a delayed response to the covid-19 outbreak initially fig 6
a and scenario 3 solution a lower peak value and a longer duration due to social distancing fig 7
b is similar to that observed in japan where social distancing actions have been implemented fig 6
cthe simulated particle plumes plotted in fig 8
reveal the subtle discrepancy between the three mitigation scenarios scenario 1 assumes that four initial cases were initially located on the right side of the city while the whole population 10000 susceptible persons was distributed randomly in the 1  1 domain fig 8
a the trajectory of each person is assumed to follow two-dimensional brownian motion with retention described by eq 7 to capture the random vector for each displacement and the random waiting time between two consecutive motions described by the time fractional derivative term in eq 7 the virus moved quickly from east to west figs 8
b and 8
c spreading over the entire city before all the infected people were cured or expired dead at time t69 fig 8
d a total of 664 susceptible people 66 of the total population distributed randomly around the city were never infected
scenario 2 assumes that social distancing can reduce the infection probability which can be characterized by a smaller reaction rate or a smaller interaction radius in our lagrangian approach the virus was spreading at a much lower rate from west to east than that in scenario 1 figs 8
e8g reaching a stable condition ie  of cases neither increasing or decreasing at a later time t125 and leaving more susceptible people unaffected 2734 total which is 273 of the population therefore social distancing is effective in limiting the spread of coronavirus among people note however this scenario assumes that every person in this city strictly maintains social distancing otherwise a surge of infections may occur the same way as that shown in scenario 1
scenario 3 assumes self-quarantine notably not all of the infected people can be effectively quarantined due to the following 1 people can be infected without coronavirus symptoms 2 people in the incubation period can transmit the infection and 3 limited health care facilities and capabilities for the large influx of patients for example according to imai et al 40 many infected people could not be appropriately screened initially in wuhan city china under this condition we assume that 50 of people infected and diagnosed are immediately quarantined while the remaining infected people fig 8
i can still cause the spread of coronavirus figs 8
j8l self-quarantine therefore may not be as effective as maintained social distancingfractional calculus provides a useful tool to modeling complex dynamics in biology and this study extended the fde for modeling the coronavirus outbreak the covid-19 is a pandemic radically impacting our lives by altering our daily patterns and interactions in an unprecedented way and rate a time-dependent seir model with built-in fde components motivated by the coronavirus milestone of recording zero new local infections in china on 3192020 was applied to capture the covid-19 evolution observed over the last three months in china a stochastic model built upon the time fde for random resting times of people was also proposed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical mitigation options three main conclusions are presented by this studyfirst different properties in the covid-19 spreading in china data up to 3222020 exhibited different kinetics and the death evolution can be captured by the time fde model fitting showed that the recovery rate of covid-19 increases with time due to various human factors the fast-increasing recovery rate caused the rapid decline of the current infected population curve removing the possible memory impact and any delayed processes which does not require a time-nonlocal model such as the time fde contrarily the evolution of deaths in china italy south korea and japan can be captured well by the time fde likely due to the time memory in the death toll it is also noteworthy that the time fde version of the seir model might be needed if the late-time recovery rate declines due to the change of coronavirus properties affected by the change of climate public policy andor possible evolution of the virus itself and the contiguous mannerratesecond the updated seir model provided predictions although with high uncertainty for covid-19 evolution within china and for other countries for example the improved seir model showed that if the infection and recovery rates remain stable the number of cumulative infections is likely to decline to 1 of the total infected population within one month from 3222020 in china the overseas imported cases however may break the internal asymptotic status and significantly postpone the ending time of covid-19 in china predictions using the validated seir model also showed different evolution dynamics of covid-19 within populations of the united states italy japan and south korea for example it may take at least 23 months for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population in the us requiring more efficient mitigation strategies while south korea may control the covid-19 spread in a relatively shorter period however these predictions contain high uncertainty due to uncertainty in the maximum infected population and changes of transmissioninfection and recovery rates among different countriesthird a stochastic model based on the lagrangian scheme for the time fdes analogous to a mixing-limited reaction mechanism model showed that self-quarantine may not be as effective as strict social distancing since not all the infected people can be diagnosed and immediately quarantined while strict social distancing can apparently slow covid-19 spread the pandemic may last longer this is another case that fractional calculus may be used to explore covid-19 outbreak therefore one of the main contributions of this study is to extend the application of fdes to model dynamics and mitigation scenarios of the coronavirus spreadyong zhang conceptualization methodology

novel coronavirus cov infection called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 this is the third member of a family of covs that is associated with the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars due to atypical pneumonia the disease has evolved from wuhan china and was first reported among the visitors of local seafood market it is likely to have a zoonotic origin as horseshoe bats are a well-known natural reservoir for a variety of covs that spread to humans via incidental hosts which has not yet been identified in relation to covid-191the novel cov was determined already on 9 january 2020 and received a name of sars-cov-22 the virus quickly spread over the globe on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern and already on 11 march 2020 a pandemic was announced3 currently more than 58 million cases of covid-19 were reported with more than 350 thousand associated deaths4 the confirmed case is defined as a positive test for covid-19 regardless the presence of symptoms and signs of the disease5 thus identification of cases depends on testing coverage while many countries do not test individuals with only mild symptoms6according to the recent meta-analysis the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever 82 cough 61 fatigue with or without muscle aches 36 dyspnea 26 headache 12 sore throat 10 and gastrointestinal symptoms 97 in china the vast majority of covid-19 cases are mild 814 whereas 139 are severe and 47 are critical8 in countries of european union the proportion of severely ill patients is approximately the same and constitutes 15 of hospitalized cases9 the increased case fatality rate cfr was established in older patients  60 years males and those who presented with severe pneumonia and comorbidities10as an outbreak expands in the country more and more individuals become affected and a number of critically ill patients may increase drastically surpassing the abilities of health care system to resist the coercive pressure therefore several approaches were proposed to decrease the rate of disease spreading and to secure the capacity of health care in meeting the population demands11 such approaches could be divided into two broad categoriesindividual protection and community protection voluntary self-isolation frequent hand washing following the principles of respiratory etiquette wearing of face masks in public places and avoidance of touching face work well on a personal level while mass quarantine of healthy individuals closures of schools and child care facilities social distancing and regular cleaning of frequently touched surfaces in public places enable community protection12most countries across the globe implemented a set of protective measures with mass quarantine social distancing and travel restrictions being the most frequently practiced although it definitely had positive response the covid-19 pandemic is still far from its final phase and some international researchers anticipate another wave later this year13 in this study we aim to report on the rates of covid-19 in the republic of kazakhstan to make prognoses on cases deaths and recoveries through predictive modeling and to forecast the need in professional workforcepositive polymerase chain reaction pcr test for sars-cov-2 is currently used in the republic of kazakhstan to confirm the covid-19 case ministry of health reports on the number of covid-19 cases via a special platform run by the national center of public health14 the data on total population at risk average in year were obtained from official statistics presented at the website of republican center for health development15 from these data we constructed a real-time database that included all covid-19 cases in the country beginning march 13 2020 and ending may 28 2020kazakhstan has a population of 18654000 people16 and is administratively divided into 14 regions east kazakhstan pavlodar akmola karaganda kostanay north kazakhstan aktobe atyrau mangystau west kazakhstan almaty zhambyl kyzylorda and turkistan regions also three citiesnur-sultan shymkent and almatydo not belong to the regions they are surrounded by and are considered as the separate administrative units17the cfr was calculated as the proportion of individuals who die from covid-19 out of all individuals who were diagnosed with the disease over the period from march 13 2020 till may 28 2020the mortality rate mr for covid-19 was calculated on the basis of theoretical assumptions as the current situation is changing and we will have more precise data on covid-19 cases and mid-year population by the end of 2020 the following formula was appliedthe incidence rate ir was calculated asthe cfr age-adjusted was calculated on the basis of overall number of fatal cases of covid-19 in specific age group and overall number of covid-19 cases in the same groupthe cfr age-and-sex-adjusted was calculated based on total number of fatal outcomes in specific age and sex group and total number of covid-19 cases in the same group via the following formulathe growth forecasts for covid-19 were calculated with possibility of exponential growth ie on the basis of assumption that current growth trends are true and that future growth of covid-19 cases will be proportional to numerical values of covid-19 with 95 confidence interval cito describe the spread and progression of covid-19 in the republic of kazakhstan we applied an on-line tool18 of compartmental epidemiological model which is based on the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed seir model seir model is a widely used method for modeling of epidemic situation in the specific place the model is based on the sir model with addition of exposed compartment according to this model all people are categorized as susceptible individuals who can develop the disease exposed individuals who are already infected but have no symptoms infected infected individuals who show symptoms and signs and removed recovered individuals19 the time of modeling used was equal to 200 days the list of basic variables that were used in the model without intervention is presented in table 1after modeling the situation without intervention measures we assumed that measures implemented by the country government will be effective at least in 50 cases so possible reduction of r0 on 50 was taken as an influence factor of quarantine introduction the quarantine measures were induced in kazakhstan on the 6th day 19 march 2020 after the first covid-19 case appeared 13 march 2020 thus start time for the intervention was inputted as the tenth day because it is the earliest possible day in seir modeling basic parameters of model after intervention and reduction of r0 were r0  125 r  0025 per day and t2  27 days we created the forecast graphs that reflected reduction of all symptomatic patients all infected and exposed individuals all deaths and all hospitalized casesthe health workforce estimator tool version 22 who copenhagen denmark was utilized for forecast modeling of health care workers capacity20 this tool provides a daily estimate of each type of health care personnel needed to treat all country cases of covid-19 depending on their severity mild moderate severe and critical being developed by the who the tool estimates ideal workforce numbers to make calculations we grounded our judgments on the basis of seir modeling outcomes thus for the scenario when no intervention measures are applied we made the following inputs out of total number of symptomatic individuals 2038 million there will be 80 mild cases 163 million 18 moderate cases 3672 thousand about 2 severe cases 408 thousand and 077 critical cases the same assumptions were applied for forecasting the need in health care professionals in case of implementation of quarantine measures with an account of reduction in symptomatic individuals to 8492 thousand cases at the peakmild infection is defined as symptomatic individuals who have mild disease manifestations ie fever and cough and mild pneumonia commonly hospitalization is not required though in many countries such individuals are also hospitalized severe infection is defined as symptomatic individuals presenting with severe disease manifestations ie more severe pneumonia that leads to dyspnea respiratory rate  30min blood oxygen saturation  93 ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen pao2fio2  300 andor lung infiltrates  50 volume within 24 to 48 hours hospitalization and supplemental oxygen therapy are generally required critical infection is defined as symptomatic individuals who experience respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure the treatment is provided in an intensive care unit icu and often requires mechanical ventilation18we assume that all infected individuals will show the signs of mild disease in 80 cases moderate disease in 18 and will have severe disease in about 2 cases that may potentially become critical in the future this assumption is based on the current distribution of covid-19 clinical forms in kazakhstanoverall the crude incidence rate of covid-19 in the country is 05240 with much heterogeneity between administrative units such the highest incidence rate was observed in two largest cities  nur-sultan and almaty it has to be noted that first patients in the country were identified in these cities and there is a high concentration of specialized medical facilities which serve as referral centers for severely ill patients from neighboring regions the lowest incidence rate was seen in east kazakhstan and north kazakhstan regions where it constituted 00536 and 00916 respectively the highest crude cfr was spotted in akmola region 268 followed by kostanay region 147 and east kazakhstan region 135 table 2 as for the age-adjusted cfr it was the highest in age stratum 90-99 0083 eighty-eighty nine-year old males had excessive age-and-sex-adjusted cfr 0167 and so did 9099 year old females 0111 table 3 from the beginning of covid-19 outbreak in kazakhstan the vast majority of patients 874 had mild disease 113 had moderate disease while severe manifestations were seen in 13 cases fig 1fig 2 presents the results of seir modeling in situation when no intervention measures are applied such a possible peak is 120 day after appearance of the first covid-19 case in the country and the number of susceptible population is 712 million people at the peak of covid-19 outbreak there will be 2038 million infected individuals 25 million exposed individuals 1547 thousand people will die and 156 thousand patients will require hospitalization fig 3 demonstrates the changes in covid-19 dynamics introduced by the quarantine measures reduction of all symptomatic patients with mild i1 severe i2 and critical i3 disease manifestation will result in total 8492 thousand cases at the peak fig 3a reduction of all exposed and infected individuals will give in total 188983 thousand cases at the peak fig 3b reduction of all deaths will result in total 375 thousand cases at the peak fig 3c and reduction of all hospitalized patients with severe and critical disease manifestation will give in total 931 thousand cases at the peak fig 3don the next stage of our analyses we aimed to decipher the need in health care professionals at a country level depending on the fact of implementation of quarantine measures at the peak of covid-19 outbreak if no quarantine is applied there will be a daily need in 12026 icu doctors and 58144 icu nurses while introduction of quarantine may potentially reduce these numbers to 500 and 2420 respectively likewise lack of quarantine measures will necessitate the availability of 707 dialysis practitioners and 589 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo practitioners while implementation of quarantine will can help to reduce these numbers to 29 and 24 practitioners respectively besides 168576 ward nurses will be needed in the country if no intervention is applied as compared to just 7982 nurses in case of quarantine implementation tables 4 and 5this study aimed at epidemiological elucidation of covid-19 outbreak in the republic of kazakhstan and at predictive modeling of cases deaths and recoveries as well as needs in professional workforce depending on implementation of quarantine measures to the best of our knowledge this is the first study devoted to epidemiology of covid-19 outbreak in the republic of kazakhstan the vast majority of symptomatic patients in this study have mild disease manifestations and the proportion of moderate disease is around 10 refusal to implement quarantine measures will result in 156 thousand hospitalized patients due to severe illness and in 1547 thousand deaths at the peak of an outbreak besides this will substantially increase the need in professional medical workforce still 50 compliance with quarantine measures could potentially reduce the number of deaths up to 375 thousand cases and the number of hospitalized patients up to 931 thousand cases at the peak also this may decrease the demand for medical professionals alleviating the burden placed on kazakhstani health care systemhaving the seir model and parameters in hand simulations could be carried-out for a longer time period and thus predict the potential trends of covid-19 outbreak both at the national and local levels simulation models could also evaluate the impact of different intervention scenarios21 other studies across the globe show good agreement between seir modeling and official data that fall within 95 ci in china the forecasted values were higher than the actual ones which was attributed to the effectiveness of anti-epidemic measures undertaken by the country government22 in italy the forecast modeling of covid-19 outbreak showed high accordance with the real data23communitywide protective measures such as quarantine social distancing and closure of schools and childcare facilities are broadly implemented throughout covid-19 pandemic and kazakhstan is not the exception although being effective these measures present rather challenging issue as they might be very disruptive and require adequate planning and community engagement24 a recently published rapid systematic review concludes that home quarantine is not very cost-effective and should be started when pandemic just began the authors emphasize that testing and contact tracing with rapid isolation of infected individualsa strategy that is also undertaken in kazakhstanappears to be more cost-effective than quarantine25 apart from social and economic costs home quarantine is associated with mental distress as it leads to confusion anger and posttraumatic stress syndrome which may have long-lasting negative effects26still quarantine measures undertaken by other countries have proven to be effective in controlling the spread of covid-192122 despite early introduction of quarantine in kazakhstan the outbreak continues to escalate probably because many infected individuals have not been identified yet this phenomenon could be explained in two different ways first many infected individuals remain asymptomatic and this proportion could be as high as 405027 these individuals are not identifiable at the community level and along with those who are presymptomatic or have only mild symptoms are not likely to seek medical care second individuals with known exposure like asymptomaticpresymptomatic foreign travelers do not readily follow the recommendations on self-isolation taking into consideration that inadequate compliance with quarantine leads to community transmission of sars-cov-2 to the susceptible individuals this explains the continuing community spreadas covid-19 outbreak evolves the scarcity of health care resources becomes a major challenge no country in the world is prepared for rapidly increasing needs in icu resources including beds equipment and professionals in india allocation of one third of icu beds for covid-19 alone would result in troubling effects among other patients presenting with serious conditions requiring icu care28 the actual number of icu beds available in kazakhstan is not officially reported although the ministry of health made efforts to equip existing icus with additional mechanical ventilators and ecmo machines however if covid-19 outbreak takes the negative scenario the newly emerged patients in critical condition will completely overwhelm the health care system of kazakhstansevere cytokine activation or cytokine release syndrome crs is an acute systemic inflammatory response and might be the cause of lethal outcome in otherwise healthy individuals affected by covid-1929 the cause of crs is the activation of bystander immune cells and endothelial cells due to the binding of car t-cell receptor to its antigen in turn activation of bystander immune cells results in mass production of cytokines and pathophysiological cascade of subsequent events30 because covid-19 patients with crs carry worse prognosis it is important to recognize it early in order to provide an adequate therapeutic response31in general effective tackling of covid-19 outbreak has several side aspects and improved patients satisfaction is one of them as this outbreak caused multiple problems for the population of kazakhstan it is worth to maintain trust in such international organizations as the who32 and also in local health care providers which became undermined over recent years33 for this it might prove to be useful to provide adequate information on outbreak status in a timely manner and to initiate an open dialog with general public which could be done via social mediathe outcomes of our study could be of interest for policymakers as they help to forecast the trends of covid-19 outbreak the demands for professional workforce and to estimate the consequences of quarantine measures our study results based on combination of official data on covid-19 outbreak in kazakhstan and seir modeling suggest that 50 compliance with quarantine measures could potentially reduce the number of cases according to available international reports introduction of quarantine may provide beneficial effects in reality kazakhstan initiated quarantine very early and combined it with other community protection measures including closure of all educational establishments restriction of travels and cleaning with disinfection in public places thus this model is likely to show exaggerated results and the real situation can be more optimistic if the country government will not cease the interventions preliminary we hope that this simulation can be useful for managing covid-19 outbreak in kazakhstan as well as in other countries that are still at an early stage of covid-19 epidemicsince its outbreak in december of 2019 coronavirus disease covid-19 has spread worldwide causing more than 5 million infections and tens of thousands of deaths in the course of three months 1 in cities that were severely affected by covid-19 such as wuhan china lombardy italy and new york city united states 1 local medical capacities were quickly depleted by large numbers of patients who hurried to hospitals for treatment many medical workers were infected and medical care supplies were further exhausted 2 to prevent collapse of the global health care system many countries have advocated for infected patients with mild symptoms to stay home and self-quarantine 3 however it has been observed that the condition of some home-quarantined patients becomes severe or critical as the disease progresses home quarantine can delay timely treatment and hospitalization of these patients which may lead to their deathin this paper we report a telemedicine model that we developed to address the challenges outlined above this telemedicine system enabled close monitoring of 74 home-quarantined covid-19 patients from january 6 to 31 2020 of the 74 patients 6 8 were admitted to hospital when signs of deterioration were detected by the system one patient received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo treatment for 17 days all 74 patients recoveredthe telemedicine model was built based on wechat a popular smartphone app for instant messaging and social media the wechat app established two-way communication between the home-quarantined patients and a multidisciplinary team the multidisciplinary team contacted the patients regularly to receive information updates the information was subsequently analyzed to determine the latest status of the patients home-quarantined patients could also initiate communication to report any abnormalities in addition to receiving feedback about their medical conditions the system we developed is the first to quantify subjective symptom descriptions with objective numerical scales in addition this telemedicine system helps alleviate the workload of overwhelmed medical staff 4 as we found that excessive laboratory data and physical examinations were not strictly necessary to identify the prognoses of patients with mild symptoms furthermore the telemedicine model minimizes the risk of infection among caregiving staff by reducing their direct physical contact with patients in this paper we summarize the procedures of the telemedicine model and present clinical evidence of its successbelow we outline the procedure of the telemedicine system when a patient signed up for the telemedicine system the multidisciplinary team created a patient-specific telemedicine form in the cloud the telemedicine form was then sent to the patient through a link via the wechat app to the patients mobile phone or by email the patient began the process by filling in the telemedicine form figure 1the patient first answered a set of standardized questions which included general demographic information name gender age occupation and pregnancy status medical history comorbidities epidemiological history within the past 14 days and medication usage clinical manifestations eg fever cough chest tightness lack of strength various laboratory tests computed tomography ct images and nucleic acid test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 detection figure 1next the patient underwent quarantine management assessment this assessment was based on a set of medical observation scales developed by the multidisciplinary team based on both a literature review 5-9 and input from 34 medical experts from our medical school or its affiliated hospitals multimedia appendix 1 the quarantine management assessment helped the multidisciplinary team assess the patients conditionsbased on the assessment the multidisciplinary team determined whether the patient should be hospitalized immediately or placed under medical observation at home if the patient was placed under medical observation the patient would then begin using the electronic counseling ecounseling system which facilitated close observation by and efficient communication with the multidisciplinary team specifically the patient was required to update their conditions on a daily basis using the telemedicine form due to the convenience provided by the cloud service the information could be instantly accessed by pertinent multidisciplinary team members they subsequently provided feedback and guidance on the telemedicine form which then could also be accessed by the patient immediatelyin addition the patient was invited to join a wechat group consisting of patients participating in the telemedicine system and multidisciplinary team members in this way the patient could receive health tips from the multidisciplinary team and conduct a group chat with other patients and multidisciplinary team members the patient could also initiate a one-to-one chat or telephone call with any multidisciplinary team member using built-in functions in the wechat appthe multidisciplinary team adjusted their observational attention based on the progression of each patients condition if a patients condition continued to worsen eg repeated and persistent fever 385 degrees celsius cyanosis or ct image deterioration 50 within 48 hours or their mental state scores continued to decline the patient was flagged as red the multidisciplinary team then determined that the patient should be admitted to hospital to be treated the detailed decision-making process regarding hospitalization is presented in figure 2 figures 3 and 4 provide screenshots of the interfaces in which the telemedicine form is created and used respectivelythe multidisciplinary team consisted of multidisciplinary medical workers including 2 physicians 3 nurses 1 rehabilitation physician and 1 psychologist the physicians gave treatment advice according to the patients condition updates through the ecounseling system the nurses guided the methods of quarantine and disinfection supervised the patients regular work rest nutrition and diet and urged the patients to update their conditions in the telemedicine form on a daily basis the rehabilitation physician helped the patients develop practical rehabilitation plans and the psychologist helped them maintain a positive moodthe system initially recruited 188 individuals through word of mouth and physician referrals of these individuals 114188 606 showed no symptoms of covid-19 during the 14-day quarantine period these individuals were dismissed from the telemedicine system the remaining 74 patients were confirmed covid-19 cases among these patients 2674 35 left the system prematurelythe multidisciplinary team followed up with every patient who dropped out they found that all 26 patients had recovered and felt that their continued participation in the telemedicine system was unnecessarythe observation endpoints for the patients in the telemedicine system were set as follows patients were clinically cured normal ct imaging reports plus a minimum of 2 rounds of negative results for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid detection patients were admitted to hospital because of progression of the disease or patients were deceased although this did not occur in our studythe diagnostic criteria for confirmed cases were defined as the presentation of either 1 of 2 pieces of etiological evidence testing positive for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr or virus sequences detected in respiratory or blood samples sharing high homology with the known sequence of sars-cov-2the inclusion criteria of the telemedicine system were set as confirmed or suspected cases of covid-19 and voluntary participation in medical observation patients who were not diagnosed with covid-19 with certainty pregnant or breastfeeding women patients younger than 18 years or older than 75 years and patients who were unable to cooperate with the data reporting were excluded from the analysiswe designed the quarantine management assessment scales using common symptoms presented by the patients with covid-19 we treated at the tongji hospital clinic we then gradually added new symptoms to the scales as our understanding of the disease advanced the final version of the quarantine management assessment was designed based on these scales which consisted of 5 primary indicators 22 secondary indicators and 83 tertiary indicators multimedia appendix 1to calibrate the validity of the quarantine management assessment scales they were submitted to 34 medical experts for evaluation two rounds of expert consultations were conducted in each round 17 experts from the emergency department respiratory department intensive care unit icu and infectious disease department were invited to evaluate the scales statistical analysis of the consultation results showed that the response rates of the two rounds of expert consultations were 100 and 8824 respectively the mean authoritative coefficient was 0855 the w values for the degree of coordination of the expert opinions were 0204 and 0293 for the two rounds respectively the w values were also statistically significant p003of the 48 patients in the study 35 73 were female the median age was 375 years iqr 3000-4500 fever was the most common initial symptom among the 48 patients 28 58 followed by cough 16 33 lack of strength 6 13 muscle soreness 5 10 and nasal congestion 3 6 table 1 one patient had no symptoms upon their initial clinic visit six patients were admitted to hospital later because their conditions worsened during home quarantine all these patients had fever of the hospitalized patients 3 had coughs and 3 also showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis however 2 hospitalized patients exhibited normal ct imaging at initial diagnosis table 2of the 6 hospitalized patients 2 patients 33 progressed to critical condition one patient labeled as patient no 3 in table 2 was directly admitted to the icu ecmo support was provided to this patient for 17 days he was transferred to the general ward when his condition stabilized eventually the patient recovered table 2 another hospitalized patient labeled as patient no 4 in table 2 was found to have a persistent fever on day 5 of observation the patients ct results identified ground-glass opacities in both lungs figure 5 emergency hospital admission was requested for the patient noninvasive ventilation was provided and the patients condition gradually improved this patient was discharged from hospital after 30 days of treatment table 2based on the information collected through the ecounseling system we found that there were differences in disease progression between patients with mild conditions and the patients who were hospitalized the hospitalized patients had appreciably elevated body temperature at onset which scored between 3 and 4 points approximately 38-40 c and persisted longer than that of nonhospitalized patients the mean body temperature of the nonhospitalized patients became normal by day 4 or 5 figure 6a in comparison the body temperature of the hospitalized patients remained elevated on day 5 to 6 along with exacerbated cough figure 6bthe results of the quarantine management assessment of symptom progression also provided direct insight into timely intervention for patients whose conditions deteriorated over time the separation between the dyspnea curves was very distinct between nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients for nonhospitalized patients with mild symptoms dyspnea peaked on day 6 with a score of 2 to 3 which manifests as shortness of breath when hurrying on a level surface however these patients symptoms gradually improved over time in contrast hospitalized patients had sustained dyspnea that continued to worsen over time figure 6calthough the degree of lack of strength appeared to be unrelated to disease severity at onset this symptom was never alleviated among hospitalized patients and continued to worsen over time in comparison among nonhospitalized patients strength was nearly normal by day 4 figure 6d in addition we observed that the mental state of hospitalized patients gradually deteriorated over the course of the disease showing a similar pattern to lack of strength figure 6e furthermore while muscle soreness was alleviated on day 4 for all patients the degree of muscle soreness in hospitalized patients continued to be higher than normal figure 6f the progression of diarrhea was inconsistent for both groups figure 6g this may be due to the side effects of certain antiviral drugs we also found that 4 days after the onset of illness the chest tightness of hospitalized patients gradually worsened figure 6hworld health organization who emergency guidelines recommend considering alternative quarantine methods including homecare and isolation for patients with covid-19 who have mild symptoms in cases of insufficient hospitalization conditions or medical resources 3 however these guidelines do not provide details on how this home quarantine should be conducted nor do they offer instructions on what to do when patients conditions become severe or critical a notable example is the british prime minister boris johnson who was admitted to the icu after 11 days of home quarantine 10 more concerningly based on initial clinic symptoms and laboratory tests it is difficult to distinguish patients whose conditions will later become severe or critical for example ct results were normal for 748 15 of the patients in our study during initial diagnosis including 2 patients who were hospitalized our results were consistent with the findings of guan et al 11 who reported that ct images were normal for 179 of patients with mild conditions and 29 patients with severe conditions respectively thus it may be a common challenge to identify patients during an initial clinic screening whose conditions are prone to become severe or critical constant observation of home-quarantined patients by medical staff may therefore be of lifesaving importancethe telemedicine model presented in this paper not only fills the gap in the who guidelines on home quarantine but also mitigates the subsequent threats of the disease caused by a lack of initial symptoms specifically through the quarantine management assessment the telemedicine system can complement the initial clinic screening and hence greatly increase the accuracy of diagnosis through the ecounseling system the telemedicine system can detect any newly emerged symptoms then the multidisciplinary team can be promptly informed to make appropriate treatment decisionsto demonstrate the merits of the telemedicine system fever can be considered as an example current studies list fever as an indispensable or highly prevalent symptom during the initial phase of covid-19 infection 12-16 however in the study by guan et al 11 fever was only present in about half 487 of the patients during initial diagnosis the telemedicine system proposed in this paper helped patients report their elevated body temperatures later to medical staff who then could monitor the changes in body temperature over time to detect any alarming patterns we found that hospitalized patients had elevated body temperature that was sustained considerably longer than that of nonhospitalized patients in contrast the body temperature of nonhospitalized patients returned to normal by day 4 to 5 this difference can be detected only through continuous observation implemented by the telemedicine system or another similar system thus the telemedicine system greatly aids medical staff in making correct treatment decisions without being misguided by the initial clinic diagnosisthe telemedicine system also contributes to clinical practice by identifying the key roles of dynamic changes in four diagnostic symptoms fever dyspnea lack of strength and muscle soreness dyspnea peaked on day 6 for nonhospitalized patients but persisted in hospitalized patients and was exacerbated over time similarly both lack of strength and muscle soreness returned to normal by day 4 for nonhospitalized patients but not for hospitalized patients when a patient reported via the ecounseling system that she was still experiencing the symptoms listed above after day 4 the multidisciplinary team went on alert and paid closer attention to that patientfurther these symptoms have not been fully studied in the literature on covid-19 therefore tracing dynamic changes in the abovementioned symptoms paves the way for future studies to investigate whether these time markers can serve as turning points of the disease in comparison we found that excessive laboratory data and physical examination were not strictly necessary to evaluate patients with mild symptoms instead the evaluation could be performed through patients subjective initiative and active participation through self-monitoring of the diseaseanother contribution of this telemedicine system is the quarantine management assessment scales this set of scales provides hands-on and easy-to-use self-diagnosis tools for home-quarantined patients it also helps medical staff obtain more details about the clinical symptoms of the patients without the need for close physical contact in a clinic we found that the quarantine management assessment worked well in identifying patients with disease progressionfrom the resource management perspective the telemedicine system enabled management of 188 individuals initially and 74 patients later by a team consisting of only 7 medical workers none of the patients died and none of the multidisciplinary team members were infected with covid-19 efficiency is important for regions whose medical workforce has been impacted by medical worker infection many infected medical workers were required to remain at home for at least two weeks after recovery one merit of the telemedicine system is that medical staff who have recovered from covid-19 and are self-quarantined can be enlisted to help thus the shortage in the medical workforce can be alleviated and other medical workers can be freed to fight covid-19 on the front line in conclusion the implementation of such a system can optimize the usage of local medical resources and reduce cross-infection among medical workers and patientsone limitation of this study is that its scope was restricted by the suddenness and complexity of the covid-19 outbreak as well as the diversity and latency of the clinical manifestations of the disease as a result we were unable to obtain a larger sample size to achieve a higher level of validity of the findings it is worth mentioning that we are currently testing the telemedicine system globally as of april 9 2020 1421 patients worldwide are using this system including 804 in italy 250 in the united kingdom 181 in france and 168 in the united states more than 60 of the participating patients are quarantined at home we expect to report further findings in the futurecontinuous monitoring of patients with covid-19 quarantined at home with a telemedicine system helped greatly reduce the risks of delayed hospitalization due to disease progression through this system medical workers can trace changes in several key symptoms and intervene in the home quarantine in time for hospitalization the telemedicine system proposed in this study was proven to be effectual and efficient implementation of this system will optimize the usage of local medical resources and reduce cross-infection among medical workers and patientsthe earliest recorded usage of the term quarantine dates back to the 14th century to prevent the transmission of the deadly plague quarantine stations continue to be an established public health norm when a rapidly spreading infectious disease is to be controlled infected and potentially infected cases are isolated as seen in the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus epidemic sarscov of 2003 middle east respiratory syndromecov ebola outbreaks and other infectious diseases with an epidemic or pandemic potential as there is very little literature regarding dermatology and the sarscov2 virus we must be aware as dermatologists regarding what to expect
1
 quarantine and isolation have the distinct advantage of fever surveillance in addition to movement restriction which prove effective in preventing droplet transmission as in the case of the current coronavirus pandemic
2
 this public health tool is quintessential in situations if we have no established vaccines or therapeutic modalities as with the sarscov2 quarantine regulations apply to individuals exposed to the virus whereas isolation is mandated for individuals showing molecular positivity for sarscov2 these can be achieved by social distancing selfquarantine hospital quarantine or community containment which help in preventing humantohuman transmission however with sarscov2 the limiting factors for isolation and quarantine are early transmissibility unknown viral shedding patterns the possibility of fomite transmission and the short incubation period
3
 therefore there is a need to resort to measures beyond simple containment counterproductive to this is the overzealous and indiscriminate use of isolation and quarantine there is a lot of criticism and uproar on the quarantine of the diamond princess cruise ship which was under quarantine at the yokohama port in japan the latter is being hailed as a brewing petri dish wherein 712 individuals tested positive for sarscov2 which is an avoidable effect of local transmission
4
 furthermore with quarantines ethical aspects come into play as the confinement is not simply physical it encroaches upon human rights causes spiritual isolation and may have psychological repercussions it is pertinent to remember the economic health and psychosocial hardships faced by sierra leone during the 20142015 outbreak of the ebola virus and the subsequent isolation5 6 some federal quarantine laws have been likened to unlawful detention and challenged by the writ of habeas corpus for the same reason before covid19 pandemic dermatologists aesthetic practioners and plastic surgeons were doing reasonably well and business was blooming now as covid19 spreads around continents it has become evident that this virus has the ability to derail the world economy significantly will we be able to strike a balance between civil liberty and public health and defy covid19 using these ancient public health tools or will we need more sophisticated tools to flatten the curve only time will tellthe world health organization who named the virus 2019 novel coronavirus disease covid-19 and the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which has attracted worldwide attention the new coronavirus is a strain that has never been found in humans before this virus can cause an acute respiratory disease and common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms fever cough shortness of breath and dyspnea in more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome kidney failure and even death 1according to who situation reports the outbreak of covid-19 has led to 79407 confirmed cases worldwide and 2622 deaths in 32 countries as of february 24 2020 of which 64287 were from hubei china numerous cases have been reported in other areas outside hubei including metropolitan areas of beijing n  399 and shanghai n  335 as well as other countries outside china such as south korea n  833 japan n  144 and italy n  124 with the continuously increasing number of cases understanding the spread pattern of covid-19 and monitoring spikes in the number of cases are crucial steps in providing evidence that could guide public health intervention strategies and healthcare policy makingseveral mathematical models and data analysis approaches attempting to estimate the transmission of covid-19 have been recently reported 24 public health interventions and transportation restriction effects for disease transmission have also been evaluated in some studies 5 6 some studies indicated that public intervention measures greatly mitigate the final size of the epidemic and shift the turning point about 24 days before the turning point without these measures 7 some noted that travel restrictions would not affect much unless combined with a 50 or higher reduction of transmission in the community 8 and a report from imperial college covid-19 response team concluded that the intensive intervention or something equivalently effective such as combining home isolation of suspect cases home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease could reduce transmission however this would need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available and the team also predicted that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed so it requires the combination of multiple interventions to have a substantial impact on transmission 9 in order to predict the outbreak size and time researchers have published many different results for forecasting when the outbreak will peak in different areas 10 11 these models are certainly useful to understand the emerging trends of covid-19 however there are several challenges to such timely analyses and forecasting due to barriers such as the disease incubation period asymptomatic infection diagnosis testing capacity overloaded medical staff and complicated reporting processes there can be delays or missed reporting in this evolving situation regarding the confirmation of cases furthermore the adopted models have mostly been complicated with many pre-settings or assumptions or parameter values that are likely not accurate although some modeling approaches can estimate parameter values through statistical methods they can only contribute a rough simulation for the modeling as a result those studies achieved different prediction results by using different methods and datasetsto achieve a relatively objective judgment given that that this new disease and complicated situation has many unknown factors we used mathematical modeling methods to characterize covid-19 transmission and used multiple datasets for ensuring the data reliability since individual data sources may be biased or incomplete according to related studies the use of multiple data sources rather than a single dataset can enable a more robust estimation of the underlying dynamics of transmission 12 therefore we investigated and collected data from four sources including released data and official daily reports from commercial technology companies academic institutes authorities or local healthcare commissions and the world health organization to minimize the resulting errors caused by potentially biased single data sources the data were obtained from the beijing municipal health commission bmhc 13 shanghai municipal health and family planning commission smhfpc 14 health commission of guangdong province 15 national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 16 baidu migration big data platform bmbdp 17 center for systems science and engineering csse of johns hopkins university 18 and who coronavirus disease covid-2019 situation reports 19 considering that the cases detected in these four cities were all imported or secondary transmission cases and based on the reported data available after january 20 2020 chinese authorities have implemented prevention measures in these cities to contain the outbreak and prevent the disease from spreading thus we considered the secondary transmission pattern of covid-2019 to be different than the early spread pattern in wuhan where the virus was rampantly transmitted without any prevention measures therefore we collected data from january 24 2020 chinese new years eve to february 23 2020 to give an overall objective estimation of covid-19 development in four high-risk metropolitan areas of china beijing shanghai guangzhou and shenzhen we estimated how covid-19 human-to-human transmission occurred in these large cities which have developed considerable cases we further used these estimates to forecast the potential risks and development trends of these four metropolitan areas inside chinathe seir model is a deterministic metapopulation transmission model in which the population is divided into four classes s susceptible people who are likely to be infected e exposed people who are exposed i infectious people who are infected and r removed recovered and dead persons we assumed that the epidemic risk started with infectious cases on february 3 2020 when authorities announced that people were returning to work after the chinese spring festival holiday therefore we modeled a period beginning on february 3 2020 the seir model state transition is shown in figure 1 in our estimation the entire population was initially susceptible since covid-19 is an emerging new infectious disease and not all people have immunity against it in january before chinese new year there were an estimated 3246 2847 3430 and 3271 million people flown out from beijing shanghai guangzhou and shenzhen respectively we took this outflow number out from these four cities initial populations and assume they returned after chinese new year by february 17 2020 we estimated the initial exposed population using the number of confirmed cases during the next 7 days we assumed that the median incubation period was 56 days ranging from 014 days based on the who report 20based on the basic seir model we further considered the influence of multiple factors on the transmission pattern as the situation unfolded including public health intervention measures peoples self-protection behaviors the diagnosis rate population flow etcassuming that public health interventions contributed to the control of the dynamics of the epidemic we incorporated a parameter that indicates the changes in the population flow into the model according to the inflow index outflow index and urban daily adjusted index of the travel intensity from the baidu migration big data platform for the period from january 24 2020 to february 23 2020 we inferred that peoples activity was obviously lower than the normal level for the same period last year furthermore considering the spring festival population flow and those returning to work after the holiday officially announced as february 3 2020 we regarded that the risk for these four metropolitan areas grows with the inflow population increase starting on february 3 2020 and the four cities executed 14 days quarantine policy for incoming travelers during that time the spread was contained strictly so an average introduced number of cases were counted into the modelwe also estimated the parameter values within these cities using the mcmc method cases in the reported data and other sources reported between january 24 2020 and february 23 2020 were used to adjust the model considering the possible complex influencing factors we proposed an adjusted seir model for covid-19 estimation as displayed in figure 2in the adjusted seir model we considered the inflow of the citys population so the total number of people was not fixed and the population was divided into seven classes s susceptible people who are likely to be infected e exposed people who are exposed i infectious people who are infected r recovered and dead persons sq quarantined susceptible persons eq isolated exposed persons and iq isolated infected persons the transmission dynamics are governed by the following equationswhere q is the quarantined proportion of exposed individuals  is the transmission probability per contact c is the contact rate which defines how many people are contacted with an infected person per day and i is the estimated infected people within the inflow population each day the quarantined infected people moved to the compartment eq at a rate of cq while the quarantined uninfected people moved to the compartment sq at a rate of 1cq those who were not quarantined if infected moved to compartment e at a rate of c1  q  is the transmission capability between the latent and the infected population according to the reported results of related work the transmission capability of the people in the incubation period and the diagnosed infected patients are similar 21 we assume that   1  is the transition rate from the quarantined to susceptible population  is the transition rate from the exposed to the infected population  is the mortality rate i is the transition rate from the infected population to the quarantined infected population and i is the recovery rate of the infected population q is the transition rate from the quarantined exposed population to the quarantined infected population and h is the recovery rate of the quarantined infected populationthe mcmc method is a commonly used algorithm in modern statistical calculations this algorithm provides an effective tool for establishing statistical models and is widely used in bayesian calculations of complex statistical models 22 we used the mcmc method and metropolis-hastingsmh algorithm sampling 23 with a normal distribution as the recommended distribution estimated the parameters of the modified seir model to obtain the baseline estimation of parameters incorporated the data collected from infectious disease reports into the above statistical inference and simulated the process of infectious disease transmission to further fix some parameters on the basis of fitting reported data using beijing as an example the parameter estimates and initial values of the seir model are listed in table 1in addition to simulate the contact rate for model estimation we used urban travel index data from baidu a major internet company in china that hosts the popular navigator app baidu maps which indirectly monitors the real-time urban travel intensity and population flow the baidu index of travel intensity and population flow was converted into the corresponding coefficients for the contact rate and the quarantined susceptible population in terms of the baidu index we simulated peoples activity level by comparing our observed period under strict interventions with a normal level in the same period last year we also consider the assumption scenario that when people return back to work limited interventions accordingly we added the coefficients 06c 08c c 15c 2c for the baseline contact rate to compare different effectiveness of interventions similarly the coefficients were added to baseline quarantine proportion 06q 08q q 15q 2qat the onset when all people are susceptible r0 is defined as the average number of new infections directly caused by a case in a population of people who are all susceptible given the model structure includes quarantine and isolation we used the next generation matrix to derive a formula for the basic reproduction number after public health interventions were executed the principal eigenvalue of the next generation matrix is the expectation of population growth and the equation is as follows and the parameter definition is same with adjusted seir modelto characterize the overall epidemic size and dynamics figure 3 shows the epidemic curve of covid-19 cases identified in beijing shanghai guangzhou and shenzhen from january 24 2020 to february 23 2020we summarized and interpreted the transmission dynamics of covid-19 in the four metropolitan areas the adjusted seir model was used to predict cases in beijing shanghai guangzhou and shenzhen and figure 4 shows the comparisons between the predicted results and actual results the results are based on an assumption of no further imported cases to these cities since china implemented strong regulation measures during the observation periodbased on our observations from the data shown in table 2 and figure 5 below we also found that the number of infected individuals changed with different levels of public health interventions and that strict interventions could decrease the peak number of infected individuals compared with the scenario of weak interventions accordingly we used different contact rates to reflect the different levels of interventions the baseline contact rate was derived by the mcmc method and the results show that reducing the contact rate either persistently decreased the peak value or could delay the peak in addition with strict public intervention the number of infected individuals eventually decreased and the peak appeared sooner than it would with weak intervention methods after february 3 2020 as people returned to work after a holiday many people returned to these cities which was inferred from the baidu transportation index we added this information into the risk factors for the contact rate 15c 2c accordingly the number of infected individuals increased compared with the scenario of a decreased contact rate 08c 06cin addition we compared the transmission dynamics with different quarantined proportion of exposed individuals as shown in table 3 and figure 6 which reflects the contact tracing capability and management efforts of local governments and the results show that reducing the quarantined proportion of exposed individuals 08q 06q led to an increase in the peak value and delayed the peak time conversely the peak value decreased and an earlier peak time occurred with a higher quarantined proportion of exposed individuals 2q 15qwe used the mcmc method to fit the model and adopted an adaptive mh algorithm to carry out the mcmc procedure as a result we inferred r0  291 278 202 and 175 for beijing shanghai guangzhou and shenzhen respectivelyour analysis results strongly demonstrate that reducing secondary infections among close contacts would effectively limit human-to-human transmission and public health measures such as the rapid identification of cases tracing and following up with people who had contact with an infected person infection prevention and control in health care settings and the implementation of health measures for travelers can greatly prevent further spread of the diseasethe documented covid-19 reproduction numbers range from 20 to 49 6 11 25 which are based on cases that developed during different transmission phases and in different areas for instance the r0 in wuhan was obviously higher than that in other cities during the timeframe analyzed furthermore after implementing the prevention measures employed by the chinese government and local authorities we regarded the inferred r0 results of the four cities as reasonable and interpretablein this study we aimed to monitor covid-19 trends after cases were imported into other cities and estimate the spread pattern by mathematical modeling which can be helpful for evaluating the potential risk and severity of new outbreaks the results of our study show that for four metropolitan areas of china the containment measures were an effective control at that time however it is imperative to raise awareness in the population and prevent potential outbreak risks going forward the study has limitations the present reported data are insufficient to understand the full epidemiological pattern of covid-19 transmission and new potential outbreaks for example the estimates in this manuscript have a certain degree of uncertainty and delays due to the limitations in reporting mechanisms over the course of the natural history of the cases the impact of other potential asymptomatic cases and some unreported cases some studies were conducted with the assumption that a small fraction 20 were not reported 7 and others reported the estimated asymptomatic proportion was 179 26 or 60 21 evidently such asymptomatic infectious cases are not fully reported by current testing method however some studies suggested crowdsourced data could be compiled and analyzed as an complementation of officially released data which could perhaps help in improving the analysis results 2729as concluded from the who-china joint mission report 30 the covid-19 transmission dynamics are inherently contextual as are the dynamics for any outbreak and people worldwide need to work together to defend against this disease to do this it is necessary to 1 enhance the understanding of the evolving covid-19 and the nature and the impact of ongoing containment measures 2 share knowledge on the covid-19 response and preparedness measures being implemented in countries affected by or at risk of importations of covid-19 3 generate recommendations for adjusting covid-19 containment and response measures in china and internationally and 4 establish priorities for a collaborative program of work research and development to address critical gaps in knowledge responses readiness tools and strategiesas a consequence of our study we concluded that the outbreak could be greatly reduced by strict public health interventions the public intervention strategies and implemented protection measures conducted in these four areas may help provide epidemiological suggestions to governments that guide measures for the international cases that are

dioxide no2 and sulfur dioxide produced by fossil fuel air pollution is a causative factor for various ocular surface complaints such as eye redness irritation and blurring of vision as well as various ocular diseases such as meibomian gland disease and dry eye disease vernal keratoconjunctivitis allergic conjunctivitis retinal vein and artery occlusion and glaucoma14 putative pathophysiology of air pollutants is mediated by oxidative stress in ocular tissues exposed to atmospheric changes involving damage of cellular dna membrane lipids peroxidation inactivation of receptor protein and enzymes and finally cells apoptosis and autophagy mediated by autophagosome3 5 similarly air pollutants promote neurotoxic and microvascular effects impacting on cardiovascular diseases as well as glaucoma and retinal vascular diseases2 6 7 since 8 december 2019 the world has been confronted by a viral pneumonia pandemic caused by the coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-2 or coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 initially described in wuhan hubei in the peoples republic of china the movement of people and freight through tourism and commercial airline flights contributed to the spread of the global pandemic causing millions of cases and tens of thousands of deaths the local authorities responded quickly to promulgate quarantine status of epicentres such as towns popular districts production plants and other gathering places consequently the reduction of human activities has impacted on greenhouse gas emissions from industry tertiary services mass transits or individual car circulation nasas aura satellite described a marked reduction of nitrous oxide no2 across china from 120 january 2020 before the quarantine to 1025 february during the quarantine8 9 according to nasa scientists the reduction in no2 pollution was first apparent near wuhan but eventually spread across the country and around the world a similar no2 decrease across europe china and india were identified by copernicus sentinel-5p satellite from the european union copernicus programme during quarantine10 11 globally an no2 decrease of 4050 over major cities across asia europe or north america were measured following the decrease of global economy due to coronavirus epidemic figure 18 10 11 the impact of the global reduction of air pollution during sars-cov-2 pandemic could positively affect all the biodiversity of earth involving the slowdown of climatic change and the quality of freshwater therefore the strong efforts of the international community to contain the covid-19 epidemic may also have indirect health benefits by lowering the impact of air pollution on ocular diseases even if sars-cov-2 involves conjunctivitis and external ocular infections12 there are not yet published data describing the effects of a reduction of air pollutants on the ocular surface during the quarantine period and a putative decrease in some ocular complaintsindividuals being at home and less exposed to pollens and atmospheric pollutants however all activities soliciting the near vision and accommodation were particularly increased during quarantine such as videogames television tele-working reading and others activities in smartphone putatively generating dry eye symptoms and visual fatigue13 also it should be noted that a large number of doctors accidentally acquired coronavirus infection by contact with oropharyngeal fluids but also tears and conjunctival secretions of patients14particularly for patients with conjunctivitis15 furthermore recent data highlighted that ocular symptoms could occur about 1015 days after systemic contamination with a low positivity rate of reverse transcription-pcr in tears and conjunctival samples ie conjunctival swab orand scrapping16 17 sars-cov-2 patients without any ocular symptoms could also excreted sars-cov-2 in tears18 even if sars-cov-2 is an enveloped virus surviving a few hours or days on dry inert surfaces the contaminated surfaces of ophthalmological consultation rooms are an established route of sars-cov-2 spreading19 thus ophthalmologists are mainly concerned by an aerosol transmission working in confined spaces at few centimetres from the faces of their patients and a transmission by contact with tears or contaminated surfaces considering the contagiousness of the sars-cov-2 personal protective equipment is necessary in daily clinical practice gloves and filtering face piece respirators ffp2 or ffp3 masks for the ophthalmologist and surgical facemasks for the patient20 a plexiglass barrier protective shield between patient and ophthalmologist is as additional salient approach during close clinical and paraclinical examinations21 those preventive measures against sars-cov-2 will increase the duration of consultation which will increase the waiting list for patientsthat is already long and that may further delay medical treatment22 in conclusion even if individuals are less exposed to air pollutants and environmental allergens during quarantine weeks sars-cov-2 seems to be a foe both for ophthalmologistswith a risk of infection through contact with eye secretions of patientsand for patientswith a delay in their medical management the sars-cov-2 will probably upset ophthalmological practices during the forthcoming months or yearsin february 2020 italy became the epicentre for coronavirus disease covid-19 in europe with many exportations to other countries and widespread community transmission particularly in northern italy 1 as a public health response on 22 february 2020 italy imposed a lockdown with shutdown of businesses schools and public places plus physical distancing in hotspot regions close to milan and venice approximately 50000 people could not enter or leave several towns in veneto and lombardy for 14 days without special permission the population sizes in these towns range from 927 to 15293 individuals 2 as at 9 march 2020 7375 laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 and 366 deaths had been observed in italy so on that date the community quarantine was extended to include all of northern italy until 3 april here we aim to investigate the extent of physical distancing needed to effectively control the outbreak in a lockdown situation in a small size town setting typical of italy we specifically estimate the disease burden and the time required until the quarantine can be lifted by taking into account the time spent by individuals in the public ie outside of the home and the household sizeto account for the importance of stochasticity in individual-based processes within smaller cities and within households we modelled the outbreak progression as a continuous-time markov process specifically by developing a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered seir epidemiological model in the form of a master equation 3-5 supplement 1 the model was parameterised to covid-19 based on published data on incubation time and infectious period 67 we modelled a scenario where 01 of the population in the quarantined town would be in the latent period ie the period of time between the point of infection and the onset of infectiousness at the time of implementing the quarantine policy on 22 february and that all symptomatic cases would have been moved out the locked-down town eg placed in a hospital for care and isolation this corresponds to five latent persons in a city of 5000 persons further we assumed that all persons were isolated after 1 day of symptoms we also assumed a pre-symptomatic period of infectiousness of 1 day of all infected persons we modelled different proportions of asymptomatic infections scenarios of 10 20 or 50 based on our preliminary knowledge on such proportions 89 persons with asymptomatic infections would not be isolated and continue to contribute to transmission parameters are summarised in the tableimportantly the standard reproductive rate 5 equal to the product between contact rate and the probability  of transmission given a contact event was set within a household to   c  21 10 and within public locations in the community to c027 lower than in mainland china or on the cruise ship diamond princess 1011 as population densities in european towns are lower the within-household contact-rate  was thus assumed to be eight times higher than the contact-rate  at public locations we could then apply a quarantine adherence parameter  to model dynamically the amount of time spent in households relative to that in public locations see supplement 1 for a more detailed descriptionwe modelled the effectiveness of quarantine based on the degree of adherence to quarantine measured by the number of hours per person spent in the public per day complete noncompliance to community quarantine corresponds to a reference quarantine level where individuals perform their every-day out-of-household activities ie working shopping socialising as normal for an average 10 hours per day medium adherence to community quarantine restricts every-day out-of-household activities to 50 of normal ie 5 hours a day a complete community quarantine corresponds to no out-of-household activities at all ie 0 hours a day for any degree of quarantine adherence we tested for four different average household sizes i larger average households of six persons ii medium average households of three persons iii small average households of two persons and lastly iv single-person households given that italy had initially implemented a 14-days lockdown with community quarantine in several towns in northern italy we estimated the number of secondary cases including asymptomatic cases in a town of 5000 persons by the end of this time period in relation to the above scenarios figure 1 for any degree of quarantine adherence between 0 and 10 hours figure1a figure 1b and figure 1c provide the expected number of secondary infections over 14 days of lockdown and the number of latent infectious persons and the number of infectious persons respectively at day 14 of lockdown these reported numbers relate to a population where 10 of all infected persons are asymptomatic and would increase for 20 figure 1 df or 50 figure 1 gi asymptomatic casesour model shows how the number of secondary cases within the town increases with the time spent in the public and also with the average household size ie the quarantine unit looking at the extremes for a six-person household and no community quarantine we predicted 43 new infections over the 14 days period in contrast for a single-person household and complete community quarantine no time outside of homes no secondary cases were predicted over the 14 days period the average household size in italy is 258 according to the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd 12 for an average household size of two persons with complete near-complete medium and no community quarantine ie 0 1 5 and 10 hours respectively in the community we predict 3 4 7 and 11 secondary infections during the lockdown with an average three-person household size 7 8 12 and 20 secondary infections are predicted respectively the average italian household size 258 is thus in-between that of a two-person and three-person household size with a six-person average household size 16 19 29 and 43 secondary infections would be predicted to occur over the 14-days period respectivelyin addition our model indicates that the number of secondary latent and infected cases has a linear relationship with the population size of a lockdown region provided same population densities apply between cities in a locked-down area with 50000 people we would expect for an average household size of two persons with complete near-complete medium and no community quarantine 30 40 70 and 110 secondary infections over the 14-days period respectivelythe objective of the lockdown with community quarantine is to contain the outbreak within a manageable duration figure 2 shows the results on lockdown durations required for average household sizes of 1 2 3 and 6 and for various degrees of strictness of quarantine restrictions assuming 10 asymptomatic infections figure 2a for a three-person average household-size situation around 30 days will be a sufficient length under conditions of near-complete community quarantine adherence with only medium adherence a duration of 54 days would be necessary less strict quarantine will result in much longer lockdown periods which then become unfeasible for any society these results are only marginally different to a situation with 50 asymptomatic cases figure 2b in addition the definition to declare an outbreak over requires waiting two times the maximum incubation period after the last case eg 2  14 daysthe lockdown in china with government enforced movement restriction outdoors combined with facility-based case isolation rigorous contact tracing and quarantine of all contacts had a substantial impact on interrupting the chain of human-to-human transmission in wuhan thus effectively containing the outbreak 16 while the outbreak in wuhan involved a highly urbanised setting the current lockdown in italy involves small villages with a different social culture and behaviour and different mechanisms of quarantine enforcement our findings suggest that the degree of quarantine adherence needs to be very high regardless of population size in order to be effective we note however that a less strict community quarantine could still flatten the curve of the outbreak compared to no quarantine 17 in any case quarantine adherence has an important and notable impact on reducing the outbreak but some transmission will still occur within households we showed that in a theoretical scenario of a single-person household with very strict community quarantine measures no secondary infections would occur while a single-person household does not reflect the reality of any society it does suggest that if all cases could be isolated eg moved out of the community the epidemic curve would decline much faster and the lockdown duration could be reduced this means that more efforts need to be done at household level keeping physical distance even within a household combined with wearing face masks and segregated within-household isolation or better all symptomatic cases ideally need to be promptly moved out of the household and isolated in a designated facility prompt testing is therefore needed for timely diagnosis and immediate isolation we also show that a 14-days lockdown period is not sufficient for most scenarios a longer lockdown duration is needed on 8 march italy announced the need to extend the lockdown to include around 16 million people for 25 additional days until 3 april such longer duration should in fact be expected to be required to have a positive impact which is going to be very challenging for affected communities to be supplied in food essential services and to be able to cope psychologically if lockdown is enforced it must be done rigorously to truly interrupt transmission and this would mean near 100 restriction of contacts between persons within the community combined with prompt isolation of new cases less strict quarantine adherence would imply even longer lockdown periods and longer lockdown periods will likely present even greater socioeconomic challenges by implementing the worlds largest lockdown combined with prompt case isolation contact tracing of contacts and with strict enforcement of physical distancing 16 containment of covid-19 in china was shown to be feasible remarkably in south korea the control of the outbreak which had been temporarily lost was regained without lockdown but with rigorous active case finding by liberal testing prompt isolation and by using novel digital technologies to maximise contact tracing and quarantine of all contacts 18 in certain places like taiwan 19 singapore 20 and hong kong a flat epidemic curve was maintained for covid-19 by applying very liberal testing prompt case isolation outside of the community no home isolation even of the mildest cases and technologically enhanced contact tracing very early in the outbreak if the lockdown in italy and meanwhile in many other european countries is aimed at containment close to 100 restriction of contact time within communities combined with prompt case detection and immediate isolation of infected persons need to be achievedthe outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in the republic of korea this year resulted in 186 confirmed patients with 38 deaths 204 and a loss of 03 in the gross domestic product 12 the first case of mers-cov was confirmed on may 20 2015 by the korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc despite efforts by the kcdc to contain the epidemic not all of the 28 first-generation cases infected by the index case were identified in the early phase of the outbreak and thus were followed by the occurrence of 125 second-generation cases and 32 third-generation cases 3at the initial stage of the response monitoring of close contacts focused on healthcare personnel and the patients who shared the same hospital room with the index patient along with the family members who visited the roomif the response had been successful in containing the spread the outbreak could have been ended as hoped on may 28 however another patient who had not been included in the initial group under monitoring was diagnosed with mers-cov infection by this time several other patients among the first-generation cases who were also not included in the monitoring had already been transferred to other hospitals where new outbreaks emerged 13it is worth asking what can be done better in the future to answer this question systematic assessment needs to be performed on the actions taken and the outcomes of such actions with detailed analysis of the data in order to guide such analyses this paper will explore a conceptual framework and suggest a new measure to monitor the adequacy of a public health responsewhen an initial case of mers-cov is confirmed immediate public health responses should include thorough epidemiologic investigation of the case contact monitoring an active search for additional cases and enhanced surveillance 4 contact monitoring often called contact tracing is particularly important for two reasons to find any cases that might have already occurred among the close contacts and to quarantine those who are at high risk of infection to contain further spread over the course of responding to the outbreak in korea a contact tracing procedure was established that included three steps contact identification by investigating the activities of the case and the people around the case contact listing of all who had significant exposure to maintain communication and ensure preventive actions including quarantine and contact follow-up for 14 days on a daily basis to detect any development of symptoms 5 contact tracing may be challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the patients activities challenges in contact tracing have also been addressed for other infectious diseases 67a conceptual framework to describe the contact monitoring process is shown in figure 1 the figure represents a process in which a contact is infected by the index case develops symptoms after an incubation period and obtains a diagnosis after a certain delay monitoring as a function of time t specifically the number of infected cases being monitored at time t mt implies appropriate public health actions such as quarantine of a high risk contact or isolation of a patient for specialized treatment if the infected individual is not identified early enough and monitoring starts only at the time of diagnosis td this patient may have already infected some of the contacts during the delay in detection missing any of them from contact tracing may result in further spread of the disease if monitoring starts soon after the time of symptom onset ts as the patient visits health care facilities there will be shorter delay and smaller number of contacts with a reduced chance of spread if monitoring starts at an even earlier timeas soon as a contact is identified and before any symptoms develop tc there should be little infectivity at this point and no further cases will occur however this approach will involve a greater effort to monitor all the contacts as soon as they are identified regardless of any symptomsquantitative measures can be constructed from figure 1 to represent the characteristics of the process the framework may be applied to a population so that c represents the number of contacts s the number of contacts who developed symptoms and d the number of confirmed casesa traditional measure associated with an epidemic is the secondary attack rate sar the proportion of secondary cases among those exposed which is calculated by dc as shown in figure 1 the sar reflects the transmission risk of the disease assuming all contacts are identified we propose a new measure timely quarantined proportion tqp to represent the proportion of confirmed cases who have been monitored in a timely manner that is before symptom onset this is a simple and straightforward measure that reflects the combined effects of public health responses including early diagnosis contact identification and quarantine tqp ranges between 0 to 1 and is calculated by mtcd figure 1 using the data from the confirmed cases it only takes into account information on whether a confirmed case has been identified before or after symptom onset if the tqp approaches 1 it implies that most cases develop symptoms and become infective while already being monitored and if appropriate quarantined no more contacts should be generated under effective quarantine leading to an end of epidemic if the tqp is low eg 01 nine out of 10 confirmed cases have not been identified until they develop symptoms likely with many contacts and higher chances of further transmissionthe tqp can be used after an outbreak has ended to evaluate the responses to the outbreak perhaps an even more useful application is to monitor the ongoing responses during the epidemic any new confirmed case arising outside of the contact monitoring should trigger an alarm and an expansion in the range of the scope of monitoring sufficient to have included the missed case an overall trend of an increase in the tqp would provide reassurance that the response is reasonably effective and the epidemic will end soonin the korean mers-cov epidemic important super-spreading events occurred a sufficiently high tqp could have prevented many of these events to maintain a high tqp extensive monitoring is needed for a wider range of possible contacts which may be costly a reasonable cost-benefit analysis may be performed by examining the trade-off between the scope of monitoring and the effect of such efforts and the tqp may provide a tool for such an assessment further studies including empirical data analysis are needed to elaborate the characteristics and utility of the tqp we assumed in this paper that tc is the most adequate time for monitoring but this needs to be validated by empirical data any new evidence that supports the presence of infectivity during the incubation period or absence of infectivity in the early symptomatic period needs to be taken into account more generally tqp may be defined for different time points tc ts and td and the effectiveness of quarantine may be compared among the alternativeson 30 january 2020 the cabinet of japan classified coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 as a designated infectious disease that legally allows compulsory hospitalization additionally on 14 february 2020 the cabinet orders cabinet order nos 28 and 29 of 2020 allowed that the government could isolate an asymptomatic carrier with a positive sarscov2 test result by hospitalizing himher in an entrusted medical institution designated for infectious diseaseswe report the case of an asymptomatic patient infected with sarscov2 with abnormal chest computed tomography ct findings who remained reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcrpositive for 24 days she was quarantined in an isolation hospitalon 15 february 2020 a 64yearold asymptomatic woman on board a cruise ship was tested for sarscov2 using rtpcr undertaken with a throat swab sample her husband was diagnosed with laboratoryconfirmed covid19 and transferred to an isolation ward at a healthcare facility although she remained asymptomatic without fever on 20 february 2020 she was diagnosed with sarscov2 infection and was transferred to our hospital for quarantinethe patient had been in her usual health without fever after her husband developed fever approximately 10 days before her current admission her medical history included hypertension her regular medications were amlodipine candesartan hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol on initial examination her blood pressure pulse rate and body temperature were 10857 mmhg 57 bpm and 366c respectively while she was breathing ambient air her respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were 18 breathsmin and 98 respectively physical examination revealed the absence of cough and vesicular sound without crackles based on the patients laboratory test results her white blood cell count and creactive protein level were 7300 cellsl and 041 mgdl respectively table 1 chest xray showed no abnormal findings chest ct revealed patchy groundglass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura on the right lower lobe fig 1the patient was quarantined in a single room with a bathroom she was not allowed to move outside the room she did not develop fever during her hospitalized isolation fig 2 followup with chest xray and chest ct was not carried out ten days after the first day of acquiring a positive rtpcr test result rtpcr was undertaken on nasal swabs every few days following the instructions of the quarantine stationthe first day of continuous negative rtpct test results was 9 march 2020 all the following criteria had to be met so that an asymptomatic patient infected with sarscov2 can be discharged from a hospital i hospital isolation longer than 125 days ii normal temperature lasting longer than 3 days iii absence of respiratory symptoms iv two consecutively negative rtpcr test results separated by at least 12 h as the patient met the criteria for the discontinuation of quarantine in japan on 10 march she was discharged from our hospital on 11 marchthe major finding of the present case indicated that an asymptomatic patient diagnosed with sarscov2 infection remained rtpcrpositive for 24 days and the potential communicable period was 24 days although she was quarantined in an isolation hospital this finding suggests that an asymptomatic patient diagnosed with sarscov2 infection can be an asymptomatic carrier for more than 3 weeksa previous study has shown that sarscov2 infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of a patient who was diagnosed with covid19
1
 however it is still unclear whether asymptomatic individuals are potential sources of sarscov2 infection causing the current outbreak leekha et al revealed that a patient with nonenveloped virus infection who remained pcrpositive was shedding virus as a carrier
2
 this case possibly suggests that asymptomatic patients diagnosed with sarscov2 infection continuously transmit sarscov2 for more than 3 weeksa previous study has indicated that recovered covid19 patients had positive rtpcr test results 513 days after the discontinuation of quarantine although they met the criteria for hospital discharge including the absence of clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities with two negative rtpcr test results
3
 the following are the two possible reasons why recovered covid19 patients still have positive rtpcr test results the patient infects with another type of sarscov2
4
 as the result of inadequate isolation at home or falsenegative rtpcr test results are obtained regardless if continuous sarscov2 infection
5
 is observed as we strictly isolate our patients infected with sarscov2 with or without symptoms under the quarantine act and cabinet order of japan in our hospital the present case indicated that an asymptomatic patient diagnosed with sarscov2 infection could remain rtpcrpositive for more than 3 weekshu et al
6
 reported that 208 and 500 of cases of asymptomatic patients infected with sarscov2 developed symptoms during hospitalization and showed typical ct images with groundglass opacities in the lung respectively in our case report the patient did not develop fever cough or fatigue and there were no abnormalities on chest xray but she had patchy groundglass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura on the right lower lobe we defined the communicable period as the interval from the first day of a positive rtpcr test result to the first day of continuous negative test results
6
 the same study also revealed that the communicable period of sarscov2 infection ranged from 1 to 21 days median 95 days interquartile range 35130 days in the whole cases and the communicable period was 40 days interquartile range 20150 in patients who are asymptomatic with normal chest ct findings
6
 however to the best of our knowledge the communicable period in asymptomatic patients with abnormal chest ct findings was not mentioned in any studies in our case report the patient was asymptomatic with abnormal chest ct findings and the communicable period was 24 days this result suggests that abnormal chest ct findings would prolong the potential communicable period in asymptomatic patients infected with sarscov2although several countries imposed a mandatory 14day period of quarantine on individuals arriving from countries considered highrisk for sarscov2 infection our findings suggest that prolonged period of quarantine might prevent the outbreak of covid19 however a previous study has revealed the negative association between covid19 mortality and healthcare resource availability
7
 in general asymptomatic patients infected with sarscov2 are identified only from systematic screening which includes the assessment of their close contacts with covid19 patients or covid19suspected patients by undertaking chest ct the clinician could identify asymptomatic patients with abnormal chest ct findings as high risk for a prolonged potential communicable periodthe present finding shows that an asymptomatic patient infected with sarscov2 with abnormal chest ct findings remained rtpcrpositive for 24 days and the communicable period might be longer than 3 weeks disregarding healthcare resource availability we could carry out a chest ct scan in order to identify the patient as high risk with a prolonged potential communicable period among asymptomatic patients this finding suggests that a prolonged communicable period even greater than expected in asymptomatic patients infected with sarscov2 with abnormal chest ct findings might cause asymptomatic carrier transmission suggesting that prolonged period of quarantine of at least 4 weeks might prevent the outbreak of covid19approval of the research protocol nainformed consent written informed consent was obtainedregistry and the registration no of the studytrial naanimal studies naconflict of interest none
