answering the initial 20 questions on covid-19 january-february 2020 igor rudan   the history of the genus homo and the dozen human species we know of today through archaeological excavation was determined by the fight against infectious diseases it is likely that the species that are no longer around today are largely extinct due to the spread of infectious diseases 1 we should be happy that we no longer live in the times of great epidemics and pandemics that once decimated our species a huge number of people died during their childhood or youth 1 the most severe mediaeval infections killed up to every third person before the discovery of the microscope people could not even know why it was happening to them no one thought that tiny invisible living microbes could cause these diseases people assumed that some heavenly punishment for their sins had come upon them we should therefore be grateful that we are living in the age of this advancement of science and medicine 1 since 1940 many bacterial diseases have begun to be controlled by antibiotics and since 1960 many viral and bacterial diseases have had vaccines developed for them 1 unfortunately we do not have a vaccine for all infectious diseases as we see in the example of this pandemic new viruses continue to transfer from other species to us because history has not ended with the advent of our generation instead it just continues but this pandemic certainly does not look like it will decimate us it could have because this is already the seventh coronavirus to try to make itself at home within the human population 2 it is trying to adapt to us and use us as its reservoir specifically we exist together with this virus on a small blue-brown planet in a vast dark universe we share it with tens of millions of other species they all strive to barely survive more than 99of all species that have ever existed on earth have failed to survive to this day 1 that is why viruses constantly transfer themselves to new species and thus expand their reservoirs they must choose the winning species because they cannot reproduce on their own their survival depends on the survival of the species that is their reservoir 3 humans are currently an interesting potential viral reservoir we are expanding rapidly in population size  from about a billion-and-a-half individuals we have grown to about seven-and-a-half-billion in the last 130 years alone 1 in doing so we are conquering new territories clearing forests draining wetlands hunting for pleasure and reducing overall biodiversity 1 this is making it increasingly difficult for others to survive while there are more and more of us fortunately for us all the first four human-adapted coronaviruses were merely the cause of common colds 2 no-one considered the four of them a serious threat to public health sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle eastern acute respiratory syndrome were a real surprise for scientists and experts these were further respiratory viruses from the coronavirus family the fifth and sixth that managed to infect humans surprisingly instead of colds they were able to cause very severe fatal pneumonia 2 in addition the death rate among those infected with both diseases was truly frightening sars killed one-in-ten infected while mers killed one-in-three both could have caused a horrible amount of human deaths if they spread to the worlds entire population 2 the coronavirus that caused sars had its reservoir in bats which hibernate in caves in winter this is the time of the year when hardly anyone hunts or consumes bats however sars managed to infect an animal from the cat family a civet from a civet it was then also contracted by a man a farmer in guangdong province in late 2002 sars then spread to more than twenty countries and infected more than 8000 people with every tenth infected person dying from the disease it was the fifth human coronavirus but it was the first to kill humans 2 ten years later in 2012 the mers coronavirus appeared in saudi arabia it was passed on to humans from the camels in the desert it has also spread to more than twenty countries infecting about 2500 people and every third infected person died 2 so both sars and mers had a really scary case-fatality rate the advent of mers showed us that sars was not an isolated incident with a coronavirus that we could just forget about but that coronaviruses have become the most significant potential biological threat to our species if sars or mers had spread around the world and infected billions of people they would have caused a catastrophe unlike any other in the modern history of humans in those two cases we were actually very lucky essentially an entirely new virus that tries to transfer over to the human species can spread among humans in three basic ways each of these three ways informs our strategies for epidemic surveillance and dealing with the epidemic once the virus enters the human body it begins to multiply in the kind of specialised cells that it has the ability to bind to in the case of coronaviruses these are the cells of the respiratory system the virus multiplies in them by hacking their cellular genetic code and using their machinery to build its own proteins 2 this multiplication of the virus eventually destroys the infected cells that is the reason for the eventual development of the symptoms that are characteristic of respiratory infections such as a sore throat and cough in the first mode of the spread the virus will jump from the infected person to unaffected people only after the onset of those symptoms such an epidemic is the easiest to control and contain that is because the sick person is soon confined to bed and no longer leaves home therefore the virus can mainly spread to their household members this also makes it relatively easy to identify everyone who was in contact with the person after the onset of symptoms those people can then be placed in isolation quite easily we were fortunate that both sars and mers spread to other people only after the onset of the symptoms of the disease this is why we were able to suppress the epidemics by isolating those infected and all their contacts after the onset of the symptoms this is quite likely the most important reason why sars and mers did not manage to kill remarkably large number of people 2 it is much more difficult to contain an epidemic if the virus spreads from infected to healthy people during the period of the so-called incubation this period lasts from the entry of the virus into the body until the onset of the first symptoms 3 in such case infected persons can transmit the virus by contact to a significantly larger number of people in the days before they get any symptoms that seems to be the situation with this new covid-19 pandemic but even then it is at least possible for every new patient to determine from whom they contracted the infection namely all newly diagnosed cases had to meet an existing and known case in the past this allows epidemiologists to follow the entire chain of movement of the virus from person to person due to this favourable circumstance intensive isolation measures of all those who were in contact with those already infected can significantly slow down the spread of the virus this was done in wuhan that is why test-trace-isolate as the first line of defence and quarantines as the ultimate response both represent a justified containment strategy when people are infectious for others during incubation period both approaches will slow down and contain the epidemic if applied properly a nightmare scenario for any epidemiologist however is a third possibility for the virus to spread in such a variant people become infected and transmit the virus but they themselves never show any symptoms scientists are currently looking for such possible spreads of contagion with this new covid-19 pandemic that is the reason why such possible persons are occasionally mentioned in the media in high-profile articles namely because of such infected people cases are beginning to emerge among the population that cannot be linked to any of the already infected people when people are circulating in the population without symptoms but passing the virus on to others it is very difficult for epidemiologists to do anything to prevent it from spreading among all humans such an epidemic has the potential to spread over time mainly due to such transmitters or carriers who show no symptoms when something has happened six times within a system that is as complex as the earths ecosystem then it is no surprise that it would also happen for the seventh time another coronavirus is now trying to make itself at home in the human species in this case the primary reservoirs were probably bats again we know this because the genetic sequence of this new coronavirus coincides with that found in hibernating bats in about 96 percent 4 this time instead of a civet a smaller mammal or bird has probably served as coronavirus so-called transitional reservoir it is possible that it was a pangolin because in one of them a coronavirus that matched to the human form by as much as 99 of the sequence was found although this is not completely definite either 5 sequence matching is not the only important factor when it comes to viral jump from animals to humans what is also important is how many individuals in the species that serve as a transitional reservoir are infected and how often the species comes into contact with humans sometimes these factors are more important so they can bridge the gap of 2-3 of the difference in genome sequence because pangolins are a protected species and cannot be eaten thus in the chinese province of hubei in the city of wuhan which has a population of eleven million at around the end of 2019 the number of patients with an unusual and very dangerous type of pneumonia began to increase many of them had in common that they visited a particular fish market it was soon discovered that this infectious disease was spreading very quickly each infected person managed to further infect as many as two to three people such a degree of infectivity is quite high and leads to rapid growth of the epidemic we had the misfortune that the disease caused by the 7th coronavirus  covid-19  apparently manages to spread even during the incubation period possibly even by touch this incubation period lasts about five days on average it would be very tricky if it lasted longer because the novel coronavirus would then have more time to spread from an already infected person to others however an incubation period of up to two weeks is not entirely unusual even rare cases who had incubation period of up to four weeks seem to be possible during some of this time the infected person can spread the virus before the onset of their first symptoms if there are infected people who do not develop symptoms it will be really difficult to contain this pandemic until we develop a vaccine in conclusion infectivity ie the ability to move from the infected to the uninfected seems to be significantly higher in covid-19 than it was with sars and mers as a trade-off we now know that the covid-19 case-fatality rate is significantly lower than that of sars and mers in order to answer this rather complicated question it must first be said that nowadays the registered number of infected persons and the number of deaths can be monitored online 6 when the number of deaths was divided by the confirmed and registered number of infected people at the beginning of the pandemic a figure of about 2 would be obtained 6 from this alone one could apparently conclude that  given that this is an entirely new coronavirus and nobody is immune to it  it will necessarily spread throughout the world and infect us all if it kills 2 percent of all people then it follows that out of a total of 75 billion people about 150 million will necessarily die it is difficult for anyone who is not a specialist in this field to understand how such an outcome can now be prevented because a vaccine against this virus does not yet exist nor do medicines the question of the case-fatality rate among those infected with covid-19 exposed a general lack of epidemiological knowledge among the general public and in the media from the very beginning of this pandemic there were people who claimed that the new coronavirus was a disease milder than even the flu but also those who believed it was significantly more dangerous in recent days this issue has finally caught the attention of all the worlds media as the world health organisation reported that about 34 of those infected with coronavirus have died 7 that sounded terrifying to the media and the public but then the president of the usa mr donald trump also made a public statement saying the number released by the who was wrong he said that hed talked to people who knew something about it and that his impression was that the number was certainly below 1 if not significantly less 8 in my guest appearance on sunday at 2 an influential croatian tv programme on march 1st i made an estimate of the case-fatality rate of 05-1 allowing for the possibility that it could even be smaller 9 namely at this point we do not properly distinguish infection-fatality rate from case-fatality rate so once that insights into seroprevalence become available they may even bring this estimate further down however both president trump and who are actually right each in their own way which shows best how difficult it is for many people to keep track of what is really going on because of their lack of knowledge of the epidemiology in the beginning of every epidemic of a new virus the virus has to jump over from animals to humans and then from humans to humans that can be quite difficult therefore the virus will be more likely to successfully infect those with a weakened immune system who will find it more difficult to reject it because of this the first patients are often people who are either older or already have some underlying illnesses that make them more vulnerable they end up in a hospital where at that point no one suspects that pneumonia that they are experiencing may have an epidemic potential then they infect other hospital patients and some health care professionals the latter can then spread the disease to other patients in the hospital  mainly to those most susceptible such as those ailing or immunocompromised treated for serious illnesses or the elderly this is the reason why the case-fatality rate among all covid-19 patients was initially very high in wuhan and later in italy many people died of covid-19 infections in hospitals and they were mostly very old and sick people 10 in the meantime the virus has started to spread among the general population  in the community and outside of hospitals it has infected many people who are otherwise healthy and had a much better immune response a large number of these people would have thought that they had a cold or the flu and perhaps even a more severe flu they were just resting at home and letting those respiratory infections run their course considering that it was flu season in wuhan at the time of the outbreak and the media reported that a strange epidemic was causing many deaths in wuhans hospitals it is quite likely that many wuhan residents who were infected with the coronavirus stayed home and treated themselves few people would choose to go to the hospital to test whether their flu-like symptoms were caused by the novel coronavirus when a deadly epidemic was spreading there only the few who have struggled with fevers and symptoms for more than eight or nine days sought help from wuhan hospitals in china there is typically no primary health care and family medicine as we know it but there are large hospitals in their huge cities where patients report directly that is the most likely explanation as to why the case-fatality rate among patients at wuhan hospitals at the beginning of the epidemic was so frighteningly high it is not the epidemic seemed even more dangerous at first as it created a great deal of pressure on hospital intensive care units which were unprepared for this infection as a result all severely ill patients could not receive intensive care this further increased the case-fatality rate at the beginning of the epidemic that is why the chinese have started building the two new hospitals they wanted to ensure a sufficient capacity to provide intensive care also they needed to move all those infected with covid-19 away from other seriously ill people who were sick from other diseases and at the highest risk of dying if they became infected based on this it should be understood that the total number of those infected with covid-19 in wuhan could have been much higher than what was confirmed by their health statistics specifically only those with coronaviruses who were eventually admitted to the hospital were confirmed to be infected and were tested for the new virus there they are by no means representative of all those infected with the new coronavirus in wuhan therefore the early estimates of case-fatality rates in wuhan cannot be extrapolated even to all those with confirmed coronavirus infection in wuhan let alone would they be representative of the entire population of wuhan for those reasons it is wrong to look at the number of deaths and the number of confirmed infected cases and divide those two numbers and draw any conclusions 11 if all the reported deaths are divided by the total number of people with confirmed infection then both the numerator and the denominator are wrong when it comes to calculating the actual case-fatality rate even deaths in the numerator would be wrong this is because we monitor the confirmed infected and those who have died in real time a great many infected people have not even had a chance to either recover or die so the number of deaths in the numerator is an underestimate some of the people who are presently in intensive care are expected to die in several days weeks maybe even months this is why the number of deaths that corresponds to the number presently infected will inevitably increase over time therefore some future number of deaths as the numerator will increasingly correspond to the current number of registered infected persons as the denominator as a result the case-fatality rate of deaths among those with confirmed infection will then no longer be 2 or 3 percent but it may increase quite considerably over time  perhaps to 6-7 percent or even more therefore to simply say that about 34 of those confirmed to have been infected so far have died is not really wrong in itself which is what the world health organisation did but it missed explaining that this case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is quite unrepresentative of the mortality rate among all those who were infected 11 the true rate should be much lower it would not surprise me as an epidemiologist if it is up to ten times smaller perhaps even more 11 depending on the actual true number of infected people which should be used as a denominator this could ultimately make covid-19 a less deadly disease even than the common flu given that the virus is new and unknown this is a key question unfortunately the possibility that this virus is quite different from other known viruses must also be allowed it may be that the case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is only 3 to 5 times higher than the infection-fatality rate ie the number of deaths among all infected people so it may not be ten or thirty times higher as many epidemiologists would expect the only thing we can be reasonably sure of is that the number of confirmed infected people was not equal to the number of all infected people in wuhan the current global totals of confirmed infected and fatalities for covid-19 are still largely determined by what happened in wuhan at the beginning of the epidemic this is because about two-thirds of cases worldwide still originate in wuhan to this day 6 that is why i have already explained on sunday at 2 tv programme that the case-fatality rate among those who were confirmed to be infected is not so important it is only a subset of the patients with the most severe symptoms we need to find out what is the case-fatality rate among all infected people however no one can know that at this time because a random sample of at least 100 000 wuhan residents would need to be tested for this then the presence of antibodies against coronaviruses should be detected this is how we measure seroprevalence 3 this would allow us to estimate the number of people in wuhan who got over the infection with the novel coronavirus without ever seeing a doctor so far no one has conducted these studies because the health system was preoccupied with diagnosing and treating the epidemic of covid-19 in hospitals and struggled with it it is now understood that during some days of the wuhan outbreak there were not enough tests for all those who reported to hospitals with symptoms however additional lines of evidence are beginning to emerge the first is the report of an international panel of experts who visited china 12 they looked at the cases across china that were reported after february the 1st at this point the identification of those infected was significantly improved also hospitals were better prepared for the epidemic case-fatality rate of all cases that came under health surveillance and were tested dropped to about 07 12 for anyone who may remain skeptical of chinas data the first reports have recently been provided by south korean authorities that country has really led by example in proactively testing people seeking out all those infected and their contacts isolating them and treating them in their analyses to date case-fatality rate of all infected people has been slightly above 06 13 both of those estimates could still increase albeit not substantially if they also included those who will likely die over time and are currently counted as infected still at such a low case-fatality rate there should not be many additional deaths in fact it is more likely that many infected people remained undiagnosed and that the case-fatality rate is actually even lower 11 another interesting recent new source is the study of more than 1000 hospitalized covid-19 patients who were followed up until the very end of the infection this sample has been collected from more than 500 chinese hospitals and the result was published recently in a leading medical journal 14 this analysis quoted their overall case-fatality rate to be about 14 however it did not include all those infected again but rather those who requested hospital treatment 14 therefore it should still be possible that the infection-fatality rate is at least two to three times smaller among all those who were infected with the novel coronavirus thus it appears that data from very different and increasingly reliable sources are starting to converge to the values which i predicted on sunday at 2 tv show on march 1st ie 05-1 because of all of the above president of the usa donald trump was most likely right to say that this number should be closer to 1 and that he believes that it could even be well below 1 8 everything we know about epidemiology and previous pandemics gives us hope that this should be the case the virus will not succeed in infecting everyone for a number of reasons our first line of defence consists of anti-epidemic measures all those who are experiencing symptoms and may be infected are being tested all their contacts are also tested for the presence of the virus then covid-19 patients and all their contacts are being isolated 15 these measures will significantly slow down the spread of the infectious disease and buy us time it is of utmost importance that the number of patients with covid-19 does not increase too quickly when the new cases emerge more slowly the staff of national health care systems will be able to provide quality care to all patients for the more severe cases they will also offer intensive care in the absence of these measures there would be an exponential increase in the number of infected people this number would soon outgrow the capacity of the health system many people within countries are also protected by their geographical dispersion ie many people live in smaller towns and settlements a large number of them will probably never be exposed to an infected person furthermore as people become infected develop covid-19 and then get well they should become immune to the virus as a result there will be fewer people the virus can still infect at some point the number of susceptible persons that infected people can spread coronavirus to will decrease substantially at some point each infected person will on average pass the virus to less than one susceptible person in time this will eventually limit and stop the epidemic that is the reason we vaccinate even if the virus infects some unvaccinated people it will have very few options for further spread vaccinated people will already be immune to the virus and their bodies will react vigorously if the virus tries to enter 16 many processes in nature are self-limiting in a similar way  forest fires stock market crashes and epidemics furthermore the case-fatality rate should not be directly applicable to the entire population of a country to estimate the possible death toll the first reason is that the virus mainly endangers the elderly whose case-fatality rates are much higher young people and children rarely get unwell and their death rates are much much lower this is why age and sex structure of the population can diminish the potential of the virus to cause a very high number of covid-19 casualties if the population is reasonably young 11 the situation should be taken seriously and people should be cautious but there is no reason to be overly afraid there is especially no reason to panic many people are afraid of this pandemic because they probably think that we are in a completely unfamiliar situation so anything could happen but it is unlikely that much could happen for which science could not find explanations and answers and the epidemiological services could not respond in a timely manner it is unwise for a serious scientist to try to predict the spread of a completely new and unknown virus to the entire human population in the world let alone to predict more specific outcomes still we have in recent weeks collected enough information about the new covid-19 virus for at least some predictions if the new coronavirus spreads across any country over time and manages to circumvent the many prevention measures in place the application of anti-epidemic measures should still limit its casualties to make them at least roughly comparable to the deaths from flu or road accidents in the same period this means that some healthy caution is advisable this caution is reasonable as long as it is on the same level as the fear you may feel when sitting in a car and preparing for a longer trip or when you hear on the news that a more severe form of influenza has arrived but many are wondering why the novel coronavirus attracts such a level of media attention this is because flu has been a well-known disease for decades it comes back every year and we have experience with its manifestations among many millions of patients worldwide we know how to develop vaccines against flu in advance of its season 16 we have even started to produce the first somewhat effective drugs and offer them on the market 17 unlike the flu the new coronavirus is unknown to us we should remain cautious so that we do not get unpleasantly surprised at the same time the most vulnerable among us who are already seriously ill or very old are not vaccinated as is the case with the flu this is why the new disease covid-19 can kill more easily this question has constantly been being raised since the beginning because many are looking at various figures without a deeper understanding of their background and are comparing the incomparable first of all the general public underestimates how serious and dangerous and serious the flu actually is  especially for the most vulnerable the elderly and those who are already ill globally influenza causes between 250 000 and 650 000 deaths annually depending on the strain of the circulating virus 18 different strains can cause milder or more severe symptoms and the virus mutates each year however we try to protect those most vulnerable before the flu season begins by vaccinating them therefore the number of deaths from influenza is reduced by preventive health intervention ie vaccination this cannot be done with the spread of covid-19 this is the first reason why the flu seems less dangerous than covid-19 however it may not be much less dangerous inherently especially during seasons when flu is more severe it is just that we protect the most vulnerable in addition flu vaccinations make it more difficult for it to spread among the population because there are fewer options for it to transfer to the uninfected due to the slower spread new cases emerge more slowly and the health care system has time to deal with them properly especially if they require intensive care another reason is that the number of deaths directly from the flu is several times lower than the number of deaths that are indirectly caused by the flu influenza is often not cited as a direct cause in statistics on the causes of death if it has merely led to the exacerbation of some of the long-present chronic underlying disease these chronic diseases are then cited as the primary cause of death rather than influenza therefore the actual role of influenza in annual mortality is often significantly underestimated it can be several times higher when the causes of death are reclassified at the end of each year based on the increase in deaths from chronic diseases during the flu season the third reason for caution in comparing covid-19 and flu is that we have a much better idea of the total number of people truly infected with the flu than we do about the novel coronavirus this is because influenza is a disease that is typically managed within primary care after which patients are referred to home care only the most serious cases of flu are referred to hospital there is an obligation to report the total number of people infected with influenza in the population to the central registry as well as for sick leave this makes the denominator for case-fatality rate of influenza better known to us than we can estimate it for the novel coronavirus covid-19 has so far been diagnosed and treated exclusively in hospitals where severe cases clustered the early estimates of case-fatality rates for covid-19 included patients suffering from hospital outbreaks which affected the elderly the sick and the immunocompromised this is why those case-fatality rates are hardly comparable to a spread that would occur in the general population from all of this it should be concluded that case-fatality rates from influenza as another very dangerous viral disease have been mathematically reduced compared to the current reports of case-fatality rates for coronaviruses for the three reasons i mentioned the first is because we vaccinate those most vulnerable to the flu the second is that health statistics do not assign the majority of flu deaths to influenza but rather to the exacerbations of pre-existing underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes malignant tumours and others the third is that the denominator we use to calculate case-fatality rates from influenza is much closer to the actual number of those infected while the denominator for coronavirus is not yet known with sufficient certainty from their experience with other respiratory viruses epidemiologists know that all events in hospitals will dramatically over-represent the most vulnerable this is why those case-fatality rates should by no means be applied to the general population however lay members of the public cannot have a good sense of these nuances that is why it is best to avoid comparisons between case-fatality rates for the flu and for the novel coronavirus until we learn more on the seroprevalence of the latter the general public underestimates the risk of influenza for the three reasons mentioned above they are also likely to overestimate the risk of the new coronavirus due to its intense media focus if influenza infections and deaths were monitored in the same way each year the public would realise how dangerous the flu really is and how reasonable it is to be vaccinated against it therefore it still does not seem possible to me at least at this stage of the pandemic to decisively state which of the two diseases is inherently more dangerous to human beings or which will eventually cause more human deaths in 2020 flu will cause fewer deaths because the most vulnerable will be vaccinated and health statistics will not properly attribute many indirect deaths to flu which really caused them covid-19 in turn will cause fewer deaths due to epidemiological surveillance the prevention of its spread and possible strict quarantine it may also have seasonal characteristics and simply disappear with the arrival of late spring when we have no other means of defending ourselves against the new virus all we can really do is retreat indoors and prevent the virus from jumping from infected to healthy individuals too quickly people generally do not have an intuitive sense of exponential growth if each newly infected person infects just one more person each day the number of newly infected people will increase from 2 to 16 during the early phase which does not seem like a big increase a little later it will jump to 1024 infected people from 128 over the next three days and that does not sound so terrible either but there will also come four days in which the number of newly infected people will increase from 100 000 to 800 000 when china realised that the covid-19 epidemic was out of control and that it already entered this explosive phase the authorities immediately cut off wuhan and then fifteen other cities from the rest of the country in addition the authorities ordered that the population within these cut-off areas stay in their apartments and not leave it was an unprecedented measure in human history  tens of millions of people were quarantined for weeks everything stopped 12 however this measure produced excellent results and china could keep its death toll below 5000 although the epidemic caught them unprepared and the virus spread to all chinese provinces a recent report from the world health organisations commission made up of 25 international experts visiting china concluded the following chinas bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic faced with an unknown virus china has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history 12 this may be because on these large ships people are mostly older one should look very closely at the age and gender structure of passengers which would tell us more about the final outcome it is also quite possible that a mutated version of the virus which is somewhat more dangerous could have entered such a pocket such isolated groups can always emerge and the disease may actually run a more severe course there this is possible but not very likely also this case-fatality rate should not be extrapolated to the entire country for the same reason once the virus begins to spread through the entire human species it will continue to mutate it will try to adapt to humans as quickly as possible according to previous epidemiological experiences many of those mutations should make it less dangerous for human health as this would lead to a better adaptation however some random mutations could make it more dangerous to us this is why we need to be on our guard until we get better acquainted with the virus and the pandemic is over it is unlikely that the novel coronavirus will mutate to become significantly more dangerous than it is now but we will only be able to assert that with certainty when the pandemic is over these are very difficult questions to answer until we get more quality data from both countries in principle it is possible that the first entry of the virus into a new country may be through an infected person in whom the virus has mutated into a more severe form if all further cases arise from that mutant then the situation in those countries may initially seem more difficult than elsewhere in population genetics this development is known as the so-called founder effect 19 however patterns of spread and case-fatality rates in both countries may also have many different explanations the reason why the death toll among infected people in italy appears to be very high is because the disease is spreading in small-town hospitals and elderly care homes which were completely unprepared for the epidemic the elderly and infirm are at much greater risk of dying if they become infected case-fatality rates in hospital outbreaks where older sick and immunocompromised people are affected will be much higher than those in the community among younger and healthy people among the first several hundred deaths in italy almost all people were over 60 years of age and had underlying illnesses 20 that is why the case-fatality rate seems so high there but it is not representative of the entire population a harsh flu season would probably have done similar damage if people had not been vaccinated against it but it is also possible that there are many more cases in the population than previously thought because the virus has been spreading for a long time in iran however the situation is unclear so far the most likely explanation too is that there are already significantly more cases of infection among the population than it was thought initially if covid-19 proves to be significantly more dangerous than seasonal influenza then one million deaths worldwide could indeed be expected perhaps significantly more unfortunately such a scenario is still possible in principle with a virus that is new and unknown to us for a variety of reasons because of this all experts in the field including myself are constantly urging people to take caution but without the unnecessary panic in which scenarios could the situation become much more difficult first most epidemiologists based on their experience with previous epidemics and pandemics expect the covid-19 case-fatality rate to fall below 1 when the total death toll is divided by a better estimate of the total number of infected people however the virus is new so it is possible in principle for this specific virus that the number of infected individuals who are not confirmed through testing may not be as large as epidemiologists would expect this would come as a surprise to science and would indicate a different nature of this virus the new coronavirus causing covid-19 is somewhat similar to that caused by sars the sars pathogen however had a much higher case-fatality rate if the total population infected by the novel coronavirus is found to be higher than the registered infected population by only two or three times and not by eg ten times or more then the case-fatality rate of those infected with covid-19 could be significantly higher than the flu combined with the lack of an available vaccine in such a case it would lead to a significantly higher number of deaths than the flu however such an occurrence should still be prevented by measures of isolation of the patients and their contacts as well as by quarantines which are not applied in the case of flu we also hope that with the winter ending and the new seasons arriving seasonality would slow down or completely hinder the further spread of the virus furthermore the virus could spread to infected people in some of its more dangerous forms as well as in milder forms previous experiences with epidemics have shown that mutation into milder forms is more likely but mutation into more dangerous forms or those that are more easily spread is not impossible either 3 in some countries such a variant would increase the case-fatality rate locally compared to other countries or accelerate infection this would put their health systems in a really difficult situation as intensive care units would soon become overburdened with poorer care available case-fatality rate of all those infected would increase further with the likely collapse of part of the health system it is also a very tricky scenario in which many health care professionals would become infected over time in providing care to patients which would make the situation worse therefore currently perhaps the most important citizens of any country are health care professionals who work in hospitals for infectious diseases especially in their intensive care units they should be protected not only from work overload but also from coronavirus infection by their patients with the increasing number of infected people with severe forms of disease the demand for quality intensive care respirators and ecmo devices for extracorporeal oxygen enrichment will become the bottleneck of the health care system the same is true for healthy and well rested doctors and nurses in these wards those parts of the health system should be amplified and further strengthened before they come under increased pressure the worst-case scenario imaginable right now is the entry of some more dangerous mutated version of coronavirus into one of the very poor countries in the world with a dysfunctional health system such countries cannot implement satisfactory quality epidemiological surveillance measures then a more dangerous version of the virus would likely infect a larger percentage of the countrys population relatively quickly panic would ensue probably also a black market for the transport of migrants to other countries then a more severe variant of covid-19 would start to expand uncontrollably and in a whole new way in the event of any of these unfavourable developments all of which are unfortunately possible though not likely an entirely new protection strategy would be required each country will have its own approach when the death toll in each of the affected countries begins to rise so much as to cause fear among the population people will become increasingly willing to undertake much stricter epidemiological measures in such a case an increasing number of countries will resort to a solution that has proven effective in wuhan  ie declaring large very strict quarantines it is essential to buy time in such quarantines so that health systems do not become overburdened we should then anticipate the end of winter and hope that there would be evidence of possible seasonality of this virus it may then begin to spread in a weakened manner or disappear altogether at least until next winter there are at least several reasons for optimism first of all epidemiological surveillance and first lines of defence are currently in place throughout the european union if they work well in most countries it is possible that their outbreaks will be controlled and would not enter a phase of exponential growth in the number of infected cases in the most favourable scenario with this retention this novel coronavirus would show seasonality then it would gradually disappear from circulation among humans with changes in nature characteristic of late spring and summer 3 however this is the most favourable scenario in which the final death toll would be much lower than that already caused by the flu this year however if the front line of defence and epidemiological surveillance is broken through by the virus then governments will resort to strict measures to ban assemblies and organise quarantines as the chinese did several models done in recent weeks indicate that strict quarantine should completely suppress the spread of this coronavirus within up to three months 21 this is exactly what we have already seen in china that is why it seems that one great positive lesson of this pandemic is that humanity today would be able to survive even more dangerous infectious diseases than covid-19 with strict quarantine in which people would remain until scientists developed vaccines in this unusual situation this answer has been revealed to us all finally the tireless work of numerous scientists currently testing over a hundred drugs against this virus as well as at least eleven experimental vaccines should be noted 22 it is not impossible that some existing medicines may show some effect and be repurposed to treat covid-19 also vaccines should become available over time in this unusual situation emergence of an effective drug or a vaccine could make a sudden and important difference we should try to find something good in all the bad things that seem to be happening many people may finally realise how dangerous flu is more of them may start getting vaccinated against it each year the flu kills between 250 000 and 650 000 people worldwide 18 in china which is one-sixth of the worlds population the death toll from covid-19 could be stopped below 5000 by the wuhan quarantine if all other countries could implement anti-epidemic measures like china then the death toll from covid -19 could be at most six times higher ie up to 30 000 that would be ten times fewer deaths than the total number of deaths caused annually by seasonal influenza unfortunately many countries will not be able to follow chinas example closely and will have uncontrolled outbreaks if the warmer season does not stop the spread of the virus furthermore if the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the leadership and public health systems of individual countries function it will be possible to produce performance charts for each country in controlling this new infectious disease given the population size and age structure these will be very important lessons to learn in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerous additionally viruses generally spread by contact this means that it is good to be reminded that hands should be regularly and properly washed during epidemics and touching surfaces that many people touch should be avoided knobs handrails atms shaking hands should also be avoided and we should keep at least two steps away from people who have symptoms of respiratory infections it is also advisable to regularly ventilate all living quarters it is also helpful to strengthen personal immunity with sufficient sleep exercise and good nutrition we all hope at this point march 7 2020 that there would be very few i explained why it is no surprise that after the previous six coronaviruses the seventh has now also managed to infect humans nor is its spread rate a surprise as there are both more and less infectious respiratory viruses 3 it would be somewhat surprising for epidemiologists if the total number of infected people in the population was not significantly higher than the number of registered infected people in such occurrence case-fatality rate would indeed become significantly higher than that of the flu we should continue to await the information of well-conducted studies on this key question perhaps the biggest surprises so far have been related to the clinical course of covid-19 rather than its epidemiology for now clinicians in china have reported that registered infected people report to the hospital rather late on average after as many as 9-12 days of home care 23 this may reflect their fear of being admitted to the hospital during an epidemic but it may also be an interesting feature of an illness with slow development in comparison to other respiratory infections furthermore fever does not appear to always accompany other symptoms of the disease in the first few days making it difficult to identify possibly contagious cases by controlling peoples temperatures 23 the media has also reported on the possible return of the virus after suffering from the infection in some cases 24 for now it is hard to know how common these cases are and how many exceptions there are it is often wise to rest well after many viral respiratory infections to allow the body to recover after the infection has ended it is unknown whether this infection can return if the immune system has not completely removed the virus from the body but with all new and unknown viruses such surprises are possible so one should be careful until the pandemic is over in all the answers provided in this editorial i endeavoured to convey the most likely scientific explanations for the abundant information that is published about covid-19 in the domestic and international media over time some of the likely scientific explanations may need to be modified in the light of new information one should not forget that this is a new and unknown virus therefore surprises and deviations from the expected scenarios are in principle possible that is why i emphasise that caution is needed but not panic the community of scientists and health experts will continue to closely monitor the further development of the pandemic obviously we need to prepare for a very serious flu-like illness against which no-one will be able to be vaccinated against for quite a while therefore elderly people and those with underlying illnesses should be extremely careful because the infection is the most dangerous for them having gained our first knowledge of covid-19 we now need to concentrate on preventing the spread of the virus and buying time until the arrival of warmer days then we might be lucky enough to see the virus slowly disappearing due to seasonality unfortunately we cannot know that right now from everything written here it should be understood that all measures of active searching and the isolation of affected patients and their contacts are justified these also include bans on gathering together larger groups of people as well as possible quarantine if the epidemic starts to elude epidemiological control particularly older people should be looked after because the probability of a bad outcome increases significantly with age in addition those with heart disease diabetes or undergoing cancer treatment should take special care  understanding the covid19 outbreak a comparative data analytics and study anis koubaa  the coronavirus also known as the covid-19  the coronavirus covid-19 outbreak nowadays represents the most critical event worldwide it has been declared by the world health organization who as a global public health emergency by the end of january 2020 and then as a global pandemic in march 2020 the impressive fast spread of the virus is unprecedented and has exceeded all expectations the containment of the virus is increasingly challenging as almost all countries in the world become infected the virus has begun on from wuhan district in china where the first confirmed case was reported to have happened on november 17 2020 2  initially the confirmed cases in china were continually increasing on january 31 the total infections reached a bit less than 10000 confirmed cases with 214 recovered and 213 reported deaths 2 death rate and similar for recovery although the chinese authorities have taken incremental and prompt preventive measures to avoid the exponential outbreak the virus continued to spread not only within chinese borders but also worldwide the virus was transmitted through travelers around the world one of the most dangerous aspects of the coronavirus is that it has an incubation period of 2-14 days during which the patient transmits the virus without having any symptoms all these circumstances have favored the exponential growth of the infection leading to a world health emergency crisis as a consequence after only two months from the official declaration of covid-19 as global public health emergency and despite the numerous exceptional preventive measures that every country has taken to avoid the outbreak the virus has contaminated almost all the world countries figure 1 illustrates the evolution of the number of countries that were affected by the coronavirus outbreak from january 22 until march 26 2020 based on the daily report data provided by johns hopkins university repository 3 it is observed from the figure that the outbreak pick growth started towards the end of february which is almost four weeks since the disease was declared as a global public health emergency besides asia the first continent to be severely affected the outbreak has been more generalizing to other continents during march 2020 putting first europe into a crisis followed by the americas and finally the african countries at the time of writing this paper a total of 173 countries are reported to have confirmed cases with different gravity while only 60 countries had confirmed cases at the end of february 2020 and only 25 countries at the end of january 2020 this means that the increase rate was between 24 to 29 each month almost all countries worldwide are currently infected but the impact of the covid-19 virus has widely varied between the continents regions and countries this represents the motivation of this data analytics study our objective is to unveil the secrets of the covid-19 virus and understand its evolution in the world we aim to know the distribution of confirmed and death cases across the continents regions and countries and the correlation between them furthermore we compare the impact of the the rest of the paper is organized as follows since its spread there have been several initiatives to investigate the impact of covid-19 from the scientific community in 4  the authors have proposed to analyze the use of social media to exchange information about the coronavirus they proposed to identify situational information to investigate the propagation of covid-19 related information in social media they used natural language processing techniques to classify covid-19 information into several types of situational information in 5  the authors develop a predictive model to forecast the propagation of covid-19 in wuhan and its impact on public health by considering the social preventive measures some other researchers like in 6  the authors have analyzed the covid-19 outbreak during its early phases in italy they provided estimates of the reproduction number and serial intervals in 7  the authors investigated the impact of preventive measures such as social distancing lockdown in the containment of the virus outbreak they developed prediction models that forecast how these measures can reduce the mortality impact of aged people the authors of 8 addressed the question about how the virus has spread from the epicenter of wuhan city to the whole world they have also analyzed the impact of preventive measures such as quarantine and city closure in mitigating the adverse impact of the spread the authors have demonstrated visual graphs and developed a mathematical model of the disease transmission pattern in 9  the author has analyzed the virus outbreak in italy based on early data collected to predict the outcome of the process he argued that there is a strong correlation between the situation in italy and that of hubei province some researchers have attempted to use deep learning and artificial intelligence in the context of covid-19 in 10  the authors have proposed covid-net which is a deep convolutional neural network for the detection of covid-19 infection from chest radiography images open-source dataset the dataset contains 5941 chest radiography images of 2839 patient cases in 11  the authors have developed an image processing technique for the detection quantification and tracking of the covid-19 virus they utilized deep neural network models for the classification of suspected covid-19 thoracic ct features using data from 157 patients from the usa and china the classification area under the curve auc of the study was found to be 0996 in 12  the authors investigated drop-weights based bayesian convolutional neural networks bcnn and its effect on improving the performance of the diagnostic of covid-19 chest xray they showed that the uncertainty in prediction is highly correlated with the accuracy of prediction in this paper we propose a detailed data analytics study about the covid-19 virus to understand its impact besides we compare its severity against ebola 2014 mers 2012 and sars 2003 to achieve this objective we have collected data from authentic sources and widely accepted by the scientific community in what follows we present the datasets used in this study we searched for datasets that provide credible data about the covid-19 outbreak the 2019 novel coronavirus covid-19 data repository provided by johns hopkins university 3 is the most comprehensive up-to-date and complete dataset that gives daily reports of the covid-19 outbreak in terms of confirmed cases death cases and recovered cases besides johns hopkins university maintains an active dashboard that reports daily updates of the coronavirus 13  also the same dataset is being extensively used by the data science community of kaggle to develop several analytics notebooks and dashboard about covid-19 14  each row in the covid-19 dataset contains the following relevant data  observation date it represents the date when the corresponding data row was reported  country the country from where the data emerged  confirmed cases the number of covid-19 confirmed cases  death cases the number of covid-19 death cases  recovered cases the number of covid-19 recovered cases in addition to this data we have processed the dataset to add additional information related to  continent the continent of the country related to the collected data we considered five continents including africa the americas north and south asia europe and oceania australia and new zealand  region the region is a level between country and continent we considered the following regions in our study northernsoutherneasternwesternmiddle africa northernsoutherneasternwestern europe northersouthernsouth-easterneasternwestern asia northernsouthcentral america arabic gulf caribbean australia and new zealand melanesia and micronesia the mapping between countries and their corresponding regions and continents was performed using the following csv file 1  we have also collected datasets for the other epidemic diseases namely 16  ebola 2014-2016 outbreak complete dataset 17 all the dataset provides time-series information about confirmed and death cases per country per day during the observation period except the mers dataset that provides only the final statistics of the disease for the confirmed cases no death cases reports we could not find any credible data source for the time series evolution of mers neither the death cases 1 httpswwwkagglecomstatchaityacountry-to-continent we have processed these datasets to clean the data and also add the mapping of the countries to their region and continent to develop region-level and continent-level statistics also we have created an all-in-one dataset with all data combined for comparative purposes in this work we have used tableau professional software to analyze the collected data and develop visualization dashboards about the coronavirus disease our methodology consists in creating descriptive models of the coronavirus outbreak using statistical charts to understand the nature of the spread and its impact we develop our analysis at three levels namely at the country-level at region-level and continent-level each level provides different granularities towards understanding the distribution of the disease around the world the descriptive model provides different types of statistical charts including bar charts geographic maps heat maps box plot and packed bubbles to represent different features of the covid-19 outbreak we also develop some predictive models using linear and polynomial regressions to predict the evolution of the outbreak given the historical data in this study we also compare covid-19 with the other three most critical world epidemic outbreaks namely ebola 2014 mers 2012 and sars 2003 we visualize the difference in terms of the impact of these diseases in terms of confirmed and death cases analyze the characteristic of each disease the lessons learned in this data analytics study serves as a ground for data science for further investigation of the covid-19 epidemic outbreak in this section we will present the results of this data analytics study the dashboards of this study are also available online 1 a how does covid-19 evolve figure 2 depicts the evolution of the covid-19 outbreak in the logarithmic scale during the period from january 22 2020 to march 27 2020 ie two months period let us consider january as the reference month we performed a linear regression analysis on the different curves shown in figure 2  and we determined the confirmedrecovereddeathactive rates during the observation periods these rates are shown in table i  the rates are the slope of the regression lines they are shown as the first parameter between parenthesis in the table below by observing the trend lines of linear regression models on the different curve at each month we conclude the following observation this is also confirmed by the ratio between the recovered rate and the death rate comparing the trend death and the trend of recovered cases it can be observed that the ratio of recovered to death rates was 086 1922 in january 2020 meaning that the death rate was a bit higher in january than the recovered rate however in february 2020 the ratio of recovered to death rates increases to 1333 1373103 and reaches 366 2906792 in march 2020 thus the general trend is that the disease is being more controlled in terms of fatality rates due to increasing emergency procedures that the different countries have implemented the results presented above a coarse grain in the sense that they related a global assessment of the evolution however the evolution of the covid-19 infection depends much on the countries the region and the continent it is therefore important to assess the evolution at these levels to get a better understanding of it figure 4 presents the cumulative confirmedrecovereddeathactive cases reported as of march 27 2020 for the top-10 countries then their regions and continents we observe that in the top-10 countries there are six countries are from europe ie italy spain germany france united kingdom and switzerland three from asia china iran and south korea and the united states of america which recently become top-1 in terms of the number of infections nonetheless the highest death rate is in italy with more than 9000 death cases reported because italy has been severely affected by the virus well before the usa since the end of february however the usa is currently having a death rate of 39 deaths per day whereas it has 0 deaths in february 2020 based on the data collected there is a strongly believed that the covid-19 takes almost one month to transit from one continent to another in the direction from the east to the west since the pick was in china at the end of january then it was in italy south of europe at the end of february and it reached the usa at the end of march where the pick of infection are in new york located at the eastern side of the usa it can be observed in figure 3 that the eastern side of the usa and mainly new york are the most affected considering that it is closer to europe if the trend is the same it will be expected that the west side of the usa will reach its pick by the end of april 2020 in figure 4  it can be observed that europe has the most significant confirmed cases currently and the most severe fatality rates where the maximum reached are the south of europe with more than 14000 death cases among which more than 9000 are located in italy italy is currently having the third of fatalities in the whole world it is also observed that oceania and africa are less affected by the virus as compared to other continents finally the distribution of the different cases is illustrated in the heatmap presented in figure 5  dark colors mean a high concentration of cases and lighter colors mean smaller concentrations of cases in the previous section we have presented a comprehensive analysis of the covid-19 virus and we got a better understanding of how it was evolved and its impact on the country region and continent level in this section we address the question how does covid-19 compare to other epidemics several other epidemics have emerged in the last 20 years in particular severe acute respiratory syndrome sars2003 in 2003 in hong kong the middle east respiratory syndrome mers2012 in saudi arabia and the middle east and ebola 2014 in western african coast namely guinea liberia and sierra leone these three epidemics in addition to covid-19 are the most remarkable world diseases in the last 20 years which we proposed to compare and analyze 1 comparative evolution over time figure 6 presents a dashboard that compares the four epidemic outbreaks on the top we observe the geographic heat map for the four diseases it is visually apparent that covid-19 is the largest outbreak to a considerable extent followed by sar it can be observed that covid-19 is considered as a more acute specie of sars 2003 as they both share some common features including 1 both have started from china 2 they belong to the same family of coronavirus syndrome affecting the respiratory system 3 they have the highest contamination rate as compared to other epidemics based on these observations it seems that the covid-19 containment will take a more extended period for its complete containment as compared to sars 2003 the third row of figure 6 shows the daily confirmed cases for covid-19 ebola 2014 and sars 2003 the trends of covid-19 are exponential whereas the trends of ebola 2014 and sars 2003 are high at the start of disease then start to decrease after two months of the first confirmed cases this shows that the behavior of covid-19 is more aggressive as compared to the other epidemics 2 comparative impact we address the question how do the impacts of the epidemics compare to each other in terms of confirmed cases and death cases figure 7 shows the comparative impact with respect to the confirmed cases and figure 10 shows the comparative impact with respect to the death cases at continent-level region-level and country-level the blue color refers to the covid-19 the red color refers to the ebola 2014 and the yellow color refers to sars 2003 looking at the two figures we can conclude that the covid-19 is exceptionally more aggressive in terms of confirmed cases with more than 90 of the share of the heatmap where it is at around 80 concerning the fatality impact at the country-level the usa has the most significant share of confirmed cases as of march 27 2020 with 1643 followed by italy 1398 then china 1315 we can also observe that the number of confirmed cases of ebola 2014 in sierra leon is similar to the covid-19 spread in south korea and countries in the west of europe namely netherlands belgium and austria regarding the death cases impact it is different from the confirmed cases at continent-level the highest death impact is in europe with 5626 then asia with 1856 with covid-19 which is of the same magnitude as the fatality of ebola 2014 in africa looking at table ii  we can observe a strong correlation between the median age at a continentregion and the fatality rate europe is the oldest of all continents with a median age of 42 has the highest fatality rates mainly in southern and western europe at region-level we observed that the deadly impact of ebola 2014 on western africa is the second most severe after the deadly impact of death in the south of europe at the country-level the impact of covid-19 is the highest in italy followed by the impact of ebola 2014 in in what concerns sars 2003 its fatality rate is much lower than eolba 2014 and covid-19 diseases figure 9 and table 8 present the average confirmeddeath cases per continent for each of the epidemics per continent the results confirm the heatmap and packed bubbles presented above and provide the average distribution of death in each continent the highest average of confirmed cases   highlights an exploratory study of covid-19 misinformation on twitter  a very timely study on misinformation on the covid-19 pandemic  synthesis of social media analytics methods suitable for analysis of the infodemic  explaining what makes covid-19 misinformation distinct from other tweets on covid-19  answering where covid-19 misinformation originates from and how it spreads  first recommendation for social media listeners and managers and crisis managers an exploratory study of covid-19 misinformation on twitter  gautam kishore shahi  anne dirkson tim majchrzak a gautam shahi kishore  although a lot of correct and useful information is shared through channels such as twitter it has also become a home ground for misinformation on covid-19 to tackle this still ongoing infodemic scientific oversight as well as a better understanding by practitioners in crisis management is needed we have conducted an exploratory study into the propagation authors and content of misinformation on twitter around the topic of covid-19 in order to gain early insights into the covid-19 infodemic our results enable us to not only give first indications but also to suggest gaps in the current scientific coverage of the topic moreover we propose actions for authorities to counter misinformation and hints for social media users on how to help stop the spread of misinformation  the covid-19 pandemic is currently spreading across the world at an alarming rate 79  it is considered by many to be the defining global health crisis of our time 66  as who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus proclaimed at the munich security conference on 15 february 2020 were not just fighting an epidemic were fighting an infodemic 82  it has even been claimed that the spread of covid-19 is supported by misinformation 22  the actions of individual citizens guided by the quality of the information they have at hand is crucial to the success of the global response to this health crisis by the 23 april 2020 the international fact checking network ifcn 54 uniting over 100 fact-checking organisations unearthed over 4 000 false claims regarding the pandemic however misinformation does not only contribute to the spread misinformation might bolster fear drive societal disaccord or could even lead to direct damage -for example through ineffective or even directly harmful medical advice or through over-eg hoarding or underreaction eg deliberately engaging in risky behaviour 50  the misinformation is spreading rapidly on social media 82  similar trends were seen during other epidemics such as the ebola 48  yellow fever 47 and zika 45 outbreaks this is a worrying development as even a single exposure to a piece of misinformation increases its perceived accuracy 49  in response to this infodemic the who has set up their own platform mythbusters that refutes misinformation 78 and is urging tech companies to battle fake news on their platforms 7  1 fact-checking organisations  the work presented in this document results from the horizon 2020 marie skodowska-curie project risesma funded by the european commission   corresponding author gautamshahi16gmailcom gk shahi ardirksonliacsleidenunivnl a dirkson timamuiano ta majchrzak orcids 0000-0001-6168-0132 gk shahi 0000-0002-4332-0296 a dirkson 0000-0003-2581-9285 ta majchrzak 1 at the same time the who itself faces criticism regarding how it have united under the ifcn to battle misinformation collaboratively as individual fact-checkers like snopes are being overwhelmed 11  there are many pressing questions in this uphill battle so far four studies have investigated the magnitude or spread of misinformation on twitter regarding the covid-19 pandemic 16 33 21 62  however they either investigated a very small subset of claims 62  manually annotated a small subset of twitter data 33 or used the reliability of cited sources to identify misinformation 21 16  in line with vosoughi et al 77  we believe reliance on reliable sources is problematic as the reliability of news sources is a subject of considerable disagreement in contrast we use the verdicts of professional fact-checking organisations which manually check each claim furthermore none of the previous studies have investigated how the language use of covid-19 misinformation differs from other covid-19 tweets or which twitter accounts are associated with the spreading of covid-19 misinformation although there have already been some indications that bots might be involved 21 19  we thus conduct an exploratory analysis into 1 the twitter accounts behind covid-19 misinformation 2 the propagation of covid-19 misinformation on twitter and 3 the content of incorrect claims on covid-19 that circulate on twitter we decided to work exploratory because too little is known about the topic at hand to tailor either a purely quantitative or a purely qualitative study the exploration of the phenomena with the aim of rapid dissemination of results combined with the demand for academic rigour make our article somewhat uncommon in nature nevertheless our contributions are threefold first we present a synthesis of social media analytics techniques suitable for the analysis of the covid-19 infodemic we believe this to be a starting point for a more structured goaloriented approach to mitigate the crisis on the go -and to learn how to decrease of negative effects from misinformation in future crisis as they unfold second we contribute to handles the crisis among others regarding the dissemination of information from member countries 71  the scientific theory with first insights into how covid-19 misinformation differs from other covid-19 related tweets who it originates from and how it spreadsthis should pose the foundation for drawing a research agenda third we provide a first set of recommendations for practice they ought to directly help social media managers of authorities crisis managers and social media listeners in their work in section 2 we provide the academic context of our work in the field of misinformation detection and propagation in section 4 and 3 we elaborate on our data collection process and methodology respectively we then present experimental result in section 5 followed by discussing these results and providing recommendations for organisations targeting misinformation in section 6 finally we draw a conclusion in section 7 in this section we describe the background of misinformation propagation of misinformation rumours detection and the impact of fact-checking we define misinformation broadly as circulating information that is false 84  commonly it refers specifically to accidentally false information or as a consequence of an honest mistake whereas disinformation refers to deliberately false information 26  in this study we do not make claims about the intent of the purveyors of information whether accidental or malicious in reality claims are not always completely false or true but can be mostly false with elements of truth such claims are coined partially false two examples in this category are images that are miscaptioned and claims omitting necessary background information in this article we compare such claims with completely false claims in order to attain better insight into differences in their spread we believe it may be more challenging for users to recognise claims as false when they contain elements of truth as this has found to be the case even for professional fact-checkers 37  as such it is crucial for fact-checking organisations and governments battling misinformation to better understand how to sustain information sovereignty 41  in an ideal setting people would always check facts and employ scientific methods in a realistic setting they would at least be mainly drawn to information coming from fact-based sources who work ethically and without a hidden agenda authorities such as cities ought to be such sources 42  rumours are circulating pieces of information whose veracity is yet to be determined at time of posting 84  misinformation is essentially a false rumour that has been debunked research on rumours is consequently closely related and the terms are often used interchangeably rumours on social media can be identified through topdown or bottom-up sampling 84  a top-down strategy use rumours which have already been identified and fact-checked to find social media posts related to these rumours this has the disadvantage that rumours that have not been included in the database are missed bottom-sampling strategies have emerged more recently and is aimed at collecting a wider range of rumours often prior to fact-checking this method was first employed by 85  however manual annotation is necessary when using a bottom-up strategy often journalists with expertise in verification are enlisted since crowd-sourcing will lead to credibility perceptions rather than ground truth values the exhaustive verification may be beyond their expertise 84  in this study we employ a top-down sampling strategy relying on the work of on snopescom and over 100 different fact-checking organisations organised under the coro-navirusfacts datoscoronavirus alliance run by the poynter institute we included all misinformation see section 32 around the topic of covid-19 which include a tweet id a similar approach was used by jiang et al 29 with snopescom and politifact and by 77 using six independent fact checking organisations to what extent information goes viral is often modelled using epidemiological models originally designed for biological viruses 23 60  the information is represented as an infectious agent that is spread from infectives to susceptibles with some probability this method was also employed by 16 for the propagation of information to study how infectious information on covid-19 is on twitter they found that the basic reproductive number 0  ie the number of infections due to one infected individual for a given period is between 40 to 51 on twitter indicating a high level of virality of covid-19 information in general 2 additionally they found the overall magnitude of covid-19 misinformation on twitter to be around 11 they also investigated the relative amplification of reliable and unreliable information on twitter and found it to be roughly equal other researchers have modelled information propagation on twitter using the retweet rt trees ie asking who retweets whom various network metrics can then be applied to quantify the spread of information such as the depth number of retweets by unique users over time size number of total users involved or breadth number of users involved as a certain depth 77  these measures can also be considered over time to understand how propagation fluctuates an advantage of this approach is that unlike epidemiological modelling it does not rely on the implicit assumption that propagation is driven largely if not exclusively by peerto-peer spreading 23  however viral spreading is not the only mechanism by which information can spread information can also be spread by broadcasting ie a large number of individuals receive information directly from one source goel et al 23 introduced the measure of structural virality to quantify to what extent propagation relies on both mechanisms previous research on the efficacy of fact-checking reveals the corrections often do not have the desired effect and misinformation resists debunking although the likelihood of sharing does appear to drop after a fact-checker adds a comment revealing this information to be false this effect does not seem to persist on the long run 20  in fact 519 of the re-shares of false rumours occur after this debunking comment this may in part be due to readers not reading all the comments before re-sharing complete retractions of the misinformation are also generally ineffective despite people believing understanding and remembering the retraction 35  social reactance 8 may also play a role here people do not like being told what to think and may reject authoritative retractionsthree factors that do increase their effectiveness are a repetition b warnings at the initial exposure and c corrections that tell an alternate story that does not leave behind an unexplained gap 35  twitter users also engage in debunking rumours overall research supports the idea that the twitter community debunks inaccurate information through self-correction 84 43  however self-correction can be slow to take effect 55 and it appears that in the earlier stages of a rumour circulating twitter users have problems differentiating between true and false rumours 85  this includes users of high reputation such as news organisations who may issue corrective statements at a later date if necessary this underscores the necessity of dealing with newly emerging rumours around crises like the outbreak of covid-19 yet these corrections also do not always have the desired effect fact-checking corrections are most likely to be tweeted by strangers but are more likely to draw user attention and responses when they come from friends 24  although such corrections do elicit more responses from users containing words referring to facts deceit eg fake and doubt there is an increase in the number of swear words 29  too thus on the one hand users appear to understand and possibly believe the rumour is false on the other hand swearing likely indicates backfire 29  an increase in negative emotion is symptomatic of individuals clinging to their own worldview and false beliefs thus corrections have mixed effects that may depend in part on who is issuing the correction in this section we describe the steps involved in the data collection and filtering the tweets for analysis we have used two datasets for our study first one is the tweet which has been mentioned by fact-checker and classified as false or partially false and the second dataset of covid-19 tweets collected from kaggle first we have collected the list of fact checked news articles related to the covid-19 from snopes 64 and poynter 53 from 01-14-2020 to 23-04-2020 we collected 4 468 fact checked articles from snopes and poynter we used beautifulsoup 57 to crawl the content of the news articles and prepared a list of news articles which collected the information like title content of the news article fact checker company location category eg false partially false of fact checked claims an overall workflow for fetching tweets mentioned in the articles on fact checked claims is shown in figure 1  to find the misleading posts on covid-19 on twiter we crawled the content of the news article using beautifulsoup and looked for the article which is referring to twitter in the html dom document object model we looked for all anchor tags a which defines a hyperlink we filter the anchor tag which contains keyword twitter and status because each tweet message is linked with the url uniform resource locator in the form of httpstwittercomstatusesid from the collected url we fetched the id where the id is the unique identifier for each tweet we fetched 473 tweet ids from 4468 news articles tweet from the tweet id generated in the above step we used tweepy 58  a python library for accessing the twitter api using the library we fetched the tweet and its description like createdat like screen name description followers etc to analyse the propagation of misinformation on the twitter we fetched the all the retweet using the python library twarc 68  twarc is a command-line tool for collecting twitter data in json 3 format we gathered the retweet from using the tweet id gathered in the above step during the limitation of the twitter developer account we could collect the retweet from last seven days user account details from the twitter api we also gathered the account information like favourites countnumber of likes gained friends countnumber of accounts followed by the user follower countnumber of followers this account currently has account agenumber of days from account creation date to 31-12-2020 the time when discussion about covid-19 started around the world profile description user location we used these information classifying the popular account bot detection discounting differences in capitalisation our data originally contained 21 different verdict classes provided by the fact-checking organisations ie snopes and over 100 different organisations in the international fact checking network we provide class definition in table 1 an overview of news category that were included or not included in our study along with a categorisation by us and the original and more granular categorisation by fact checkers since each fact-checking organisation has its own set of verdicts eg false that it gives to claims and these have not been normalised by poynter manual normalisation is necessary fol- figure 1  illustration of data collection using the interaction between social media and fact-checking website screenshots from 28 18 lowing the practice of 77  we normalised verdicts by manually mapping them to a score of 1 to 5 1false 2partially false 3mixture 4mostly true 5true based on the definitions provided by the fact-checking organisations as we are specifically interested in misinformation we excluded claims with a score of 3 or lower ie considered only false and partially false category we also excluded claims with verdicts that did not conform to this scale eg sarcasm unproven claims and disputed claims from 473 tweets collected 443 are used for our study -372 false and 71 partially false the data used in our work is available through github 4  we randomly took 2 examples of misinformation in the false and partially false category which are shown in figure 2 and figure 3 respectively there was a rumour that costco had issued a recall of their bath tissues in the fear that the tissues might contain covid-19 in the first tweet 46 a user posted a video related to the fake news of toilet paper the author states that people were running to the store to buy and then return the toilet papers due to the news later the claim was fact-checked by snopes and it was found that the claim wa false and that costco had not announced any such recall 65  there were several other similar fake news regarding similar claims the second tweet 6 was posted by the news company ani that people quarantined from tablighi jamaat 4 misbehaved with the health workers and police staff they are not following the rules of the quarantine centre afp checks 1 it and found that the claim is partially false and the video used in the claim was used from an incident in mumbai during february 2020 different twitter handles circulated this 4 httpsgithubcomgautamshahimisinormationcovid-19 misinformation both claims were retweeted and liked by several users on twitter in order to understand how the misinformation around covid-19 is distinct from the other tweets on this topic we made use of a background corpus of all english covid-19 tweets on the 15th of april 2020 63  it includes tweets with the following hashtags on that day coronavirus coronavirusoutbreak coronaviruspandemic covid19 covid19 epitwitter and ihavecorona the total size of the dataset is 264 893 tweets originally the data contained 26 known languages according to twitter -see figure 4  we use the google translate api 5 to automatically detect the correct language and translate to english hereafter tweets were lowercased and tokenized using nltk 40  emojis were identified using the emoji package 31 and were removed for subsequent analyses mentions and urls were also removed using regular expressions hashtags were not removed as they are often used by twitter users to convey essential information additionally sometimes they are used to replace regular words in the sentence eg i was tested for corona and thus omitting them would remove essential words from the sentence therefore we only remove the  symbol from the hashtags in this section we present our method for analysis and illustration of the extracted data we follow a two-way approach in the first we analyse the details of the user ac- this rating is used with photographs and videos that are real ie not the product partially or wholly of digital manipulation but are nonetheless misleading because they are accompanied by explanatory material that falsely describes their origin context andor meaning y mostly false misleading offers an incorrect impression on some aspects of the science leaves the reader with false understanding of how things work for instance by omitting necessary background context n -unproven this rating indicates that insufficient evidence exists to establish the given claim as true but the claim cannot be definitively proved false this rating typically involves claims for which there is little or no affirmative evidence but for which declaring them to be false would require the difficult if not impossible task of our being able to prove a negative or accurately discern someone elses thoughts and motivations this rating indicates that a claim is derived from content described by its creator andor the wider audience as satire not all content described by its creator or audience as satire necessarily constitutes satire and this rating does not make a distinction between real satire and content that may not be effectively recognized or understood as satire despite being labeled as such n -explanatory explanatory is not a rating for a checked article but an explanation of a fact on its own n -mixture this rating indicates that a claim has significant elements of both truth and falsity to it such that it could not fairly be described by any other rating counts involved in the spread of misinformation and propagation of misinformation false or partially false data in the second we analyse the content with both we investigate the propagation of misinformation on social media in order to gain a better understanding of who is spreading misinformation on twitter we investigated the twitter accounts behind the tweets first we analyse the role of bots in spreading misinformation by using a bot detection api to automatically classify the accounts of authors similarly we analyse whether accounts are brands using an available classifier third we investigate some some characteristics of the accounts that reflect their popularity eg follower count  a twitter bot is a type of bot program which operate a twitter account via the twitter api the pre-programmed bot autonomously performs some work such as tweeting unfollowing re-tweeting liking following or direct messaging other accounts shao et al 61 discussed the role of social bots in spreading the misininformation previous studies show there are several types of bots are involved in social media such as newsbots spambots malicious bot sometimes newsbots or malicious bots are trained to spread the misinformation caldarelli et al 12 discuss the role of bots in twitter propaganda to analyse the role of bots we used the examine each account with a bot detection api 17  social media such as microblogging websites used for sharing information and gathering opinion on the treading topic social media has different types of user organisation celebrity or an ordinary user we consider organisation celebrity as a brand which has a big number of followers and catches more attention public attention the brand uses a more professional way of communication gets more user attention 67 and have high reachability due to bigger follower network and retweet count with a large network a piece of false or partially false information spread faster compared to a normal account we classify the account as a brand or normal users using a modified of twirole 36 a python library we use profile name picture latest tweet and account description to classify the account popular accounts get more attention from users so we analyse the popularity of the account we considered the parameter number of followers verified account twitter gives an option to following a user can follow another user by clicking the follow button and it becomes the followers when a tweet is posted on twitter then it is visible to all of hisher followers twitter verifies the account and after doing a verification twitter provides the user to receive a blue checkmark badge next to your name from 2017 the service is paused by twitter and its limited to only a few accounts chosen by the twitter developer hence the verified account is a kind of authentic account we investigate several characteristics that are associated with popular accounts namely favourites count follower count account age and verified status if a popular user spread false or partially false news then it is more likely to attract more attention from other users compared to the non-popular twitter handle to investigate the diffusion of misinformation on twitter we explore the timeline of retweets and calculate the speed of retweets as a proxy for the speed of propagation a retweet is a re-posting of a tweet which a twitter user can do with or without an additional comment twitter even provides a retweet feature to share the tweet with your follower network quicklyfor our analysis we only considered the retweet of tweet 1 where p s is the propagation speed rc is retweet count per day and n d is the total number of days we calculated the speed of propagation over three different periods the first metric p sa is the average overall propagation speed the speed of retweets from the 1st retweet to the last retweet of a tweet the second metric is the propagation speed during the peak time of the tweet denoted by p spt  after a time being the tweet does not get any retweet but again some days again start getting user attention and retweet so we define the peak time of the tweet as the time in days from the retweet start till retweet goes to zero for the first time the third metric p spcv is the propagation speed calculated during the peak time of crisis ie from 15-03-2020 to 15-04-2020 we decided the peak time according to the timeline propagation of retweets as shown in 5 which is maximum during the mid-march and mid-april in order to attain a better understanding of what misinformation around the topic of covid-19 is circulating on twitter we investigate the content of the tweets due to the relatively small number of partially false claims we combined the data for these analyses first we analyse the most common hashtags and emojis second we investigate the most distinctive terms in our data to gain a better understanding of how covid-19 misinformation differs from other covid-19 related content on twitter to this end we compare our data to a background corpus of all english covid-19 tweets on 1504 see section 34 this enables us to find the most distinctive phrases in our corpus which topics are discussed in misinformation that are not discussed in other covid-19 related tweets these topics may be of special interest as there may be little correct information to balance the misinformation circulating on these topics third we make use of the language used in the circulating misinformation to gauge the emotions and underlying psychological factors authors display in their tweets the latter may be able to give us a first insight into why they are spreading this information again the prevalence of emotional and psychological factors is compared to their prevalence in a background corpus in order to uncover how false tweets differ from the general chatter on covid-19 hashtags are brief keywords or abbreviations prefixed by a  that are used on social media platforms to make tweets more easily searchable 10  hashtags can be considered self-reported topics that the author believes his or her tweet links to emoji are standardised pictographs originally designed to convey emotion between participants in text-based conversation 30  emojis can thus be considered a proxy for self-reported emotions by the author of the tweet we analyse the top 10 hashtags by combining all terms prefixed by a  for  symbols that are stand-alone we take the next unigram to be the hashtag we identify emojis using the package emoji 31  to investigate the most distinctive terms in our data we used the pointwise kullback leibner divergence for informativeness and phraseness klip 72 as presented in 76 6 for unigrams bigrams and trigrams kullbackleibler divergence is a measure from information theory that estimates the difference between two probability distributions the informativeness component kli of klip compares the probability distribution of the background corpus to that of the candidate corpus to estimate the expected loss of information for each term the terms with the largest loss are the most informative the phraseness component klp compares the probability distribution of a candidate multi-word term to the distributions of the single words it contains the terms for which the expected loss of information is largest are those that are the strongest phrases we set the parameter to 08 as recommended for english text determines the relative weight of the informativeness component kli versus the phraseness component klp the emotional and psychological processes of authors can be studied by investigating their language use a well-known method to do so is the linguistic inquiry and word count liwc method 69  we made use of the liwc 2015 version and focused on the categories emotions social processes cognitive processes drives time personal concerns and informal language in short the liwc counts the relative frequency of words relating to these categories based on manually curated word lists all statistical comparisons were done with mann-whitney u tests this section describes the result obtained from our analysis for both 443 tweets which classified as misinformation and 264 893 covid-19 tweets from 443 tweets we filter 375 unique accounts and performed categorisation of account using method mentioned in section 41 the summary of the result obtained is shown in table 2  automation probabilitycap score to classify the bot cap is the probability of the account being a bot according to the model used in the api we choose the cap score of more than 067 we discovered that there are 6 bot accounts out 372 user accounts user ids 1025102081265360896 and 1180933034423529473 for instance are classified as bots brand detection for brand detection we used the twi-role api then categorised the accounts as a brand which has classification score more than of 62 to decode role of the account because we performed a random check and all account which has 62 prediction rate was classified correctly we have got 154 accounts as a brand for instance user id 18815507 is an organisation account while user id 621533 is a representative of the unicef gathered the information about favourite counts gained by the accounts followers count friends accounts and the age of the accounts using the twitter api we represented the median of favourite count account age and followers count as shown in table 2  in this section we describe the propagation of misinformation with timeline analysis and speed of propagation figure 5  we presented our result from january to april one plot for each different month from january to april 2020 the blue colour indicates the propagation of false category and orange colour indicates the partially false category we calculated the number of retweets done in 3 hours for both false and partially false category we plotted the number of retweets for each day from 20-01-2020 to 25-04-2020 we choose 3 hours duration to adjust the count for plotting false and partially false category the timeline analysis of retweet shows that the propagation of misinformationfalse category is faster than the partially false category and spreading of misinformation was more during mid-march to mid-april 2020 the spread of misinformation was at a peak from 16th to 23rd march 2020 the time when covid-19 was spread across the globe the median count of total number retweet of the false and partially false category tweets are 128 and 48 respectively the tweet of false category gets more retweets or likes compare to the partially false which concludes the reachability of fake news is more to the users we calculated the three variant of propagation speed of tweet as discussed in section 42 results for p sa  p spt and p spcv are describe in table 3 we have observed that the speed of propagation is higher for the false category and it was the highest during the peak time of tweet time duration from the beginning to the day tweet not getting new retweet we performed a chi-square test on the propagation speed shown in table 3 the analysis showed that there is a difference in the speed of propagation in tweets between false and partially false by performing x 2 3 n  443  1023 p 001 in particular the propagation speed was maximum during the peak time of the tweet  this section discusses the result obtained after doing the content analysis of tweets discussing false and partially false claims  hashtag analysis as can be seen in figure 6  many of the most commonly used hashtags in covid-19 misinformation concerns the corona virus itself ie coronavirus corona covid19 cov19 and ncov2019 since we did not use any hashtags in the data collection of our corpus of covid-19 misinformation see section 31 this confirms that our method managed to capture misinformation related to the corona crisis additionally the hashtag fakenews stands out the term fake news is widely used to refer to inaccurate information 84 or more specifically to fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organisational process or intent 34  thus it appears that some authors are discrediting information spread by others yet we are unable to determine based on this analysis who they are discrediting furthermore two locations can be discerned from the hashtags both spain and qom the first city of iran to have corona infections seems to be connected to covid-19 misinformation another topic that is reflected in the hashtags is event 201 event201 the bill and melinda gates foundation 25  this event is known to be used as evidence to claim that bill and melinda gates predicted or profited from the coronavirus 52  lastly it appears that some claims concern public applauding of spanish health care workers aplausosolidario these tweets are partially false and are accompanied by videos of the police of madrid applauding health care workers emoji analysis emojis are used on twitter to convey emotions we analysed the most prevalent emojis used by authors of covid-19 misinformation on twitter see figure  7  it appears authors make use of emojis to attract attention to their claim loudspeaker and to convey distrust or dislike down-wards arrow or danger warning sign police light also emojis relating to certain countries ie united states and india are popular moreover authors use emojis to direct attention towards urls pointing finger the party emojis do not appear to be used sarcastically but in reference to actual parties eg carnival in bahia -who will  -url- which refers to a video showing carnival in bahia but of which some claim it shows a gay party in italy shortly before the covid-19 outbreak 2  analysing the most distinctive terms in our corpus compared to a corpus of general covid-19 tweets can reveal which topics are most unique the more unique a topic is to the misinformation corpus the more likely it is that for this topic there is a larger amount of misinformation than correct information circulating on twitter we can see in table 4 which phrases have the highest klip score and thus are most distinct when we compare our corpus to the background corpus of covid-19 tweets first we find that tweets about the amount of corona cases are distinct to this corpus infected person new confirmed cases cases confirm coronavirus tested positive new cases second compared to general covid-19 tweets misinformation more often concerns discrediting information circulating on social media fake news circulating on social media social media an example for this is the following tweet messages being circulated on social media as who protocol for lockdown are baseless and fake who does not have any -url- third information about corona in certain cities of colombia colombia patients bogota medellin is distinct to our corpus of misinformation eg 6 new cases confirm coronavirus in colombia  patients are in bogota medellin and rionegro lastly other phrases that more common in our corpus than in general covid-19 tweets are interferon alpha which refers to the alleged claim that cuba is using interferon alpha as an effective medication against the corona virus aerosol infection  which concerns whether corona is airborne kibundani kwale which refers to an alleged incident in kenya of youth beating up a corona patient and bicentennial bank which refers to the rumours surrounding images of a robbery of this bank in venezuela by bandits 13  to investigate the emotions and psychological processes displayed by authors in their tweets we use the liwc to estimate the relative frequency of words relating to each category 69  liwc is a good proxy for measuring emotions in tweets in a recent study of emotional responses to covid-19 on twitter kleinberg et al 32 found that the measures of the liwc correlate well with self-reported emotional responses to covid-19 we first compared the misinformation on covid-19 with a background corpus of tweets on covid-19 emotions such as anger happiness sadness did not appear to differ figure 8  both positive and negative emotions are significantly less prevalent   0001 and  0002 resp in tweets with covid-19 misinformation than in covid-19 related tweets in general this is also the case for spe- cific negative emotions namely anger   0002 anxiety   001 and sadness   0001 tweets on misinformation are also significantly less likely to discuss family   0007 but not less likely to discuss friends when we consider cognitive processes that can be discerned from language use we see that tweets containing misinformation are significantly less tentative in what they say   0001 they use significantly more language reflecting certainty   0001 they also give less explanatory reasons or causes eg words like because hence  0001 and contain less words relating to discrepancy between present ie what is now and what could be ie what would should or could be   0001 yet tweets with misinformation use more language that reflects differentiation words like but or else   003 in this context this might reflect a differentiation from what others eg traditional media say overall tweets containing covid-19 misinformation are less likely to refer to what drives the authors than covid-19 tweets in general   0001 all drives except risk ie affiliations to others reward achievements and power are significantly less likely to occur   0001 yet words relating to risk eg danger are more frequent   0003 thus authors posting misinformation appear to be significantly more driven by their concerns or preventing others from coming to harm misinformation is also less likely to discuss personal concerns such as work leisure and money all  0001 but also death   0015 the only personal concern that was not significantly less prevalent was religion further covid-19 tweets appear to have a particularly focus on the present covid-19 misinformation seems to also focus on the present but to a significantly lesser degree   0001 whereas the focus on past or future does not differ lastly although both corpora are from twitter the covid-19 tweets containing misinformation use relatively more informal language with more so-called netspeak eg lol and thx   0001 and assent eg ok   0001 although significantly less swear words were used   003 based on our analysis we discuss our findings we first look at lessons learned from using twitter in an ongoing crisis before deriving recommendations for practice we then scrutinise limitations of our work which form the basis for our summary of open questions while conducting this research we encountered a number of issues concerning the use of twitter data to monitor misinformation in an ongoing crisis we wanted to point these out in order to stimulate a discussion on these topics within the scientific community the first issue is that the twitter api severely limits the extent to which the reaction to and propagation of misinformation can be researched after the fact one of the major challenges with collecting twitter data is the fact that the twitter api does not allow for retrieval of tweet replies over 7 days old and limits the retrieval of retweets as it typically takes far longer for a fact-checking organisation to verify or discount a claim this means early replies cannot be retrieved in order to gauge the public reaction before factchecking recently twitter has created a endpoint specifically for retrieving covid-19 related tweets in real-time for researchers 73  although we welcome this development this does not solve the issue at hand although large data sets of covid- 19 twitter data are increasingly being made publicly available 14  as far as we are aware these do not include replies or retweets either the second issue is that there is an inherent tension between the speed at which data analysis can be done to aid practitioners combating misinformation and the magnitude of twitter data that can be included in a crisis where speed is of the essence this is not trivial our data was limited by the number of claims that included a tweet for more on data limitations see section 63 causing a loss of around 90 of the claims we collected from fact-checking websites this problem could be mitigated to some extent by employing similarity matching to map misinformation verified by factchecking organisations to tweets in covid- 19 twitter data 14  however this would be computationally intensive and require the creation of a reliable matching algorithm making this approach far slower moreover automatic methods for creating larger data sets will also lead to more noisy data thus such an approach should rather been seen as complementary to our own probably social media analytics support can draw from lessons learned on crisis management decision making under deep uncertainty 56  eventually more work and a a scientific debate on this topic is necessary additionally as an academic community it is important to explicitly convey what can and what cannot be learned from the data so as to prevent practitioners from drawing unfounded conclusions the other way around we deem it necessary to look over the shoulder over practitioners to learn about their way of handling the dynamics of social media eventually leading to a better theory a third point that must be considered by the academic community researching this subject is the risk of profiling twitter users there have been indications that certain user characteristics such as gender 15 and affiliation with the alt-right community 70 may be related to the likelihood of spreading misinformation systematic analyses of these characteristics could prove valuable to practitioners battling this infodemic but simultaneously raises serious concerns related to discrimination in this article we did not analyse such characteristics but we urge the scientific community to consider how this could be done in an ethical manner better understanding which kind of people create share and succumb to misinformation would much help mitigating their negative influence fourth relying on automatic detection on fact checked articles can lead to false results the method used by fact checkers is often confusing and messy it is a muddle of claims news articles and social media posts additionally each fact checker appears to have its own process of debunking and set of verdicts we even encountered cases where fact checkers discuss multiple claims in one go resulting in additional confusion moreover fact checkers do not always explicitly specify the final verdict or class false or not of the claim for example in a fact check performed by pesa check 51 the claim chinese woman was killed in mom-basa over covid-19 fears is described and the article links various news sources then abruptly in the bottom a tweet message about a mob lynching of a man is embedded and no specification of the class false or not of the article is mentioned research on topic that relate to crisis management offer the chance to not only contribute to the scientific body of knowledge but directly back to the field our findings allow us to draw a first set of recommendations for public authorities and others with an official role in crisis communication ultimately these also could be helpful for all critical users of social media and especially those who seek to debunk misinformation first and rather unsurprisingly closely watching social media is recommended cf eg with 3 80 75  covid-19 has sparked much misinformation and it quickly propagates our work indicates that this is not an ephemeral phenomenon for the john doe user our findings suggest to always be critical even if alleged sources are given and even if tweets are rather old or make reference of old tweets second our results serves as a proof that brands organisations or celebrities are involved in approximately 35 of false category and partially false category of misinformation they either create or circulate misinformation by performing activities such as liking or retweeting this is in line with work by researchers from the queensland university of technology who also found that celebrities are so-called super-spreaders of misinformation in the current crisis 9  thus we recommend close monitoring of celebrities and organisations that have been found to spread misinformation in order to catch misinformation at an early stage for users this means that they should be cautious even if a tweet comes from their favourite celebrity third we recommend close monitoring of tags such as fakenews that are routinely associated with misinformation for twitter users this also means that they have chances to check if a tweet might be misinformation by checking replies to it -these replies being tagged with for instance fakenews would be an indicator of suspicion 7  fourth we advise to particularly study news that are partially false -despite an observed slower propagation it might be more dangerous to those not routinely resorting to information that provides a desired reality rather than facts as mentioned before it may be more challenging for users to recognise claims as false when they contain elements of truth as this has found to be the case even for professional fact-checkers 37  it is still an open question whether there is less partially false than false information circulating on twitter or whether fact checkers are more likely to debunk completely false claims fifthly we recommend authorities to carefully tailor their online responses we found that for spreading fake news emojis are used to appeal to the emotions one the one hand you would rather expect a trusted source to have a neutral non-colloquial tone on the other hand it seems advise able to get to the typical tone in social media eg by also using emojis to some degree we also advise authorities to employ tools of social media analytics this will help them to keep updated on developing misinformation as we found that for example psycho-linguistic analysis can reveal particularities that differ in misinformation compared to the usual talk on social media debunking fake news and keeping information sovereignty is an arms race -using social media analytics to keep pace is therefore advisable in fact we would recommend authorities to employ methods such as the ones discussed in this paper as they work not only expost but also during an ongoing infodemic however owed to the limitation of data analysis and regarding api usage cf with the prior and with the following section we recommend making social media monitoring part of the communication strategy potentially also manually monitoring it this advise in general applies to all twitter users commenting something is like shouting out loudly on a crowded street just that the street is potentially crowded by everyone on the planet with internet access whatever is tweeted might have consequences that are unsought for lastly we recommend to work timely yet calmly and with an eye for the latest developments during our analysis we encountered much bias -not only on twitter but also on media and even in science topics such as the justification of lockdown measurement spark heated scientific debate already and offer much controversy traditional media which supposedly should have well-trained science journalists will cite vague and cautiously phrases ideas from scientific preprints as seeming facts ignoring that that ongoing crisis mandates them to be accessable before peer review acting cautiously on misinformation will not only likely create more misinformation but it may erode trust our final recommendation for officials is thus to be the trusty source in an ocean of potential misinformation these recommendations must not be mistaken for a definitely guidelines let alone a handbook they should offers some initial aid though moreover formulating them supports the identification of research gaps as will be discussed along with the limitations in the following two subsections due to its character as complete yet early research our work is bound to several limitations firstly we are aware that there may be a selection bias in the collection of our data set as we only consider rumours that were eventually investigated by a fact-checking organisation thus our data probably excluded less viral rumours additionally we limited our analysis to twitter based on prior research by 16 that found that out of the mainstream media it was most susceptible to misinformation nonetheless this does limit our coverage of online covid-19 misinformation we are also aware that we introduce another selection bias through our data collection method as we only include rumours for which the fact-checking organisation refers to a specific tweet id in its analysis of the claim furthermore we cannot be certain that this tweet id refers to the tweet spreading misinformation as it could also refer to a later tweet refuting this information or an earlier tweet spreading correct information that was later re-purposed for spreading misinformation two examples of this are 1 carnival in bahia -who will  -url- which refers to a video showing carnival in bahia but of which some claim it shows a gay party in italy shortly before the covid-19 outbreak 2 and 2  i leave a video of what happened yesterday 1103 on a bicentennial bank in merida  yes these are notes which is the correct information for a video from 2011 that was repurposed to wrongly claim that italians were throwing cash away during the corona crisis 13  second our interpretation of both hashtag and emoji usage by authors of misinformation is limited by our lack of knowledge of how the authors intended them both are culturally and contextually bound as well as influenced by age and gender 27 and open to changes in their interpretation over time 44  however none of these limitations impairs the originality and novelty of our work in fact we gave first recommendations for practitioners and are now able to propose directions for future research on the one hand work on misinformation in social media is no new emergence on the other hand the current crisis has made it clear how harmful misinformation is obviously strategies to mitigate the spread of misinformation are needed this leads to open research questions particularly in the light of the limitations of our work open questions can be divided into four categories first techniques tools and theory from social media analytics must be enhanced it should become possible -ideally in an half-or full-automated fashion -to assess the propagation of misinformation understanding where misinformation originates in which networks in circulates how it is spread when it it debunked and what the effects of debunking are ought to be researched in detail as we already set out in this paper it would be ideal to provide as much discriminatory power as possible for example by distinguishing misinformation that is completely and partly false misinformation that is spread intentionally and by accident maybe even with good intention but not knowing better and misinformation that is shared only in silos versus misinformation that leaves such silos and propagates further not only such a typology maybe even taxonomy would make a valuable contribution to theory but also in-depth studies of the propagation by type such insights would also aid fact checkers who would for example learn when it makes sense to debunk facts and whether there is a break even point after which it is justified to invest the effort for debunking second since a holistic approach is necessary to effectively tackle misinformation it is important to investigate how our results -and future results on the propagation of misinformation on twitter -relate to other social media while twitter is attractive for study and important for misinformation due to the brevity and speed other social media should also be researched covid-19 misinformation is not necessarily restricted to a single platform and may thus be spread from one platform to another consequently factchecking organisation may not mention any tweets despite a claim also being present on twitter especially if the origin of the claim was another platform there may be several seeds on twitter as people forward links from other platforms as part of this the spread of fake news through closed groups and messages would make an interesting object of study third the societal consequences of fake news ought to be investigated there is no doubt society is negatively impacted but to which extent these occur whom they affect and how the offline spread of misinformation can be mitigated remain open research questions again achieving high discriminatory power would be much helpful to counter misinformation for example it would be worthwhile to investigate how the diffusion of misinformation about covid-19 differs per country in this regard specifically the relation between trust and misinformation is a topic that requires closer investigation in order for authorities to maintain information sovereignty users -in this case typically citizens -need to trust the authorities such trust may vary widely from country to country in general a high level of trust as achieved in the nordic countries 38 5  should help mitigating misinformation thus a better understanding of how authorities can gain and maintain a high level of trust could greatly benefit effective crisis management fourth researching synergetically between the fields of social media analytics and crisis management could benefit both fields on the one hand social media analytics could benefit from the expertise of crisis managers and researchers in the field of crisis management in order to better interpret their findings and to guide their research into worthwhile directions on the other hand researchers in crisis management could make use of novel findings on the propagation of misinformation during crisis to improve their existing theoretical models in order to provide holistic approaches to information dissemination throughout the crisis crisis management in practice needs a set of guidelines what we provided here is just a starting point an extension requires additional quantitative and especially qualitative research as well as validation by practitioners further collaboration of these fields is necessary in this article we have presented work on covid-19 misinformation on twitter we have analysed tweets that have been fact-checked by using techniques common to social media analytics however we decided for an exploratory approach to cater for the unfolding crisis while this bring severe limitations with it it also allowed us to gain insights otherwise hardly possible therefore we have presented rich results discussed our lessons learned have first recommendations for practitioners and raised many open questions that there are so many questions -and thereby research gaps -is not surprising as the covid-19 crisis is among few stress-like disasters where misinformation is studied in detail 8 -and we are just at the beginning therefore it was our aspiration to contribute to a small degree to mitigating this crisis we hope that our work can stimulate the discussion and lead to discoveries from other researchers that make social media a more reliable data source some of the questions raised will also be on our future agendas we intend to continue the very work of this paper even though in a less exploratory fashion rather we will seek to verify our early findings quantitatively with much larger data sets we will seek collaboration with other partners to gain access to historical twitter data in order to investigate all replies and retweets to the tweets on our corpus this extension should not only cover additional misinformation but also full sets of replies and retweets moreover it would be valuable to longitudinally study how misinformation propagates as the crisis develops regarding covid-19 medical researchers warn of the second wave 81  and maybe consecutive further ones will misinformation also come in waves possibly in conjunction to societal discussion political measurements or other influencing factors besides an extension of the data set our work will be extended methodologically for example we seek to stance detection methods to determine the position of replies towards the claim at the same time we would like to qualitatively explore the rationale behind our observation right as we concluded our work on this article doctors nurses and health expert     sound the alarm over a global infodemic with viral misinformation on social media threatening lives around the world 74  they target tech companies specifically those that run social media platforms we take their letter as encouragement the companies might be able to filter much more misinfomation than they do now but to battle this infodemic much more is needed we hope we could help arming those that seek for

der hurk maarten jensen christian kammler fabian lorig luis ludescher gustavo alexander melchior ren mellema cezara pastrav los vanhee harko verhagen   in order to handle crises like the covid-19 crisis governments and decision makers at all levels are pressed to make decisions in a very short time span based on very limited information rosenbaum 2020 where italy and later spain are criticized by not being quick enough to react on the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus one wonders whether others would have made different decisions at that time although health is considered of the prime importance the interventions from governments are having huge economic impacts and possibly even bigger socio-psychological impact because the incubation time of the coronavirus is around two weeks it will take at least two weeks before the effects of any restriction on movements is visible that is decisions will everytime be two weeks behind the actual situation given this fact many countries made a jump start and installed possibly more severe restrictions than necessary in order to stay ahead of the effect however it also means that in many countries the restrictions will last for several more months extended lockdown and restrictions on movement are leading to social stress and the economic effects will have lasting consequences too it can be expected that people will find unforeseen ways to circumvent the restrictions and there will be increased attempts to violate the restrictions all potentially undoing the effects of the restriction at the same time lockdowns are causing social stress unemployment in several countries is rising at an incredible speed causing even more social unrest this is pushing the timing and type of strategies to exit lockdown and lessen the current restrictions leading many governments to consider the introduction of tracking apps or other means to limit spread once restrictions are partially lifted in order to limit the risks of a second or third pandemic wave how and when should restrictions be lifted is it better to first re-start schools or should transport and work take priority what will be the effect of these strategies on the pandemic but also on the economy and social life of people and countries it is also clear that interests and possibilities are not equal for all countries thus a preliminary lifting of restrictions in one country might adversely affect the spread in the neighbouring countries unless all cross border transport is halted which is almost impossible given the economic and food dependencies between countries worldwide the above considerations make clear that health social-psychological and economical perspectives are tightly coupled and all have a huge influence on the way the society copes with the covid-19 crisis epidemiology the study of the distribution and determinants of diseases in humans is a cornerstone of public health and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare as such it is not strange that during the initial times of the covid-19 pandemic decision makers got their main advice from epidemiologists epidemiology assumes that risk factors are general abstract and difficult for an individual to control however individual behavior has a direct influence on these risks as it became evident in the spread of the coronavirus the study of individual and societal behaviors are therefore necessary to the taken into account next to epidemiological studies in order to be able to understand the combined effect of any policy measure across all aspects this is especially serious if the effects of a restriction or the lifting of a restriction have an effect in one perspective that invalidates the assumptions made from another perspective bnassy-qur et al 2020 there is thus a need for ways to couple the different perspectives and model the interdependencies such that these become visible and understandable this will facilitate balanced decision making where all perspectives can be taken into account tools like the one we propose should thus facilitate the investigation of alternatives and highlight the fundamental choices to be made rather than trying to give one solution in this paper we present assocc agent-based social simulation for the covid-19 crisis an agent-based social simulation tool that supports decision makers gain insights on the possible effects of policies by showing their interdependencies and as such making clear which are the underlying dilemmas that have to be addressed such understanding can lead to more acceptable solutions adapted to the situation of each country and its current socio-economic state and that is sustainable from a long term perspective in the next section we will briefly discuss the current covid-19 crisis situation in sect 3 we will discuss the different perspectives of the consequences of the crisis and show what is needed to connect the different perspectives in sect 4 we describe the agent architecture at the core of the assocc approach which brings together the epidemiologic social and economic perspectives and show how this is implemented in a workable agent architecture that can be used in a social simulation framework in sect 5 we describe the practical application of the social simulation framework assocc by exploring different example scenarios where the different perspectives are combined conclusions are drawn in sect 6 the covid-19 crisis is characterized by very emotional debates and an atmosphere of crisis and panic khosravi 2020 when the pandemic spread from asia to europe it took some time to realise its possible consequences and what would be appropriate measures to prevent these consequences also the usa seemed to ignore what was happening in asia and europe for some time causing a considerable delay in introducing defensive policies when the pandemic finally reached the country in a country like the usa where little social security exists and government is not prepared to invest money in preparing for disasters the societal consequences are possibly even larger than in europe hick et al 2020 this was also one of the lessons learned from the storm katrina executive-office 2006 but the lack of preparedeness still remains in the usa alone already by end march 2020 over 66 million americans had filed for unemployment1 as the number of covid-19 cases increased policies had to be made quickly in order to prevent the rapid spread of the virus resulting in an overload of hospital and ic capacity given the lack of data about the coronavirus at the time of decision making epidemic models based on those modeling earlier influenza epidemics were leading on making decisions there was simply not enough information and not enough possibilities to take more focused measures that would target the right groups and still had the desired effect the early days of the pandemic show a quick change of approaches as more became known about the coronavirus eg the fact that in early stages it was believed that asymptomatic carriers were not able to transmit the virus was influential in initial decisions concerning testing and contact tracing and possibly to the high speed at which the virus spread initially currently many countries have introduced severe movement restrictions and full lockdown policies with potentially huge social and economic consequences however also in these cases it is unclear what are the factors and motivations leading to the policy in fact an initial study by oxford university shows that there is little correlation between the severity of the spread of the coronavirus and the stringency of the policies in place in different countries2 the initial idea was that these measures would last for one or two months however at the moment there are already several countries speaking about a period of several months extending at least until mid 2020 or even longer based on data from previous pandemics initial economic policies were based on the expectation of getting back to normal within a limited amount of time with many governments soldering the costs for the current period it is increasingly clear that impact may be way above what governments can cope with and a new normal economy will need to be found bnassy-qur et al 2020 and above that the international dependencies of the world economy require that countries should coordinate their policies in order to sort maximum effect a thing which is notoriously difficult and has not been improved by the recent attitude of the usa to go for its own interests first and show little solidarity with other countries from a sociological perspective there are not many theories that can be used to predict how the current situation will develop however some principles are clear people have fundamental needs for affiliation and thus need to socialize people can use the internet for some of these needs but physical proximity to other people is a basic need and cannot be withheld for a long period without possibly severe consequences keeping families locked up in their homes for long periods also will create problems of its own even without considering the particular dangers for disfunctional families and domestic violence victims new practices need to be formed where all members of the family will experience less privacy and autonomy and have to adjust their daily practices to accommodate the new situation this is possible for short periods as tensions can be kept in reign however over long periods this might lead to conflicts and consequent problems of distress increased domestic violence suicides etc cluver et al 2020 these experiences might also affect families and society on the long term people will change their behavior permanently to avoid similar situations thus eg people might be less inclined to travel get close to other people etc the effects of these changes can be more subtle but have a long lasting effect on the well being of society from the considerations above may be clear that policies impact epidemics economics and society differently and that a policy that may be beneficial from one perspective may lead to disastrous consequences from another perspective as the crisis progresses and with it its impact increases decision makers need to be aware of the complexity of the combined impact of policies means to support understanding this complexity are sorely needed as are tools that enable the design and analysis of many what-if scenarios and potential outcomes in this section we describe the epidemics economics and social science models that are needed to support decision makers on policies concerning the covid-19 crisis and the complexity of combining these models epidemiological models are dominated by compartmental models of which sir cope et al 2018 or seir formulations are the most commonly used in compartmental models people are divided into compartments as depicted in fig 1 seir shows how people start as being susceptible to a virus s then can become exposed e to the virus from that state they can become infected documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumenti2enddocumenti2 from those states they can still visit a doctor and in the end they are either recovered r or passed away once recovered people can become susceptible again if immunity does not last the spread of the virus is determined by the probabilities with which persons move from one state to the next of course this figure gives a very simple picture of all complexities involved in epidemic models however what is clear from this picture is that people are a kind of passive containers of the virus that can infect others with a probability and can recover and become immune there are no explicit actions that people undertake a model like the above is often combined with a social network model that shows the speed of the spread along certain dimensions when a person gets infected that is central in the network he will spread the virus in all directions and the epidemic spreads quick as well these models are mathematical simplifications of infectious diseases and allow for understanding how different situations may affect the outcome of the epidemic by assuming that every person in the same compartment exhibit the same characteristics that is the model does not consider explicit human behaviour as is also explained in the media nowadays3 or consequences of interventions on actions of people heesterbeek et al 2015 these are either considered outside of the model or are transformed into an estimated effect on the parameters of the seir model that is uniform for all individuals in one compartment eg the effect of closing schools on the spread of the corona virus can be interpreted as a lowering of factor documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentdeltaenddocument in fig 1 meaning a lower number of places where the spread of the virus is possible and thus a lower probability for the virus to spread however what if the consequence of closing schools would be that children are staying with their grandparents or that they are brought together at the homes of other children rotating caring between families in these cases the number of places where the virus can spread may actually increase which might outweigh the effect of closing the schools it is possible to include all these factors in to the probability factor however by doing so we loose the actual causal links between the different factors as these are not explicit part of the model and therefore cannot be easily identified and adjusted in economics there are many competing models and theories without singling out a specific model it can be said that in general economic models have difficulties in times of crisis kirman 2010 colander et al 2009 competing theories focus on different aspects of the economy and make different assumptions about the rest the main issue all models struggle with exactly like epidemiological models is that of human behavior often economic models take a homo economicus view on human behavior a rational individual that always goes for maximum utility or profit in all circumstances however we all know this is not always true as can be easily illustrated by the ultimatum game an experimental economics game in which one player proposes how to divide a sum of money eg 100 dollars with the second party if the second player rejects this division neither gets anything rationally the agent that gets offered should accept any offer as it is more than nothing what he gets when refusing however empirical studies show that people only accept what they perceive as fair offers andersen et al 2011 in our example when more than 30-40 dollars are offered so fairness apparently also is worth something it neatly illustrates that people have more motivations to take actions than mere utility of that action again such motivations and values can be somehow incorporated in economic models but such interpretation is not part of economic theory ie economics does not directly provide an answer on how much fairness is worth this will depend from the context and history eg suppose an agent is pretty fair and offers the other agent 49 dollars and the other agent accepts the next time the same agent offers the other agent 45 but now the other agent refuses due to the fact he feels he will get offered less and less however he might very well have accepted the 45 if it was offered the first time the above is just one example to show that economic models are very good to explain and predict some behavior of people but do not include all motivations and behaviors following from those the third perspective that is relevant for modeling of a pandemic is the social science in particular social network analysis is often used to understand the possible ways a virus might spread firestone et al 2011 nowadays much of the work in this area is related to online social media networks because a lot of data is easily available on such networks however for the spread of a virus the physical social networks between friends family colleagues etc are those of main interest given that there is enough data to construct the physical social networks they are a very good tool to determine which people might potentially be big virus spreaders this can be due to their role eg nurses in elderly care or due to the fact that they have many contacts in different contexts eg sports and culture that are otherwise sparsely connected and they form bridges between densely connected communities however knowing which people or which roles one would like to target for controlling the spread does not mean one can device effective policies eg in the current pandemic it is clear that closing schools as being a possible bridge between communities is acceptable while closing hospitals or elderly care centres is not so again additional aspects have to be included in these models in order to use the theory in practice more semantics for the nodes in the networks are needed as well as what the links between the nodes are constituted of do the links indicate the number of contacts per day can people also change the network based on their perception of a situation ie avoid contacts have different types of contacts establish new contacts etc so where social network analysis looks at people as nodes in a network people are the ones that actually create maintain and change the social network when a government tries to contain the spread of a virus the social networks give a good indication where that might be done most effective but how the people constituting the network will react to the policies is not included in the social network theory thus whether new links will arise bypassing previous links or other persons will take the place of so-called super spreaders cannot be derived from this theory given the above short discussions of the different modeling perspectives of the crisis one can conclude that all perspectives include some assumptions about human behavior in their models however this behavior and especially how people influence each others behavior is not part of any of these models we propose to take the human behavior as the central perspective and use it as a linking pin to connect the different perspectives as illustrated in fig 2 in the next section we will discuss how our agent model from the assocc framework can be used to fulfill this central role to couple the different perspectives the design of the assocc framework is based on the fact that individuals always have to balance their needs over many contexts in the research that we have done in the past twenty years we have come to the the sketch in fig 3 that illustrates how people manage this balancing act in their daily life we assume that people have a value system that is reasonably consistent both over times contexts and domains the value system is based on the schwartz value circumplex schwartz 1994 that is quite universal it depicts a number of basic values that everyone possesses and their relations people differ in how they prioritize values rather than on which values they have although priorities can differ between individuals they are reasonably consistent within cultural groups therefore the values can also be seen as linking individual drivers to the social group we have used this abstract social science framework already in vanhee et al 2011 vanhe 2015 cranefield et al 2017 heidari et al 2018 in order to use it in these simulations we have formalized and extended the framework such that it can be coupled to concrete behaviour preferences in each context thus values give a stable guideline of behavior and they will be kept satisfied to a certain degree whenever possible thus if conservatism is important to a person she will in general direct her behavior to things that will benefit the preservation of the community the second type of drivers of behavior in fig 3 are the motives that all people have in common this is based on the theory of mcclelland 1987 the four basic motives that are distinguished areachievementaffiliationpoweravoidancethe achievement motive drives us to progress from the current situation to something better whatever better might mean the affiliation motive drives us to be together with other people and socialize thus we sometimes do things just to be doing it together with our friends and family the power motive actually does not mean we want power over others but rather that we want to be autonomous ie being able to do tasks without anyones help finally the avoidance motive lets us avoid situations in which we do not know how to behave or what to expect from others each of these motives is active all the time and whenever possible it will drive a concrete behavior thus i might go to my grandparents to ask a question rather than text them just because i want to have a chat the third type of elements that determine behavior are the affordances that a context provides these affordances determine what kind of behavior is available and also what type of behavior is salient eg in a bar one often drinks alcohol even though it is not obligatory it is salient and also afforded easily individuals have to balance between their values their motives and the affordances to determine what behaviour would be more appropriate in each situation as one can imagine this is quite tricky and will take too much time and energy if done in every situation from scratch therefore in human society we have developed social structures to standardize situations and behaviors in order to package certain combinations that will be acceptable and usually good even if not optimal these social constructs are things like norms conventions social practices organizations institutions note that these constructs give general guidelines or defaults of behavior but are no physical restrictions on what is possible implementing this whole architecture would be too inefficient for any social simulation therefore we use this as theoretical starting point but translate it into a simpler model that is more efficient and scalable thus for the assocc simulation framework we fix the the most important aspects of the values and motives described in the above architecture into a set of needs illustrated in the following fig 4 from the figure it can be seen that we model the values and motives as needs that deplete over time if nothing is done to satisfy them the model prevents that an agent will only look at the need with the highest priority and only at other ones when that need is completely satisfied by calibrating the size and threshold and the depletion rate of each need we can calibrate and balance all the needs over a longer period between different contexts and over several domains eg using this model it becomes possible to decide for an individual whether it is more important to work a bit more or go home and be with the family this simple model is the crux behind combining health wealth and social wellbeing in a simulation model fig 5 for our implementation of the covid-19 crisis situation we have selected the following five needs that combine some values and motives that are more salient in the current crisis situationsafety representing the motive of avoidance and the conservation valuesbelonging representing the affiliation motive and the self-transcendence and conservation valuesself-esteem representing the power motive and the self-enhancement valuesautonomy representing the power motive and the value of self-directionsurvival representing the avoidance motive and the conservation valuesthere is not a complete mapping as not all values are of importance given the type of activities and choices that the agents can make moreover the achievement motive is not included explicitly individual agents inherently are driven to take actions because they need to fulfill their needs longer term kinds of achievement like getting educated or getting rich are not important for the purpose of this context some of the needs are subdivided safety has the more concrete needs of food-safety financial-survival risk-avoidance compliance and financial-safety food safety and financial survival represent that individuals have to have enough food and money to survive financial safety means that one has some buffer to pay other than the basic necessities compliance indicates whether complying to norms is important or not risk-avoidance in this context indicates whether people take actions that might get them infected or avoid any of those at all costs given this core model of the agent decision model for behavior we can now describe the actual agent architecture as we have implemented it in assocc we have developed a netlogo simulation consisting of a number between 300 and 2500 of agents that exist in a grid agents can move perceive other agents and decide on their actions based on their individual characteristics and their perception of the environment the environment constrains the physical actions of the agents but can also impose norms and regulations on their behavior eg the agents must follow roads when moving between two places but the environment can also describe rules of engagement such how many agents can occupy a certain location through interaction agents can take over characteristics from the other agents such as becoming infected with the coronavirus or receive information the main components of the simulation areagents representing individuals agents have needs and capabilities but also personal characteristics such as risk aversion or the propensity to follow the law and recommendations from authorities needs include health wealth and belonging capabilities indicate for instance their jobs or family situations agents need a minimum wealth value to survive which they receive by working or subsidies or by living together with a working agent in shops and workplaces agents trade wealth for products and services agents pay tax to a central government that then uses this money for subsidies and the maintenance of public services such as hospitals and schoolsplaces representing homes shops hospitals workplaces schools airports and stations by assigning agents to homes different households can be represented families students rooming together retirement homes three generation households and co-parenting divorced agents the distribution of these households can be set in different combinations to analyse the situation in different cities or countriesglobal functions under this heading we capture the general seir model of the corona virus which is used to give agents the status of infected contagious etc this model also determines the contageousness of places like home transport shops etc based on a factor that represents fixed properties of a place like size time people spend there on average whether it is indoor or outdoor and density how many people are there at the same time under this global functions we also capture economic rules that indicate tax and subsidies from government finally we also include the social networks and groups that exist under this heading the social networks give information about normal behavior and also provide clusters of agents performing activities togetherpolicies describing interventions that can be taken by decision makers for instance social distancing testing or closing of schools and workplaces policies have complex effects for the health wealth and well-being of all agents policies can be extended in many different ways to provide an experimentation environment for decision makersagents can move between places and take the policies into consideration for their reasoning as described in sect 4 agents decisions are based on the container model of needs these needs are satisfied by doing activities and decay over time needs may have different importance to each agent but the overall assumption is that agents will try to satisfy their most important need that is least satisfied at a given moment given the context the context determines which choices are available at any given moment thus eg if agents have to work in a shop they will normally go to work even if the need for safety is high but if they have work that can be done at home as well they have a choice between going to work or staying home to work in that case their need for safety can make them decide to stay home most needs are composite for instance safety is built up of food-safety financial-survival risk-avoidance and compliance listed here in order of importance ie relevance to the agents direct need to survive eg the safety need is defined as the minimum of the first two and a weighted mean of the rest where the weights are the importances assigned to each subneed here the satisfaction of food-safety is defined as having enough essential resources stocked up at home such as food and medicine measured over a two week period ie the need is fully satisfied if the agent has enough supplies for the coming two weeks and decays from there the only way to increase this need is by going shopping for essential resources however going shopping ie leaving the house may conflict with the need for safety so the agent will need to balance these two needs in its decision to go shopping agents with a high level of risk-avoidance will be more likely to try to avoid the disease and thus want to stay away from large groups of people the need for belonging includes conformity ie the need to comply with norms and regulations which is satisfied by taking actions that conform to the rules such as staying inside during lockdown or going to school or work if that is requested from them conformity can have a negative value in the case that the agent decides to break a rule the need for autonomy is satisfied when agents are able to follow their own plans agents satisfy their need for autonomy when they are able to make an autonomous decision lockdown policies block many of these actions which means that when an agent reaches a too low level of autonomy it may decide to break lockdown however to regulate this effect and not provide agents with too strong incentives to break the lockdown the compliance is used as a regulating factor the need for self-esteem is satisfied when the agent believes that its actions are accepted and even followed by other agents finally the need for survival represents an agents need to rest if it is sick this need can be satisfied by resting at home if the agent believes it is sick and depletes if it does anything else while it believes to be sick under this need we also fitted the conformity need people will conform to what other people do if they are uncertain about the context and which action is the best to take conforming to others is safe as it is usually good to do what others do thus it contributes to social survival as can be seen above agents in assocc have a wide range of needs they range over the social health and economic dimensions of society and can therefore also show how interventions intended to remedy eg the spread of the virus can influence other dimensions and due to these dependencies do not have the intended effect in the next section we describe some examples of scenarios we have simulated in assocc to illustrate the use the range of possible scenarios and importance of the approach in fig 6 the results of closing the schools and working at home are shown we show a graph with the health status of the population and the activities taking place when only the schools are closed the left two graphs some people are forced to work at home too as they have to take care of their children the scale on the horizontal axis denotes time four ticks make up one day so the runs cover about 24 months depending on whether any differences still appear after 2 months the vertical axes show the number of agents which is around 330 this number can vary slightly as it depends on the household distribution and the way the households are generated the results are based on 40 runs although the number of people at home is of course much higher than people in other places the green line in the bottom plots compared to the baseline simulation which implies less spreading of the virus the peak of infected people is higher around 210 and 215 resp the peak is reached around the same time ie 40 ticks or 10 days the number of people that died is 80 and 78 resp this means that the differences are not significant we also see a difference in people going to non-essential shops the black line in the activity graphs the number of people at non-essential shops on the right where the last two peaks saturday and sunday show that people go out shopping in the weekend the above findings show that the measures do not lower the peak as expected but even increase that peak this can be explained by the fact that more people want to leave the house during the weekend as they have worked at home during the week with less social interaction at these public places typically people of different communities are gathered while at work or school more or less the same group of people are present thus closing the schools only increases the spreading of the virus thus without additional restrictions like social distancing and closing restaurants the effect of working at home or closing schools is surpassed by the side effect namely people wanting to go out the covid-19 pandemic has severe medical and social consequences but it has vast economic consequences as well a recession is expected and predictions show that it can be way more severe than the banking crisis 2009 recession thus governments are trying to minimize the economic impact of the pandemic and try to minimize the financial issues people and companies have by giving massive financial support also once the pandemic has been dealt with restarting the economy is a big challenge as many people have lost their jobs and economic activity has slowed to a minimum with this scenario we demonstrate the relation between the pandemic health measures and the economy this shows the complex and interconnected nature of the situation in many countries the government has locked down the country and closed down business operations this cuts the cycle of income of companies and subsequently either people become unemployed or governments temporarily take over paying the wages of the employees in this scenario we show two different situations the first shows what happens with a lockdown and no government support the second shows the situation when government supports companies by taking over wages when government closes all non-essential shops to prevent spread and orders a lockdown the curve of the pandemic is really flattened within the time span of our simulation we see that we are still not experiencing many infections and hardly any deaths note that lockdown here starts when only one person was infected so much earlier than in real life people are almost all working at home the essential shops seem to be doing well this can be seen as hoarding behavior of people that want to make sure they have enough essential products and have still money to buy things they do not buy anything non-essential as those shops are all closed and we have no on-line shopping in our simulation the non-essential shops do not go bankrupt in the simulation because we did assume here that they could postpone all fixed costs like loans rent etc if these fixed costs are taking into account all the non-essential shops will go bankrupt pretty quick without government intervention the velocity of the money flowing through the system decreases due to the lockdown fig 7 in the second situation government takes over wages from all people working in the non-essential shops overall we see capital increasing slightly this can be explained due to the fact that people cannot spend money on non-essential products and leisure activities going to cafes sport events etc while the number of unemployednon-payed people is relatively small fig 8 the economic activity is kept up by the government however the government reserves are quickly depleting as less tax is coming in and more subsidies are paid this situation is not sustainable in this paper we have shown that in crises like the covid-19 crisis the interventions of government have to be made quick and are often based on too little information and only partial insights of the consequences of these interventions in most cases the health perspective is the leading perspective to inform government decisions however the models used by epidemiologists lack the part on human behavior therefore they have to translate government interventions and the expected reactions from citizens to parameters into parameters of the epidemic model without being able to check for interdependencies we have shown how the assocc platform can be a good addition to current epidemiological and economic models by putting the human behavior model central and from that core connect the health wealth and social perspectives in general there are several advantages of using an agent based tool like assocc first a tool like assocc explicitly avoids providing detailed predictions but rather supports investigating the consequences in all perspectives from government policies by comparing variations of policies like government subsidizing people or not in the economic scenario it becomes clear what are the consequences and which are the fundamental choices that have to be made taking this stance avoids politicians being able to just blame the model for giving a wrong advice technology should not give single solutions to decision makers but should support the decision makers to have a good insight in the consequences of their decisions and which are the fundamental priorities that have to be weighed eg the joy of life of elderly people against the risks of meeting their family and becoming infected or the risk of contagion happening through schools vs the social disruption when schools are closed due to the agent based nature it is also possible to explain where results come from eg closing schools might not have any positive effect on the spread of the virus due to all kinds of side effects in the scenario we could see that people were going more to non-essential shops in the weekend because they had to be more at home to take care of the children during the week their need for belonging went up and going to the shops was the only option left as other leisure places were closed tracing this behavior back in this way helps to explain what is the basic cause and where in the chain something can be done if one wants to avoid this behavior each of the steps in these causal chains is based on a solid theory social-psychological economic or epidemiological in our case and thus can be checked both on its plausibility as well as on its theoretical foundation using the agent based models makes it easier to adjust parameters in the simulation based on differences in demographics and cultural dimensions in different countries but also in different regions or even neighbourhoods in big towns therefore more finegrained analysis can be performed on the impact of government interventions on different parts of the country eg rich and poor neighbourhoods or urban and rural areas can be affected in different ways by the same measure finally we should stress that we do not claim that agent based models like used in assocc should replace domain specific models actually one could use assocc to simulate intervention scenarios to study the human reactions to it and the consequences having a good insight in these dependencies one can feed the domain specific models with better information to make precize optimizations or predictions for the effect of that intervention thus in this way the strength of the different types of models can be combined rather than seen as competing supplementary information the full project is available at httpssimassoccorg the netlogo and gui code is

talukder md iftekharul islam sakib zahidur talukder   today the coronavirus epidemic is overtaking areas of asia europe and north america in full intensity with the usa reporting more coronavirus-related deaths than any other country officially 1  everyday life has been impacted by the proliferation of virus from social networks 2 3 4 5 6 to e-governance 7 8  from digital automation 9 10 and cyber security 11 12 to cellular networks 13  during the global coronavirus epidemic many high-tech approaches are placed in motion to help mankind combat the virus the entire world is coming to a standstill as policymakers are urging people to stay indoors even using coercion it would not have been possible to separate ourselves from civilization if people had no access to modern technology digital media services have provided content for hundreds of millions of users a vast amount of individuals have begun telecommuting to schools and jobs and the usage of safety devices has grown dramatically when millions more patients are diagnosed with telehealth applications -the last thing politicians across the globe expected was to see citizens with extremely infectious illness symptoms nevertheless the use of such technologies often poses several questions regarding privacy 14  israel also agreed to use the cellphone data gathered anonymously typically meant for counter-terrorism use the information was used to identify people who crossed paths with persons bearing covid-19 a combination of geotracking and ai technology has allowed the israeli government to recognize individuals who should be quarantined because of their potential coronavirus exposure when the coronavirus pandemic spread across the globe countries leveraged massive monitoring networks to track the transmission of the virus and pressured policymakers around the world to consider the trade-offs with millions of people in public health and safety government agencies in south korea are harnessing surveillance camera video mobile location data and credit card payment records to help monitor recent coronavirus patient movements and create virus transmission chains iran launched an app promising to cure covid-19 today much of what it does is collect millions of peoples location info effectively serving as a way for the government to monitor its population in real time the us aims to counter coronavirus through mobile location info the white house and the centers for disease control and prevention are calling on facebook google and other tech giants to give them greater access to american smartphone location data to help international journal on cryptography and information security ijcis vol 10 no3 jul 2020 them fight the spread of coronavirus according to four people at the companies involved in the discussions who are not authorized to speak publicly about it advocates for privacy are concerned although some sources emphasized that the effort would be anonymized and the government would not have access to the locations of specific individuals federal health authorities say they will use confidential aggregated consumer data obtained by the internet firms to monitor the distribution of the virus -a technique known as syndromic surveillance and avoid more outbreaks they might still use the data to see if people were using social distancing in china south korea and israel similar and more extreme monitoring techniques have also been used the moves set off warning bells for privacy activists who are fearful of what the government might do with consumer data facebook also offers anonymized data to health experts and charities in certain countries to help deter epidemic efforts yet other reports cautioned that supplying government with greater access to anonymized location data might now contribute to the downline degradation of individual privacy especially if the government begins asking for non-anonymized data the data-protection consequences of efforts to monitor coronavirus dissemination have been increasingly evident in asia when this economic epidemic is fully under control it is possible that china will be commended for the scientific success with which it ultimately succeeded in preventing an outbreak that could have infected billions yet it sure does come at a expense there are examples of epidemic maps displaying the exact position in real time of reported and alleged cases so people can stop traveling to the same locations theres also an app that lets people communicate with someone who acquired the virus whether theyve been on a train or plane such interventions are also successful but they involve the vast processing and distribution of accurate medical data similarly creative approaches to addressing the problem have been introduced in korea and singapore and ultimately given the broad and apparent intrusions to privacy they seem to have been successful nowhere in the world the right to privacy is an absolute right laws on privacy and data security can not and do not mess with a common-sense solution to saving lives of this reason all these systems allow the use and sharing of data for that purpose where appropriate around the same time it is not possible to ignore the criteria laid down in the legislation-except in times of crisis disproportionate decisions and measures are often the result of knee-jerk reactions and everybody is at risk when that happens on a global scale-no matter how often you wash your hands international journal on cryptography and information security ijcis vol 10 no3 jul 2020 our contributions this paper presents the following contributions  survey on privacy issues during pandemic this paper provides the first comprehensive survey on various privacy issues on various fronts that are taking place during the pandemic to the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive survey that addresses privacy issues from all sectors from surveillance to medical data  privacy principles recommendation this paper presents various privacy principles recommendation for monitoring app and device designers that include privacyconscious mechanisms aggregated anonymized data and volunteered data  guideline for post-pandemic privacy restoration finally this paper presents a comprehensive guideline to ensure post-pandemic privacy restoration that would be beneficial for the public and private sectors alike the rest of the paper is organized as follows section ii describes the privacy issues section iii describes the recommended privacy principles section iv discusses the post-pandemic privacy restoration finally section v concludes the paper with a highlight on the scope of future work deutsche telekom europes biggest telco firm announced that it is turning over 5 gb of consumer data to the german robert koch institute to counter coronavirus transmission covid-19 the institute would use the anonymized data to monitor the activities of the general public to forecast how the virus spreads and to help address questions about the social distance effectiveness similarly vodafone has published a five-point program in which it promises that private consumer data will now be transferred to lombardy italy and austrias largest telco a1 has contributed the data as well critics point out that other countries are already making more authoritarian use of mobile-phone data these data are used in china israel and south korea to monitor the connections of contaminated locals and to ensure quarantine is enforced critics also question the legality of the donation and whether the data privacy of customers has been respected -and whether the donation of data would be useful although gps-related data such as that international journal on cryptography and information security ijcis vol 10 no3 jul 2020 obtained by google can be very reliable cellular providers mobile phone tracking data still use cell phone towers to locate the customers 15  its accuracy ranges from 25 to 100 metres that might not be particularly helpful in big cities while european officials assured data-privacy advocates of not tracking individuals consent and transparency issues were not eased much information is associated with the mobility data which could be worse with the lack of transparency of the telecom companies that have long been collecting and selling geolocation data of their customers 16 17  in the us the government is currently engaged in talks with tech giants such as google apple and facebook about how data from their customers could be used to prevent covid-19 from spreading a medical school in hanover in germany is collaborating with local mapping firm ubilabs to develop an app that will enable individualized monitoring of infections a person who has tested positive for covid-19 voluntarily donates the gps data 18 from their phone with this app named geohealth and expected to be available in a few weeks time many users would be able to say whether they are at the same location at the same time as the infected person if the users get a red signal theyre told to go and get checked warning them they were really close by recently the government of the autonomous spanish territory of catalonia has released its own related app named stop covid19 cat anonymous data can also be quickly re-identified which they claim raises fear in cases like this this and the absence of a system has in the past been a significant obstacle to the use of evidence in a humanitarian situation as happened during ebola the oxford university academics and the health services digital innovation unit in uk also designed a contact-tracing app see fig 1 that takes into account different age groups household structures and movement patterns in an effort to try to maximise the number of people who could be allowed to freely move 19  when south korea is fighting a snowballing number of covid-19 incidents the government is letting people know if they are in a patients area but the volume of information has led to some awkward moments and there is just as much fear of social stigma as of illness such warnings arrive all day all day asking people where an infected person was people may also visit the ministry of health and welfare website for information when online searching for the case number of a virus victim the associated inquiries include contact information name photo father or even adultery there are no names or addresses given but certain people nevertheless tend to connect the dots and recognise individuals and even though patients arent specifically known online they risk criticism or mockery doctors warn that pursuing patients online may have very serious consequences malicious online remarks have long been a issue in south korea and have led to suicide in some situations another known thing is elevated levels of anxiety due to online criticism and endured sleep deprivation because the virus spreads quickly the knowledge they need to defend themselves and others will be made available to the public the good news is however that data security agencies from around the world are coming in to provide their advice and feedback on data management practices and on fighting coronavirus the contrasting perspective among the opinions of data protection agencies -who may be categorized as punitive impartial or acceptable -indicates that the best response would be to pursue a reasonable middle ground that does not neglect the enforcement of basic standards of privacy this is also in accordance with the announcement released on march 16 by the european data protection board edpb stressing that data security laws such as gdpr do not obstruct steps taken to counter the coronavirus pandemic  the coronavirus epidemic is forcing the us government to relax one of its few laws relating to data protection the health insurance portability and accountability act is one of the protections against the misuse of patient records but the health and human services administration said it would waive fines for suspected hipaa breaches which is very common 20  safety of students or other individuals ferpa requires school agencies and organizations to reveal information from educational documents without permission until all piis have been deleted provided that the organization or institution has made a fair decision that the students name is not publicly identifiable whether by single or multiple releases and taking into account all fairly available information therefore reporting that a student in a certain class or grade level is missing would be troublesome because for example there is a directory containing the names of every student in that class or grade many known attacks have occurred and can de-anonymize individual data from the anonymized data collection there is an exception to the general consent requirement of ferpa health or safety emergency which is limited in time to the emergency period and generally does not allow for a blanket release of pii from student education records however the concern is that while educational agencies and institutions may frequently address threats to the health or safety of students or other persons in a manner that does not identify a particular student ferpa allows educational agencies and institutions to disclose pii from student education records to relevant parties in connection with an emergency without prior written consent usually law enforcement officers public health authorities qualified medical agency or institution will have sufficient services to sustain the situation because on the basis of the knowledge available at the time of the assessment of the educational agency or institution there is a reasonable reason for such a decision therefore there is a substantial possibility that certain school organizations and institutions may report to the department of public health the names addresses and telephone numbers of missing students without permission so that the department of health can contact their parents to determine the illnesses of the children there is also a possibility that a single pupil teacher or other school official may be reported by the school as requiring covid-19 for parents of other students in the organization as a result of its coronavirus-fuelled market expansion teleconferencing firm zoom is attracting attention internet-rights activists claim they want zoom which was flooded by demand after the ebola epidemic to begin releasing a transparency report outlining its data protection policies and how it responds to governments trying to clamp down on freedom of speech the growing need for their services makes zoom a priority for third parties ranging from law enforcement to sophisticated hackers targeting confidential data and sensitive data meanwhile such gatherings will attract attention from regulators trying to regulate the flow of information as people assemble online while the video conference software zoom is gaining traction as a result of increased usage of the coronavirus pandemic federal authorities are now warning of a new possible risk for privacy and security dubbed zoombombing the phrase applies to a type of cyber abuse reported by some users of the app who have claimed that some of their calls have been intercepted by anonymous persons and trolls speculating hatefully zoombombing has become so widespread that the fbi has released a news release reminding people of the threat which includes profanity pornography and swastika these zoombombing incidents occur as zoom faces criticism for its privacy rights which customers technology experts and us regulators have flagged in their efforts to mitigate these threats from potential hackers or trolls federal officials urged those using video teleconferencing apps to exercise due diligence and caution malicious cyber actors are searching for ways to manipulate flaws in telework applications to obtain private information eavesdrop on phone calls or simulated meetings or conduct other disruptive activities international journal on cryptography and information security ijcis vol 10 no3 jul 2020 coronavirus is a particularly infectious illness and will most likely entail the monitoring of to exchange confidential data with organizations such as clearview ai and palantir in times of disaster such as a terrorist incident or pandemic provides short-term gains but has an disturbing effect on data protection even after the emergency passes one major concern is that after the crisis passes new surveillance technologies deployed during the coronavirus crises will become thenew normal and permanently embedded in daily life it will result in ongoing mass population monitoring without proper oversight accountability or justice of this there is a history albeit not long after the terrorist attacks of 911 in 2001 led to the proliferation of surveillance cameras and networks across the us and the patriot act a new statute that eliminated statutory guardrails for government oversight and limited accountability increasing the invasive and extensive surveillance powers of the national security agency later exposed by whistleblower edward snowden despite the public uproar against nsa activities it is yet to be de-authorized by lawmakers there is no question about the presence of government departments to represent the people nonetheless people run institutions and often people make errors errors that can reveal sensitive information to hackers who do not have access to it governments will certainly ensure that the tools they have built to combat extremism such as the position monitoring device used in israel remain in safe hands only all people who want to secure their digital life need to ensure that all connected devices are protected by reliable anti-virus software as regards regular folks international journal on cryptography and information security ijcis vol 10 no3 jul 2020 after the advent of the coronavirus pandemic tech companies have provided their resources funds and face mask stashes to help many organizations that work with the data are now stepping up providing their tools for data collection to try and monitor or avoid the virus spread unacast a data company that collects and provides the retail real estate marketing and tourism industries with cellphone location data and analysis has recently revealed something called the social distancing scoreboard 21  the scoreboard is an interactive map that gives letter ratings to each state and county in america depending on how often unacasts examination of data conclude that its people conduct social distancing its the first offering from the companys latest covid-19 location data toolkit and more location data will be introduced in the coming days and weeks to demonstrate trends and patterns that the company hopes would unacast isnt the only tech firm that has used the technology for what it claims is a public benefit these days the data for good platform on facebook uses de-identified statistical data from its users to support its disease prevention maps which will offer information about where people live and where they travel and can help health agencies monitor disease transmission or anticipate when they will be heading next kinsa health uses data from its smart thermometers to attempt to identify extremely high rates of influenza with its us health climate monitor which the organization claims has forecast the spread of flu correctly in the past and may also map outbreaks of coronavirus unacast is a bit different though for the facebook system and the kinsa app users will opt to monitor their position and instead have a clear interaction with those businesses in comparison unacast receives app data from a number of third-party providers such outlets according to its privacy policy include unacasts suppliers as well as the software development kit or sdk which it puts in applications the stumbling point is that users give one of those applications permission to access their location data without realizing that this location data will go to unacast as well to the average consumer there is no simple way to see what sdks an app may use because the privacy rules of the app typically state the details goes to third parties without disclosing who certain parties are unacast claims its sdk is its preferred data base on its website but when we asked for clarification the company wouldnt specify the applications or partners it deals with an study by apptopia a smartphone app technology company these apps users can always turn the location tracking off but some of them obviously need the location services to be able to work at all while the chart itself can be a helpful device it also makes such data collection activities even more visible behind the scenes  and how precise the data collected can become unacast is hardly the only company doing this kind of data crunching for example oneaudience a marketing company puts its sdk into apps to gather user information the firm also illegally collected social media data as facebook alleged in a recent complaint but the firm admitted this compilation was accidental and that it changed its sdk  one of the best tools at the hands of public health authorities during a epidemic crisis is low-tech detective work if a person is infected with a disease such as covid-19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus public health authorities figure out where they have been lately and monitor all people they have been in touch with the tension between preserving the rights of people and obtaining knowledge that is important to the general interest varies over the course of dissemination of a epidemic core specifics would need to be sorted out by monitoring device designers how to assess phone proximity and user safety status where the information is processed who uses it and in what format digital contact tracing services are currently working in a variety of countries but specifics are sparse and questions over privacy exist in the following we propose several recommended privacy principles  another choice is to use a coronavirus-specific app to start new requiring users to willingly share their location and health details one emerging app in germany depends in part on location data already held by google for its account holders a person who is performing favorably may use the geohealth app to donate the history of their place the data will then be anonymized and processed on a central server a data analytics platform developed by the ubilabs tech firm will equate the history of users activity with that of infected individuals and the system will display color-coded warnings depending on how recent they might have experienced the virus as a mixture of gps mapping wireless network data and telephone communications using bluetooth the device will be able to identify when a mobile comes within one meter from another coordinated data-sharing has become an essential tool in the ongoing fight against coron- in an unprecedented situation several policymakers are able to neglect the ramifications of privacy in an attempt to save lives the confidential data being gathered though is not limited to policy and public health organisations throughout the united states the international journal on cryptography and information security ijcis vol 10 no3 jul 2020 government is partnering publicly with verily a sister corporation owned by google to provide electronic verification services allowing users to have a google account surveillance security providers and smartphone device creators are now allowing access to confidential data for example users of the corona 100 m app will see the date a coronavirus patient was infected along with their race ethnicity age and where they went sensitive medical records related to a patient will and should be kept confidential in ordinary circumstances exposing them to private corporations is a matter of anxiety particularly in the name of public health as such documents have considerable economic importance for example they could provide valuable targeting data for health-care and pharmaceutical companies to advertising agencies they could also help inform health insurers making decisions seeking to verify medical history when processing new policies and claims databases containing identities linked to mobile location data do bear a price tag especially for consumer markets data protection laws such as the european general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act ccpa would limit businesses attempting to retain personal data of any kind and even use it for potential commercial advantage however businesses must adopt the newest advances in privacy-enhancing technologies pet to completely ensure regulatory enforcement and secure data-an enormously important market commodity as demonstrated by the world economic forum this emerging type of privacy technologies helps companies to exploit knowledge obtained from third-party private data without disclosing sensitive information which can not and should not be exchanged luckily sophisticated cryptographic methods based on pet are now in use by businesses the global research community has rigorously sought and tested them and business members are deeply engaged in attempts to standardize pets such as zkproof to promote wider acceptance if correctly applied pet will inspire companies rather than constrain them it can help them to securely leverage third-party data and remain competitive without jeopardizing user privacy or business confidentiality preserving privacy as we develop and implement these technical solutions will be critical it is more than important ever to consider privacy principles as we collectively move forward into this next phase of tracking tracing and testing and using similar technologies developed to address the pandemic meaningful consent must be obtained by being international journal on cryptography and information security ijcis vol 10 no3 jul 2020 transparent about the reason for collecting data what data is collected and how long it is kept only when people make the decision to participate should data be collected with consent and used in the manner explained clear and user-friendly communication aims to encourage cooperative engagement and will ensure that anyone engaging with the system makes informed decisions to engage in data collection this should also ensure the user is aware of the purpose of gathering the data the essence of the data to be collected the length of data retention and the advantages of data collection  understanding the emerging coronavirus what it means for health security and infection prevention a peters p vetter c guitart n lotfinejad d pittet   the current outbreak covid-19 of the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 in china and the beginning of its subsequent global spread is already impacting global health systems and the global economy 1 how countries and international organizations respond to the challenges it presents may have profound lasting impacts for global health the decisions taken both at national and international levels will help to inform how we react to future pandemics and health security challenges global disease outbreaks and pandemics have been increasing exponentially over the last 40 years and experts have long been warning of the potentially devastating effects of a severe pandemic although it is important to note that the improvement in diagnostic capabilities undoubtedly plays a role figure 1 figure 2
 23 by analysing the causes of this and similar pandemics as well as the physiopathological human and political influences on its spread we hope to shed some light on the current health risks decision-making dynamics and future implications of the current coronavirus pandemic coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense enveloped rna viruses of the subfamily orthocoronavirinae family coronaviridae order nidovirales among those four are widely distributed human coronaviruses hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 and cause the common cold severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are zoonotic in 20022003 sars-cov caused an outbreak of pneumonia in 8000 affected cases distributed over 30 countries and five continents and is now considered to be eradicated mers-cov was discovered in 2012 4 it originates from bats with dromedary camels as the intermediate host causes pneumonia in humans and has a mortality rate of over 30 nosocomial spread has also been described no specific antiviral treatment is available and treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic 5 sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus of the coronaviridae family it shares more than 79 homology with sars-cov 6 and causes mild to severe disease with fatal bilateral viral pneumonia described in humans 78 it is referred to as a novel coronavirus because it has not been observed previously in humans its likely reservoir is bats with pangolins identified as the likely intermediate host 9 it is worth mentioning that pangolins are endangered and the most trafficked animal in the world 10 as the pangolin trade is illegal this would explain why they were not listed in the official registers of the wuhan market making it difficult for researchers to identify the source of the virus some researchers are suggesting that the virus may have been circulating previously and the market may have been an amplification setting rather than the source of the spillover 11 there are numerous reasons for the exponential growth of global pandemics but the most frequently cited include expansion of the human population destabilization of ecosystems and globalization humans are coming into contact with environments that were previously untouched meaning that they will also come into contact with the viruses and bacteria that are inherent to those environments many of these will have no impact on human health but some do 212 human actions that impact animals such as changes in land use and climate change have a profound effect on how these diseases spread as our climate changes certain populations of animals especially mosquitos or other animals that function as disease vectors increase and spread into geographic zones that were previously uninhabitable to them and they are more likely to spread the diseases that they carry to new regions changes in land use and changes in humananimal contact also affect the emergencere-emergence and spread of disease as does the unmanageable explosion of the global wildlife trade legal and illegal wildlife trade is estimated to affect one in four mammal and bird species globally and to generate between us78 and us10 billion annually 1314 in response to covid-19 china placed a temporary ban on wildlife trade on 26th january 2020 15 although this will likely only affect the legal wildlife trade temporarily it is a step in the right direction how we raise our food is just as important and zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza including the 2006 h5n1 epidemic and swine influenza including the 2009 h1n1 pandemic are often associated with industrial farming the monoculture effect is well known in agriculture but there is mounting evidence that it is also important in animal farming 1617 although the aforementioned studies look at wild animal populations there is a high indication that it holds true for animals raised for food often large populations of specific species of animals raised for food are kept in suboptimal conditions without even mentioning the inherent issues of waste management and animal welfare industrial farming also creates health risks for humans in multiple ways if these populations are not isolated from wild animals of similar species in the case of avian influenza the virus which circulates naturally in wild bird populations came into contact with large homogeneous populations of birds in poultry farms 18 due to the disease potential associated with intensive animal farming animals are often treated with vaccines and antibiotics both avian and swine influenza continue to be managed through regular vaccination of livestock 19 although the main reason for antibiotic use in farming is to preserve human and animal health and prevent zoonoses widespread use of antibiotics in terrestrial animal production including first-line antibiotics such as colistin promotes antibiotic resistance 2021 in farming antibiotics are used as prophylactics to make up for crowded unhealthy conditions and growth promoters as well as therapeutic treatments for specific disease outbreaks therefore although they are relevant tools for decreasing zoonoses antibiotic use in animals can also become the catalyst for the development of zoonoses that are resistant to antibiotics 22 these issues are compounded by globalization in two main ways interconnectedness and mobility our interconnectedness means that there are huge global markets for specific products from specific environments which can speed up environmental degradation deforestation has already been linked to the emergence and re-emergence of nipah virus lassa fever lyme disease and possibly zika virus 323 a current example of this is how the international drive for palm oil a cheap and stable oil in malaysia has led to the upsurge of malaria in the region currently the worlds highest rate of deforestation is of malaysian forests for the creation of palm oil plantations 24 25 26 the zoonotic malaria species plasmodium knowlesi has recently become the principal cause of human malaria in borneo and this has been linked directly to deforestation on the island 2728 considering the dynamics at the humananimalecosystem interface it is not surprising that the worst epidemics and pandemics including human immunodeficiency virus sars-cov avian influenza swine influenza ebola virus and zika virus of the past 40 years were all of zoonotic or vector origin human populations are also more mobile than they have ever been and air travel enables a pathogen to be transported across the globe in a matter of hours currently over 4 billion trips are taken by air every year and this frequency of travel in an infected and moving global population gives a disease unprecedented opportunity to spread and spread quickly 29 in that sense the timing of covid-19 was very bad luck chinese new year is the biggest mass migration in the world with 385 million people making approximately 3 billion trips during the holiday period 3031 the fact that the outbreak happened during this time makes it that much more difficult to trace and control and certainly influences the speed at which it is spreading in a globalized world the security of countries is interdependent and in the case of a severe global pandemic the world is arguably only as prepared as its weakest country 32 the issue that needs to be assessed is the level of risk that more frequent outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases pose for the human population impact can be assessed in different ways including global morbidity mortality economic burden and geopolitical implications the stakes are high the world health organization who estimates that a moderate to severe pandemic would cost approximately us500 billion or 06 of global income 33 as has been shown repeatedly an epidemic does not need to reach severe levels or have many or technically speaking any casualties in order to destabilize national health systems or put a strain on the networks responsible for international and global response and the economy in order to quantify risk and forecast possible scenarios of transmission it is necessary to look at the traits of a specific pathogen there are numerous characteristics that can predict how well a pathogen could spread through and damage a population these traits include virulence clinical severity ease of human-to-human transmission and if the pathogen is transmissible during the disease incubation period if it is the length of the incubation period is of importance health system and human factors will also impact the spread of a virus health system capacity factors include the availability of treatment or vaccine and the level of resources human material and financial available for allocation human factors include whether the population is immunologically nave or not how well the human immune system can respond to the virus age structure of a population population density mobility and cultural behaviours individuals behaviour is informed by cultural beliefs and mores and these can impact movement within a community contact with others and likelihood to comply with official recommendations level of education and previous knowledge of general infection prevention measures also play a role 34 systemic factors that will determine the severity of an outbreak or pandemic include the resilience of health systems co-existing external factors that would hinder an appropriate response and the ability of a governing body to respond to the outbreak implement infection control measures in the population and continue to function despite a health emergency health systems are varied a small outbreak of influenza in a high-resource country with a robust health system will likely only have a small impact on the continual habitual or average delivery of health services that have nothing to do with the outbreak a health system that is fragile or already overloaded by either routine care or another emergency needs only a little disruption to damage it or even cause it to collapse traditionally supranational organizations international institutions and non-governmental organizations will fill that response vacuum as well as is possible an example of this and how difficult it is to implement effectively would be the international response to the 2014 ebola epidemic 3536 an outbreak in one country can deeply affect not only that countrys economy but also the world economy and the countrys political relationships with other countries eg trade agreements opening or closing national borders etc economists are expecting chinas economic growth to slow to 45 because of the outbreak 37 sars-cov-2 fulfils many of the qualities that a pathogen needs to cause a worldwide pandemic it seems to be quite virulent as sars-cov-2 has not been seen before in humans the population is completely nave the virus has also been shown to have high interhuman transmission sufficient data are not yet available for exact figures concerning the spread but there have been initial estimates that each infected person would infect on average 26 other people uncertainty range 1535 38 who estimates are a little less daunting reporting a preliminary reproductive number r
0 estimate of 1425 39 importantly calculations from imperial college london estimate that infection control measures need to block well over 60 of transmissions to be effective in controlling the outbreak 38 that number is most likely inaccurate but this will be easier to assess as time goes on in the case that the virus can be transmitted by an asymptomatic individual 40 it will be even more difficult to implement a 60 effective infection and control ipc strategy especially because most of the people infected will be in the community and not in healthcare settings however the initial report of asymptomatic transmission in germany was inaccurate which is encouraging 41 a further challenge is posed by the decision of foreign governments to evacuate and repatriate their citizens from china the inevitable quarantines and infection control measures that need to be taken as people arrive back in their home countries will be crucial for preventing the spread of the virus 42 the diamond princess cruise ship outbreak of sars-cov-2 in japan with more than 691 infected people and four deaths as of 25th february 2020 is an example of inadequate ipc in the community that led to a disaster 43 44 45 the sars-cov-2 genome has already been sequenced and countries are working hard to develop a vaccine 46 47 48 it is difficult to tell what the actual mortality of the virus is as the current death toll includes all-cause mortality of infected people and is likely overestimated by the testing of mostly sicker patients although this information will emerge over time sars-cov-2 seems to be spread mainly by droplets and not through air nosocomial transmission has been described 49 and superspreading events in hospital settings may occur sars-cov-2 is possibly spreading indirectly through contaminated surfaces and hand contamination as well but the lack of aerosol transmission will make the spread less efficient according to who 25 of current cases are considered severe 39 but this proportion would presumably decrease while more patients and contacts would have been searched for and screened the reason for this is that most of the cases screened are for relatively severe infections especially in areas where tests are limited once more people are screened including milder cases the percentage of severe cases and the death rate will inevitable drop and get closer to its true value contact tracing of sars-cov-2 suggests that there is a low r
0 and limited person-to-person transmission 50 the exponential spread of the number of cases however may suggest that superspreaders of the virus may be playing a major role either from individuals or a zoonotic source 50 superspreading individuals were found to have a major impact in the previous mers sars and ebola pandemics 34 the current death toll is rising much more slowly than the current number of cases 80234 confirmed cases and 2701 deaths as of 25th february 2020 overall fatality rate of 336 51 due to under-reporting a shortage of test kits reporting of all-cause mortality and a prevalence of patients with mild symptoms it is highly likely that the death rate will be much lower than initially expected 5253 there are some estimates that currently only approximately 5 of current cases of the virus have been identified 53 if this is true then covid-19 is far less lethal than it seems it might be easy for ipc experts to get caught up in the frenzy of getting prepared for a new pandemic granted we do not know what if any long-term effects this virus might have on the human body but what is most important is to keep a healthy perspective and avoid getting distracted by all of the hype and forecasting although sufficient information is not yet available sars-cov-2 may be less deadly than the influenza virus that hospitals deal with on an annual basis and transmission seems to occur mainly through droplets even a high estimate of the r
0 rate is many times lower than for airborne diseases such as measles for instance 54 it is important to remember that the r
0 rate refers to the average transmissibility of the disease and does not give information on how fast it will spread seasonal influenza has an r
0 of approximately 13 but circulates through the whole human population every year 55 human immunodeficiency virus on the other hand spreads far more slowly through the population yet has a highly variable reproductive rate 56 still sars-cov-2 causes pneumonia in healthy people 57 even if most of the deaths are described in elderly comorbid patients more epidemiological data are needed in order to determine the full spectrum of the disease in order to better understand this dynamic it might make sense to look at sars-cov this has a similar reproductive rate to estimates of the r
0 of sars-cov-2 but only infected approximately 8000 people in the early phase of the 2003 sars-cov outbreak the lack or inappropriateness of ipc measures used proved to be associated with increased risk for cross-transmission and within-hospital spread of the disease among both visitors and healthcare staff 58 59 60 in contrast when applied appropriately ipc measures were extremely effective during the sars epidemic 61 similarly ipc measures will certainly prove to be extremely effective in respect to sars-cov-2 but more detailed transmission models are needed 62 in a 2003 analysis of sars in hong kong that excluded superspreading events the reproductive rate dropped from 29 during the initial phase of the epidemic to 04 after the implementation of ipc measures 63 usually once the reproductive rate falls below 1 the outbreak will die out on its own therefore having a strong and adapted ipc response to this outbreak will be crucial to stopping it an additional factor is that people infected by sars-cov felt unwell and were likely to seek care in hospitals sars-cov-2 seems to cause a wider range of symptoms and if people only show mild infections the infection may go unnoticed with people thinking that they have a common cold this can cause the disease to be underdiagnosed which means that people will be more likely to continue to spread the virus it is essential that we prepare ourselves for what seems like the inevitability of having the virus at our doorstep but we must think ahead to enact commonsense policies that will not cripple the normal functioning of our healthcare institutions that may mean sending people home while waiting for a test result to come back providing home care to mild cases 64 or figuring ahead of time how to handle an extra influx of patients healthcare institutions can organize beds and isolation rooms and ipc teams can set up hotlines in anticipation of the virus although more easily said than done having a clear definition of what constitutes a suspect case is crucial the case definition will evolve rapidly in a context where the epidemiological risk changes with geographic spread of the disease and possible new information about its epidemiology in order to contain the outbreak the case definition should be broad at an early stage it is also important for ipc teams to work with hospitals in expanding their triage capacity and deciding how to organize the activities during a period with a potentially unusually high influx of patients suspected to have the virus liaising with the virology laboratory to define additional hours and workforce if needed can be an additional step to prepare an institution healthcare staff must be reminded of the importance of hand hygiene standard precautions contact precautions and any complementary measures in preventing the spread of the disease developing countries face more critical challenges during outbreaks compared with higher-income countries preventing effective management worldwide major issues and challenges of influenza pandemic preparedness in developing countries oshitani 96 the lack of ipc in developing countries with limited resources is a major dilemma that leads to high rates of healthcare-associated infections 65 hand hygiene is arguably the most important infection control procedure and is often neglected by healthcare workers in these countries 66 while developing countries still lack the equipment expertise and health infrastructure to detect and manage patients 65 sars-cov-2 is spreading rapidly in these unprepared countries 67 prompt prioritization of resources precise surveillance and capacity development have been recommended in countries with low preparedness for diagnosing the virus and limiting transmission 68 what is most essential is that regular care activities do not suffer because of a pandemic condition and that control of the far more common and far more deadly pathogens that hospitals deal with on a daily basis remains of utmost importance the scale of chinas response to the pandemic is unprecedented extreme cordon sanitaire-type quarantine measures have questionable efficacy and can jeopardize trust between healthcare providers and the population this was seen in the 2014 ebola epidemic when the government of sierra leone imposed a 3-day quarantine and sent police and military house to house to educate the population and to find people harbouring patients with ebola patients in their homes 6970 that said the covid-19 outbreak is a delicate situation and a difficult decision for the chinese government to make  any decision will have major risks still quarantining a major region will most certainly result in practices that could be considered human rights violations 71 it is worth noting that it would be much more difficult for a government to implement such a large-scale dedicated disaster response in a democratic country china worked day and night to construct two hospitals within a matter of days they are made of prefabricated buildings and serve to help handle the overwhelming number of patients 72 on 28th january 2020 after just 48 h of construction china opened another 1000-bed hospital that had been retrofitted into an empty building 73 china has an impressive track record for being able to implement huge engineering projects at record pace during the 2003 sars epidemic they were able to construct a 1000-bed hospital in under 1 week using prefabricated buildings at the height of the epidemic the xiaotangshan hospital treated one-seventh of patients with sars in china 74 countries are often motivated to be cautious in declaring an emergency rather than alarmist as this has severe economic repercussions the speculations that china knew about the outbreak before they declared it seem to be well founded on 27th january 2020 the mayor of wuhan zhou xianwang admitted that we havent disclosed information in a timely manner and also did not use effective information to improve our work 75 locally officials might have little motivation to declare an emergency to their superiors 53 quarantines were announced hours before they were put in place which could have encouraged people to flee approximately 5 million residents reportedly left wuhan before the quarantine was in place 75 deciding when to declare a national or international emergency is always a difficult riskbenefit analysis the risks of doing so can disrupt trade and severely hurt a regions economy but policy makers often do not have many options especially when faced with public scrutiny europe is now faced with the same dilemma after the recent spike of cases in italy but on a far smaller scale the italian government has put a number of towns on lock down and cancelled carnival celebrations to attempt to stem the spread of covid-19 the first example of major spread of the virus in europe also highlights issues concerning the open borders between european countries 76 epidemics impact peoples health and livelihoods far beyond the direct effects of the outbreak in the sectors of the countries where the disease occurs 77 during the 2003 sars epidemic the global economy lost an estimated us40 billion 78 the direct economic burden of the 2014 ebola outbreak is estimated to be between us28 billion 79 and us326 billion of lost gross domestic product with the comprehensive economic and social costs factored in the cost to the global economy was estimated at over us51 billion with us18 billion in deaths from non-ebola causes 80 the impact of the outbreak of sars-cov-2 has spread from asia to other parts of the world including europe with the emergence of many sars-cov-2 cases in italy and south korea as two of the worlds major economies concerns have been raised regarding global economic damage 81 after some debate who declared sars-cov-2 a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30th january 2020 the process leading up to this decision is complex and impacts many people on the one hand such a declaration is an international call for alarm but on the other hand it does not guarantee that the outbreak will be ended or the exact nature of the international response 82 who initially declined to label the coronavirus outbreak as a pheic as doing so would be extremely disruptive the member views concerning this decision were quite divided during the first meeting but who agreed to re-assess this decision in a few days time 39 and changed its global risk assessment for sars-cov-2 from moderate to high 83 it maintains that there is no evidence that donors withhold disaster relief funds if a pheic is not declared 84 it is worth noting that who repeatedly declined to label the 2018 ebola outbreak as a pheic showing that there is a tendency to err on the side of caution 85 when it did so in 2019 there was prevailing opinion that the pheic designation would be game changing in terms of resources allocated and international response 86 we predict that the pheic designation for sars-cov-2 will help to mobilize the response on a global scale although china has been praised for its rapid sequencing of the virus genome and the impressive construction of health facilities and mobilization of the response it has been struggling with managing the human element 53 effects of outbreak situations such as sars-cov-2 are always difficult to predict because there are so many variables to consider firstly we do not know much about this virus and secondly so much of its spread will be dictated by human behaviour decisions and ultimately luck there is much that can be done in terms of reducing the likelihood that novel viruses will jump from animals to humans but these measures often include the type of environmental regulation that is difficult to implement in an international system inherently focused on growth and short-term profit there are also cultural and practical issues associated with changing how we farm and stopping the wildlife trade which are equally difficult to implement the magnitude of effort needed to address this issue is daunting warning systems response networks and real-time tracking are important tools for containing outbreaks but they do not actually prevent them from occurring in the first place projects that catalogue and study novel viruses do not equal preparedness the same scientific work that is used to study a disease can in and of itself create biological risk 8788 both national governments and supranational organizations state that this issue is of utmost importance and have pledged their commitment 89 90 91 nonetheless expert consensus is that there is a high chance of the world dealing with a devastating pandemic in the near future and that we are quite unprepared 8792 93 94 still the number of cases in countries other than china continues to grow outside of china there is a growing number of cases and casualties with 12 deaths in iran 10 in south korea seven in italy four on the diamond princess cruise ship two in hong kong and one each in france japan taiwan and the phillippines 45 coupled with the exponential growth of the pandemic the very short pre- or pauci-symptomatic and infectious incubation period of the virus as well as the possible prolonged high-level carriage makes it quite difficult to contain 40 one probable scenario is that sars-cov-2 will just become another human virus that the world deals with on a regular basis who director-general dr tedros warned of a potential global pandemic the window of opportunity is still there but our window of opportunity is narrowing he said on 21st february 2020 we need to act quickly before it closes completely 95 it seems to be less dangerous than initially thought so perhaps once again humanity will be lucky hopefully we can learn from our mistakes before our luck runs out none declared this work is supported by

foundation grant no 32003b163262  severe acute respiratory syndrome and dentistry lakshman samaranayake p malik peiris   the sars outbreak has been identified in more than 30 countries in five continents affecting more than 8000 people predominantly in asia especially china with mini-outbreaks in north america and a few cases in europe the disease has led to more than 700 deaths worldwide clusters of cases are particularly common among close associates of patients and the health care workers who treated them and their household contacts because of the alarming global spread of the disease who issued a global alert in march 2003 and instituted worldwide surveillance6
 most patients identified up to now were previously healthy adults aged 25 through 70 years10 a few cases of sars have been reported among children  15 years of age in whom the clinical course now is thought to be less aggressive11 we provide a summary of the major clinical characteristics of patients with sars although the information should be considered preliminary because of the broad and non-specific case definition the incubation period for sars is widely considered to be two to seven days but occasionally may last up to 10 days symptomatically the illness appears to have two phases an early prodromal febrile phase and a secondary lower-respiratory phase in pathological terms however it is a triphasic disease with a primary viral replicative phase a secondary immune hyperactive phase and a pulmonary destructive phase12 the disease generally begins with a prodrome of typically high fever  38 c that may be accompanied by chills and rigors headache malaise and myalgia also are common at the onset of the illness some patients have mild respiratory symptoms in a few cases the febrile prodrome may be accompanied by diarrhea although rash and neurologic or gastrointestinal findings are absent after three to seven days the secondary lower-respiratory phase begins with a dry nonproductive cough or dyspnea that may be accompanied by or progress to hypoxemia in up to one-fifth of the cases the respiratory illness is severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilation the fatality rate among patients with illness that meets the current who definition for probable and suspected cases of sars ranges from 3 to 10 percent depending on the age group and possibly other yet unconfirmed factors10 furthermore the mortality rate is higher among those with underlying illnesses and among the very elderly typically chest radiographs appear normal during the febrile prodrome and in some patients throughout the course of the illness however in the majority of patients the respiratory phase is characterized by early focal infiltrates that progress to more generalized patchy interstitial infiltrates sometimes leading to consolidation in the very late stages13
 in general in the early phase of the disease patients may have either a normal or decreased white blood cell count with a reduction in the absolute lymphocyte count at the peak of the lower respiratory phase up to one-half of patients exhibit leukopenia and thrombocytopenia or platelet counts at the low end of the normal range 50000 to 150000 per microliter renal function appears to remain normal in the vast majority of patients the box

 a number of treatment regimens have been explored for sars these include a variety of antibiotics to presumptively treat known bacterial agents of atypical pneumonia as well as antiviral agents such as oseltamivir and ribavirin steroids also have been administered in combination with these antimicrobial agents however the most beneficial regimen remains to be determined15
 until reliable diagnostic tests an effective vaccine and antiviral drugs are available control of the epidemic depends on early identification of suspected and probable cases quarantine of patients and their close contacts and effective infection control measures particularly after patients are admitted to a health care facility researchers have confirmed that a new strain of virus belonging to the family coronaviridae is the prime agent of this disease16 17 18 19 although other viruses belonging to paramyxoviruses such as metapneumovirus have been implicated these appear to play only a secondary role if any in the disease process 
coronaviridae are a family of rna viruses that have been associated etiologically with respiratory illness in humans and with other diseases in domestic animals interestingly they also are associated to some extent with human diarrheal diseases21 structurally they are 80 to 160 nanometers in diameter positive-stranded and about 30 kilobases in length21 their genome is the largest of all rna viruses and high-frequency recombination between related coronaviruses leads to the generation of much genetic diversity the virus has three major proteins the nucleocapsid protein is enclosed within the viral envelope with the rna in a helical nucleocapsid the other two proteins are the membrane glycoproteins and the spike glycoprotein21 the spike glycoprotein is responsible for the characteristic fringe of crownlike projections antibodies that elicit spike glycoprotein are thought to confer protection against infection because the human strains are relatively difficult to culture compared with animal strains the extent of strain variation in human coronaviruses is unclear25
 there are three serologically and genetically distinct groups of coronaviruses associated with animal and human disease in general they are species-specific although there are a number of examples of viruses crossing species barriers and establishing themselves in new hosts21 25 once the host is infected the virus may produce localized disease that often is restricted to the respiratory epithelium or the gastrointestinal tract or they may produce disseminated infection causing systemic disease21
 coronavirus was confirmed as the etiologic agent in sars via serologic techniques demonstrating a rise in antibody titer its growth in tissue culture a determination of reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction or rt-pcr specific for this virus using molecular genetic techniques and animal studies23
 animal studies have helped to satisfy kochs postulates which are necessary to prove disease causation19 these postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent a pathogen must meet four conditions it must be found in all cases of the disease it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host and it must be found in the experimental host so infected however further studies that include control groups are required to determine the role of other agents if any in causality or as cofactors for severe disease the rapid spread of sars worldwide within a few months points to the contagious nature of the disease the infectivity during the incubation period is still unclear and it appears that the risk of transmission during the prodrome is low in contrast in coronaviruses that cause the common cold the viral shedding period usually precedes the onset of clinical symptoms by one to two days although the peak viral excretion occurs during the symptomatic phase21 23 26 the infectivity of sars during convalescence appears to be low and remains to be determined some data on the survival and infectivity of the sars coronavirus27 indicate that unlike other coronaviruses it is a rather robust organism that is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least one to two days it is more stable up to four days in stool from patients with diarrhea which has a higher ph than does normal stool however the virus loses infectivity five minutes after being exposed to commonly used disinfectants and fixatives including 10 percent formaldehyde 10 percent hypochlorite 75 percent ethanol and 2 percent phenol heat at 56 c kills the sars coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes considered to be a quick reduction27
 the available epidemiologic data suggest strongly that the main routes of virus spread are droplets direct contact and fomite indirect contact transmission although airborne transmission has not been ruled out completely28 researchers believe that the cause of the large outbreaks among health care workers was the transmission of droplets through aerosol-generating medical procedures such as the use of nebulizers28 29
 no firm data exist regarding the infectivity of contaminated saliva as opposed to sputum from the respiratory tract through the droplet route in some patients the infection manifests itself as a mild form of diarrhea and coronavirus particles have been recovered from fecal matter hence it is possible that fecal contamination could lead to the spread of the disease although more data are needed to confirm this route of transmission it is interesting that some animal coronaviruses are spread through the fecal-oral route21
 from about 20 days after the onset of clinical signs elisa tests can be used to detect immunoglobulin or ig m and iga antibodies in the serum samples of patients with sars early antibodies are detected in some patients within two weeks sars virusinfected vero cells can be used to detect igm antibodies in serum samples of patients after about day 10 of the onset of the disease this test is reliable yet demanding because the live virus must be grown in cell culture in addition subsequent immunofluorescence needs to be demonstrated laboratory workers can detect virus in specimens for example respiratory secretions blood from patients with sars by infecting cultured vero-e6 or fetal rhesus kidney 4 or frhk-4 cells laboratory workers can use pcr assays that detect genetic material of corona-virus in patient specimens such as respiratory secretions blood or stool samples primers that are required for this test now are available widely through various web sites for example the cdc the university of hong kong and the governmental viral unit of hong kong clinicians must exercise caution when interpreting laboratory test results because the key to diagnosis is clinical evaluation and possible exposure to an infected person a positive laboratory test result indicates that the patient is or has been infected with the sars-cov while a negative test result does not necessarily rule out sars16 23
 seroconversion of paired serum samples with convalescent serum samples obtained more than 21 days after onset of symptoms is a reliable sensitive and specific diagnostic method however the current diagnostic option of choice for early and rapid diagnosis is rt-pcr detection of virus in respiratory or fecal specimens this test has low sensitivity and a negative test result does not exclude the diagnosis many laboratories are addressing the problem of sensitivity and specificity of the sars diagnostic tests and it will take some time before a highly sensitive specific quick and simple diagnostic test is available it is possible that as is the case with hiv infection saliva could be used as a diagnostic fluid in this context as health care providers dentists should be able to identify a suspected case of sars the cdcs current interim diagnostic criteria for sars are shown in the box14 they are subject to change as more is learned about the disease and should be reviewed periodically by visiting the ada or cdc web sites as stated above we doubt that patients with sars who are in the acute febrile phase of the disease will visit a dentist in the unlikely event that this does occur the dentist should not treat the patient in the dental office but should refer him or her to a health care facility as soon as possible for diagnosis and care dentists also have a duty to report the case to state or local health departments32
 as always dentists should take a thorough medical history from each patient and update it at each recall appointment5 the questionnaire used for this purpose may have to be modified to incorporate targeted screening questions regarding sars although these questions may appear superfluous during the current abeyance of the outbreak they are important as a guide if there is another outbreak of sars or an outbreak of a similar new disease these questions may include the following
do you have feverhave you experienced a recent onset of a respiratory problem such as a cough or difficulty breathinghave you within the last 10 days that is the incubation period for sars traveled internationally or visited an area where documented or suspected community transmission of sars is occurringhave you come into contact with a patient with sars in the past 10 days
 in the event that the patient recently has returned from a geographic region with documented or suspected community transmission of sars the clinician can defer elective treatment until the incubation period is over dentists can provide emergency treatment provided they use routine barrier precautions and avoid spatter or aerosol-generating procedures this emergency treatment should be limited to the control of pain and infection dentists should not treat patients in the dental office who are suspected of having sars if a patient replies yes to the first two screening questions the dentist should wear a surgical mask discuss his or her potential concerns with the patient call an area medical facility such as a hospital and inform the staff that he or she is referring a patient suspected of having sars so that arrangements can be made for transportation and care of the patient patients with sars need ground emergency medical services32
 these screening questions should be asked routinely of all patients because questioning only a select group of patients for whatever reason may undermine the early detection of infection and might be construed as a discriminatory practice clinicians should delay treating convalescing patients for at least one month after they are released from the hospital convalescing patients are instructed to remain at home for seven days after discharge from the hospital and during this period they are requested to stay indoors and keep contact with others to a minimum33
 a preprocedural antimicrobial mouthrinse with 012 to 02 percent chlorhexidine gluconate is believed to reduce the number of microbes that are released into the operatory environment this has been shown in a number of studies in which a long-lasting mouthrinse for example chlorhexidine gluconate with povidone iodine and essential oils has reduced the disseminated microbial load during procedures such as ultrasonic scaling34 35 however no concrete data show that a preprocedural mouthrinse reduces infection among dental health care workers or patients a preprocedural rinse would be most useful in situations in which a rubber dam cannot be used such as when a prophylaxis cup or an ultrasonic scaler is used and in the absence of assisted high-volume suction microflora on the skin can be divided into two categories the transient flora colonizing the superficial layers of the skin and mainly acquired through environmental routes and the residential flora thriving on the deeper layers of the skin and hair follicles36 the exogenous superficial flora are harmful and pathogenic but are removed easily with clinical hand-washing procedures by contrast the endogenous residential flora are almost impossible to remove completely but are less likely to be associated with infections36
 the single most important method of preventing transmission of any infectious agent including the sars coronavirus is hand washing and appropriate hand care studies have found that even in critical care units hand-washing compliance is relatively low sometimes approaching 40 percent37 by contrast a dramatic reduction in the prevalence of health careassociated infections has been shown when regimented hand hygiene measures were introduced38 thus appropriate hand hygiene is the mainstay of a good dental infection control program furthermore recent data indicate that the sars virus compared with other coronaviruses is a relatively robust organism and may survive on nonporous surfaces for up to 48 hours39 this reinforces the need for good hand hygiene as well as the importance of thorough surface disinfection for routine dentistry which entails examinations and nonsurgical procedures plain soap and water are adequate recently the cdc recommended that if the health care workers hands are not visibly soiled an alcohol-based hand rub could be used for routine decontamination because this is as effective as hand washing and also saves time40 also clinicians should decontaminate their hands both before and after removing gloves because humidity and moisture cause bacteria to multiply rapidly under the glove surface hand rubs that are based on alcohol alone should not be used owing to their rapid evaporation and lack of residual effect consequently hand rubs must be laced with agents such as chlorhexidine octenidine or triclosan to achieve the needed effect41 after using an alcohol-based hand rub the clinician must dry his or her hands thoroughly before putting on gloves because any residual alcohol may increase the risk of glove perforation42
 face masks were first worn by surgeons to minimize postsurgical infection in patients due to microbes that were exhaled or shed by the surgical team43 however the realization that face masks protect the health care worker as well as the patient has led to the routine use of this protective measure in many clinical settings including dentistry transmission of airborne infection depends on factors such as the virulence of the organism as well as the number of organisms transmitted44 in the case of coronavirus-induced pneumonia leading to sars airborne droplet transmission of infection is considered to be the main route of spread45
 various types of masks and face shields are available surgical masks usually provide adequate protection in dental care settings where highly transmissible infectious diseases are not typically encountered however surgical masks are not designed to provide adequate protection against exposure to airborne infectious agents such as tubercle bacilli or droplet nuclei smaller than 5 micrometers for such purposes particulate respirators for example n-95 masks must be used during the sars outbreak in hong kong the vast majority of dental practitioners in that country used n95 masks for routine dentistry however these masks are uncomfortable to wear for extended periods because of the difficulty in breathing through a thick impervious fabric and are not recommended for routine dental office settings rubber dams help minimize the production of saliva- and blood- contaminated aerosol or spatter samaranayake and colleagues46 reported an up-to-70-percent reduction in airborne particles around a 3-foot diameter of the operational field when a rubber dam was used a split-dam technique may be used in situations in which gingival areas are involved such as class v restorations and crown-and-bridge preparations aerosol-generating procedures should be avoided as much as possible if rubber dam isolation is not feasible some of these procedures include ultrasonic scaling root-surface debridement and high- or low-speed drilling with water spray there is no doubt that coronavirus research has gained an unprecedented and urgent momentum owing to the lethality of sars and its nearly worldwide spread within a few months consequently laboratories throughout the world are working in unison to provide answers to many unresolved questions as well as to develop a new preventive vaccine in dentistry in particular a number of questions remain to be resolved including the following
does the virus survive in human saliva and if so for how longis the virus shed in saliva during the early incubation period or during the convalescent phase of the diseasedo human salivary constituents such as lysozyme lactoferrin and the salivary leukocyte protease inhibitor have anticoronavirus activitycould the virus spread in a dental clinic environment because of aerosols and if so are additional barrier protection measures required to prevent such spreadwhat are the more efficacious disinfectants that kill or inhibit the viral activityhow long does the virus survive on surfaces and what factors such as humidity affect its survival
 although the global threat of sars has peaked for the most part it is helpful to review the response of the community to this novel disease it is fortunate that sars was not sufficiently infective to cause a repeat of the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed millions even so we might be able to attribute the relatively low death rate in large part to the worldwide surveillance networks and patient isolation efforts that were introduced rapidly in most countries in retrospect an overreaction seems to have been a better option than allowing the disease to run out of control as was the case with the aids pandemic the who lifted all its travel advisories47 as of june 15 2003 and since then only three new cases of sars have been reported two of theseone in singapore and the other in taiwanwere accidental laboratory-acquired infections in research technicians working with the organism while the third patientfrom guangdong province in southern chinais thought to have acquired the infection through contact with contaminated rodents because the initial symptoms of sars mimic those of many variants of atypical pneumonia a high degree of suspicion by the medical establishment intense surveillance and immediate quarantine of all close contacts of patients should ward off another large-scale winter outbreak if sars does return its epidemiology may be different from that of the current strain for instance the genome of the new sars-cov may differ and the virus may be more or less infective than the original strain that emerged in 2003 furthermore we do not know how long the acquired immunity to sars persists also will those exposed to the virus be carriers of the disease in the face of a new infection how many will be silent healthy carriers of the virus will an emergent strain or strains behave similarly to the older counterpart we do not have the answers to these questions the reason for the pandemic spread of hiv is its ability to mutate rapidly from one generation to another so it can escape the immune surveillance mechanisms of the host as well as the prescribed antiviral medications the sars virus on the other hand seems to be remarkably invariant the genome sequence of isolates from patients in singapore toronto china and hong kong has not revealed any changes of major consequence23 this does not mean that the sars virus is incapable of mutation rather because the virus has encountered little resistance from new human hosts there is less selective pressure for new mutants to emerge and persist many researchers are working on potential drugs and vaccines to treat patients with sars however their approach has been scattered for the most part as they screen the multitude of available drugs and compounds for their ability to destroy the sars-cov thus far a few have had success one group reported that the compound glycrrhizin which is derived from licorice roots can rid cultured monkey kidney cells of the sars virus48 other researchers using in silico research have proposed that the newly described proteinase of the sars virus which converts viral proteins into the active form required for viral replication49 could be inhibited by drugs animal models are essential for experimentation and drug discovery thus far the only validated model has been cynomolgus macaque macaca fascicularis20 a smaller and less expensive animal model for sars research has yet to be defined although vaccines exist for animal coronavirus infections it may take a few years before a vaccine for sars is developed it is comforting to note that the existing technology and know-how for animal coronavirus vaccines could be translated directly toward the manufacture of a sars vaccine furthermore implicit evidence shows that the vaccine approach to preventing sars is feasible because patients conditions appear to improve when they are given hyperimmune serum from recovered patients with sars sars vaccines could be based on a killed sars virus or on an attenuated virus that is sufficiently potent to replicate itself in humans and initiate a successful antibody response but not potent enough to cause disease another option would be to re-engineer a harmless candidate virus to contain genetic sequences of the sars virus this approach has been used to produce a prototypic vaccine against a coronavirus that causes bronchitis in chickens50 should there be a renewed threat of sars a vaccine would be a most-welcomed weapon by health care workers sars is the first readily transmissible infectious disease that the global community has confronted in the new millennium this surely will not be the last contagion that we will encounter the fact that no dental health care worker or dental patient has thus far contracted sars in a dental setting is a testament to good infection control measures that have been implemented in the vast majority of dental offices however the dental community cannot let down its guard and must be constantly aware of impending infectious threats in various guises as well as recrudescence of disease that may challenge the current infection control regimen  analysing the combined health social and economic impacts of the corovanvirus pandemic using agent-based social simulation frank dignum paul davidsson mijke van der hurk maarten jensen christian kammler fabian lorig gustavo luis  ludescher alexander melchior ren mellema cezara pastrav los vanhee harko verhagen  analysing the combined health social and economic impacts of the corovanvirus pandemic using agent-based social simulation abstract during the covid-19 crisis there have been many difficult decisions governments and other decision makers had to make eg do we go for a total lock down or keep schools open how many people and which people should be tested although there are many good models from eg epidemiologists on the spread of the virus under certain conditions these models do not directly translate into the interventions that can be taken by government neither can these models contribute to understand the economic andor social consequences of the interventions however effective and sustainable solutions need to take into account this combination of factors in this paper we propose an agent-based social simulation tool assocc that supports decision makers understand possible consequences of policy interventions bu exploring the combined social health and economic consequences of these interventions  in order to handle crises like the covid-19 crisis governments and decision makers at all levels are pressed to make decisions in a very short time span based on very limited information 16  where italy and later spain are criticized by not being quick enough to react on the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus one wonders whether others would have made different decisions at that time although health is considered of the prime importance the interventions from governments are having huge economic impacts and possibly even bigger sociopsychological impact because the incubation time of the coronavirus is around two weeks it will take at least two weeks before the effects of any restriction on movements is visible that is decisions will everytime be two weeks behind the actual situation given this fact many countries made a jump start and installed possibly more severe restrictions than necessary in order to stay ahead of the effect however it also means that in many countries the restrictions will last for several more months extended lockdown and restrictions on movement are leading to social stress and the economic effects will have lasting consequences too it can be expected that people will find unforeseen ways to circumvent the restrictions and there will be increased attempts to violate the restrictions all potentially undoing the effects of the restriction at the same time lockdowns are causing social stress unemployment in several countries is rising at an incredible speed causing even more social unrest this is pushing the timing and type of strategies to exit lockdown and lessen the current restrictions leading many governements to consider the introduction of tracking apps or other means to limit spread once restrictions are partially lifted in order to limit the risks of a second or third pandemic wave how and when should restrictions be lifted is it better to first re-start schools or should transport and work take priority what will be the effect of these strategies on the pandemic but also on the economy and social life of people and countries it is also clear that interests and possibilities are not equal for all countries thus a preliminary lifting of restrictions in one country might adversely affect the spread in the neighbouring countries unless all cross border transport is halted which is almost impossible given the economic and food dependencies between countries worldwide the above considerations make clear that health social-psychological and economical perspectives are tightly coupled and all have a huge influence on the way the society copes with the covid-19 crisis most of the time decision makers get their main advice from epidemiologists during pandemics other experts are sometimes added but most models used by the experts focus on only one perspective making it extremely hard to understand the combined effect of any policy measure across all aspects this is especially serious if the effects of a restriction or the lifting of a restriction have an effect in one perspective that invalidates the assumptions made from another perspective 2  there is thus a need for ways to couple the different perspectives and model the interdependencies such that these become visible and understandable this will facilitate balanced decision making where all perspectives can be taken into account tools like the one we propose should thus facilitate the investigation of alternatives and highlight the fundamental choices to be made rather than trying to give one solution in this paper we present assocc agent-based social simulation for the covid-19 crisis an agent-based social simulation tool that supports decision makers gain insights on the possible effects of policies by showing their interdependencies and as such making clear which are the underlying dilemmas that have to be addressed such understanding can lead to more acceptable solutions adapted to the situation of each country and its current socio-economic state and that is sustainable from a long term perspective in the next section we will briefly discuss the current covid-19 crisis situation in section 3 we will discuss the different perspectives of the consequences of the crisis and show what is needed to connect the different perspectives in section 4 we describe the agent architecture at the core of the assocc approach which brings together the epidemiologic social and economic perspectives and show how this is implemented in a workable agent architecture that can be used in a social simulation framework in section 5 we describe the practical application of the social simulation framework assocc by exploring different example scenarios where the different perspectives are combined conclusions are drawn in section 6 the covid-19 crisis is characterized by very emotional debates and an atmosphere of crisis and panic 13  when the pandemic spread from asia to europe it took some time to realise its possible consequences and what would be appropriate measures to prevent these consequences also the usa seemed to ignore what was happening in asia and europe for some time causing a considerable delay in introducing defensive policies when the pandemic finally reached the country in a country like the usa where little social security exists and government is not prepared to invest money in preparing for disasters the societal consequences are possibly even larger than in europe 12  this was also one of the lessons learned from the storm katrina 8  but the lack of preparedeness still remains in the usa alone already by end march 2020 over 66 million americans had filed for unemployment 1  as the number of covid-19 cases increased policies had to be made quickly in order to prevent the rapid spread of the virus resulting in an overload of hospital and ic capacity given the lack of data about the coronavirus at the time of decision making epidemic models based on those modeling earlier influenza epidemics were leading on making decisions there was simply not enough information and not enough possibilities to take more focused measures that would target the right groups and still had the desired effect the early days of the pandemic show a quick change of approaches as more became known about the coronavirus eg the fact that in early stages it was believed that asymptomatic carriers were not able to transmit the virus was influential in initial decisions concerning testing and contact tracing and possibly to the high speed at which the virus spread initially currently many countries have introduced severe movement restrictions and full lockdown policies with potentially huge social and economic consequences however also in these cases it is unclear what are the factors and motivations leading to the policy in fact an initial study by oxford univeristy shows that there is little correlation between the severity of the spread of the coronavirus and the stringency of the policies in place in different countries 2  the initial idea was that these measures would last for one or two months however at the moment there are already several countries speaking about a period of several months extending at least until mid 2020 or even longer based on data from previous pandemics initial economic policies were based on the expectation of getting back to normal within a limited amount of time with many governments sholdering the costs for the current period it is increasingly clear that impact may be way above what governments can cope with and a new normal economy will need to be found 2  and above that the international dependencies of the world economy require that countries should coordinate their policies in order to sort maximum effect a thing which is notoriously difficult and has not been improved by the recent attitude of the usa to go for its own interests first and show little solidarity with other countries from a sociological perspective there are not many theories that can be used to predict how the current situation will develop however some principles are clear people have fundamental needs for affiliation and thus need to socialize people can use the internet for some of these needs but physical proximity to other people is a basic need and cannot be witheld for a long period without possibly severe consequences keeping families locked up in their homes for long periods also will create problems of its own even without considering the particular dangers for disfunctional families and domestic violence victims new practices need to be formed where all members of the family will experience less privacy and autonomy and have to adjust their daily practices to accomodate the new situation this is possible for short periods as tensions can be kept in reign however over long periods this might lead to conflicts and consequent problems of distress increased domestic violence suicides etc 4  these experiences might also affect families and society on the long term people will change their behavior permanently to avoid similar situations thus eg people might be less inclined to travel get close to other people etc the effects of these changes can be more subtle but have a long lasting effect on the well being of society from the considerations above may be clear that policies impact epidemics economics and society differently and that a policy that may be beneficial from one perspective may lead to disastrous consequences from another perspective as the crisis progresses and with it its impact increases decision makers need to be aware of the complexity of the combined impact of policies means to support understanding this complexity are sorely needed as are tools that enable the design and analysis of many what-if scenarios and potential outcomes in this section we describe the epidemics economics and social science models that are needed to support decision makers on policies concerning the covid-19 crisis and the complexity of combining these models epidemiological models are dominated by compartmental models of which sir 6  or seir formulations are the most commonly used in compartmental figure 1  seir cycle as described in 6 models people are divided into compartments as depicted in figure 1  seir shows how people start as being susceptible to a virus s then can become exposed e to the virus from that state they can become infected i 1  in that condition they can visit a doctor o 1  or just stay home i 2  from those states they can still visit a doctor and in the end they are either recovered r or passed away once recovered people can become susceptible again if immunity does not last the spread of the virus is determined by the probabilities with which persons move from one state to the next of course this figure gives a very simple picture of all complexities involved in epidemic models however what is clear from this picture is that people are a kind of passive containers of the virus that can infect others with a probability and can recover and become immune there are no explicit actions that people undertake a model like the above is often combined with a social network model that shows the speed of the spread along certain dimensions when a person gets infected that is central in the network he will spread the virus in all directions and the epidemic spreads quick as well these models are mathematical simplifications of infectious diseases and allow for understanding how different situations may affect the outcome of the epidemic by assuming that every person in the same compartment exhibit the same characteristics that is the model does not consider explicit human behaviour as is also explained in the media nowadays 3  or consequences of interventions on actions of people 10  these are either considered outside of the model or are transformed into an estimated effect on the parameters of the seir model that is uniform for all individuals in one compartment eg the effect of closing schools on the spread of the corona virus can be interpreted as a lowering of factor  in figure 1 meaning a lower number of places where the spread of the virus is possible and thus a lower probability for the virus to spread however what if the consequence of closing schools would be that children are staying with their grandparents or that they are brought together at the homes of other children rotating caring between families in these cases the number of places where the virus can spread may actually increase which might outweigh the effect of closing the schools it is possible to include all these factors in to the probability factor however by doing so we loose the actual causal links between the different factors as these are not explicit part of the model and therefore cannot be easily identified and adjusted in economicsthere are many competing models and theories without singling out a specific model it can be said that in general economic models have difficulties in times of crisis 14 5  competing theories focus on different aspects of the economy and make different assumptions about the rest the main issue all models struggle with exactly like epidemiological models is that of human behavior often economic models take a homo economicus view on human behavior a rational individual that always goes for maximum utility or profit in all circumstances however we all know this is not always true as can be easily illustrated by the ultimatum game an experimental economics game in which one player proposes how to divide a sum of money eg 100 dollars with the second party if the second player rejects this division neither gets anything rationally the agent that gets offered should accept any offer as it is more than nothing what he gets when refusing however empirical studies show that people only accept what they perceive as fair offers 1  in our example when more than 30-40 dollars are offered so fairness apparently also is worth something it neatly illustrates that people have more motivations to take actions than mere utility of that action again such motivations and values can be somehow incorporated in economic models but such interpretation is not part of economic theory ie economics does not directly provide an answer on how much fairness is worth this will depend from the context and history eg suppose an agent is pretty fair and offers the other agent 49 dollars and the other agent accepts the next time the same agent offers the other agent 45 but now the other agent refuses due to the fact he feels he will get offered less and less however he might very well have accepted the 45 if it was offered the first time the above is just one example to show that economic models are very good to explain and predict some behavior of people but do not include all motivations and behaviors following from those the third perspective that is relevant for modeling of a pandemic is the social science in particular social network analysis is often used to understand the possible ways a virus might spread 9  nowadays much of the work in this area is related to online social media networks because a lot of data is easily available on such networks however for the spread of a virus the physical social networks between friends family colleagues etc are those of main interest given that there is enough data to construct the physical social networks they are a very good tool to determine which people might potentially be big virus spreaders this can be due to their role eg nurses in elderly care or due to the fact that they have many contacts in different contexts eg sports and culture that are otherwise sparsely connected and they form bridges between densely connected communities however knowing which people or which roles one would like to target for controling the spread does not mean one can device effective policies eg in the current pandemic it is clear that closing schools as being a possible bridge between communities is acceptable while closing hospitals or elderly care centres is not so again additional aspects have to be included in these models in order to use the theory in practice more semantics for the nodes in the networks are needed as well as what the links between the nodes are constituted of do the links indicate the number of contacts per day can people also change the network based on their perception of a situation ie avoid contacts have different types of contacts establish new contacts etc so where social network analysis looks at people as nodes in a network people are the ones that actually create maintain and change the social network when a government tries to contain the spread of a virus the social networks give a good indication where that might be done most effective but how the people constituting the network will react to the policies is not included in the social network theory thus whether new links will arise bypassing previous links or other persons will take the place of so-called super spreaders cannot be derived from this theory given the above short discussions of the different modeling perspectives of the crisis one can conclude that all perspectives include some assumptions about human behavior in their models however this behavior and especially how people influence each others behavior is not part of any of these models we propose to take the human behavior as the central perspective and use it as a linking pin to connect the different perspectives as illustrated in figure 2  in the figure 2  combining perspectives next section we will discuss how our agent model from the assocc framework can be used to fulfill this central role to couple the different perspectives the design of the assocc framework is based on the fact that individuals always have to balance their needs over many contexts in the research that we have done in the past twenty years we have come to the the sketch in figure  3 that illustrates how people manage this balancing act in their daily life we figure 3  driving behaviour assume that people have a value system that is reasonably consistent both over times contexts and domains the value system is based on the schwartz value circumplex 17 that is quite universal it depicts a number of basic values that everyone possesses and their relations people differ in how they prioritize values rather than on which values they have although priorities can differ between individuals they are reasonably consistent within cultural groups therefore the values can also be seen as linking individual drivers to the social group we have used this abstract social science framework already in 18 19 7 11  in order to use it in these simulations we have formalized and extended the framework such that it can be coupled to concrete behaviour preferences in each context thus values give a stable guideline of behavior and they will be kept satisfied to a certain degree whenever possible thus if conservatism is important to a person she will in general direct her behavior to things that will benefit the preservation of the community the second type of drivers of behavior in figure 3 are the motives that all people have in common this is based on the theory of mclelland 15  the four basic motives that are distinguished are achievementaffiliationpower and avoidance the achievement motive drives us to progress from the current situation to something better whatever better might mean the affiliation motive drives us to be together with other people and socialize thus we sometimes do things just to be doing it together with our friends and family the power motive actually does not mean we want power over others but rather that we want to be autonomous ie being able to do tasks without anyones help finally the avoidance motive lets us avoid situations in which we do not know how to behave or what to expect from others each of these motives is active all the time and whenever possible it will drive a concrete behavior thus i might go to my grandparents to ask a question rather than text them just because i want to have a chat the third type of elements that determine behavior are the affordances that a context provides these affordances determine what kind of behavior is available and also what type of behavior is salient eg in a bar one often drinks alcohol even though it is not obligatory it is salient and also afforded easily individuals have to balance between their values their motives and the affordances to determine what behaviour would be more appropriate in each situation as one can imagine this is quite tricky and will take too much time and energy if done in every situation from scratch therefore in human society we have developed social structures to standardize situations and behaviors in order to package certain combinations that will be acceptable and usually good even if not optimal these social constructs are things like norms conventions social practices organizations institutions note that these constructs give general guidelines or defaults of behavior but are no physical restrictions on what is possible implementing this whole architecture would be too inefficient for any social simulation therefore we use this as theoretical starting point but translate it into a simpler model that is more efficient and scalable thus for each application we make choices which are the most important aspects of the above architecture and fix the resulting values and motives into a set of needs as is illustrated in the following figure 4  from the figure it can be seen that we model the values and motives as needs that deplete over time if nothing is done to satisfy them the model prevents that an agent will only look at the need with the highest priority and only at other ones when that need is completely satisfied by calibrating the size and threshold and the depletion rate of each need we can calibrate and balance all the needs over a longer period between different contexts and over several domains eg using this model it becomes possible to decide for an individual whether it is more important to work a bit more or go home and be with the family this simple model is the crux behind combining health wealth and social wellbeing in a simulation model for our implementation of the covid-19 crisis situation we have selected the following five needs that combine some values and motives that are more salient in the current crisis situation  safety  belonging from the four motives only the achievement motive is not included explicitly individual agents inherently are driven to take actions because they need to fulfill their needs longer term kinds of achievement like getting educated or getting rich are not important for the purpose of this context the avoidance motive is modeled through safety and survival the affiliation is modeled through the need for belonging and the power motive is part of both the autonomy and self esteem the needs also reflect the more salient values the need for belonging models part of the value of universalism the need for autonomy that for individual achievements there is not a complete mapping as not all values are of importance given the type of activities and choices that the agents can make some of the needs are subdivided safety has the more concrete needs of foodsafety financial-survival risk-avoidance compliance and financial-safety food safety and financial survival represent that individuals have to have enough food and money to survive financial safety means that one has some buffer to pay other than the basic necessities compliance indicates whether complying to norms is important or not risk-avoidance in this context indicates whether people take actions that might get them infected or avoid any of those at all costs given this core model of the agent decision model for behavior we can now describe the actual agent architecture as we have implemented it in assocc we have developed a netlogo simulation consisting of a number between 300 and 2500 of agents that exist in a grid agents can move perceive other agents and decide on their actions based on their individual characteristics and their perception of the environment the environment constrains the physical actions of the agents but can also impose norms and regulations on their behavior eg the agents must follow roads when moving between two places but the environment can also describe rules of engagement such how many agents can occupy a certain location through interaction agents can take over characteristics from the other agents such as becoming infected with the coronavirus or receive information the main components of the simulation are  agents representing individuals agents have needs and capabilities but also personal characteristics such as risk aversion or the propensity to follow the law and recommendations from authorities needs include health wealth and belonging capabilities indicate for instance their jobs or family situations agents need a minimum wealth value to survive which they receive by working or subsidies or by living together with a working agent in shops and workplaces agents trade wealth for products and services agents pay tax to a central government that then uses this money for subsidies and the maintenance of public services such as hospitals and schools  places representing homes shops hospitals workplaces schools airports and stations by assigning agents to homes different households can be represented families students rooming together retirement homes three generation households and co-parenting divorced agents the distribution of these households can be set in different combinations to analyse the situation in different cities or countries  global functions under this heading we capture the general seir model of the corona virus which is used to give agents the status of infected contagious etc this model also determines the contageousness of places like home transport shops etc based on a factor that represents fixed properties of a place like size time people spend there on average whether it is indoor or outdoor and density how many people are there at the same time under this global functions we also capture economic rules that indicate tax and subsidies from government finally we also include the social networks and groups that exist under this heading the social networks give information about normal behavior and also provide clusters of agents performing activities together  policies describing interventions that can be taken by decision makers for instance social distancing testing or closing of schools and workplaces policies have complex effects for the health wealth and well-being of all agents policies can be extended in many different ways to provide an experimentation environment for decision makers agents can move between places and take the policies into consideration for their reasoning as described in section 4 agents decisions are based on the container model of needs these needs are satisfied by doing activities and decay over time needs may have different importance to each agent but the overall assumption is that agents will try to satisfy their most important need that is least satisfied at a given moment given the context the context determines which choices are available at any given moment thus eg if agents have to work in a shop they will normally go to work even if the need for safety is high but if they have work that can be done at home as well they have a choice between going to work or staying home to work in that case their need for safety can make them decide to stay home most needs are composite for instance safety is built up of food-safety financial-survival risk-avoidance and compliance the first of these are most important for an agents direct need to survive so the safety need is defined as the minimum of the first two and a weighted mean of the rest where the weights are the importances assigned to each subneed for example the satisfation of food-safety is defined as having enough essential resources stocked up at home such as food and medicine measured over a two week period ie the need is fully satisfied if the agent has enough supplies for the coming two weeks and decays from there the only way to increase this need is by going shopping for essential resources however going shopping ie leaving the house may conflict with the need for safety so the agent will need to balance these two needs in its decision to go shopping agents with a high level of risk-avoidance will be more likely to try to avoid the disease and thus want to stay away from large groups of people we also assume that all agents have a certain need to comply with norms and regulations which is satisfied by taking actions that conform to the rules such as staying inside during lockdown or going to school or work if that is requested from them this need can have a negative value in the case that the agent decides to break a rule the need for autonomy is satisfied when agents are able to follow their own plans agents satisfy their need for autonomy when they are able to make an autonomous decision lockdown policies block many of these actions which figure 5  assocc agent architecture means that when an agent reaches a too low level of autonomy it may decide to break lockdown however to regulate this effect and not provide agents with too strong incentives to break the lockdown the compliance is used as a regulating factor finally the need for survival represents an agents need to rest if it is sick this need can be satisfied by resting at home if the agent believes it is sick and depletes if it does anything else while it believes to be sick under this need we also fitted the conformity need people will conform to what other people do if they are uncertain about the context and which action is the best to take conforming to others is safe as it is usually good to do what others do thus it contributes to social survival as can be seen above agents in assocc have a wide range of needs they range over the social health and economic dimensions of society and can therefore also show how interventions intended to remedy eg the spread of the virus can influence other dimensions and due to these dependencies do not have the intended effect in the next section we describe some examples of scenarios we have simulated in assocc to illustrate the use the range of possible scenarios and importance of the approach in this section we briefly discuss two scenarios we have simulated with assocc they are about quite different aspects of the covid-19 crisis the first is on the question whether schools should be closed and employees work at home during the pandemic the second investigates some economic effects of having a lockdown for several weeks or even months both scenarios are built on the same model as described above which shows the richness of the model and possibilities for exploration of new policies typically schools are places where both children and parents from a community gather which potentially leads to spreading of the virus when epidemics emerge one common measure to be taken is the closure of schools in case of influenza-like illnesses it has been proven that this is an effective measure since children are highly susceptible for that disease however the covid-19 pandemic is different as it seems to be less contageous for children sweden as one of the few european countries has kept primary and junior school 0-16 years old open based on the premise that closing schools would mean many parents with jobs that are vital to society like healthcare personnel would have to stay home and take care of their children instead of going to work this would delay efforts to stem the spread of the virus in 3 it is already indicated that closing schools would not have much effect in the australian situation in this scenario we explore potential consequences of keeping schools open on the spread of the virus but also on social and economic aspects we model the direct and indirect effect on the spread of the virus when schools are closed and people work from home we assume that schools will be closed as soon as a certain amount of infected people within the city has been reached different thresholds have been tested but in this paper schools are closed whenever one infected person is detected the scenario assumes that when children are staying at home at least one adult should be at home to take care of them this caregiver is assumed to work from home for the duration of the school closure we will in particular look at the effect on the spreading of the coronavirus when schools are closed and thus parents working at home compared to parents already working at home with children still going to school in figure 611 the results of closing the schools and working at home are shown we show a graph with the health status of the population and the activities taking place when only the schools are closed the left two graphs some people are forced to work at home too as they have to take care of their children the scale on the horizontal axis denotes time four ticks make up one day so the runs cover about 2-4 months depending on whether any differences still appear after 2 months the vertical axes show the number of agents which is around 330 this number can vary slightly as it depends on the household distribution and the way the households are generated the results are based on 40 runs although the number of people at home is of course much higher than people in other places the green line in the bottom plots compared to the baseline simulation which implies less spreading of the virus the peak of infected people is higher around 210 and 215 resp the peak is reached around the same time ie 40 ticks or 10 days the number of people that died is 80 and 78 resp this means that the differences are not significant a closing schools health b working at home health c closing schools activity d working at home activity figure 6  results we also see a difference in people going to non-essential shops the black line in the activity graphs the number of people at non-essential shops on the right where the last two peaks saturday and sunday show that people go out shopping in the weekend the above findings show that the measures do not lower the peak as expected but even increase that peak this can be explained by the fact that more people want to leave the house during the weekend as they have worked at home during the week with less social interaction at these public places typically people of different communities are gathered while at work or school more or less the same group of people are present thus closing the schools only increases the spreading of the virus thus without additional restrictions like social distancing and closing restaurants the effect of working at home or closing schools is surpassed by the side effect namely people wanting to go out the covid-19 pandemic has severe medical and social consequences but it has vast economic consequences as well a recession is expected and predictions show that it can be way more severe than the banking crisis 2009 recession thus governments are trying to minimize the economic impact of the pandemic and try to minimize the financial issues people and companies have by giving massive financial support also once the pandemic has been dealt with restarting the economy is a big challenge as many people have lost their jobs and economic activity has slowed to a minimum with this scenario we demonstrate the relation between the pandemic health measures and the economy this shows the complex and interconnected nature of the situation in many countries the government has locked down the country and closed down business operationsthis cuts the cycle of income of companies and subseqently either people become unemployed or governments temporarily take over paying the wages of the employees in this scenario we show two different situations the first shows what happens with a lockdown and no government support the second shows the situation when government supports companies by taking over wages when government closes all non-essential shops to prevent spread and orders a lockdown the curve of the pandemic is really flattened within the time span of our simulation we see that we are still not experiencing many infections and hardly any deaths note that lockdown here starts when only one person was infected so much earlier than in real life people are almost all working at home the essential shops seem to be doing well this can be seen as hoarding behavior of people that want to make sure they have enough essential products and have still money to buy things they do not buy anything non-essential as those shops are all closed and we have no on-line shopping in our simulation the non-essential shops do not go bankrupt in the simulation because we did assume here that they could postpone all fixed costs like loans rent etc if these fixed costs are taking into account all the non-essential shops will go bankrupt pretty quick without government intervention the velocity of the money flowing through the system decreases due to the lockdown in the second situation government takes over wages from all people working in the non-essential shops overall we see capital increasing slightly this can be explained due to the fact that people cannot spend money on non-essential products and leisure activities going to cafes sport events etc while the number of unemployednon-payed people is relatively small the economic activity is kept up by the government however the government reserves are quickly depleting as less tax is coming in and more subsidies are paid this situation is not sustainable in this paper we have shown that in crises like the covid-19 crisis the interventions of government have to be made quick and are often based on too little information and only partial insights of the consequences of these interventions in most cases the health perspective is the leading perspective to inform government decisions however the models used by epidemiologists lack the part a health of population b activity c capital per age group d government reserves figure 8  results with government subsidy on human behavior therefore they have to translate government interventions and the expected reactions from citizens to parameters into parameters of the epidemic model without being able to check for interdependencies we have shown how the assocc platform can be a good addition to current epidemiological and economic models by putting the human behavior model central and from that core connect the health wealth and social perspectives in general there are several advantages of using an agent based tool like as-socc first a tool like assocc explicitly avoids providing detailed predictions but rather supports investigating the consequences in all perspectives from government policies by comparing variations of policies like government subsidizing people or not in the economic scenario it becomes clear what are the consequences and which are the fundamental choices that have to be made taking this stance avoids politicians being able to just blame the model for giving a wrong advice technology should not give single solutions to decision makers but should support the decision makers to have a good insight in the consequences of their decisions and which are the fundamental priorities that have to be weighed eg the joy of life of elderly people against the risks of meeting their family and becoming infected or the risk of contagion happening through schools vs the social disruption when schools are closed due to the agent based nature it is also possible to explain where results come from eg closing schools might not have any positive effect on the spread of the virus due to all kinds of side effects in the scenario we could see that people were going more to non-essential shops in the weekend because they had to be more at home to take care of the children during the week their need for belonging went up and going to the shops was the only option left as other leisure places were closed tracing this behavior back in this way helps to explain what is the basic cause and where in the chain something can be done if one wants to avoid this behavior each of the steps in these causal chains is based on a solid theory social-psychological economic or epidemiological in our case and thus can be checked both on its plausability as well as on its theoretical foundation using the agent based models makes it easier to adjust parameters in the simu-lation based on differences in demographics and cultural dimensions in different countries but also in different regions or even neighbourhoods in big towns therefore more finegrained analysis can be performed on the impact of government interventions on different parts of the country eg rich and poor neighbourhoods or urban and rural areas can be affected in different ways by the same measure finally we should stress that we do not claim that agent based models like used in assocc should replace domain specific models actually one could use assocc to simulate intervention scenarios to study the human reactions to it and the consequences having a good insight in these dependencies one can feed the domain specific models with better information to make precize optimizations or predictions for the effect of that intervention thus in this way the strength of the different types of models can be combined rather

michael peters through shared in-depth empirical feelings and representations from a wide variety of cultural historical and social contexts the article outlines an answer to the question how do students connected virtually but separated physically in an internationalized university deal with disruption brought about by the covid-19 pandemic at first news spread slowly with some reports saying that the virus could not be spread by human-to-human contact however as was later found it became clear that local government officials had failed to properly assess and report the extent of the outbreak tufecki 2020 when word finally did spread to all corners of the nation it was too late thousands upon thousands of citizens would become infected with the worlds largest annual migration helping to cement covid-19 as a certified global pandemic this annual migration known as the spring festival in china is a time when families ceremoniously go back to their hometowns for often-times the only visits they will pay their relatives during the year ironically for many this visit which usually lasts no more than one to 2 weeks has now been prolonged indefinitely as millions of families anxiously wait confined to their homes praying for news of a cure or for that matter any signs of abatement the virus continues to spread across the globe each new day brings news of yet another country hit by the seemingly incurable and devastatingly elusive covid-19 virus referred to colloquially as the coronavirus it has been about a month and a half now since my january 17th trip to beidaihe a trip that was supposed to be as with many others a 2-week trip to visit family before heading back to beijing to prepare for the spring semester however on around january 21st news started circulating about just how dangerous this virus was with daily updates on the incredibly infectious nature of covid-19 quickly turning a regional concern into a full-scale national emergency not witnessed since the sars outbreak of 2004 around this time the government began to lock down not just wuhan the epicenter of the epidemic but every city prohibiting inter-province travel and confining netizens to their homes with bands of local volunteers reminiscent of the red guard militias of the past ensuring that stringent new curfews are adhered to by all it was almost surreal as images of americans being evacuated from wuhan swept across social media on january 29th many foreign nationals followed suit catching last-minute flights out of the country sometimes having to transfer multiple times to avoid travel bans enacted for passengers flying out of china some stayed however choosing for one reason or another to wait it out placing outsized trust in our adopted homeland hoping against hope that chinas exceptional measures of containment could stem the rising tide of infection for those of us not hailing from centralized nation-states we cannot help but marvel at how efficiently china has managed the quarantine of its almost 14 billion citizens hoping that our own countries can find their paths towards containing the spread to our families and loved ones overseas so we continued to wait sometimes patiently sometimes in desperation frequently with a malaise that comes only hard-earned from having not left your apartment for weeks on end from the feeling of never knowing when this interminably cruel holiday might end within a few weeks those of us within chinas field of he ie students lecturers etc were met with messages from our respective university faculties we were informed that regardless of the continued national health emergency without so much as a gap in scheduling classes would continue as planned the one caveat all classes would now be held online i wondered aloud and not so politely at how this would be possible how could an entire nation take classes online this was a government decision which touched every single level of education from compulsory education at grade one all the way up to phd level graduate courses everything would now be held in one form of virtual classroom or another my skepticism would need to be held in check as of now during the time of this writing chinas millions of students are studying online to varying degrees of success no doubt but studying online nonetheless and i an avowedly anti-online education professional someone who more than once decried the need for a physical classroom as a medium for scholarly debate and socialization find myself not just taking an online course but teaching two as well so i am now confronted with the task of undoing all of my prejudices and biases against the digital pedagogical revolution hoping praying that i can evolve quickly enough and with enough acumen to provide my students with an educational experience that overcomes the obstacles present within an education system grappling against a semi-apocalyptic viral pandemic with the spread of the covid-19 controlled and the number of people recovered incrementally rising wuhan the epicenter of the pandemic is walking out of the lockdown from january 23rd i cannot forget the moment when i saw the news about the lockdown i was shocked because i traveled to wuhan last summer with my boyfriend i shared the story with him at once and he said it is bad later on as the news reached more people around the world different interpretations and voices came up one voice by the influential newspaper the guardian eve 2020 was that the lockdown was a massive authoritarian measure eroding human rights back in the day i guess they could not see the ironycovid-19 soon spread all over the world and many countries have announced similar lockdown orders for instance italy which has an exceptionally large number of casualties announced a nationwide lockdown on march 9th why could not they see that covid-19 does not know borders and that any place attacked by the disease that did not respond quickly and effectively would bear significant suffering chinese overseas feel the direct impact of this politically fueled hatred these days some of my chinese friends who are studying abroad get unwelcome treatments wearing a mask as self-protection brings them loads of hatred and fear one of my friends in the uk was pointed at directly by a stranger who shouted coronavirus this lady got the mask on some of my friends believe this hatred and fear are due to cultural differences while others view these are related to racist nationalism or xenophobia international students who are very vulnerable to these attitudes and behaviors need more than ever to remain calm and rational fortunately following the global spread of the pandemic more and more people realize the necessity of wearing masks and know that covid-19 is not a chinese virus i do hope that will block the resentment stirred by those biased groups that fueled hatred among people from different countries between january 18th and mid-february the first thing i woke up to every day was wechat news and notifications of new cases in my area the only topic discussed during that period was the coronavirus starting from january 26th all residents in my community were not allowed to go out without exceptional circumstances the community had only one open entry and one open exit and also a 24-h epidemic monitoring duty to go in and out one had to wear a mask i expected that the whole society would be paralyzed under the pandemic with no stores open no cars or people in the street but i underestimated the efficiency of the governments measures and peoples determination to overcome difficulties i can know the world without leaving home in addition to tv reports and announcements of my schools online public account news opinions and academic articles about the coronavirus are flooding social media platforms such as weibo and wechat i take classes have zoom meetings with my supervisor in germany every tuesday and discuss with my classmates from all corners of the world i have also taken up courses through beijing foreign studies universitys website whose online language learning platform is open to the public and free of charge since february 1st its foreign language courses cover 20 languages including online courses and resources supporting foreign language teaching and learning international exams and culture general education etc those courses prepare people to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected and intercultural world and to support the goal of international education to help students adapt to and address global challenges i expected that going online would be a tough challenge for teachers and students of kindergarten elementary and secondary schools who are not so keen on high-tech teaching facilities and may be conservative in regard to online education but i changed my view when i saw nuo my nephew who was in her second grade of junior high school having online classes every day five-year-old yan another nephew of mine has been taking drama classes online with a british teacher both nuo and yan have school assignments and projects about coronavirus i am amazed by their teachers high levels of information literacy and adaptability to online teaching peoples acceptance of online education is getting increasingly high and the speed of popularization of online education may exceed our imagination my elder sister who is a mother of three children has immersed herself in the joy of cooking and baking following her online cuisine lessons now we do not have only traditional chinese cuisine such as dumplings and yuan xiao but we also enjoy western food such as toasts chiffon cake sushi pizza pasta and so on online education extends the reach of traditional educators not only to students studying at schools but also to other groups such as homemakers online education can also provide more courses that might not be offered by ordinary chinese schools such as baking and drama learners regardless of their nationality or social status are now confined to their homes online learning is accessible to them without discrimination in unfortunate lockdown circumstances caused by covid-19 pandemic online learning and teaching are useful tools to boost international education in mid-february it became clear to us all this winter break will not end soon covid-19 made us all seriously prepare for online teaching and learning feelings are mixed and everyone is on their toes it is hard to focus on work when everything is up in the air i find myself eager to return to my normal life and learn properly but as a regular joe renting an apartment in beijing there are many things i need to do before i return to my old regular life i need to pay attention to city instructions whether my community allows travel how to keep myself safe on the way how to self-quarantine how to get essentials during self-quarantine where to buy face masks is there a ration for this or that product and which online store is still making deliveries i need to apply to my university not only for returning to campus but also for returning to beijing things could never be as simple as they used to be for university staff the workload for preparing online education is astounding and the shift is not easy being an urban university beijing normal university is notorious for a high population density and we cannot afford community transmission yet we already have confirmed cases of covid-19 suddenly everyone is alert self-isolating and looking frantically into online teaching and learning but not everyone knows how to do it well facultys tpack technological pedagogical content knowledge is challenged most directly but there are lots of heartwarming moments like when faculty and staff are sharing all their resources and knowledge on group chat fixing each others technical hiccups showing both theoretical backgrounds and applied experiences trying out innovative measures for their cohort and expanding their understanding as a student of online learning i thought that i came prepared i pride myself to be a semi-veteran of online teaching because i used to work as an online teaching instructor developed tutorials and packages to help faculty teach online am familiar with many online learning management systems and teleconference tools on the market and i did research in online teaching pedagogy how hard can it be for me but i could not be more wrong as it turned out i could never be too prepared when our cohort meets online i can see the struggle for instance i struggle to find a convenient platform for sustained and threaded conversations for now we have a notice board but that is of little meaning for going back and forth on our learning i fear this will be the case for this entire class without structured study and work-life structure i am consistently close to missing deadlines trying to balance work and research we staff working on university internationalization are heartbroken with the pandemic international students are leaving one by one we are tracking down and checking up our faculty members and students in foreign countries making sure they are safe planned international travel gets canceled until may we write to our partners and cancel events and bookings however i believe that these are only temporary emergency measures and that our international ties will not weaken it all started in december 2019 at the end of the first semester every international student had hisher plan during vacation some wanted to visit different places and others planned to go back to their home countries unfortunately the covid-19 outbreak caused tension fear panic and dilemmas to international students many of their plans missed the mark especially for those who remained in china beijing normal university was brought to a halt international student affairs kept in touch with love and support to international students emphasized and admonished the need to stay indoors avoid crowds and gatherings some campus gates closed to ensure security international students who were away from campus received notices which prohibited them from returning until further notice on-campus international students faced a challenge whether to go back to their countries we had no idea when novel coronavirus threat might come to an end things continued to worsen we were told to stay indoors and shops were closedwe had only one open supermarket which hardly had all the products we needed most of the restaurants closed as well the one open restaurant offered food which was not to everyones tastes we now follow online classes some international students especially those who are in their home countries face network problems and time difference is a challenge we are praying that this crisis will come to an end soon medical doctors and the chinese government are looking for a solution day and night as parents lose their children children lose their parents as well it is so painful and we are crestfallen the novel coronavirus epidemic quickly accelerated and spread through china killing more than 4000 people the epidemic has pushed chinas health system beyond its capacity bringing the country into intense additional stress and ultimately forcing school closures public gatherings were banned including lectures and various restrictions have been imposed on students freedom of movement entertainment and socialization the university temporarily isolated suspected cases and that caused additional stress one international student described her experience of stigmatization that she experienced after the quarantine fellow students in her dormitory were afraid of the virus and they would not touch her and even talk to her she felt hurt and responded by isolating herself from her friends this incident reveals vulnerability in the school communities capacity to recognize the specific stresses and losses of those quarantined school closure fueled fear and mistrust and school reopening is delayed by the ministry of education at the height of the epidemic important resources had to be diverted from education to health emergency response programs a robust emergency plan has been developed by all universities and colleges online and distance learning programs are strongly encouraged students have noted various emotional impacts of the outbreak many report a profound feeling of loneliness due to the ban on public gatherings some of my friends expect a rise of depression and anxiety disorders in post-novel-coronavirus china however the university does provide a social service support system to help students through the closure of the university the chinese government the ministry of health and the international community are working together to figure out how to combat such an outbreak we pray and hope that the novel coronavirus epidemic will be over soon at the end of january novel coronavirus cases were detected in wuhan city and many other areas teachers and instructors tried their best to ensure the safety and health of every student here are some of the requirements international students who live on campus or off campus or travel in other cities of china during the winter vacation have to report their location and their temperature to their counselor every day if students have been to wuhan recently or in close contact with students who have been to wuhan they need to inform their counselor students who live on campus must pay attention to the hygiene and ventilation of their rooms they were asked to stay in their room do not leave the campus if they need to go out of the dormitory be sure to wear a mask and take their student card and go to the dormitory reception registration students who live off campus have to stay at home and try not to meet with people especially to avoid social gatherings students who live on or off campus should reduce the frequency of going out for shopping teachers suggest that some representatives help other students to go to the supermarket to minimize the risk wash hands frequently wear masks outdoors disinfect timely exercise and a proper diet will help students enhance their immunity and stay healthy if there are any suspected symptoms such as a cough or a fever go to the hospital and get medical treatment immediately and then report to their counselor during the period of epidemic prevention and control chinese teachers and administrators help international students in daily disinfection to ensure the safety and health of every student unfortunately the discrimination against chinese people around the world spread with novel coronavirus international students from china are also involved when chinese teachers do their utmost to look after international students from all over the world chinese students are discriminated against and excluded due to a narrow limiting and parochial view i wish the world could unite together and fight against the novel coronavirus with some real action there were many reasons for me to choose to undertake a phd in china one of the main ones was being able to finish the imposing process in 3 years while in my home country of the usa a phd generally takes a few more years what i have learned since coming to china is that if one wants to finish that journey in 3 years a strict timeframe must be adhered the first year is predominately about taking courses and being a student the second year should be marked by two distinct milestonespreparing a proposal and successfully defending it happening hopefully in the first semester and the beginning of the research phase where the identity of the student switches to that of the researcher second semester for those like me a second year phd student in china an unexpected hurdle was thrown into the mix of our carefully scheduled timeframe covid-19 became the latest virus to rear its ugly head against humanity i like many others had plane tickets to go back home and there i would wait for news in the upcoming semester as the spring semester drew ever closer i waited in anticipation for when i could go back to china yet here it is march and i am still in the usa unable to return until my university says i can yet the university continues with online classes daily check-ins on temperature and emails from the university but what is ignored is the disruption caused the impact of the coronavirus can be quantified by the loss of profits for universities but how to quantify in terms of students loss and their ability to do research as i am a human being i am inherently selfish and keep returning to the thought of my own research which is now on hiatus thus making me a researcher-on-hiatus a far cry from what i should be if i am to finish in 3 years my whole proposal centered around china and the unique position of international schools in china instead of traveling throughout china with my supervisor to understand the international school experience i am sitting at home thinking of this pause as a friend pointed out even if i tried to do this online the students answers would be reflexive of their own recent experiences with covid-19 creating a whole new dynamic to the research how does one cope with research in the time of covid-19 which has caused many like myself to take an unwanted hiatus and has presented an unprecedented barrier for many phd students covid-19 is the epitome of uncertainty offering an opportunity for novel research experiences and insights giving fresh perspectives in which to address research like my own the dichotomy of research in the time of covid-19 is ever present as it continues to be a time of massive disruption but also potential and flexibility a time when phd students in china must learn how to be researchers in the time of covid-19 during my first semester course i submitted a write-up for one of my classes and i was determined to improve on the write-up and upgrade it to an article and then submit to a journal for possible publication during the winter vacation however my plans changed with the covid-19 outbreak in china when the disease started i thought it was just like any type of flu outbreak but as the month of january progressed the situation became serious and death toll started to increase news reports on the number of affected cases and the death rate got me panicked and worried covid-19 was labeled a dangerous disease without a cure at the time scientists were not even sure about its mode of transmission numbers of infected cases kept swelling every day and the death toll skyrocketed i was left wondering why me others who came before me studied successfully and returned home with no stigma but i was caught in the middle of the outbreak to make matters worse the university imposed a lockdown on students living on campus and prevented us from even visiting our country-mates in other dormitories on the same campus this move drowned my hope and academic energy and replaced them with fear and stress this resulted in self-quarantine in my 3  3 meter room spending days and nights on my phones talking to relatives and getting comforting words from them sometimes just to spend time i aimlessly watched movies without even knowing their titles as days went by my worries and anxiety got worse i was engulfed by fear and the wish to return home grew stronger my academic enthusiasm i once had was washed away and replaced with uncertainties and fear of losing the academic year as well as my life the worst moment was when my roommate packed her bags and returned to her country at a period when the number of cases across china was around 4000 per day i lost hope and was unable to open my computer for days i could barely eat not to mention doing any academic work to make matters worse two people were diagnosed with the flu on campus this sent a wave of panic among international students and i was particularly hit by this news i spent days without leaving my room or talking to anybody in my dormitory my plans of writing the article faded away even the idea of doing a background check on education policies in my country to identify a possible research gap that i could use to design my research topic was put on hold while the virus was ravaging wuhan the epicenter it was equally damaging my academic stamina and determination during peak period of the disease beijing normal university was like a ghost city one day i came out of my room to get some fresh air and decided to walk around for a while the whole campus was quiet and empty and the only thing i could see and hear were my own footsteps when i returned to my room i was devastated and i expected to lose my scholarship and be sent home inability to engage in any tangible academic activity during the winter break has interrupted my academic calendar i failed to submit a possible thesis title to my supervisor so i was behind schedule i was equally unable to write my proposed article or do any advance reading on possible coursework for the second semester i was unable to concentrate knowing that the virus was dangerous and had no cure i was worried about being unable to fulfill my academic dreams based on rumors spreading about the infection rate among students adoption of online classes by the university has relieved my worries and fears for being delayed due to this severe outbreak on january 27th an official statement has been released from the beijing normal university and the government has had new regulations put in place regarding teaching and learning this outbreak obliged everyone to stay at home and put stress on teachers to find out new learning tools i would say it pushes us to a new learning era e-learning keeps people students and teachers on pace with their studies works and their research it also supports parents in homeschooling opportunities taking advantage of stress relief and spending more time with the family for me e-learning is an opportunity to develop more skills from and out of my institute second year phd students like me who are supposed to start their data collection are stuck in a haze of uncertainty my research is centered around chinese teacher education i had planned to take a role along with my supervisor in class observation and group interviews timeframe for this semester was planned in detail taking into consideration additional actions in case of inability to implement original plans however the outbreak of covid-19 put me in a state of questioning other researchers might find it possible to conduct their research through alternative options such as online interviews however those of us who need to go through observation and interaction with participants like myself need to wait for the end of the pandemic my research is designed around a certain case study that takes place only once each year it cannot be brought online because teachers and students need to be observed and interviewed during and after practical courses after receiving news about school closures and class delays i can only postpone my research to an uncertain time in the future my plans to complete this phd journey in 3 years will be extended by this postponement the impact of this outbreak did affect not only our research plans or academic life but also our mental strengths for some who are not used to isolation like myself the rise of cases in and out of china and social distancing created in us a fear of the unknown in the near future and made us in an endless blue full of uncertainties uncertain of the near future situation away from family and friends has an influence on the daily functioning and learning process i would say for a period found myself unable to concentrate or progress any further but as the semester starts online classes brought back a glance of life again and interaction the blue that i was once in slowly faded away and back to normal though this pandemic is taking way longer the chinese government ministry of health and the international health organizations are working together to figure out how to combat this outbreak and we can only pray and hope that this epidemic will be over soon chinas collective memory in 2020 began with anxiety restriction and isolation when did you begin to fully understand covid-19 a student from northwest china stated as followsi was not concerned about the virus outbreak when the news came online when i heard about the wuhans lockdown on january 23 and the governments introduction of the relevant policies my attitude changed i was also heartbroken when i saw the picture of mr nanshan zhong sleeping on his way to wuhan to prevent the spread of the infectious disease when i focused my attention on the daily rise of the confirmed cases i felt scared walter lippmann said that in our information age people are unable to feel every related emotion personally they can only rely heavily on the reproduction of social reality by mass media wang 2019 in the covid-19 outbreak negative events repeated and peoples emotions were contagious with the shutdown the spread has continued a large number of people were infected and the lack of rescue materials exacerbated the disaster and also heightened the overwhelming effect of press media after emergent public health events accurate collection monitoring and publication of data are particularly important to the publics rational judgment primary health knowledge possessed by individuals did not reduce the impact of the epidemic yet it expanded the national sentiment under the spread of public discourse insufficient understanding and speculation have caused public panic which has continued to bring about irrational behaviors such as fear rumors looting materials violence and conflict this may be due to the lack of perceptions about public health education formation of social groups concerned about general interests in the public sphere forms a critical public opinion habermas 1999 in cyberspace since the medias symbolic treatment of news as well as unchecked irrational cognition of groups stories named chinese virus wuhan virus pandamonium yellow peril etc have undoubtedly challenged international students during the spread of covid-19 students interviewed from russia uk israel italy and germany said they had been involved in verbal and physical conflict to various extents ccyl 2020 rapid emergence of public health education has affected international education mobility and cognition following mers sars ebola zika covid-19 and other epidemics people should realize that viruses co-exist with nature with proper health education the public needs to take steps under the correct guidance now is the time to popularize international public health education all over the world this is not the time for non-systematic separation and differentiated treatment all countries may need to integrate public health issues into basic education from the perspective of consciousness and action risk and survival go hand in hand in human history early humans lived short and brutal lives as the search for food and shelter exposed them to physical dangers from preying animals poor weather war and outbreak of different diseases risk clearly is inevitable but what does it mean to manage risk in december 2019 an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infections was detected in wuhan china in the beginning morbidity of covid-19 has been low but it soon reached a tipping point in mid-january 2020 during the second half of january a remarkable increase of infected patients in affected cities occurred outside hubei province because of an increase in traveling before lunar chinese new year followed by an exponential growth the outbreak spread to other countries attracting extensive attention around the world evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers confirmed human-to-human transmission by droplets contact and fomites so far there is no definite evidence for intrauterine infection according to current estimates covid-19 has a median incubation period of 3 days range 0 to 24 days with potential asymptomatic transmission on february 18 2020 about 380 cases were reported in beijing where i live some university students were infected causing fear among students and staff residing in and out of campus many overseas chinese students traveled home during the festive period and were unable to return to their schools chinese students studying in new zealand for example were unable to return to school due to customs regulations international education significantly improved through effective risk management which controlling or management mechanisms theories or models could best manage potential risks of the covid-19 while maintaining safety and continuity of education internationally perhaps china could offer answers to some of these questions the government response to major public health emergencies always arrives with a slight temporal lag in the field of education this lag is even more prominent i first heard about the new coronavirus at a seminar in late december 2019 where one of my classmates from hubei told us that a new virus is quietly invading wuhan but people who released the news were punished for rumor charges later it was proven that china missed the best time to control the new coronavirus at that time my classmate worried that history will repeat itself like in the 2004 sars epidemic and that we will not come back to school in the next semester her words came true at 1000 january 23 2020 the whole chinese nation entered a quarantine and national and international education governance began to play a vital role in mitigating the crisis chinas international education governance manifests in two main aspects incoming students including foreign student management and outcoming students including overseas student management through a combination of official documents such as policy documents notices news etc and my personal feelings and experiences i distill following characteristics of chinas international education governance modeleducational governance philosophy china regards the epidemic as a systematic battle and the progress of international education governance is a must-win as president xi jinping noted resolutely wins the war of prevention and control of the epidemic situation strikes and wins the war in the education systemgoals and objectives ensure the heath of students maintain normal functioning of international education and improve quality of educationsubject ministry of education plays a vital role during this period new government institutions like the office of the leading group of the ministry of education the chinese service center for scholarly exchange and chinese scholarship council play an essential role in international education governance during the epidemicobject china is a centralized state with a top-down policy working model so international education will impact provinces schools teachers students faculty members and universitieslinks international education governance covers primary secondary and higher education including enrollment education employment and further education china also values civic education in this processmethod chinas international education is governed mainly through issuing documents notification and notices news and so on since january 2020 coronavirus has caused a major public crisis every chinese person is affected in china and abroad since lockdown local people regard outsiders as potential virus carriers especially people living in wuhan and even hubei many of whom have been blown out of their accommodation and spent the spring festival in their parked cars until the government installed them for isolation it is astonishing to watch discrimination against chinese people just because the virus originated in china thus covid-19 intensifies divisions within human beings it seems to be a part of human nature to defend those who belong to ones own faction and attack those who do not why cannot we just acknowledge differences with reason as the old proverb says there are no two identical leaves in the world when we face a person we should eliminate symbols imposed on them by social norms so that we can see his or her soul prejudices exposed by the epidemic are common in interpersonal communication especially among people from different countries even in the field of education they choose to use the imaginary national image to define the face of the peer rather than to understand others and in return foster a broader understanding of a nation in international education students should be encouraged to express themselves truthfully a students personal opinion should be based on his or her experiences not on propaganda listening and then judging is a responsible way to overcome the conflict brought by the unknown just like asking the diaspora can ease the anxiety of keeping distance unlike traditional spring festivals which are always full of joy this years holiday was full of loneliness and anxiety because of the sudden outbreak of covid-19 as a graduating student i returned home during vacations and my supervisor said we would end a time-critical project soon after the spring festival but this is now delayed and my planned summer international exchange project has become unrealistic however that does not mean i am at a complete rest because curriculum arrangements from establishing contact groups to using online teaching platforms are now in place this may indicate that the epidemic will not end in a short time many young people on social media said that they played the role of educators in their relationship with their parents by persuading them to draw attention to the virus and take protective measures in my family this role is not obvious my mom who worked to fight sars 17 years ago is very alert to the news she carefully recalled her trips from past few days and strictly disinfected the familyshe even stopped the family from eating together tv shows have become our entertainment but my mother soon did not want to watch them because rates of infection and death were constantly updated in the lower third of the screen which made her very nervous i played some psychological games to remove the focus from the epidemic and kept reminding her that staying at home is a very effective measure of protection in contrast to most children persuading parents to draw attention to the virus i have assumed a stress-relieving role in my family as an emerging internet market china was not caught off-guard by online education almost all courses including swimming lessons have been transferred online yet many courses use different platforms and i have heard that many of my classmates want to return to school as soon as possible because the efficiency of learning from home is quite low many also said that it is nearly impossible to focus at home and that there is nothing better than face-to-face academic activities what is a truthful way to tell a story why and how does the story of student experiences of the covid-19 pandemic matter in humanitys collective quest for appropriate emergency measures and long-term solutions since november 2019 public health organizations including world health organization and the media have made huge efforts to deal with the outbreak yet people living in china especially wuhan province are nevertheless severely affected lockdown school closures business closures trade closures almost everything is stopped or significantly slowed down the chinese government has made many strategic innovations and policies in tackling the pandemic for schools and universities that means transferring teaching and learning online in this autoethnographic article 15 graduate students at beijing normal university have shared their views experiences and feelings about challenges and opportunities for chinas international higher education in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic the article offers reflections on covid-19 and chinese international education experiences of online teaching and learning reflections on universitys coping mechanisms an account of realities and feelings related to changes in academic life and discussion on coping strategies in chinese international higher education contributors write about their individual feelings effects benefits challenges and risk management strategies as they experienced them in the pandemic the article portrays links between students academic and personal goals government measures such as self-isolation travel bans and quarantine realities of staying at home and their relationships with various factors from cultural settings to class and strong personal feelings caused by the pandemic the covid-19 pandemic has brought a huge social experiment into our homes streets cities countries and globally outcomes of this social experiment will follow the whole humankind probably fairly unequally far into the future jandri 2020 while this article can hardly answer many questions posited by the pandemic which still rages at the time of writing the presented testimoniesbrutal honest and written in the heat of the momentwill surely contribute to deeper discussions awaiting the whole world after the end of the crisis chinas internationalized higher education during covid-19 collective student autoethnography provides an important service to readers giving a snapshot of the tumultuous and dynamic experiences of individuals involved in international higher education in china during the covid-19 pandemic while initial experiences with covid-19 took place in china people around the world have been now impacted as the pandemic has reached global proportions based in hong kong and originally from the usa i have often compared my experiences of being impacted by covid-19 with those of family and colleagues in western countries while many people face the same basic predicaments no matter where they are at the same time differing conditions and personal particularities of identity and perspective make a difference this article thus effectively highlights both unique experiences and shared ones with covid-19 in china at the same time revealing fascinating paradoxes of the struggle to cope with covid-19 in the context of international higher education unique identities are displayed effectively in the article which does not seek a convergence of views across diverse authors of the writing but instead enables each to communicate in their own voice from their own experience some key positions here are those of the student and the educator in international higher education as well as the place of those identifying as chinese and as international in that context while students and educators face different challenges authors also reveal here different emotional responses to the new normal i particularly enjoyed reflecting reading of the emotions and attitudes felt by different authors about going online some express pride about fast thinking in china in relation to the pandemic and moving education en masse online others reveal early disdain for online education followed by surprise at its possibility for learning and connecting with others yet others share about having prior confidence with online learning but shifting into uncertainty in novel conditions the view of doctoral students is also moving as this group faces quite complex challenges in terms of managing scholarly commitments and everyday life the context of international higher education in this piece reveals more complexity it shows how covid-19 as a global phenomenon positions us as international persons in a new way now to be chinese feels like a curse to some as a few authors observe the xenophobia pointed at chinese people abroad today as covid-19 is associated with china yet at the same time there is space for new pride in chinese identity as well as the response to covid-19 there has been swift and effective although this also raises questions about the value of personal liberty from an international view being in hong kong i resonated with such reflections as hong kong faces a similar challenge as it is accused by western people of coping with covid-19 in an obedient way which is increasingly being recognized as an effective way as a collective piece this article shows that the global is experienced as particular and as emotionally complex and dynamic by each of us as individuals as we enter the next phases of this world event this work can serve as a valuable foundation for later reflection on the role of international higher education around the world in relation to covid-19 i thank the authors for their courage and honesty in grappling with their places in this historical moment autoethnographic accounts are honest reflexive and often emotional discussions of personal human experience as researcher narratives they sit in stark contrast to prejudiced opinions which are preconceived notions neither based on scientific reasoning nor even on actual experience in these moving testimonials from international research students and staff in china during the covid-19 pandemic outbreak we hear warm individual tales of personal struggles at the point when life and work changed beyond all recognition while coming to terms with suspended personal research plans unnatural social isolation and loneliness anxiety and threat of bereavement these authors describe too confronting their own prejudices towards online teaching and learning for the sake of their students and themselves they discuss searching for a convenient platform feeling pushed into a new e-learning era losing hope being unable to open a computer and finding their former academic enthusiasm simply ebbing away others comment on the joy of online connection including cooking lessons that extend the realms of digital learning these adjustments represent just some of the many complex postdigital challenges thrown up by this global pandemic each individual story reveals a powerful diverse postdigital positionality where who we are is constructed in a deeply personal cultural political economic technological and material context hayes forthcoming 2020 researchers are trained to account for their positionality as they undertake qualitative inquiry however not only are the identities of authors revealed here their covid-19 narratives are shaped also by the decisions of their governments their university technologies they communicate through and multiple media accounts of what others are experiencing in virtual and physical spaces simultaneously such is the postdigital condition jandri et al 2018 where a messy hybrid intertwining of the physical biological economical and historical meets the technological cultural and personal this is illustrated through a different form of prejudice than simply an aversion to online education human prejudice in a postdigital era has multiple routes for post-truth expression students discuss stigmatization by others after quarantine where irrational fears fueled by social media replace kindness this is human bias cultivated at the intersections of biology technology and our material world where digital devices meet superstition and where physical masks chosen for health protection become also destructive weapons of hatred and racism as scientific research currently holds the gaze of the world in anticipation of a vaccine antibody testing kits and personal protective equipment autoethnographies of human experience may not seem of practical urgency yet these describe how individuals actually contribute to flattening the curve they reveal the human adhesive that binds our global medical effort across communities through education and social care that reaches beyond personal fears these new researchers in international higher education in china have bravely shared their diverse poignant postdigital positionalities as such each contributes to an emerging picture of global research that will ultimately take us forward from this crisis this is research that recognizes that science education and human experience are completely inseparable in our postdigital era and that our international covid-19 effort requires interdisciplinary collaboration across them all  emerging study on the transmission of the novel coronavirus covid-19 from urban perspective evidence from china lu liu   right before the 2020 chinese spring festival the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid-19 takes place in china fear of sars which caused large scale of panic in 2003 appears to come back along with the fast spread of the infection in the wuhan city other neighboring cities within hubei province where wuhan is the capital city as well as many other cities outside hubei province across the whole country fig 1 as early as late december 2019 the novel coronavirus has been laboratory-confirmed in china wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 later as person-to-person transmission of covid-19 is also confirmed public concern of the spread of the novel coronavirus increases dramatically chan et al 2020 it has even caused global health concern as well wang et al 2020 on january 27 2020 world health organization who remains its assessment of risk of the event as very high in china and high level elsewhere1
however on january 30 2020 who raises its assessment to a public health emergency of international concern2
 it is really a bad time for the event since the spectacular spring transportation in china brings hundreds of millions of people back home for the chinese lunar new year liu 2014 as the spring transportation is considered to be the largest scale of temporary human migration on earth this tremendous large number of travelers makes it extremely difficult to contain the spread of the infection within the epicenter of outbreak ie wuhan city as announced by the local government in the news express on january 26 2020 5 million plus people out of 14 million have left wuhan before the city is officially sealed off3
tremendous efforts have been employed to contain the infection and cure the infected patients and china has taken various measures to combat the novel coronavirus4
although the clinical features of patients infected with covid-19 is relatively mild compared with sars huang et al 2020 its spread is faster as of april 30 2020 the accumulated total number of confirmed patients of the novel coronavirus is 84385 in china and the number of death cases is 4643 while we observe the evolution of the covid-19 epidemic in china we notice substantial heterogeneity in the size of the epidemic of cities across the country hence this study tries to answer some essential questions to the transmission of covid-19 raised by the reality with the evidences from china first why do some cities have more infected cases while some other cities have less second what is the role of the distances of these cities with confirmed cases to the epicenter of the outbreak of an infectious disease with large scale third what are the lessons of the transmission from the urban characteristics of those cities fourth is there a quantitative model which can predict the actual infection scale of the epicenter precisely with the information of the epidemic in other cities in the above questions we keep mentioning cities in fact people need to pay more attention to the social and especially urban fundamentals of the transmission of covid-19 not just the biological features of the virus itself indeed the virus is transmitted among persons in the background of the cities in this particular perspective the currently ongoing epidemic of covid-19 can be treated as an urban incident as well which causes substantial challenges to the urban management or even urban planning therefore how to deal with the current epidemic using urban regulatory methods and how to prevent it from ever happening in the future are what we need to learn and discuss from the urban perspective at present this study does not discuss how the outbreak happens instead it focuses on the aftermath of the outbreak and the spread of the infection among cities especially this study provides insights of the fundamentals to the infection from the urban perspective where the marginal effects of some most influential factors to the covid-19 transmission are estimated this study shows empirical evidence from real world data and it can provide hints to future scientific research on the novel coronavirus in addition this study provides an alternative way to know the actual size of a large-scale outbreak in the epicenter among the four questions mentioned earlier the last one can be notoriously difficult due to the technical difficulty and high cost for the laboratory-confirmation of covid-19 we are unable to know the exact scale of the infection at the epicenter of the outbreak in its early or even middle stage especially in the initial stage of the epidemic in the epicenter there can be substantial undocumented infection numbers li et al 2020a therefore precise estimation of the real infection scale is badly needed this is the lesson we really need to take from the experience in wuhan china similar understanding of the scale of the epidemic needs to be done in other emerging regions with epidemic before it is too late to contain the epidemic situation these correct estimates of the size of the epidemic are also crucial to prepare and allocate appropriate medical resources to save lives the succeeding part of this paper is structed as follows after reviewing the related literature we discuss the data and statistical models the empirical results are then shown with the focus on the marginal effects of the key variables in the discussion section later we compare the estimation results in difference time spots to show the evolution of the covid-19 epidemic in china and then we provide our estimates of the infection numbers in the epicenter of china ie wuhan city with high precision at last we present out concluding remarks earlier related studies are more commonly seen in regard to the spread of flu or flu-like diseases such as the outbreak of ebola in west africa kucharski  edmunds 2014 valencia et al 2017 after the outbreak of covid-19 the scientific scholars remain active and pay close attention to this emerging epidemic the evolution of the novel coronavirus can be very complicated xu et al 2020 and there are more and more studies on this virus to come out by the end of january 2020 some other studies on covid-19 are already released some popular topics commonly seen are listed here but not limited to the following studies such as the use of data heymann 2020 early transmission dynamics li et al 2020b epidemic in other countries outside china holshue et al 2020 the impact assessment munster et al 2020 the forecasting of the spread wu et al 2020 the genomic characterization lu et al 2020 and the clinical characteristics chen et al 2020 the most famous epidemic model in mathematical bioscience is credited to the seir model some earlier studies of which are highly cited li et al 1999 li  muldowney 1995 however after the outbreak of covid-19 some estimation results using seir model are far from the reported numbers shown later read et al 2020 tang et al 2020 perhaps one big reason for the failure of such biological models is that they ignore the fundamentals of the urban perspective which in fact provides the real background for the virus transmission indeed the high population density in the metropolitan area as well as the massive level of public transportation in the large cities can play sort of multiplier effect for the virus transmission therefore ignoring the urban context in the discussion of the transmission of a severe infectious disease is the mistake we cannot take while the researchers in the biological science community are keen to estimate and predict the size of the emerging epidemic of an infectious disease outbreak scholars in the economics and especially urban study communities keep a much lower profile this time we have to admit that not too much related studies can be found in the economics and urban professions however now even the biological and medical scholars realize that both challenges and opportunities regarding the current epidemic can be resolved in urban settings lee et al 2020 as noted besides the economic consequences cities especially the large cities are the most populated area in a region which are typically travel hubs and employment centers therefore cities are the natural existing soil to the large-scale outbreak of the fast transmitting communicable diseases although the discussion of human health issues in the urban context is popular orimoloye et al 2019 wang 2020 the particular studies on the urban infectious disease are rare among the limited studies of this strand typical examples are the discussions on the price change in the neighboring property ambrus et al 2020 and the household-built environment characteristics spencer et al 2020 in addition the effect of social network isolation on reducing the transmission of flu infection is also discussed aiello et al 2016 however to our knowledge studies on the transmission of an infectious disease under the urban setting are barely seen once there was the study on a virtual outbreak of a flu epidemic in heavily populated metropolitan area with the simulation of its spread lee et al 2008 unfortunately it comes true worldwide this time in fact the use of statistical methods in epidemiology is quite popular and necessary and many advanced techniques in statistics such as the bayesian analysis have been employed elderd et al 2013 in addition mathematical models are also commonly used in the studies of virus spreading dong et al 2015 therefore in the technical sense there should be no barriers for the economists and urban scholars to cross the border of such different disciplines as discussed earlier lee et al 2008 many factors of biologic and physiologic as well as social economic and geographic can place influences on the transmission and spread of the infectious disease such as flu therefore to achieve such research goal the methods to be used must be built-in interdisciplinary etard et al 2017 unlike those studies from purely scientific perspectives such as cells genes etc this study presents a multidisciplinary analysis of all the cities in mainland china with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus covid-19 we will try to reveal the hidden rules of the transmission of covid-19 behind the real-world data with proper models and statistical methods this study uses a joint data set combining with several different sources the data of the infection number is obtained from dingxiang yuan5
the data used in this paper is obtained at 0908 am beijing time march 2 2020 as well as some earlier time spots such as january 31 2020 and february 5 2020 in this data source we only use the number of confirmed patients for a more focused research purpose technically speaking these confirmed numbers are laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases which is not the same as those suspected cases that can be potential covid-19 cases but not yet laboratory-confirmed as for the distances from the target cities to the epicenter of infection outbreak ie wuhan city we measure the distances in the digital map provided by baiducom in addition the temperature data is obtained from the website of weather china6
at last the local urban attributes data for the target cities are primarily obtained from the china city statistical yearbook 20187
which was released on january 24 2019 the latest yearbook has not been released by the time when we conduct this research although the year book 2018 in fact includes data of 2017 luckily the numerical values of urban area urban population and others do not vary too much which makes this data set still valid for this study however the inclusion of sample cities becomes a technical trouble since the reported number of laboratory-confirmed patients can be lagged and not accurate especially at the early stage of the outbreak when a large number of potential patients in the epicenter rush into hospitals the local hospitals are lack of test kits to confirm whether they are patients of the novel coronavirus or not in a short period of time which is the main reason for the lagged report of confirmed numbers in addition some patients with mild symptoms may be cured before they are timely confirmed of covid-19 this is the case in wuhan city in its earlier stage of the epidemic and it is also the case in the emerging epicenters elsewhere such as those cities in europe and the us therefore in this paper we try three groups of estimation using the full sample the subsample without wuhan city the subsample without hubei province where wuhan is the capital city respectively according to the reasons shown above the subsample without hubei province is expected to have the best performance for the most accuracy of its reported number the epidemic size of covid-19 in the cities of mainland china without wuhan city is illustrated in fig 1
 in addition the descriptive statistics of all the dependent and independent variables are shown in table 1
 here we show a simple log linear regression model which considers the number of laboratory-confirmed patients as dependent variable and uses many other explanatory variables to find the influential factors the regression equation is shown below1lny01lndist2xwhere y is the number of laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases dist is the distance to wuhan city which is the key control variable the relationship of distance to the number of the confirmed patients of the novel coronavirus is shown in fig 2a and b in addition x is a vector of explanatory variables which are chosen as total length of built urban metro lines urban area population density annual quantity of wastewater discharged residential garbage connected and transported per capita public recreational green space in this paper at last  is the stochastic error term although the above regression model appears to be simple the real hard part is that since there are so many possible factors that may affect the spread of virus there can always be missing explanatory variables left in the error term the result of which can lead serious endogeneity problem especially for the extremely complicated issue like this ie the outbreak and spread of the mysterious covid-19 many potential influential factors are technically yet unknown to us thus we are unable to include them as the independent variables as a result the regression parameters with endogeneity issue are inconsistent which makes the estimation not valid in our study which explanatory variable is the endogenous variable we cast our doubt on population density since logically it is closely linked to a possible virus transmission in the local area the common way to solve the endogeneity issue is to find appropriate instrumental variables ie ivs and use 2sls liml or gmm to redo the regression however the tricky part here is that the instrumental variable is not easy to find according to its definition it must be uncorrelated with the error term and correlated with the designated endogenous variable which is included in all the explanatory variables our question is therefore that does such instrumental variable exist in real world luckily after numerous rounds of tests we finally find that temperature is a perfect candidate in fact it is the reality in china that the population density tends to be larger in the warmer places ie the southern part of china of course we do rigorous statistical tests to verify whether the use of temperature as the instrumental variable is appropriate which is shown later in this paper in addition since there are a highest temperature and a lowest temperature in the daily records after tests for many times we choose the highest temperature as the instrumental variable here we show the marginal effects of some most influential factors to the transmission of the novel coronavirus covid-19 which are estimated from the urban perspective by analyzing the data from all the cities in mainland china with laboratory-confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus here we propose the following important findings which are based on model 6 in table 2
 as noted we set the time spot of february 5 2020 as our baseline models which corresponds to table 2 and we also compare the results before ie january 31 2020 for table 4 and after march 2 2020 for table 5 in later section of this paper distance to wuhan is found to be a very strong influential factor cities which are 1 closer to wuhan city increase the confirmed infection number by 0962 the p value is almost 0 which shows that distance really matters in statistical level as we know that 5 million plus people have left wuhan city before the city is officially sealed off although it is really difficult to track where exactly these people go the distance to wuhan city is a very good proxy variable to represent this massive level of human movement logically the closer to wuhan city the easier for the people from wuhan to travel to those locations this fact is in very good consistent with our finding in this paper total length of built urban metro lines does matter to affect the virus infection every increase of 1 km of lines increases the confirmed infection number by 0002 although this quantity appears tiny it is statistically significant it is easy to understand that as the primary tool of massive transportation in modern cities the metro carries a very large number of passengers including the potential patients therefore the spread of the virus within the city can be accelerated and extended by the metro system cities with urban area 1 smaller increase the confirmed infection number by 2571 in addition cities with population density 1 smaller increase the confirmed infection number by 2603 the above two findings show very clearly about in which direction that we shall pay more attention to contain the virus spread at the first glance these findings are counter-intuitive since the common sense that we are familiar with suggests that the larger cities with denser population are more easily to spread the virus infection which is generally correct however we must consider the very special background of the virus spread in china first it is in the particular period of time in china ie the spring festival and spring transportation the spring transportation is normally 40 days long including the 7-day national holiday of spring festival many people working in the large cities rush back to their hometowns which are typically middle or small cities or even rural areas for family reunion for this reason during this period of time many large cities are much less populated as they are in normal period of time second since the outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan city many residents of wuhan and some other large cities take evasive activity to leave the large cities especially wuhan to small cities or even rural areas as the result of the above two reasons in this special time period the transmission risk of the novel coronavirus in small cities or even rural areas may be larger than those in the big cities our statistical result shown in this paper in fact confirms this proposition in addition cities with annual quantity of wastewater discharged 1 larger increase the confirmed infection number by 1397 the p value is around 1 which is very significant in statistic sense as well also cities with residential garbage connected and transported 1 larger increase the confirmed infection number by 1633 as we can see the p value is around 2 which is a very strong signal for its influence on the infection the above two findings are statistically strong enough to provide new clues for possible direction of the investigation on the spread of covid-19 although the coronavirus type of disease is typically considered to be the infection via air-borne droplets the real mechanism of the spread of covid-19 is yet unknown before the mysterious chain of spread is completely understood the statistical findings found in this paper can give hints to scientists and policy makers to take precautionary activities the most importantly appropriate steps must be implemented before it is too late to contain the spread of the virus is the spread of covid-19 associated with water especially discharged wastewater is there middle host of the virus in the water does the residential garbage which may also include wastewater have something to do with the virus spread and infection we are not absolutely certain about the answers to these questions at the present moment however the statistical findings shown in this paper can still contribute to the clues for future study and related regulation policies for example as many chinese residents wear face masks after the outbreak of covid-19 it is easy to predict that the used masks in the residential garbage can reach a massive level if the residents just randomly junk their used masks without proper attention it may cause secondary spread of the virus therefore our statistical results make sense and show the right direction at last we use the per capita public recreational green space as well as a dummy variable for capital city in the province as additional explanatory variables as we can see the smaller such green space area is the higher the confirmed infection number is however it is not statistically significant in model 6 it is barely significant in model 4 this result though not directly indicates that cities with larger open space may be less vulnerable to the virus infection it can be considered to be a general result not just to the spread of covid-19 the capital city dummy variable is not significant in any model as noted earlier we use three groups of samples ie the full sample the subsample without wuhan city the subsample without hubei province where wuhan is the capital city presented in table 2 we see that the estimation is robust in the sense that all the estimation parameters of corresponding variables have the same signs in all the models however which one is our best shot to answer this question we examine two things first a glance of table 2 shows that the most key variables are statistically significant in model 6 which is a very desirable result second both the endogeneity test and weak instrument diagnostics show that model 6 works the best in model 6 difference in j-stats is very significant and cragg-donald f-stat is very close to 10 which make model 6 pass the required statistical tests for endogeneity and the validity of the instrumental variable the technical favor of model 6 also makes sense to us since wuhan city is the outbreak epicenter of covid-19 in china the confirmed cases in wuhan is much larger than anywhere else therefore the inclusion of wuhan to the data set for transmission analysis can be biased in addition with the help of model 6 we are able to purify the data set by deleting those observations with poor prediction performance the most of which are remote cities with very small number of confirmed covid-19 cases and thus can be considered to be observations with extreme values after deleting these cities from our data set how good would the result be hence we present table 3
 in table 3 the ols results in model 7 and 9 are very good since all the explanatory variables except capitalcity are very statistically significant at nearly 0 level and the adjusted r
2 values are increased to above 73 level however the 2sls results in model 8 and 10 are not good any more after the data purification by model 6 the endogeneity issue can be reduced to a very large extent hence the ols results are already good in fact to understand the covid-19 epidemic in china we must first understand the role of the spring festival as well as the spring transportation in china essentially this is in the everybody-rush-home manner after the national holiday of the spring festival the peak time of the returning travelers in the spring transportation would come it is the real challenge to contain the epidemic situation since travelers from so many small cities or rural areas return to the big cities where they have their jobs which may cause a second round of outbreak in the large cities as this paper shows small cities during the period of spring festival suffer from more rapid transmission of covid-19 in fact in the days of early february the rapid increasing number of infections in shenzhen one of the most economically advanced cities in china and who has the highest ratio of migrants has already signaled a warning therefore appropriate precautionary steps must be taken immediately to prevent the second round of outbreak in the big cities from ever happening in table 4
 we show the estimation results in model 11 to 16 as a comparison the data used in table 4 is obtained on january 31 2020 the time of which is at the end of the national vacation of spring festival as we can see very clearly results of urban area and population density are less significant in table 2 which means that the transmission of covid-19 increases in big cities after the spring festival holiday as we know strong regulatory intervention policies have been employed timely one of which is to postpone the back-to-work dates in fact the massive level of returning side of the spring transportation does not occur as those regular years luckily the containment of the covid-19 epidemic in china is a great success that the epidemic outside hubei province is almost stable since late february in table 5
 we show the estimation results using data obtained on march 2 2020 as a comparison as we can see the urban area and population density is no longer significant though they still remain the negative signs again after the purification of data the ols model works fine since the number of sample cities is only around 200 we present the linear gaussian model lgm estimated by markov chain monte carlo mcmc with gibbs sampling to check the robustness of the models as shown in model 19 and model 22 even after 20000000 mcmc draws the parameters and their significances are almost the same as the corresponding ols models in addition the frequency illustration of some key variables in model 19 is also shown in fig 3
 the last question in this paper arises for model 7 and 9 as well as model 17 and 20 which one has the best prediction power now we look at wuhan city again which is the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak in china since the model prediction result of the number of covid-19 infection cases in wuhan city relies heavily on the distance to wuhan we must discuss the radius we use here before we can proceed since wuhan is a big city we cannot just simply consider it to be a point with a radius approaching to zero it is really hard to depict the radius of activities that the most people do in the city as reported by didi the leading sharing car company in china 90 residents in a city stay in a particular radius from the center of the city8
for wuhan such radius is measured as 25300 km which covers a large proportion of the metropolitan area in wuhan we present fig 4
to show the validity of this radius in fig 4 we demonstrate the satellite image of wuhan city with the 253 km radius which is then compared to the map of the official comprehensive planning of wuhan 20102020 as we can see the 253 km radius is clearly in consistent with the official comprehensive planning for the metropolitan area of wuhan moreover it covers the majority of the built urban area in wuhan very well as the satellite image confirms in table 6
 we show three levels of such radius the first one is the 25300 km mentioned above the second is 17890 km which stands for exactly half of the area of circle shown by the first radius the third one is the half of this radius which is 12650 km as noted the second radius feels more like the most representative center of mass of wuhan city then how can we evaluate the prediction results shown in table 6 since the reported number of confirmed covid-19 cases in wuhan corresponding to the prediction results of model 7 and 9 in table 6 is 8351 the mean value of the prediction results of model 7 tends to underestimate the real epidemic size of covid-19 in wuhan this is due to the lack of information from the surrounding cities in hubei province where wuhan is the capital city which limits the prediction ability of model 7 on the contrary model 9 has the valuable information from those cities in hubei province and hence can predict better when we update our prediction using data of march 2 2020 the results are much closer to the reality as shown in the last column of table 6 the prediction with the radius used for wuhan city as 17890 km shows the outcome of 56944866 as the mean value of the prediction please note that the model prediction result is in the self-updated manner that is when we update the estimation parameters with the latest data the prediction result will be updated as well however since the local epidemic situation of covid-19 is almost stabilized in early march 2020 the latest updated numbers of the epidemic in china is in fact reflecting the imported cases from abroad which is not appropriate for our research purpose therefore we stop updating the epidemic data for this study in early march 2020 as of april 30 2020 the number of confirmed covid-19 cases is 50333 in wuhan considering that there are possibly omitted infected cases self-cured cases before confirmation and other possible reasons our estimation is very accurate in fact as of april 14 2020 the accumulated cases of asymptomatic infection in mainland china is 6764 where 588 cases are imported from abroad therefore adding these symptom-free cases to the reported confirmed cases mentioned earlier our result is more accurate than we expect9
 as a very multidisciplinary research paper this study may provide valuable information to a variety of readership to biological and medical scholars this study may provide hints to the possible ways of transmission of covid-19 since many biologic and physiologic features of this new disease are still unknown the statistical findings shown in this paper may present valuable clues for example we do not know for sure that how the wastewater and residential garbage may affect the transmission of covid-19 but since the statistical results are significant scientists can look into these fields perhaps they may have unexpected breakthrough to researchers of mathematical bioscience this paper gives an alternative way other than the seir models to estimate and predict the actual size of a large-scale outbreak of epidemic in the epicenter the method shown here is born to be practical since it is based on only a few information from regions outside the epicenter of the outbreak the data of which is more accurate and reliable at the initial or even middle stage of the epidemic as shown in the paper the estimated number of infections in the epicenter of china ie wuhan city is 56944866 mean value which is very close to the officially reported number this result is obtained through rigorous statistical tests and examinations and such method and its result are proven to be accurate given the example of wuhan as shown in this study to policy makers knowing the accurate size of epidemic or how bad it would evolve to as early as possible in the initial stage of the outbreak is very crucial to get prepared and allocate scarce medical resources the result of which is hence that more lives can be saved in addition the empirical results shown in this paper have important policy implications as well for example if the distance to the epicenter is found to have so much influence on the epidemic spread then the government should seal off the city as epicenter immediately without hesitation furthermore if the subway is shown to be very statistically significant in the transmission one should close the subway system promptly we understand that these are all difficult decisions to make in the urban management however since it may take a very long time for the scientific research to reveal the hidden mechanism of the virus spread we cannot wait for months or even years before the infection numbers go exponential therefore if we can observe some influential factors with statistical significance at the initial stage of the outbreak we should act quickly to cut off the transmission chain by any possible methods we have in addition this study also provides insights to urban planners for example this paper has discussed the role of public green space in the epidemic although the corresponding coefficient shown in the paper is not quite significant its negative sign indicates that proper urban planning with more available open space can be essential to the fight with various disasters and catastrophes as for the epidemic of covid-19 two major temporary hospitals with 3000 beds are built promptly in wuhan citys open space to treat patients with severe symptoms many more temporary hospitals are also prepared in the city for the proper medical treatment of patients with mild symptoms or for quarantine use later when the situation gets much better in china in late march and early april 2020 people restore their recreational activities in open green spaces but the gathering activities in the indoor recreational facilities are still restricted the above two scenarios are all good examples of the important uses and roles that the green open space in the cities can play as the epidemic situation is still going on and evolving quickly around the globe this study provides a timely analysis of the spread of the infection among cities in mainland china now the epidemic in china tends to be stable but the situations in many other countries are still getting worse the methodology and main conclusions shown in this paper are of general interest and they can be applied to other countries to help understand the local transmission of covid-19 as well as concerns exist that the worse situation is yet to come the findings and implications of this research may offer methods of preventions to minimize the damage of the disaster from the urban perspective in the other word this study may provide valuable and timely hints and clues to the local fight with the terrible disease the above implications also apply to the economists and urban scholars to allocate scarce resources optimally is what the economists do thus economists can do a lot of contributions in the battle with covid-19 where urban scholars can add more from the city related perspectives undoubtedly economists and urban scholars can do more to the solutions of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic worldwide in this sense this paper is just a beginning all by lu liu all data utilized in the present study are publicly available the author declares no competing interests  a cascade of causes that led to the covid-19 tragedy in italy and in other european union countries igor rudan   the perception of the covid-19 pandemic in my homeland croatia has been based on two main sources of information over the past three weeks on the one hand our civil protection headquarters as well as all of the experts and scientists to whom media space has been provided called for caution but without any panic they emphasized that this was not a cataclysm but an epidemic involving a serious respiratory infectious disease the cause of this disease is the new coronavirus for which we do not have a vaccine therefore it can be expected that the disease will be very dangerous for the elderly and to those who are already ill so it was an unknown danger worthy of caution but our epidemiologists remained calm they knew that they would be able to estimate the epidemics development using data and then control the situation with anti-epidemic measures and through several lines of defence 1 on the other hand the people of croatia also followed the events in italy from there day after day apocalyptic news came with incredibly large numbers of infected and dead daily reports from italy seemed completely incompatible with what the experts and scientists in croatia were saying some have concluded that a scenario similar to that in italy if not worse is inevitable for croatia the population was in a very confusing situation in this text i will try to penetrate the very core of the infodemia that has been present in the media across many european countries as well as on social networks over the past three weeks i will explain how that disturbing situation arose and offer a scientific explanation for it this seems important at this point because the italian tragedy with the covid-19 epidemic has unfortunately hindered the credible and scientifically-based communication of the epidemiological profession to the population of croatia in my article 20 key questions and answers on coronavirus posted on the 9th of march 2020 on indexhr 1 in answer to question number 18 with the effectiveness of quarantine in china can we draw some lessons from this pandemic i stated if the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the public health systems of individual countries are functioning these will be very important lessons in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerous we are now slowly entering a phase where many countries have been exposed to the pandemic for sufficiently long to be able to make some first estimates of their results from these days up until the end of the pandemic we will see that covid-19 will divide the world into countries that have relied on epidemiology and followed the maths and the logic of the epidemic as well as those in which this isnt the case and many sadly probably quite unnecessarily  will suffer an epidemic is a serious threat to entire nations during which citizens interest in other topics may vanish quite rapidly we could see that happening quite clearly in the past several weeks the task of epidemiologists is to constantly have tables in front of them with a large number of epidemic parameters reliable field figures and formulas to monitor the epidemics development and to know the laws of epidemics in order to organize the implementation of anti-epidemic measures in a timely manner and thus protect the population now lets look at the countries that we can already point out as being successful in their response to this new challenge first and foremost there is china it has completely suppressed the huge epidemic in wuhan which spread to all thirty of its provinces in doing so it relied on the advice of its epidemiologic legend 83-year-old zhong nanshan twenty years ago nanshan gained authority by suppressing sars although surprised by the epidemic they managed to suppress covid-19 throughout china through expert and determined measures they did so over just seven weeks with the death toll eventually coming to a halt at less than 4000 2 by comparison it would be as if the number of deaths in croatia as a result of this epidemic was kept at around 14 in total furthermore if at some point you find yourself caught up in the uncertainty surrounding the danger of covid-19 you should be able to learn more if you look at the state of things in singapore despite intensive exchanges of people and goods with china since the outbreak of the epidemic singapore has a total of 732 infected people as i am writing this article with two dead and 17 more in intensive care 2 for a long time this city-state has been nurturing the ambition to lead the world in all measurable parameters from this it must be concluded that the developments in singapore are a likely reflection of the real danger of covid-19 in a country that is based on knowledge technology good organization and general responsibility also singapore had a relatively recent sars experience and learned from it so they built capacity and ensured speed in their response to future challenges the situation in singapore therefore is an indicator of the effects of the virus on the population to the extent that it is truly unavoidable any deviation towards something worse than the singaporean results will be less and less of a consequence of the danger of the virus itself and increasingly attributable to human omissions in doing so human errors that can lead to the unnecessary spread of the infection are 1 omission to properly understand the epidemic parameters 2 reluctance to make decisions based on the changes in those parameters and 3 the irresponsible behavior of the population in complying with instructions from the authorities to confirm the statements about singapore lets look at the current situation in other countries that rely on knowledge and expertise and have good organization they were also the most common destinations for the spread of the epidemic from china in the first wave hong kong japan south korea the united arab emirates and qatar there were only 519 infected people in hong kong at the time of writing this article with 4 deaths and 5 more people in a serious condition in japan 1499 were infected 49 were dead and 56 were in a serious condition in south korea which had a severe epidemic behind its first line of defence 9478 were infected 144 died and 59 were seriously ill in the united arab emirates 405 were infected 2 died and 2 were seriously ill and in qatar 562 were infected 6 were seriously ill and still no one had died from covid-19 2 fortunately croatia is now up there with all of these countries with 657 infected 5 dead and 14 more seriously ill 2 as you can see pretty clearly from all of these figures in countries that rely on the knowledge and the profession and properly applied anti-epidemic measures covid-19 is a disease that should not be life-threatening for more than a tiny percentage of all infected people this conclusion can still be reached if it is properly understood that the information on the number of cases and deaths at the website httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus 2 is based on positive tests and not on everyone who is actually infected we need to do further research to understand the denominator for the case-fatality rate properly what then is happening in italy as well as in spain but to a good extent also in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and portugal i did not include germany sweden the netherlands the united kingdom and the united states in this group of countries for now this is because at least for some time during the pandemic they have clung to the idea of intentionally letting the virus spread and infect at least part of the population given all of the previous examples of a successful epidemiological response and what is now practically the coexistence of people with the new coronavirus in asias most developed countries how is it possible for italy to have nearly 85 000 infected people and over 9000 deaths at the time of this article or that spain has 72 000 infected people and more than 5600 deaths and france has almost 33 000 infected people and 2000 deaths or that even switzerland which everyone would expect to see among the most successful countries in any of these world rankings could already have 13 250 infected people and 240 deaths with 203 more critically ill people 2 the causes of all of this are however becoming increasingly clear to science first of all there was probably a premature relaxation around the real danger of covid-19 in europe the epidemic development by the end of february was already quite similar to the one seen previously with sars and mers in both of those epidemics the primary focal point was suppressed then the virus was stopped using the first line of defence  identifying all those infected tracing their contacts and isolating them all  in more than 25 countries by the end of february 2020 it was already clear in the case of covid-19 that it would be successfully suppressed in its primary focal point  wuhan it was also already stopped using the first line of defence in another thirty chinese provinces and surrounding countries in asia then on the 28th of february the first estimates of death rates were published suggesting that it was a disease with a death rate significantly lower than that of sars and mers 34 at that time it was reasonable to expect that the epidemic could soon be stopped as a result the world health organisation delayed the declaration of a pandemic until the 11th of march and the world stock markets increased by about 10 percent from the 27th of february to the 3rd of march 56 but for any unknown virus premature relaxation is very dangerous as will be shown later with covid-19 second it is possible that chinese tourists from wuhan were visiting northern italy in january and february 2020 fever does not accompany all covid-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission is possible so infected tourists could have been allowed to enter italy even where proper checks at the airports were in place 4 italy cancelled flights linking it directly with china on january 31 following the news of the epidemic spread 7 some investigative journalists hypothesized although this has not been confirmed that it may be possible that the phenomenon of the mass immigration of chinese workers to northern italy may have contributed to the early introduction and spread of the virus 8 tens of thousands of chinese migrants work in the italian textile industry producing fashion items leather bags and shoes with the brand made in italy they worked in conditions where they were cramped closely together which would facilitate the spread 8-10 reuters and the reporter d t max wrote about this phenomenon back in 2014 and 2018 respectively 910 partly as a result of this development direct flights between wuhan and italy were introduced previous reports claimed that there may be many illegal migrants among those workers 910 whether through chinese tourists textile workers or through some other route the novel coronavirus has triggered an epidemic behind the back of the italian first line of defence which remained unrecognized in the first few weeks third infected people from northern italy spent their weekends at european ski resorts although we do not know if the arrival of the warmer weather will stop the transmission of coronavirus what we can assume is that the cold helped it to spread that is why european ski resorts became real nurseries of coronavirus in late february and in early march as many media reported 1112 in this way more infected people emerged behind the front lines of defence in france switzerland belgium austria denmark and spain their first lines of epidemiological defence focused on air transport from asia not on their own skiing returnees where indeed no one would expect a large number of chinese people from wuhan to be fourth although spain may not have had as many skiers as other european countries in this cluster the virus may have been introduced to them through a biological bomb on the 19th of february a champions league football match was held between italys atalanta and spains valencia atalanta is a team from a small city of bergamo italy which has 120 000 inhabitants this was possibly the biggest game in atalantas history as it progressed through group stages to the last 16 in the european champions league the local stadium was not large enough for everyone who wanted to attend the game so it was moved to a large san siro stadium in milan the official attendance was 45 792 meaning that a third of bergamos population with around 30 busses travelled from bergamo to milan and then wandered the streets of milan before the game 1314 unfortunately for spain nearly 2500 valencia fans also travelled to the match as atalanta scored four goals a third of bergamos population was hugging and kissing in the cold weather four times and spent the day closely together this is likely why it became the worst-hit region of italy by some distance moreover at least a third of valencia football squad also got infected with a virus and later played alaves in the spanish league where further players of that team got infected this football game has certainly contributed to the virus making its way to spain 14 fifth it is very important for the early development of the epidemiological situation in each country to look at which subset of the population the virus has spread among northern italy has a very large number of very old people in the early stages of the epidemic the virus began to spread in hospitals and retirement homes 1516 they did not have nearly enough capacities to assist in severe cases among already sick elderly and immunocompromised people the virus spread more easily and faster and had a significantly higher death rate in some other countries such as germany most of the patients in the early stages were between the ages of 20 and 60 and were returning from skiing trips or were business people 17 therefore such countries have a significantly lower death rate among those first infected sixth this is likely the most important factor required to explain the current situation in italy and other european union eu countries there must have been either the omission to monitor the mathematical parameters of the epidemic or perhaps the lack of clear communication of the dangers or the indecisiveness to adopt isolation measures for the population it is difficult to know at this time which of these three causes is the most important  a combination of them all is entirely possible however the nature of the omission largely explains the terrible figures on infections and deaths that are being reported from italy and other eu countries on a daily basis to understand the tragedy in italy and europe we must first return to wuhan when the epidemic broke out the chinese first had to isolate the virus then they needed to read its genetic code and develop a diagnostic test it all took time as the epidemic spread rapidly throughout the city when they began testing for coronavirus between the 18th and the 20th of january they had double-digit numbers of infected people 3 those numbers apparently stagnated so the epidemiologists did not know what that might mean but on the 21st of january the number of newly infected people jumped to more than 100 on the 22nd of january it jumped to more than 200 3 this was a clear signal to chinese epidemiologists that an exponential increase in the number of infected people was occurring at that time they had nothing further to wait for or to think about if the virus breaks through the first line of defence  and the chinese didnt even have any since the epidemic started there unannounced  then a quarantine measure needs to be triggered this prevents the virus from spreading further and generating a large number of infected people through the exponential growth of the epidemic after such a sudden declaration of quarantine in wuhan the huge epidemic wave had actually just begun to show everyone who was already infected began to develop the disease in the next several days the maximum daily number of new infected cases was reached on the 5th of february on that day alone as many as 3750 new patients were registered in wuhan 3 this means that the jump from about 125 to about 250 newly registered infected persons signals to epidemiologists that they should expect an epidemic surge in 14 days with as many as 3750 newly infected people at the peak let us now explain the time delay between people getting infected with a virus and the health systems ability to detect those infected based on their symptoms the new coronavirus kills primarily because it spreads incredibly quickly among humans as a result it creates a gigantic number of infected and sick in a very short time period table 1 among those who are sick about 5 will require intensive hospital care if all of them could receive optimal care we would be able to save nearly everyone but if they all get very sick at the same time then we cannot offer adequate care to everyone as a result most critical cases will die this is the main reason why this virus kills so many people in those countries which allowed it to spread freely for too long this is shown in a simple way in this table based on day-to-day growth in a number of cases by 26 which was a very realistic scenario for most eu countries with this in mind let us now look at the italian and other eu countries reaction to their own epidemic in view of what croatia did in the early stages of infection spreading in a country one or two infected persons are usually detected daily personally i advised the croatian authorities and public through social networks to start seriously thinking about social exclusion measures when they noticed a first notable shift from the first 10 confirmed infections towards the first 20 infected people on the 12th of march i posted a facebook status entitled contrast is the mother of clarity which was viewed and shared by many thousands of my fellow croatians who have been following my popular science series on the pandemics  the quarantine of wuhan this status has also been shared by many online and printed newspapers and media in croatia including radio stations 18 in that status i suggested that croatia should consider a large quarantine because we had already jumped from 14 to 19 infected people the day before however i also warned them to weigh this decision carefully against economic implications and their expected long-term effects on health the very next day on the 13th of march a decision was made in croatia to close the schools 1819 that meant that up to that point croatia completed two of the most important tasks in this pandemic the first task was to hold its first line of defence this was being achieved through the identification of infected cases imported from other countries and their isolation and that of all their contacts croatia completed this first task better than the other eu countries based on an average percentage increase of cases between the 3rd of march and the 17th of march then from march 13th croatia also began to introduce social exclusion measures at the right time thus successfully carrying out the second key task in controlling its own epidemic many credits for this should be attributed to its epidemiologists who work at the croatian institute for public health but what went wrong with these two measures in italy and other eu countries on the 21st of february the number of confirmed infected cases in italy jumped from 3 to 20 as italy is a more populous country than croatia it might have still been too hasty to send all of lombardy into quarantine based on this but on the 22nd of february the jump was from 20 to 62 cases and this should lead to some serious thought about social isolation measures a couple of days later on the 24th of february they reached a situation very similar to that in wuhan before a strict quarantine the number of confirmed infections jumped from 155 to 229 this was particularly worrying in italy because they did not seem to proactively test at that time either the jump from 155 to 229 in combination with the wuhan experience should have suggested that they would have at least 50 000 infected people under the predicted curve of the epidemic wave and they were just seeing its early beginning of it such a large number would imply that about 2500 affected would require intensive care units at the time lombardy had only about 500 such units in governmentstate facilities and another 160 in private health care facilities 20 as early as the 24th of february it was clear that there would be many deaths in lombardy weeks later with epidemics everything goes awry because the infected get sick a week later and some of the patients then die ten to twenty days later this time delay is a critically important factor that needs to be taken into account however even then the italians did not declare a quarantine they did not do so on the 29th of february either when the total number of infected people rose from 888 to 1128 those figures implied that in mere days they would be having about 15 000 newly infected people each day they did not declare quarantine on the 4th of march either when the number of infected people exceeded 3000 and when the world stock exchanges started to fall again it had then become clear to most epidemiologists who have been advising global investors that an unexpected tragedy was about to unravel in italy and this was now inevitable at that point italy already had at least 30 000 infected people spreading the infection the quarantine was declared for lombardy on the 8th of march 7 the day before the number of cases had already risen and exponentially so to as many as 5883 to appreciate the problem with epidemic spread in the population behind the first line of defence this is similar to borrowing 1000 from someone on the 29th of february with an interest rate of 26 each day meaning an interest rate of 26 on top of that the next day and so on furthermore there did not seem to be enough clear and decisive communication with the public the news of the quarantine for lombardy was in fact leaked to the media before it was officially announced this led to a quick escape of many students to the south of the country to their homes carrying the contagion with them as a result on the 10th of march all of italy had to be quarantined 7 in an already difficult situation where every new day of delay meant another thousand or more people dying as we can all notice these days there were numerous media reports warning that the population may not have taken those measures as seriously as the chinese when they introduced orders to their population in wuhan 2122 any indiscipline under such grave circumstances could have allowed the virus to take yet another step quite easily with each new step another 26 of interest was added to everything before that and then 26 on everything on everything before that again that is the power of exponential growth characteristic of the free spread of the virus in the population many italians and then spaniards as well as residents of several other wealthy countries in europe had their lives cut short by their lack of recognition of the dangers of exponential function during the spread of the epidemic delaying quarantine for a week made the epidemic ten times worse than it should have been delaying it for two weeks made it a hundred times worse and after two weeks of it being finally proclaimed all those who may have not taken the orders seriously enough would have made the epidemic several hundred times worse this means that in italy and possibly in spain too we are now observing the covid-19 epidemic that is more than a hundred times worse than it should have been in a country that was much better prepared for the response such as singapore taiwan hong kong or the united arab emirates to appreciate what is happening in italy it is enough to think of this sentence alone at least 100 times fewer people would die each day if quarantine had been declared 2 weeks earlier and had the population stuck to the recommendations during those fourteen days between 23rd of february and 7th of march they allowed the virus to spread freely and infect a huge number of people  maybe even up to a million or perhaps more it is very difficult to know at this point this would mean tens of thousands of people in need of intensive care with about ten times fewer units available nationwide about half of those who fall seriously ill will not survive without the necessary support at this point whenever we hear that 1000 people died in italy in one day we should know that the casualties would only add up to 10 had the quarantine been declared just a couple of weeks earlier i appreciate that it seems implausible that the delay of a political decision like the introduction of quarantine by just two weeks may mean the difference between 100 deaths and 10 000 deaths in the 21st century however i am afraid that this is unfortunately the reality of the exponential growth of the number of infected during an epidemic what does this mean for the public in countries like croatia who were confused and in awe of the events in italy they should know that they did not observe what the covid-19 epidemic should actually look like in a country where the epidemiological service and its communication with those in power works well as it does in singapore taiwan or south korea in italy we have unfortunately noticed the consequence of a free spread of the epidemic for too long such a development was not predictable the biggest surprise of this pandemic to date to the community of epidemiologists is undoubtedly the lack of response by the authorities of many eu countries to the apparent spread of the pandemic at an exponential rate for weeks leading to a very large numbers of infected people in a very short time it is even more surprising that although the italian example exposed this problem quite clearly a similar scenario is now happening in several other european countries how and why could this happen in italy and then in other countries in the european union eu i will try to offer at least some hypotheses first eu countries have been living in prosperity for decades focused mainly on their economies aside from the economic questions they have not had any challenges that theyve had to answer to swiftly and decisively that would measure up to this one back in the 1960s vaccines were introduced against most major infectious diseases especially childhood ones malaria is no longer present in europe and tuberculosis has been treated similarly for decades the challenge of hivaids in the 1980s is now being successfully controlled with antiretroviral drugs liver inflammation is treated mainly by clinicians the impact of influenza is controlled through vaccination while rare zoonoses are resolved with immunoprophylaxis even sexually transmitted infectious diseases stds are no longer as significant since the vaccine for human papillomavirus hpv was licensed the last real epidemic that concerned europe was the hong kong flu which occurred back in 1968 and 1969 the broad field of biomedicine offers such a wide range of exciting career paths to all those students who study it these days but the epidemiology of infectious diseases is not really one of them  or at least it hasnt been in europe for a very long time it has probably begun to seem like an archaic medical profession to the majority of students and young medical doctors it seemed to belong to the past for the european continent which made it one of the least attractive things to specialize in even the rare epidemiologists who specialized in infectious diseases have begun retraining for chronic non-communicable diseases due to the aging of europes population which is particularly the case in italy and spain it seems that at least some eu countries may have fallen victims to their own decades-long success in the fight against infectious diseases they faced this unexpected pandemic with few experts that could have had any experience in these events asian countries as well as canada have had enough recent experience with sars and mers but some european countries seem to have forgotten how to fight infectious diseases if it were not for the legacy of the great croatian epidemiologist social medicine expert and global public health pioneer dr andrija tampar and the relatively recent war in croatia it is difficult to say whether or not croatia would be as ready as it has proven itself to be another factor that would understandably undermine the italian response was that no one before italy in fact could have observed how fast covid-19 was spreading among the population the greatest danger of covid-19 is its accelerated exponential spread when it breaks through the first line of defence but before italy only the chinese in wuhan and the iranians had experienced the free spread of the infection among their population after five days of monitoring the number of infected the chinese had to quarantine the entire wuhan and then further 15 cities a day later in order to contain the virus they did not know how many infected people were there outside of wuhans hospitals for iran however only a few knew exactly what was happening as that country is significantly isolated internationally due to political reasons the koreans however had a limited local epidemic but not an uncontrolled free spread  they caught the virus using their first line of defence that is how the italians ended up becoming the first country in the highly developed world to monitor their epidemic spreading uncontrollably among the population the only estimate of the rate of spread of the virus to date has been in the scientific work of li et al from the 29th of january 23 however it was difficult to subsequently determine r0 parameter on the first 425 patients in wuhan the estimate of the r0 for covid-19 in their article was 22 but with a very wide confidence interval  from 14 to 39 it is a bit of tough luck for the italians again that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 14 exactly this figure is well known to all epidemiologists its the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community it should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that with more data r0 for covid-19 would start converging more towards 14 unfortunately the more recent data suggests that r0 is more likely to lean towards 39 implying an incredibly fast spread thus the greatest danger of covid-19 remained unrecognized in italy until the 8th of march quarantine measures at least 100 times fewer people would be dying in italy these days had they declared a quarantine for lombardy two weeks earlier than they did just a few days ago an extremely useful piece of scholarly work authored by onder et al became available 24 their contribution finally provided answers to the three great unknowns about covid-19 many hypotheses have been presented in the media to explain the developments in italy since the very outbreak of the epidemic but thanks to just one simple table we can now dispel most of them the first is the question that has plagued us for a long time  how dangerous is covid-19 for younger age groups it is clear that the media will tend to single out individual cases of death in younger people as they are of most public interest however it is interesting that until recently we didnt really have decent data on this in the public domain the first reason was that the chinese centre for disease control reported all deaths in the chinese epidemic using age groups structure that contained a very large age group of 30-79 years it only separated children up to 10 years then adolescents up to 20 years then 20-29 year-olds followed by this broad age group 30-79 years and those who were 80 years or older that is why the work of onder and colleagues is commendable as they subdivided this large group from china into 10-year age groups this finally allowed a comparison between the first 1023 deaths in wuhan up to the 11th of february with the first 1625 deaths in italy up to the 17th of march the comparison is shown in table 2it gives us some very important insights first in italy more than half of the deaths initially were among people who were older than 80 years of age and a total of 88 of the deaths occurred among the persons over 70 years of age so contrary to the impression that individual media reports can easily make covid-19 is a very dangerous disease mainly for old people moreover a recent study by a and g remuzzi 25 showed that among 827 deaths in italy the vast majority of those people were already severely ill with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease diabetes and malignancies this is what epidemiologists expected because a more severe flu would have had a similar effect if there was no vaccine available however i doubt that the general public has the proper insight into this issue from the prevalent media reports second it was suggested in the media across europe that the virus in italy may have mutated and become much more dangerous however table 2 shows that death rates by the age of 70 are practically the same in china and italy then although the case fatality rate appears to be about 50 greater in italy than in china for the age group 70-79 this does not suggest that the virus may have mutated it is known that in wuhan many of the affected with a severe clinical presentation of covid-19 could rely on the two newly built hospitals and respiratory aids that the military had brought in from other parts of china 26 they also had medical teams coming in from other provinces 26 in italy however there were not enough respirators for this age group and there werent enough doctors either as many of them themselves became infected 1620 for those two reasons i would in fact expect even a larger difference between italy and china than the one we are seeing so i would not attribute this observed difference to the impact of the virus itself and finally the reported difference in case-fatality rates for the oldest age group should also not be attributed to the virus it is more likely a consequence of the fact that italians of lombardy live on average longer than the chinese of wuhan 27 therefore there are significantly more people in the oldest age group in italy ranging to much higher ages so the two oldest groups are not really comparable the average age of the italians in the age group 80 years or older is significantly greater than the average age of the oldest chinese age group therefore the table shows practically equal death rates across all age groups on sufficiently large samples meaning that the virus did not mutate in italy from the virus we see from wuhan at least not until the 17th of march 2020 third and perhaps most importantly  this chart has now made it quite clear that covid-19 does not in fact kill people under the age of 50 unless they have some sort of underlying disease or some unknown achilles heel in their immune system that makes them particularly susceptible to the virus there are such cases with every infectious disease they are also present during the flu epidemics but they are extremely rare this suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses here after this table it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available however at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years too there is another strangeness to the situation in italy that will not be intuitive to the general public the actual number of deaths attributable to covid-19 in italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends namely at present due to the sole focus on the epidemic most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to covid-19 however once the epidemic is over it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years it could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month or a year even without being infected with the new coronavirus it is possible that among some of them covid-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels and those above expected levels will then be attributed to covid-19 this article provides an explanation from the epidemiologists point of view for most of the events reported so far in italy and then followed in spain and other european countries a combination of an early relaxation over this epidemic systematic lack of expertise in the field of epidemic infectious diseases in europe likely inexperience in containing epidemic spread in this generation of health workers relaxed immigration regulations for workers in certain industries champions league football event and a series of further misfortunes and omissions have all been implied so far in the media as contributors to the late withdrawal of lombardy into quarantine this allowed through exponential growth for a large number of people to be infected in a very short time  far too large for health systems of italy and other eu countries to cope with severe forms of illness led to many deaths due to respiratory failure in 88 of cases people over 70 years of age died who had underlying illnesses in the large majority of cases this viewpoint is based on the first 1625 deaths in italy and by the time of this writing there are now more than 10 000 dead given the size of the population this would correspond to 670 deceased in croatia if croatia manages not to follow the numbers of deceased seen in italy this will mostly be attributable to social exclusion measures being introduced early enough for its health system to come with severe cases these days the people of italy spain and other european countries are suffering large losses a significant underlying cause may be the problem that the human brain simply cannot intuitively grasp the power of exponential growth nor that two weeks of delay could make the difference between 100 and 10 000 deaths any physics enthusiasts will know the quote attributed to the great albert einstein who is often cited saying that compound interest which leads to exponential growth is the most powerful force in the universe or the eighth wonder of the world he who understands it earns it he who doesnt pays it 28  targeting the worlds slums as fat tails in the distribution of covid-19 cases robert buckley m   as is detailed below this kind of program would be expensive these high costs and the concerns that some lower-income country policy-makers are hoping that pandemic will not hit hard have led to delays against incurring such costs 8 for example the fact that african countries are spending 08 of 1 of gdp on fighting the virus while richer countries are spending 8 suggests that many poorer countries have indeed been slow to act 9 this argument could of course be countered with humanitarian arguments for saving lives however there are at least two stronger economic counterarguments on behalf of undertaking such a program first the value of the lives saved even under conservative assumptions will far exceed the costs of the assistance and the economic disruptions that prophylactic policies would entail and second the deeper reduction in per capita income possibly for a longer period of time will similarly be multiples of the likely program costs 10 11 nevertheless some may agree with the policy-makers who are concerned about the nature of the bet for undertaking public spending on fighting a virus that either may not appear or may appear in a mild form in such a case the program costs would be real while if the virus does not appear its costs would not however in just 10 weeks the virus has already affected more than three million people in 190 countries 12 there is no reason to expect this rapid spread to stop at the door of poorer countries moreover the virus comes at an inauspicious moment for emerging economies it has accompanied a sharp drop in real oil pricesa central driver of sub-saharan africas growthto 1950 levels 13 job losses of migrants in north america europe and the middle east that will greatly reduce the remittances they send home remittances which are multiples of foreign aid sent to the affected countries 18 developing countries in debt distress or high risk of debt distress 14 and perhaps most of ominously an emerging deep contraction in global gdp 15 the longer it takes to place the bet the larger the bet will have to be to realize the same gains waiting is costly in lives and treasure 16 the largest expenditure of these items would be the grants required to fund the living expenses of the poor who work largely in the informal sector usually on a daily basis one way to begin to think about the costs involved in pursuing a lockdown in these locations of the sort being undertaken in most countries is to consider the per capita income of the population of developing countries the imf estimates that in 2019 dollars this was 5380 17 slum inhabitants of course have a lower than average per capita income but exactly how much lower is difficult to say for a number of reasons first because in most cities the share of the population in slums exceeds the poverty rate so by definition many slum dwellers are not in poverty second urban income levels tend to be on the order of 20 above that of their rural counterparts so the average urban per capita income is higher in cities than the national figure 18 to get a very rough sense of how much funding would be required a figure that could be much more accurately estimated suppose the per capita income of slum dwellers is one-fifth of the average national figure ie about 1100 providing that level of support for 3 months to the roughly one billion slum dwellers less than 3 per day comes to 275 billion and that amount it is important to remember is only a beginning 19 more may well be needed over time the point is not that the estimate is accurate but that almost certainly it will be a very large amount and it is a significantly larger amount than the funding that the international institutions have pledged in additional assistance 19 to consider just how large this figure is consider how it compares with the new efforts to respond to combat covid-19 the african development bank has established a 10 billion emergency fund 20 the world bank has similarly developed a 14 billion emergency fast disbursing health loan mechanism and a 160 billion fast disbursing coronavirus relief fund in addition along with the imf the world bank is calling for 14 billion in debt relief by bi-lateral donors as a first step in a more comprehensive program 21 these programs should help address some of the health-related expenditures taken to fight the virus at the same time the government of india has budgeted 23 billion for income relief during a 21-day lockdown while the brazilian government is discussing a separate coronavirus war budget of 100 billion also to provide income maintenance for informal sector workers cumulatively these amounts are clearly significant but much of their focus is on the health-related concerns and general income assistance rather than on where the resources can be most effectively targeted to reduce the spread of the virus the slum-coronavirus paper also calls for foundations to help fund income maintenance for slum dwellers this approach i believe would be a mistake the amounts needed could easily go beyond what even large foundations could provide on a sustainable basis a far better would be the approach that the rockefeller foundation followed in new orleans in the wake of hurricane katrina or that of the ford foundation in detroits revival in both cases as well as in the gates foundations imaginative approach to funding for the development of the manufacturing capacity for seven of the most promising vaccines the aspiration was to focus on innovation rather than subsistence 22 in the gates case it went beyond just securing the supply chains to try to help build an essential one more rapidly the funding supports different vaccine options in the hope that at least one of them will work so that a vaccine can be quickly produced at scale immediate food assistance is also given priority by the slum-coronavirus paper this recommendation is vitally important given the problems with the access to food described in the world banks recent review of the effects of covid-19 on sub-sahara africa 23 a slow response in these communities could lead to starvation and increased immune deficiency in addition food prices in many emerging economies particularly in sub-saharan africa are already much higher than is the case in developed countries and it is likely that they will increase rapidly 24 particularly when it is noted that breakdowns in supply chains are already occurring 25 one step that can contribute to less price gouging while simultaneously having minimal adverse effects on supply would be to declare a moratorium on rent payments the paper calls for a stop to evictions this step will almost certainly increase rent arrears going further and stopping rent payments altogether would provide immediate relief to poor households and allow them to use these funds to purchase the food needed so that malnutrition does not weaken the immunity needed to resist the virus the reduction in the income of landlords could be compensated for at a later date nobel laureate paul romer argues that if testing can be applied to 7 of the population even with a high rate of false positives and those found to be infected were isolated for 14 days it would be possible for the numbers afflicted to not continue to expand 26 such a level of testing will not be achieved in emerging economies for example in iceland the worlds leading tester 10 of the population has been tested 10 weeks after the first case 27 so instead of striving to achieve such high levels of testing resources could be targeted on geographical areas and occupations that would allow this to be achieved with lower rates of testing slum communities provide rich samples of both populationsthose whose location and informal occupationswhich again put them in the so-called fat tails of the distributions of those likely to be affected moreover within those communities more precise targeting such as of food vendors could be highly productive such fat tail targets are particularly attractive when it is recognized both how important testing is and that the numbers tested are likely to be far lower in emerging economies it may be even more important if the uncertain etiology of the virus is asymptomatic as some early survey results indicate may be the case as a number of recent studies have shown if covid-19 is indeed asymptomatic the much higher economic costs of lockdowns can be reduced if testing is available so that those infected but not ill can return to work less economic activity can be shut down 28 the result would be lower economic costs without an increase in sickness and death four measures are possible masks social distancing housing and migration to the countryside of the first three policies a recent study of african countries indicates that while masks and social distancing are helpful the most effective policy by far is to shield the vulnerable 29 a step that requires that some portion of the population be moved to more isolated housing the relative importance of shielding in turn has implications for how assistance is distributed after a slow start in providing masks even for healthcare workers it is now recognized that masks are an effective way to slow the virus spread 30 hundreds of millions of masks are now being produced at low costsmask prices were on the order of 2 apiece in the usa before the crisisso even with price surges the main difficulty with this measure is the logistical one of moving large quantities of them to the right places of course effective in reducing the spread of the virus as the incidence of covid-19 has been greatly reduced relative to model predictions in countries that have practiced such actions however the question remains as to how much social distancing can occur in settlements where the density is many times that of new york city where that citys lower density has played a significant role in the citys high rate of infection 31 the slum-coronavirus paper calls for the building of new housing near to current locations to help reduce density this measure too could be highly effective and the world bank has experience in supporting many such projects both for disaster relief reconstruction and sites and services for new housing once again however the difficulty is not in providing the good it is in the logistics of how it should be done how can sufficient trust be developed so that the residents of slum communities agree that such relocations are not part of efforts to simply tear down the slums and destroy the housing of those who live there such destructions have a long history and their violence was one of the motivations for the world bank to begin to provide support for sites and services projects to create the trust needed to isolate the sick and the infirm requires community buy-in another target of testing would be those who chose to migrate back to rural areas ideally they could be tested and certified as virus free before being allowed to migrate but such constraints and regulation are not likely to be achieved perhaps the tracking app for phones that is now under development by google and apple offers some promise on this score the papers foremost recommendation is to recognize and enhance the community organizations that can serve slum communities without the trust and guidance about the rich sources of information as to who lives in a community what are the most important needs and how best to address those needs in the highly idiosyncratic situations it is impossible to engage community members in addressing the very deep problems they face certainly efforts to shield the most vulnerable by separating them from their families as was done in china would face strong opposition without trust in the implementer in effect community organizations can serve as the agents of donors who are trying to protect both the communities and the broader societies they can help guide resource flows to those who need it most as well as to incorporate community knowledge about how to best use the resources on first blush quickly establishing viable slum community groups to undertake such action would appear to be an impossible task but this is not the case as the slum-coronavirus paper indicates slum dwellers international sdi is an organization that has already established internet-based methods of sharing skills and practices across more than 30 countries for hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers 32 it has supported the implementation of large world bank loans and government programs in india south africa and elsewhere moreover sdis approach in some respects is more akin to developing a franchise than it is to building a community organization from scratch it provides fledgling community groups with a handbook and internet support as well as cross country visits to enable newly formed organizations to quickly establish community cohesion and sustainable community organizations this approach could easily be augmented by the webinar-based learning called for banerjee and duflo on how to most effectively address some of the concerns raised by the pandemic 33 in thinking about the concerns of the vulnerable populations who reside in the slums of poorer countries it is of course essential to recognize the existential threat to the lives and well-being of the hundreds of millions of people who live there this threat should be motive enough to move quickly to provide the support needed and while it is clear that significant steps have already been called for and are beginning to be implemented it is also useful to think beyond the humanitarian motivation for assistance in this connection a biblical parable used by john maynard keynes often referred to as the father of macroeconomics is adaptable to the current situation he was discussing the role of profits in a capitalist economy and compared it to the endless supply of oil that was magically provided by a cruse or cup used by a widow to provide assistance to elijah he writes thus profits as a source of capital increment for entrepreneurs are a widows cruse which remains undepleted 34 in other words no matter how entrepreneurs spend their profits it does not diminish their wealth the supply of such income like the oil in the widows cruse is endless with only slight exaggeration and unfortunately it may be said that a similar situation applies to the effect that the large number of slum dwellers can have on supply of those infected by the coronavirus at least until a vaccine is found without assistance and if they act only as individuals rather than as communities they will be ravaged and in their attempts to flee from their disease-burdened locations the virus will continue to spread 34 thus the population of these communities present two high quality targetsdensely populated locations as well as large numbers of people who cannot isolate themselves because they have to work in order to live and because they live in such crowded conditions targeting assistance on them makes macroeconomic sense as well as providing distributional justice  community pharmacists and communication in the time of covid-19 applying the health belief model ronald carico ron jordan sheppard c thomas borden   in late 2019 the world health organization was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan city in china the novel coronavirus responsible for this outbreak was named 2019-ncov1 and the disease the virus causes is now known as covid-19 coronavirus disease 20192 the previously-unknown virus in question was later found to be highly transmissible with the average infected person spreading the disease to up to 3 other people3initially reported case fatality rates ranged from 25 to 34

5 prompting a global response communities around the world have been advised to stay in their homes as much as possible avoid gatherings frequently wash their hands or employ other hand hygiene techniques remain at least 12 m away from others social distancing and avoid touching their faces to avoid or delay transmission of 2019-ncov1

2 these guidelines would severely hamper many day-to-day activities if implemented at a high level of fidelity so voluntary compliance is likely to be uneven at best healthcare professionals across all settings are now caring for and communicating with patients in a context of high uncertainty the ultimate impact of the covid-19 outbreak will not be clear for a long time but greater adherence to the lifestyle modifications suggested by healthcare and public health organizations will greatly delay the spread of the disease this in turn will keep hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed for example hospitals are overburdened in parts of italy which is projected to have approximately 80 of its total icu beds occupied by covid-19 patients before april 20206 as healthcare professionals with a high public availability community pharmacists are likely to be many patients first option for health information patients may present to community pharmacies for refills or new prescriptions prescribers may cancel non-urgent appointments which would make the community pharmacist a sole point of in-person contact with the healthcare system it is therefore imperative that community pharmacists be equipped with knowledge and tools to communicate clearly and effectively with patients about ways to limit the impact of covid-19 as the situation continues to develop over days and weeks instead of months and years community pharmacists are unlikely to have a ready-made and field-tested communication toolkit regarding covid-19 until after the time to act has passed in situations such as these evidence-based public health frameworks can provide a useful temporary measure in much the same way that prescribers may rely on data from small open label trials until data from higher-quality trials are available these public health frameworks can act as a checklist that pharmacists and other healthcare professionals can use to guide their communication and reinforce healthy behaviors one such framework is the health belief model hbm the hbm was originally developed to study why patients may not seek screening for tuberculosis7 and is one of the most prominent public health frameworks for understanding why individuals may or may not act in the face of a threat to personal or community health the hbm has been used for decades to study vaccination medication adherence diabetes self-care condom use and other behaviors that require modification of a patients actions to mitigate a threat to health8

9 like many public health behavior models the hbm studies behavior at an individual and community level by conceptualizing the determinants of behavior into several contributing factors called constructs the hbm has evolved over time and many modified forms are present in literature this article will operationalize the hbm as pictured in fig 1
 adapted from champion and skinner7 broadly the hbm suggests that individual beliefs and direct cues to action inform behavior in turn beliefs are informed by ones background and are comprised of ones impression of the perceived threat the perceived benefits to taking action the perceived barriers to taking action and ones perceived ability to take action ie perceived self-efficacy the purpose of this article is to explain how community pharmacist can use the constructs of the hbm as a communication guide to move patients toward behaviors that will limit the spread of covid-19 all constructs of the hbm are underpinned by an individuals background and experiences thus the community pharmacist should bear in mind the patients demographic characteristics socioeconomic status and knowledge base these things will interact directly with the constructs that comprise individual belief in the united states for example persons of lower socioeconomic standing may not have access to all of the tools needed to overcome all perceived barriers to action persons of differing ethnic backgrounds may react differently to calls for social distancing due to varying cultural attitudes and norms regarding interpersonal interactions an exhaustive list of how all modifying factors may interact with other hbm constructs in the context of covid-19 is beyond the present scope though some thoughts on modifying factors will be provided when discussing other constructs of the hbm as community members themselves community pharmacists are uniquely positioned to understand how these factors may impact their patients community pharmacists are encouraged to consider how their patients perspectives on covid-19 may differ from their own and to modify communication strategies accordingly perceived threat and its predicatesperceived susceptibility and perceived severitymake the hbm well-suited to studying or modifying behaviors that may contribute to adverse health outcomes in the hbm an individual is considered more likely to take appropriate action if the perceived threat of the disease is large in turn the perceived threat will be larger if the perceived severity is largerthat is the disease is regarded as a serious problem similarly perceived threat will also be larger if perceived susceptibility is largerthat is the adverse outcome is regarded as something the individual could reasonably experience when considering covid-19 in the context of the hbm community pharmacists may be poised to act most directly and most powerfully on these constructs educating the community on health risks is a core function of community pharmacy in most places and community pharmacists are likely to be trusted members of their communities acting on these constructs may mean educating on individual- or community-level threats incorporating patient-level modifying factors and epidemiological findings as appropriate for example early data strongly suggest that older patients with the disease are more likely to experience viral pneumonia hospitalization or other significant adverse health outcomes the odds of death may be as high as 15 in patients over the age of 804

5 patients are also more likely to experience severe illness with covid-19 if they have diabetes copd or cardiovascular disease at baseline or if they smoke or are male5
 conversely pharmacists must be careful to avoid implying that there is no threat to younger healthier individuals the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that 38 of covid-19 hospitalizations may have occurred in patients under the age of 5510 it may be worthwhile to ask patients if they would tolerate a comparable chance of a similarly-negative avoidable outcome such as an automobile accident that results in injury community-level threats may also be salient to those at lower individual risk if a younger individual is from a culture that places a high value on family or the elderly the pharmacist may want to underscore the risks of transmitting the disease to family members or older community members again the pharmacist could ask if the individual would drive recklessly with valued family members in their automobile for instance some discretion may be needed when interacting with members of the community who have anxiety disorders obsessive-compulsive disorder or other mental health concerns that may predispose to unhealthy fixation on the threat posed by covid-19 when interacting with these individuals community pharmacists may instead choose to leverage other constructs in the hbm to motivate behavior change without producing undue distress such as perceived benefits and perceived self-efficacy this may be an exception to previous guidance to deploy as many constructs of the hbm as possible example questions to assess threat constructshow big of a problem do you think the coronavirus ishow serious do you think it would be if someone like you got the coronaviruswhy do you think someone like you might contract the coronavirus
 in the hbm perceived benefits are benefits that the individual may expect to accrue by undertaking the behavior in question this is distinct from simply avoiding an adverse health outcome which is covered by threat-related constructs for example a person who engages in smoking cessation behavior may avoid the perceived threat of chronic lung disease but may also accumulate the perceived benefit of having more money due to decreased expenditures on tobacco in the case of the behaviors suggested in response to covid-19 community pharmacists may struggle to identify perceived benefits without knowing the individual in question however as previously noted personal relationships with community members are a unique strength of the community pharmacist perhaps patients who shift to a work-from-home paradigm will find they have more free time due to decreased commutes for instance more time at home may also mean more time with family members which could be welcome conversely it may also be an excellent opportunity to spend quality time alone if that is perceived as valuable spending time away from crowds may present an opportunity to cultivate a hobby or habit such as reading or hiking as time permits the community pharmacist may wish to explore the patients perspective on benefits may come with spending more time at home example questions to assess perceived benefitsare there any benefits to spending more time at home what are thosewell what are some of the things you havent had time to do around the housewhat hobbies havent you had time for
 perceived barriers in the hbm are things that the individual feels may prevent them from making the desired behavior change in general as perceived barriers increase the individuals likelihood to engage with the behavior decreases therefore exploring ways to mitigate or remove perceived barriers will help individuals engage with the behavior in question in the case of covid-19 prevention behaviors perceived barriers are likely to be profound in many cases many cultures are not configured to operate with minimal contact outside of the home for extended periods in most industrial and post-industrial economies people will likely need income to afford housing food and other essentials because of population density people living in urban areas may find it difficult to practice effective social distancing when they must leave their residences additionally some individuals may find the psychological distress that comes with spending more time away from others or the fear of the disease to be a barrier in its own right other individual factors may present special barriers such as having to find appropriate childcare following school closings many of these barriers may be beyond the capacity of a community pharmacist to resolve in a brief encounter but the pharmacist should be willing to work with and appropriately reassure a concerned patient as time constraints allow financial and vocational barriers are likely to be most profound with persons of lower socioeconomic status individuals who can work from home may be those whose jobs revolve around information technology in some way those jobs may be higher-paying conversely those in manufacturing or service sectors may find they suddenly have severely restricted income these individuals may therefore aggressively pursue any work outside the home community pharmacists can help address these barriers when they arise by supplying contact information for local governmental and nongovernmental organizations that may provide support for people who are experiencing economic distress these resources may include social workers local government aid agencies or even food pantries example questions to assess perceived barriershow difficult do you think it will be to stay at home unless you have to leavewhat might keep you from staying homei know some people are having trouble paying bills right now would you like information on community resources for you or people you know
 perceived self-efficacy is the belief that one has the ability to overcome a given challenge note that perceived self-efficacy is distinct from actual self-efficacy if one does not actually possess the ability to overcome a challenge then perceived barriers are likely to be present instead perceived self-efficacy focuses on whether an individual feels empowered to pursue tactics that are likely to result in success many times perceived self-efficacy is essential one does not finish what one does not start and one does not start what one feels they can not finish community pharmacists can help patients who express difficulties with perceived self-efficacy with respect to covid-19 prevention behaviors this may be as simple as listening to concerns regarding isolation and social distancing then reinforcing positive steps that have already been taken pharmacies can reinforce self-efficacy beliefs by working with patients who experiment with mail order refills drive-through pharmacy or other contact-minimization methods these measures can be presented to patients as proof of their ability to take effective action ultimately it will be vital to understand the individual and their contexts the preexisting relationships community pharmacists have with their patient populations will again be invaluable example questions to assess perceived self-efficacyhow likely is it that you can take action to distance yourself from othershow overwhelming is the idea of coronavirushow confident do you feel about the future right now
 in the hbm cues to action are prompts that remind individuals that they should act on a particular challenge this is another construct that community pharmacists are likely to act on in the course of everyday practice in the past this may have meant reminding patients of medication adherence behaviors or counseling on smoking cessation in the context of covid-19 prevention behaviors it may mean reminding patients standing in line to practice social distancing or advising patients who exhibit symptoms of covid-19 to quarantine themselves for the length of time suggested by their doctor community pharmacists should take care to practice cultural competence when providing guidance some communities and individuals will want their healthcare professionals to be cooperative and consultative while others may prefer simple clear directions from an expert covid-19 presents a unique challenge to public health effective mitigation of the disease will require nontrivial efforts from a significant fraction of the world population including social distancing and avoiding unnecessary interactions with others no matter how stringently these measures are recommended a fraction of people may not believe that they can or should act in ways that will limit the threat the hbm is a model that has been used to study behaviors related to preventing or mitigating disease it conceptualizes beliefs about disease as being comprised of the perception of the threat as severe and relevant the perception of benefits of and barriers to acting and the perception of ones intrinsic ability to act as trusted community-facing healthcare professionals pharmacists are uniquely suited to bring about change in patient behaviors community pharmacists using hbm to reinforce covid-19 mitigation behaviors should appropriately emphasize the severity and susceptibility of the threat emphasize barriers to acting help patients identify ways to overcome barriers to acting and reinforce self-efficacy beliefs public health frameworks such as hbm are not entirely foreign to pharmacy as a profession the transtheoretical states of change model has been used in the context of smoking cessation11 while the profession is likely less aware of other frameworks such as hbm there is reason to believe that pharmacists can deploy tools like hbm effectively ideally such a deployment would be accompanied by strong assessment tools however the speed with which the covid-19 situation is evolving necessitates a less evidence-based approach than might otherwise be used limitations of the hbm must be acknowledged unlike some other public health frameworks it does not directly incorporate constructs such as social norms and community assumptions which are instead baked in at the level of underlying demographic factors it is also unclear if the hbm applies directly to an effort as large as the ones being mobilized to combat covid-19 however this critique could be levied at most approaches that might be brought to bear on this unique situation community pharmacists are likely to have a direct role in combating misinformation and helping patients select healthy behaviors to that end the hbms constructs of perceived threat perceived barriers perceived benefits perceived self-efficacy and cues to action can be immediately deployed to help reinforce covid-19 limiting behaviors such as social distancing and remaining in the home whenever possible this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors  can india stay immune enough to combat covid19 pandemic an economic query bijoy rakshit daisy basishtha   the outbreak of covid19 which was initially conceived as a chinesecentric shock has now been understood to be a global crisis with the number of cases increasing rapidly the world health organization who on march 12 declared covid19 as a global pandemic the unprecedented outbreak of the virus has brought considerable human sufferings to every sphere of human lives in addition to the public health emergency the crisis has unpredictably hit the world economy the operations of the world economy have substantially come to a halt the economically challenging measures adopted across the countries such as bans on traveling imposing restrictions on labor mobility shutting down manufacturing companies and sharp cutbacks in service sector activities to contain the disease have produced enormous adverse effects on the economy however an accurate empirical assessment about the size and persistence of the pandemic and its likely impact on the world economy is yet unknowable the earlier pandemics sars avian flu mers had affected particularly those countries that were economically less dominant moreover the magnitude of the previous pandemics was much smaller than covid19 the effect of this virus is however economically different the number of infections is frequently changing on an hourly basis the top most affected economies out of the outbreak are united states italy china spain france united kingdom and germany these economies accidentally happen to be the worlds largest economies as well g7 economies have witnessed exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases these economies account 60 of the worlds demand and supply 65 of the worlds manufacturing and around 40 of manufacturing exports baldwin  di mauro 2020 therefore there is a saying going around that while these large economies sneeze the rest of the world will get the cold unctad projects that the slowdown in the world economy as a result of the outbreak of covid19 will cost around 1 trillion dollars according to the united nations the sudden decline in oil prices has been the major contributing factor to the global economic slowdown figure 1 highlights the loss in gdp growth worldwide although the pandemic is likely to affect the advanced economies most emerging economies like india cannot stand unaffected governments in many countries have expressed their concern and imposed lockdown to mitigate the rapid spread since india has imposed 21day lockdown nationwide with anticipation of extending it later the economic activities in the country have reached to a near halt by suspending the production process the states are incurring huge economic cost gollier and gossner 2020 the current situation of covid19 clubbed with plummeting economic growth has pushed the developing countries like india into a volatile market condition among all south asian countries india has recorded the maximum number of active coronavirus cases as of april 13 there has been total 9241 number of covid19 cases in india with 331 deaths figure 2 explains the total number of confirmed cases in india before the outbreak of covid19 indian economy had already been experiencing economic slowdown over the past few quarters the economy was already reeling under rising unemployment low consumption and weakening industrial output and prices precovid19 the economy was witnessing sluggish economic growth compounding the existing problems of rural distress malnutrition and widespread inequality furthermore indias vast informal sector is particularly vulnerable in 20172018 out of nations 465 million workers around 91 422 million workers were associated with the informal sector these economic constraints along with the current supply side shock have put the economy on an adverse situation it will be challenging to predict the scale and speed of the effect of covid19 on any economies however there is no doubt that the impact will be much pronounced than the demonetization in 2016 and 2017 gst rollout it appears to be apparent now that these two events that caused shocks to the economy and yet not recovered fully there is another shock ahead for the economy to face the similarity with the 2016s demonetization and 2017s gst does not end at their economic impact the indian economy was going through 6year low growth rate at 47 in the third quarter of the current fiscal year in the events of declining domestic investment and mean consumption rate several monetary and fiscal policy measures were taken to recover the growth rate at the end of the last quarter rbi in its biannual monetary policy report has emphasized that the outbreak of covid19 pandemic has drastically altered the outlook of the indian economy and it has been the high time for the policymakers to formulate some monetary and fiscal measures to curb the economic slowdown in india1 as the situation has not turned normal and the number of cases is increasing worldwide as well as at national level it has been anticipated that the occurrence of the virus will further deteriorate the recovery process in the near to medium term the outbreak has put a new set of challenges before the country by spreading its dangerous effect on both demand and supply side from a public health perspective the ability to contain the outbreak in india will primarily depend upon the strength of the public health system in india as the number of confirmed cases in india is on the rise the capacity of the public health system in combating the pandemic is being questioned by the experts indias expenditure on health as a percentage of gdp is lower than the poorest countries in the world according to the national health profile in 2019 india spends only 128 of its gdp as public health expenditure2 world health organization ranks india 145 among 195 countries in terms of health care access and quality india ranks much below than china 48 sri lanka 71 bangladesh 133 and bhutan 134 in south asia the human resources and physical infrastructures of the public health system in india stand at an inferior stage while the private health care system is flourishing in india more than 65 population does not have health insurance putting massive pressure on the public hospitals in order to ensure the public health first the government of india on march 24 had announced 21 days effective nationwide lockdown the main objective of the lockdown was to maintain social distancing and suspend all forms of travel so that it can prevent the spread of infection from the infected at the community level india has very less number of hospitals and testing centers in india there is only one hospital per 47000 population states like himachal pradesh and arunachal pradesh have 12 and 16 hospitals respectively for per lakh population maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of coronavirus cases in india has only one hospital for every 16 lakh population statistics also reveal that on average there is only one doctor for 10700 people in india given this poor medical condition in india a genuine question arises how well prepared is indias public health system to deal with this crisis3 while testing needs to be an essential part to fight the crisis and contain the spread india does not have enough kits to test most of its population for the new coronavirus as of april 9 india has conducted a total of 144920 tests recording lowest test rates per capita in the world some states in india have reported no tests so far4
 given the background this article attempts to answer a very crucial question that what is the economic effect of covid19 on the indian economy in general and its impact on different sectors in particular however before we discuss the economic repercussion of the pandemic we first and foremost consider this outbreak as a human tragedy there are no parameters that can account the human sufferings which the pandemic has brought as the outbreak of covid19 is spreading like wildfire some of the current economic explanations may stand redundant as the crisis evolves this article potentially reflects our perspective of covid19 on the indian economy as of april 13 through this article we address the following three aspects of covid19 pandemic in the context of the indian economy first we examine the effect of covid19 on different sectors of the economy such as the agricultural sector manufacturing sector and the service sector second we will highlight how the bilateral trade relation between india and china has been affected due to the outbreak third we present the impact of 21day nationwide lockdown on social consumption in india finally we conclude the article by highlighting the growth projections about india and recommending some policy implications boone 2020 identifies three relevant channels through which the pandemic can affect economic activities across the countries our study will be based on these three crucial channels
supply channel the first important channel is the supply channel with the disruptions in the production unit closures of factories irrespective of sizes cutbacks in the service sector especially the financial sector can result in a significant disruption in the global supply chain
demand channel as a consequence of the outbreak there will be a fall in demand in the travel and tourism sector the decline in the education services decline in trade contraction in demand for entertainment and leisure services
confidence channel the third crucial channel is the confidence channel amidst the global uncertainty there is a fall in the confidence pattern of consumers as there is less consumption of goods and services to contain the spread several containment measures have been adopted by several countries which are likely to affect the consumer and financial market confidence spillover effects are being transmitted through finance and confidence channel to financial markets
 the pandemic has disrupted the agriculture activities and supply chains the monetary loss occurred to the agricultural sector in india amidst the outbreak of covid19 has been tremendous the nationwide lockdown has put the future prospectus of the agriculture sector at stake amidst the uncertainty the sector has been encountering several challenges as the labor mobility and movements of goods have been affected nonavailability of migrant labors is causing problems in harvesting activities the north and west region encountered significant problems as wheat and pulses are not being harvested on time there have been disruptions occurred in supply chains also because of the 21day lockdown in the country and subsequent bans on transportations and other activities it is being predicted that the sector is likely to get a double hit due to the recent uneven monsoon and economic contagion that the sector is facing as ravi harvest season is approaching farmers across the states are worried about their crops lying unharvested in the field the cultivation of wheat pulses and mustard has already witnessed a decline in its productions owing to untimely and heavy rainfall with the cases farmers and agricultural laborer are fleeing to their homes in the wake of this coronavirus lockdown farmers income is going to be affected severely following are the points through which we will highlight the negative effect of covid19 on indian agricultural sector first the supply chain of agricultural products will be heavily affected due to the coronavirus lockdown in india the 21day lockdown nationwide has created hindrance in the interstate movements of trucks carrying the essential agricultural commodities owners of warehouse and cold storage have complained over the lack of available labor supply in the agricultural sector second the outbreak can also affect agriculture and allied activities through its effect on the poultry sector the fastest growing sector in the indian agriculture ecosystem apparently india ranks third in terms of egg production and fifth in terms of the producers of broilers however due to the misinformation spread on social media and linking meat consumption to the coronavirus disease the sector is facing huge losses on a daily basis there has been a sudden fall in demand for poultry products and farmers are facing lower prices for their poultry products third as the restaurants and hotels are shut down the demand for agricultural products are plummeting in india as a result there has been a fall in the prices of farm products by 1520 in the time of this uncertainty in exports5
 the pandemic has hit the manufacturing sectors across the globe in different ways since the outbreak initially emerged in the manufacturing heartland of the world east asia it is likely to disrupt the global supply chain in the industrial giants with the further spread of the virus the manufacturing sector across the world will experience a similar hit the supply chain contagion will create a direct supply shock to the manufacturing sectors in the less affected nations the less affected nations would find it harder to import the raw and possessed materials from the hardhit economies as a result of the pandemic subsequently there will be a demand disruption in both less affected and hardhit economies owing to the macroeconomic drops in aggregate consumption demand baldwin  di mauro 2020 the indian economy was already struggling hard to recover from the economic slowdown prior to the outbreak however the continuing outbreak of covid19 in india has made the possibility of revival difficult as several sectors in the economy are witnessing an adverse effect of covid19 even the finance minister has assured that the government will take some stringent measures to help the manufacturing industries mainly the msmes to reduce the effect of covid19 on the sector on the manufacturing front the impact of the coronavirus will depend upon to the extent the sector is connected to china the pharmaceuticals and automobile industries are already facing the effect as the pharmaceutical industry is strongly linked to china the supply chain of raw materials of drugs has been affected immensely though india is considered to be the top exporters of drugs in the world it depends heavily on the import of bulk drugs in the financial year 20182019 india had imported around 24900 crores of bulk drugs and the import constitutes approximately 40 of the domestic consumption6 indias dependence on china for the import of many critical antibiotics and antipyretics accounts close to 100 the largest production unit of pharmaceutical in himachal pradesh is undergoing the lockdown incurring huge manufacturing loss in india on the other hand with the disruptions in the supply chain the automobile industry in india has also seen a severe impact the coronavirus outbreak not only has affected the automobile industry but also hit the automotive components and forging industries china accounts for 27 of exports of auto components in india and considers to be the leading supplier in india as the manufacturing industries in china were shut down in the wake of the coronavirus crisis many indian automobile companies have suffered the losses several automobiles companies including mahindra and mahindra mm tata motors and mg motors in india have announced that they are facings constraints in the supply of auto components from the virushit china7
 as far as the chemical industries are considered the local dyestuff companies in india relies on china and imports several raw materials such as chemicals and intermediates from china due to the ongoing crisis the delayed shipments and the rising prices of raw materials are affecting the dyes and dyestuff industry particularly in gujarat the production of these items has been impacted by 20 due to the disruptions caused in the supply of inputs from china the spread of covid19 can also affect the electronic industries located in india china being the largest supplier of both final and raw material of electronic products the electronics industry in india fears supply disruptions economists are often criticized for producing bad records in predictions acknowledging the fact beck 2020 has recommended several ideas to interpret the effect of covid19 on the financial markets to him the effect of the coronavirus on financial markets will depend upon three significant conditions first to what extent the virus will further spread and its effect on economic activities worldwide second the effective implementations of fiscal and monetary policy to the crisis third the centrals banks and regulators reactions to the possible bank fragility applying these three conditions we examine the impact of covid19 on the indian financial system the effect of the coronavirus and the lockdown it triggered is visible on the financial markets in india the banking sector in india was already going through a crucial time even before the emergence of the crisis the collapse of yes bank created some hue and cry in the banking sector amidst the anomalies in the economic activities and deteriorations in the quality of the assets the rating agency moody has revised the prospectus of the indian banking system to negative from stable8 the outbreak of the virus will affect the profitability of banks adversely as there has been an increase in loanloss provisions and a decline in revenues the deterioration in the assets quality across micro small and medium enterprises msmes corporate and retail segments will induce a huge pressure on banks capitalization capital infusions to the public sector banks psbs as done by the governments over the past few years can mitigate the pressures on bank capitalization given the current situation where the private sector banks are facing default the growing risk aversion faced by the old private sector banks will put funding and liquidity pressures on small private sector banks the outbreak has also hit investor confidence in the financial market investor sentiment has been so low that despite relatively lower cases reported in india the indian stock market has fared worst among global peers indian stock market has lost 26 in dollar terms between february 1 and april 9 compared with a decline of 20 and 14 in european and united states markets9
 in this strongly connected world the effect of covid19 on international trade is inevitable the outbreak of covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the bilateral trade relation between india and china china has been the major importers of indian products that include jewelry seafood and pharmaceuticals as far as the total exports of diamond and pharmaceuticals are considered india exports 36 of diamond and 34 of pharmaceuticals to china as the outbreak has primarily disrupted the manufacturing activities in china and other parts of the world united states and europe it is hitting the indian exports significantly due to the restrictions imposed on exports to china it is expected that there could be a fall in the price of petrochemical products in india reports released by chinese official reveal that between january and late february trade between both the countries fell by 124 year on year when the outbreak was spreading in china it had affected the exports and imports in both countries chinas exports to india stood at 671 billion yuan dropped by 126 on year on year basis whereas the imports from india was declined by 116 to 18 billion yuan10 according to unctad estimates the loss occurs to indias trade as a result of covid19 pandemic would stand around us348 million india is among those 15 countries that have been affected severely as the outbreak disrupted manufacturing industries in china and destroyed world trade in case of india the effect of covid19 on trade is estimated to be worst for the chemical sectors with a loss of 129 million dollars whereas the damage has been estimated to be 64 million dollars for textiles and apparel apart from this several other trading companies such as automotive electrical machinery leather products wood and furniture products are likely to be affected by this coronavirus crisis the pandemic is also expected to have affected the domestic fisheries sector as the sector has incurred huge losses with its fall in exports to china the bilateral trade between india and china is also tied by the agricultural products as the agricultural products have been witnessing a negative trend in india it is also hitting the agricultural markets across indopacific region including china the main objective of the initial announcement of 21day lockdown followed by its further extension till may 3 has been to ensure social distancing social distancing interventions can be effective against fighting the pandemic but are potentially detrimental to the economy koren  pet 2020 business and corporate companies that depend heavily on the face to face communications or close physical proximity while producing a product or service are particularly vulnerable the idea of social distancing has been proven effective to contain the rapid spread of the epidemics hatchett mecher  lipsitch 2007 markel et al 2007 wildersmith  freedman 2020 many countries across the world have implemented the practice of social distancing by closing down schools prohibiting large community gatherings restricting nonessential stores and transportation in an effort to contain the spread anderson heesterbeek klinkenberg  hollingsworth 2020 thompson serkez  kelley 2020 in this regard questions arise that what are the economic effects of such social distancing previous research has established the efficacy of the implementations of social distancing on reducing the spread of epidemics 1918 spanish flu in the united states bootsma  ferguson 2007 hatchett et al 2007 markel et al 2007 and seasonal viral infections in france adda 2016 are the notable examples it does not require a trained economist to assess the impact of the complete social and economic lockdown of india on the supply side of the indian economy this lockdown will bring massive disruptions in the production and distributions of goods and services except for the essential commodities in an effort to contain the rapidly spreading coronavirus a fall in social consumption can severely affect the gdp of an economy as people are getting aware about the community transmission of the disease they are maintaining social distancing and cutting back social consumption loss in social consumption is partly considered as a permanent loss however reductions in social consumption may not necessarily amplify all scenarios by the same degree and magnitude this is due to the reason that demand and supply in the market are complementary to each other if closing down the educational institutions and banning public events result in people taking more off from their works then it will create supply shocks in such a situation demand shock will have less scope to do damage asian development bank adb has projected that the outbreak of covid19 might incur economic in indian from 387 million to 299 billion in terms of personal consumption losses in order to assess the economic effect of the outbreak on developing economies in asia adb has categorized four possible scenarios these scenarios are the bestcase scenario moderate case scenario worsecase scenario and hypothetical worstcase scenario under the bestcase scenario it has projected the loss to be 387 million for india if the spread is contained by travel suspension and taking some precautionary measures after 2 months from late january in the occurrence of a moderate scenario the loss is likely to be hit by 640 billion imposing some restrictive policies in place and with the continuation of some precautionary measures for the next 6 months under the worstcase scenario the personal consumption expenditure in india will fall by 12 billion oecd as against the growth predictions made in 2019 now amidst the global uncertainty oecd has revisited the growth forecast in the case of india considering the grave economic situation it has revised the growth by lowering down by 110 basis points to 51 for the financial year 20202021 and subsequently by 80 bps to 56 in 20212022 when it comes to global economic growth oecd has revised down it by 50 bps against the prior projections made in november 2019 due to the intensification of the spread and its possible economic consequences on manufacturing and service sector activities fitch has reduced its growth projection from 51 to 49 in 20192020 according to fitch this lower economic growth is driven by domestically weak demand for many consumable items and disruptions in supply chains after examining the effect of covid19 on the indian economy and its different sectors this study recommends some policy actions both for the shortrun and long run effective implementation of easy monetary policy by considering a repo cut of 50 basis points and extending the period from 90 to 180 days in recognizing the nonperforming assets npas can provide stimulus to the financial sector corporate social responsibility csr can also play a significant role in mitigating the effect of covid19 spending on pandemic mitigation measures should be a part of csr initiatives to minimize the effect the government should induce more capital to the public sector banks in india micro small and medium enterprises msmes should be given easy and cheap credit as these companies are worst affected by this pandemic the msmes industry provides more than 100 million employment opportunities and contributes 166 to indias gdp post the crisis the employees associated with the sector will experience a decline in their incomes government should provide some incentives to the employees to compensate for the loss that they are facing owing to the lockdown farmers and agriculture migrant workers should be included in the several assistance packages announced by the government and any social protection programs addressing the crisis should include the migrant labors unemployed informal workers should be provided cash income support through jan dhan financial inclusion program given the status of indias poor health care system government expenditure on public health care should be substantial to ensure all the required medical facilities to the people india has reported a very low number of coronavirus tests the government should ensure the supply of masks gloves and medical kits to the health workers to contain the virus since the agricultural and allied activities are heavily affected and there has been a fall in aggregate consumption in the country except for the essentials direct benefit transfers to the farmers can improve the demand for agricultural products post the pandemic due importance should be given to research and innovation so that scientist and researchers can find an effective way to address the crisis in addition to public health the government should also help vulnerable households by providing them with temporary direct benefit transfers such actions of the government would support the households to compensate for the loss of their incomes arising out of work shutdowns and layoffs international cooperation and development aid from the developed countries to less developed countries can be proven effective during this crisis  national governance of public health responses in a pandemic mary dobbs   whilst the nation state and westphalian sovereignty remain the starting points when considering regulatory powers within a territory and engagement on the international sphere these are not set in stone and considerable variations arise thus multilevel governance and regulation theories acknowledge the reallocation of authority upwards downwards and sideways from central states 5 this begs the question of how to determine where the core powers ought to rest one potential mechanism is by applying subsidiaritya broad concept with roots in ideas of democracy catholicism and economics or effectiveness 6 it focuses on the proper geographic distribution of power 7 this broadly argues that powers ought to rest at the lowest level possible due to democracy unless it would be more effective to allocate them at a higher level 8 there are three key steps in order to apply subsidiarity with a range of considerations within them 9 the first relates to the interests in question it is necessary to identify them and consider how significant they are to the various levels or constituents to what extent homogeneity or heterogeneity exists eg regarding objectives balance with other interests and broad approaches and the capacity of other levels to accommodate the heterogeneity in the context of public health this normally includes considering issues such as whether there is broad consensus on acting as a welfare state or not and the balance with other societal issues where resources are insufficient as well as opinions on related issues such as the approach to the economy and markets whilst each state shares values and goals of strong public health and also a resilient economy with both closely intertwined in the long term there is clearly no broad global consensus on the balance between values and approaches to them the second entails considering the question of effectiveness or efficiency this includes identifying where the relevant expertise andor knowledge lie including whether there is access to resources at a different level or not in many contexts this may include local and experiential knowledge where scientific or other expertise is central to decision-making centralisation of both the research and the decisionmaking may be efficient as lower levels may not have the necessary resources and gaps could arise 10 however in cases of uncertainty the value of full centralisation may be more questionable it also includes identifying the potential for externalities whereby one bodys decisions can impact on external bodies and vice versa and the potential to internalise those externalities or not by centralising where there are significant negative externalities this would support centralisation then finally a balancing act must be undertakenmaking for a very complex calculation where the division and re-allocation of different powers across several levels may be appropriate but how does this then apply to covid-19 and the surrounding decision-making whilst still part of public health covid-19 goes beyond the norm firstly covid-19 is highly contagious and spreads swiftly and easily 11 this is accentuated by potentially long incubation periods and the potential for an individual to be contagious even though they are asymptomatic the virus also remains viable on surfaces such as paper and plastic for some time facilitating the spread further without control measures the spread has proven to be exponentialwith us all now becoming too familiar with steeply increasing graphs and the term r0 12 nor is this limited to one area or country due to a combination of the above factors in conjunction with the widespread travel of individuals and products the virus has spread globally and become a pandemic furthermore covid-19 has devastating effects we have no vaccines no tailored effective treatments and no built-in resistance or partial immunity to covid-19 whilst most will be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms it can be fatal with the elderly ill and those with underlying conditions 13 being particularly vulnerable and it also can cause severe impairments in the short and long termalthough the extent of these impairments is still to be fully understood 14 this has further knock-on effects as some public health systems are overburdened to the point of collapseillnesses or injuries that should be manageable cannot be properly treated appointments and treatments are postponed and discussions arise about triage for both covid-19 and non-covid-19 patients 15 the combination of the highly contagious nature and severity of impacts is worrying it also provides for clusters of cases affecting specific groups and industries including both healthcare workers exacerbating the public health impacts once more and other 11 eg rm anderson h heesterbeek and d klinkenberg how will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the covid-19 epidemic 2020 39510228 the lancet 931 12 reproduction number the mean number of new cases an infected person will create 13 a vague term that presumably is meant to reassure us as the majority who die have underlying conditions but without clarity to date as to what this involvescould this be a broken legand also deprecating the value of those who have died who are elderly ill or with such conditions 14 essential workers in global supply chains 16 as well as the economy reflected in the imfs report all of these feed into each other and risk circular short-and long-term effectswhere the virus is present and elsewhere consequently there is the potential for severe externalities by the virus itself if left unmanagedbut this does not mean that the governance of it would lead necessarily to externalities also but is effective governance possible a final major concern for the moment which impacts upon every nation as they react to this is the underlying uncertainties 17 we do not understand the disease fully gathering data and hopefully understanding as we go that uncertainty relates to when an individual is contagious the morbidity levels how to test for the virus how to test for antibodies how long a person might be immune for and how to treat or prevent it in future whilst major strides are being made with each of these aspects uncertainty still remainsin particular regarding antibodies immunity and vaccines furthermore testing and subsequent contact tracing for the disease is sometimes flawed and frequently limitedhampering understanding and making for patchy data to underpin decision-making consequently any decision-making is based on the precautionary principle whether express or otherwise and it becomes more challenging to identify clear pathways to address the pandemic effectively that also minimise countervailing riskssomething that may in itself justify national rather than international approaches even whilst benefiting from the centralisation and sharing of scientific data in light of the goal of public health the ideal options would be widespread immunity of the entire population andor complete eradication of the virus with effective treatment as a support mechanism however besides the surrounding uncertainty nation states have different capacities and any response has countervailing risks consequently nation states have chosen different approaches the core responses include herd immunity 18 flattening the curve 19 and complete eradication 20 1 herd immunity is where a sufficient proportion of the population have immunity to a disease so that no further members of the population are likely to be affected in the future for diseases such as polio this is largely achieved through vaccination 16 l petetin the covid- but as there is no current vaccination for covid-19 to achieve this now would entail initially enabling the spread of a disease through a population as with chicken pox parties 2 flattening the curve involves trying to control the spread of the disease so that the increase in cases especially those requiring medical treatment hospitalisation and specifically the use of ventilators is slowed eg until r0  1 and remains within the capacity of the public health system this is about buying time enabling capacity-building development of effective treatments and hopefully a vaccine in order to achieve this social distancing is essential and contact tracing is a key mechanism 3 eradication could be achieved through complete immunity of the population but equally can be achieved through preventing the spread of the disease r0  1 and eventually r0  0 identification and quarantining of every single actual or potential case in the population as well as cleansing all potential contaminated areas are essential it should be noted that these can overlap and also may include cocooning vulnerable individuals testing for the disease and testing subsequently for antibodies each of these approaches in theory could be viable and acceptablewe use these approaches when addressing issues such as colds flus or chicken pox however there are numerous issues that challenge their effectiveness and appropriateness in the context of covid-19 beyond issues of the rate of transmission the potential for the virus to remain viable on surfaces or to transmit to and from animals the potential for asymptomatic individuals to transmit the virus and the virus already being in situ within the population there are a few other key concerns firstly the impacts of the virus are not negligible herd immunity is desirable but the current mechanism to achieve it is dependent on the spread of the disease with resulting deaths and severe impairments for members of the population cocooning may protect the vulnerable but we do not know who precisely is vulnerable and from the daily death rates in hotspots we are seeing that either cocooning is not working or the vulnerable are a much larger proportion of the population than we thought those pushing for flattening the curve may try to claim a moral high ground but individuals are still badly affected by covid-19 and for both there are knock-on effects on other treatments and the economy on the other hand social distancing and lockdowns can impact negatively on both the economy and mental and physical health secondly there is no certainty that immunity following recovery will arise or last long enough to prevent continued outbreaks 21 due to the ongoing uncertainty we cannot conclude that an individual cannot contract the virus a second time if they do it might not be as severe but their bodies may already be physically damaged and it could lead to covid-19s continued circulationnecessitating continued cocooning of the vulnerable this is relevant to all three approaches as it undermines the herd immunity approach entirely but also may necessitate more extended and more restrictive measures for flattening the curve and eradicationfor instance public healthcare workers treating covid-19 patients could repeatedly contract and transmit the virus thirdly we do not know when an effective vaccine will be developed and made available in sufficient quantities the same applies to more effective treatments it is hoped that these will be developed rapidly but this is by no means guaranteed and testing will be required to ensure their safety it might be that the only short-or long-term immunity possible is through contracting the disease and recovering states may not be able to maintain social distancing or lockdowns due to practical constraints such as a lack of resources including finances clearly we need further information in order to know what approaches might be the most effective and acceptable in the long term returning to subsidiarity though perhaps this indicates that a decentralised approach to policy-making here is appropriate after all it relates to public health varied balance of values worldwide with little scientific certainty and where culture may play an important role however even if effective the variations raise a further significant issue that challenges individual national approaches as we shall see each nation state has the potential to impact negatively on the others and likewise to be impacted upon if one returns to the three core approaches and presumes that they are each effective in principleherd immunity will arise case numbers and severity can be controlled andor the disease can be eradicated within the populationsimply reflect on the global nature of our society and the continued shifting nature of our populations if we change the proportion in a population who have immunity or introduce new sick individuals who need treatment or simply introduce new carriers to the population each approach will be set back and have to start again if vulnerable individuals are no longer cocooning they risk catching the disease and being severely impacted consequently one states approaches will impact on others 22 the alternative continued controls on entry into each nation state and restrictions on travelwith entry potentially limited in future to those who have certificates of immunity akin to yellow fever certificates or who are willing to be quarantined for weeks one reason why new zealand 23 has been able to take the eradication approach is that they started testing prior to any cases presenting symptoms and quarantined anyone entering the state however crucially they are also an island distant from most other countries and entry other than by plane or ship is highly challengingand even so a single case in the future could lead to a new outbreak before it can be controlled and bear in mind for instance the potential for unreliable tests and false negatives contrast this with the eus normally porous borders or the federal states within the usaentry can be limited via airports and ports but the extent of the land borders makes absolute control infeasible furthermore the photos of romanians flying to germany and the uk to pick fruit and vegetables in the midst of a pandemic highlight the existing supply chains dependence on migrant workers 24 similarly the importance of a supranational or global approach or at least considerable cooperation and collaboration is seen in the flurry of activity and competition for resources most nation states are under-resourced generally but especially are not prepared for pandemics and do not have adequate resources in situ in part due to the economic costs and the lack of need on an ordinary basis 25 nor are states typically self-sufficient in the production of protective testing or treatment equipment or components including ventilators or chemical reagentswe are dependent on both domestic and imported materials that dependency is now coming to the fore with shipments to one country being intercepted by other countries bidding wars between states in the usa 26 with president trump refusing to intervene when asked by states 27 and threats to block exports to other countries including canada 28 yet the stories are not all negativecountries are fast-tracking the production of necessary supplies and distributing these worldwide including as donations whilst others are taking in patients for treatment from overburdened countries or sending their own healthcare workers to assist 29 the pandemic merely highlights what we already know the issue is not merely the limited resources but also the control of the distribution of resources and access to them the benefits of centralisation for decision-making regarding policies and resource distribution are clear they facilitate coordinated decision-making where externalities become internalised and the long-term effectiveness of the policies is facilitated whilst there is some centralisation internationally with the who and within the eu with the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc this primarily involves the gathering and sharing of scientific evidence and provision of guidance 30 the eu

created by non-binding resolution is of particular interest although not applicable to covid-19 it demonstrates the potential role of the who in encouraging and facilitating sharing of research and resourcesbut equally through its uniqueness demonstrates the challenges in creating even soft instruments at an international level much less legally enforceable ones 31 targeted distributions across the eu furthermore the european commission has taken an innovative and impressive step recently by publishing a roadmap for exiting lockdowns across the eu 32thereby seeking to try and coordinate the exit strategies for the pandemic even though the powers still rest officially with the member states 33 such centralisation is essential to address externalities and is clearly possible in principle however three obvious difficulties in particular arise here firstly we would need to acknowledge and address the different circumstances of each state and region this would include the state of progression of the disease but also the capacity limitations of states and their population to implement policiesakin to common but differentiated responsibilities 34 but leading to more proactive support internationally just as we put in place systems to help citizens within individual nations there would need to be global responsibility and packages for states that did not have the means to address it we are seeing this to an extent with the world bank imf and g20s temporary debt relief for poor countries 35 but more would be needed if there is to be a global approachgenuine full-blown assistance for countries public becomes a global public this is going to be very challenging where for instance there is no capacity to store food for a few weeks or to self-isolate secondly a desire for centralisation is based on the presumption that the centralised approach will be the preferable one whilst there is the potential to improve the effectiveness of any of the three approaches through a closely implemented and enforced approach across all populations this does not mean it will be the best onein light of public health objectives or otherwise for instance aiming for herd immunity without also effectively protecting the vulnerable and flattening the curve at the same time appears to be prioritising the economy above human health and a weaker precautionary approach in contrast if a complete lockdown were undertaken this might have considerable negative impacts on society and economies if maintained for lengthy periods but would initially seem to prioritise human health and reflect a strong precautionary approach but which approach is preferable to society what would happen if the wrong approach were taken globally whether excessively or insufficiently precautionary thirdly linked to this decentralisation and varied approaches provide for learning opportunities and peer pressure each state is looking to see what others are doing and adjusting in light of not merely new scientific data and understanding but also in light of what seems to be working or failing 36 furthermore early substantial restrictions and generally more precautionary approaches have influenced both the timing of responses and the underlying approach in some states eg the uk switched from a laissez-faire soft-regulation approach facilitating long-term herd immunity to one that is more restrictive and reflects approaches taken broadly across the eu consequently there is soft centralisation due to comparisons facilitated by national decision-making considering the importance of the values at stake and the extensive uncertainty there is no absolute answer as to which approach will prove right in the long run or as to whether there should be full centralisation of decision-making powers with recognition of differentiated circumstances and a relatively strong precautionary approach initially whilst information is gathered it may be that mutual collaboration is the most feasible approach where efforts are taken to minimise externalitiesbut at the end of the day unless there is a uniform approach taken globally or a vaccine is available for the entire population the potential for one state to disrupt anothers approach will remain it is necessary to consider whether public health decision-making should be elevated to the global level in the case of pandemics subsidiarity provides a means to consider whether such powers should be reallocated even on a temporary basis both public healthhuman life and the economy are fundamental values within each state and the extent of the surrounding uncertainties makes the identification of the appropriate precautionary pathway in the long term more challengingwhich arguably suggests national approaches and trial and error nonetheless the potential to undermine another states approach externalities and the nature and level of the potential consequences of continued circulation of the disease supports centralisation of decision-makingat least within epidemiological unitswith caveats as noted fundamentally it also raises broader questions about public health interconnectedness and values serious health crises exist continuously across the world both in developed and developing countries they affect human life and broader society yet until the issue comes knocking at our own door we do not step up adequately so yes under ideas of subsidiarity some centralisation of decision-making science and distribution of resources appears logical in the context of a serious pandemic but this leaves unanswered the question of whether some centralisation and responsibility needs to be taken outside of pandemicsof whether we need to acknowledge the relative security and privilege of some and the corresponding insecurity and vulnerability of others in both our local and global societies 36   public policy and economic dynamics of covid-19 spread a mathematical modeling study uri goldsztejn

 background with the covid-19 pandemic infecting millions of people largescale quarantine policies have been enacted across the globe understanding how to maximize the effectiveness of these policies while mitigating economic damage is essential we develop a mathematical model to assess the impact of quarantine measures on deaths hospitalizations and economic output we expand the seir model to simulate the spread of covid-19 we incorporate the effects of quarantine policies and segment the population based on health risk and economic vulnerability using our model we simulate a baseline scenario that leaves the current quarantine restrictions in place we then simulate a rapid relaxation of the quarantine restrictions for non-seniors shortly after the outbreak is contained finally we gradually relax the quarantine restrictions for the young individuals while maintaining extremely strict restrictions for seniors in the baseline scenario we find that over 76 weeks in a population of 330 million there are 32131 deaths among those under 60 and 175775 deaths among those over 60 there is a peak of 189136 hospitalizations and the economy shrinks by 056 in the scenario where quarantine is quickly lifted a second outbreak takes place overall there are 242869 deaths among those under 60 545946 deaths among those over 60 a peak of 4363654 hospitalizations and the economy expands by 52 in the scenario where quarantine policies are progressively relaxed for the young individuals there are 33750 deaths among those under 60 187993 deaths among those over 60 a peak of 189136 hospitalizations and the economy expands by 4 interpretation strict restrictions on seniors combined with very gradual lifting of quarantine for the general population results in a limited number of deaths and lesser economic damage we recommend this strategy and lowering contagiousness to control the pandemic while making quarantine economically viable funding no funding to declare as of april 10th 2020 the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 worldwide stands at over 1690000 and at least 102500 individuals have died from this disease since the first reports of a pneumonia of unknown etiology in december 2019 1 2 3 as covid-19 expands to new territories after a latent phase with few new reported infections daily the virus spreads rapidly and local outbreaks begin the viruss containment is complicated by its high transmissibility relatively low case fatality rate and lengthy asymptomatic infectious period 4 currently the most successful measure to prevent the rapid expansion of covid-19 has been to restrain travels and physical interactions between individuals a policy referred to as social distancing 5 6 extreme social distancing has devastating consequences for the global economy quarantine policies may be an effective short-term measure but indefinite quarantine until a vaccine becomes available would prevent billions of individuals worldwide from receiving an income and could particularly devastate countries with weaker economies this economic harm could increase mortality given the correlation between mortality and income 7 especially for children 8 computational models that simulate the expansion of the disease can guide public policy makers in mitigating the detrimental outcomes of the outbreak 9  existing epidemiological models estimate the number of unknown infected individuals forecast the number of patients requiring intensive care treatment predict the death toll and evaluate the outcomes of different policies in compartmental modeling different disease stages are modeled as compartments and transitions between compartments are modeled by a system of differential equations 10 compartmental models provide useful insight into the mechanisms governing the spread of the disease and help evaluate public policies 11 12 13 some papers focus on how quarantine restrictions affect disease spread 6 13 14 15 16 time series approaches use available data to statistically forecast the evolution of the disease 17 18 19 while times series models have precise results they do not illuminate the dynamics of the disease spread to accurately predict the spread of disease and evaluate consequences beyond the infectious disease itself models must take into account how mitigation measures might impact the economy 20 21 22 existing epidemiological models usually do not integrate the economic aspects of public policy aimed at controlling the spread of the disease to the best of our knowledge no models incorporating public policy responses take into account both the distinctions in risk types within the population and the differential economic impacts of quarantine policies we propose an ad hoc compartmental model for the spread of covid-19 and 3 the economic effects of quarantine restrictions our model includes among other compartments a large group of asymptomatic infected individuals and compartments that represent quarantined individuals we separate the population into four groups in our simulations according to age and the economic impact of remaining in quarantine for an extended period of time upon infection senior individuals present much larger co-morbidity and mortality rates than younger individuals also generalized country-wide lockdowns completely suppress the productivity of some workers while having minimal implications for others by modeling our population as having different risk groups economic risks from quarantine and productivity levels we can make more specific predictions and are able to provide more targeted policy recommendations than existing methods evidence before this study we searched pubmed medrxiv biorxiv arxiv ssrn research square virological and wellcome open research for peer-reviewed articles preprints and research reports on models of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 using the search terms coronavirus 2019-ncov targeted quarantine and similar terms up to april 5 2020 other studies using a variety of data sources and statistical techniques produce estimates of the hospitalized ratio the case fatality rate the length of the pre-symptomatic period the proportion of hospitalized individuals the length of hospitalization and other important parameters we use the available literature for our own estimates of these parameters our primary contribution lies in modeling public policy as taking into account differential age-adjusted health risk and economic risk given that the state of the economy has important health effects and that public policy needs to incorporate economic effects and how citizens perceive lockdown restrictions we model public policies that balance the number of deaths and damage to economic productivity in addition we model improvements in medical knowledge about a recently discovered disease as decreasing the case fatality rate over time the results of this study provide policymakers with three primary policy suggestions 1 maintaining a non-strictly enforced quarantine policy and releasing the population after disease levels begin diminishing would lead to a second outbreak 2 an extremely strict quarantine policy for the senior population combined with a gradual removal of mandatory quarantine for younger citizens after the outbreak is largely controlled can lessen economic damage without catastrophic increases in the number of hospitalized and dead individuals however if the quarantine policy for the senior population is not strictly enforced there can be disastrous consequences no quarantine restriction approach resolves the pandemic and lockdown policies can only be used as a bridge to a global vaccination program 3 strict isolation policies and a strong reduction of contagiousness from the asymptomatic infected individuals can reduce the total number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths as compared to loosely enforced measures therefore stark measures must be enforced to prevent a prolonged pandemic to model the spread of covid-19 we design a compartmental model with ten interconnected compartments each compartment is subdivided into two parts one containing the senior population and the other containing the rest of the population a description of each compartment appears in table 1  the connectivity of the compartments is illustrated in fig 1  susceptible individuals get exposed to covid-19 at a rate proportional to the number of asymptomatic and hospitalized infected individuals exposed individuals then become infected and asymptomatic these individuals can either recover from their current state or develop serious symptoms and become hospitalized the fraction of infected asymptomatic individuals that become hospitalized follows a bernoulli distribution with a low probability for the general population and a higher probability for the senior population the hospitalized individuals either die or recover at appropriate rates which depend on whether the hospitalized population is above certain saturation points the case fatality rate decreases over time to account for better knowledge by the healthcare system individuals who are not hospitalized enter or leave quarantine compartments according to public policy expressed by  and   v where v is a vector containing the number of reported infections deaths and the current state of the economy and  is a weight vector that reflects the relative importance the public policy gives to the economy and the number of cases the greek letters represent the transition delays between the compartments and were derived from published data about the progression rate of covid-19 in our model there are occupations more affected by lockdown and occupations less affected by lockdown in our simulation we have two types of workers those whose productivity is highly damaged by a quarantine and those whose 5  cc-by-nc-nd 40

in that labor group the cost of treating the infected is the number of individuals of each risk type times the cost of treating each risk type different workers of the same labor type might be under

individuals recover they receive a small boost in productivity due to their acquired immunity using a population of 330 million we simulate the evolution of public policy given the preferences of the policymakers over 76 weeks in each scenario to imitate current strict lockdown policies we start with 856  of non-seniors and 956  of seniors in quarantine public policy and media information shifts the population in and out of quarantine we keep the non-quarantined population above zero because some jobs that could potentially spread disease continue to operate because they are deemed essential in a pandemic economy for this reason there is not much room for further strengthening the quarantine for non-seniors baseline scenario in the baseline scenario we keep the current quarantine status   0   0 leaving the quarantine in place results in 207906 total deaths the peak number of hospitalized is 189136 which strains hospital capacity but does not saturate it as shown in fig 2a and fig 2c  deaths first accelerate as more non-quarantined people get infected but then level off there are 32131 deaths among non-seniors and 175775 among seniors as shown in fig 2b and fig 2d  respectively since both young people and seniors have strict quarantine restrictions imposed on them most of the deaths occur in the senior population which is more vulnerable to the disease the economy in the baseline scenario shown in fig 3  shrinks slightly from its initial restricted levels as some people are hospitalized and die this is costly for the economy and there is no increase in productivity from others as they are all still in quarantine given that the initial restrictions on economic output are high the economic productivity in this scenario is quite low for a prolonged period of time

when the isolated population is released in week 40 a large second outbreak soon takes place after the release of the population with a sudden release the peak number of hospitalized is 4363654 which

re-imposition of restrictions fig 4a shows a decreasing number of infections before the second outbreak during this period the very low number of newly infected and deaths may suggest that covid-19 has been successfully mitigated and the pressure to resume normal activities may grow the economy is strongly boosted shortly after strict restrictions are removed however due to the large initial fraction of asymptomatic infected individuals a sudden relaxation of quarantine restrictions after the disease is largely controlled leads to a second outbreak with increased deaths and infections the economic dynamics of this scenario are shown in fig  4c  after a short-term economic boost the second outbreak damages economic productivity again although the productivity boost for quarantined

progressive restart of the economy before the pandemic is over in this scenario we investigate a gradual relaxation of the quarantine restrictions various studies have shown that the case fatality rate for the senior population is larger than that of the younger population23 24 the marked difference in mortality according to age suggests that enforcing an extremely strict isolation policy for the senior population while allowing the general population to slowly resume normal activities could potentially balance disease spread and economic damage as in the sudden release scenario policymakers loosen quarantine restrictions in week 40 releasing the non-senior isolated population at a rate of 01  daily this gradual relaxation does not lead to a second outbreak as can be seen from the number of infected individuals in fig 5a  and fig 5c  in this state the peak number of hospitalized is 189136 which does not saturate the health care system there are 33750 non-senior deaths and 187993 senior deaths as shown in fig 5b and fig 5d  respectively in this scenario there are 13837 more deaths than in the baseline scenario and a 40  increase in economic productivity that is continuing to grow at 76 weeks we see in fig 6 that relaxing restrictions on seniors as well does not improve economic productivity and results in substantially more deaths additionally if 10

holder for this preprint  the rate at which the general population abandons isolation measures increases rapidly a second outbreak could take place strict enforcement of quarantine restrictions for seniors is vital as without strict enforcement for senior individuals the number of deaths is almost one million economic output is higher in the gradual quarantine relaxation scenario with strict enforcement of quarantine for seniors however since in this scenario covid-19 becomes endemic and does not disappear relaxing isolation policies for the senior population at any time leads to an extremely large number of hospitalized and dead individuals therefore although this scenario can lead to an acceptable economic situation with a controlled number of hospitalizations and deaths it is not a viable long-term solution any quarantine policy that does not eliminate the disease can serve only as bridge to a global vaccination campaign   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

from the low and high risk populations and net change in productivity from current situation to a year and a half from the time of submission in the baseline scenario the restrictions do not change in the sudden release scenario after the disease is mostly brought under control restrictions for non-seniors are suddenly relaxed in the gradual release scenario after the disease is mostly brought under control restrictions for non-seniors are gradually relaxed first from fig 7a -c we observe that the total number of hospitalizations and deaths decrease with the strictness of isolation of hospitalized patients   while economic productivity grows slightly we see a much larger decrease in hospitalizations and deaths and a larger increase in economic productivity as disease spread of asymptomatic patients  is reduced this observation suggests the importance of enforcing quarantine measures for example by tracking diagnosed patients who are not hospitalized and by strengthening specialized delivery systems secondly from fig 7d -f we observe that as the strictness of isolation measures increase the number of deaths and hospitalizations decrease while economic output is first flat and then at certain level of quarantine measures begins to sharply decrease meanwhile at higher levels of quarantine restrictions the change in hospitalizations accelerates but the change in deaths decelerates finally we see in fig 7g -i that as policymakers put more emphasis on economic productivity at lower levels of emphasis there are increases in hospitalizations deaths and economic productivity but as the policymaker prioritizes the economy more hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase while economic output shrinks we see that if policymakers value short-term economic productivity highly relative to disease spread there is a danger of quarantine policies leading to larger death tolls   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder

preprint we present a model of covid-19 in a population with different risk groups and different levels of economic vulnerability to public policy aimed at preventing disease spread we focus our model on a situation where disease is ongoing and quarantine measures are already in place by modeling our population with different risk groups and economic groups we are able to produce specific policy suggestions that allow for a finer targeting of the spread of covid-19 the individuals most vulnerable to covid-19 are primarily those who can be protected from the disease without crippling the economy we suggest stringent lockdowns for higher-risk groups our simulations show that in order to protect the most vulnerable any lockdown relaxation must be gradual even for the less vulnerable beyond the short-term lockdown policy does not need to be as severe for lowerrisk groups quarantine restrictions can lessen over time for lower-risk people while still minimizing deaths lessening quarantine restrictions allows the economy to recover to 30  of pre-restriction productivity as opposed to 34  when quarantine restrictions are left in place it is important that policy relaxation be gradual as this limits the spread of disease and can allow for less restrictive measures in the future in real-world terms the gradual relaxation suggested by our model can correspond to the lifting of restrictions on in-person work operations several industries at a time or to gradually increasing the number of low-risk people allowed to gather in one place these results also suggest that optimal policies may differ in various countries independent of the level of disease spread and healthcare capacity for instance in countries with more vulnerable economies that have a younger population the consequences from disease may be less than in other countries while consequences from lockdown policies may be higher than in other countries we also see that contagiousness of asymptomatic infected individuals  has an important effect on disease spread and mortality and this suggests that strictly enforcing quarantines is especially important for policymakers to prioritize if policymakers prioritize short-term economic productivity more their quarantine policies may lead to many times more deaths and hospitalizations with minimal short-term economic gain our results demonstrate that keeping a stringent quarantine on at least a substantial portion of the population is necessary to avert large numbers of deaths more investigation is required as to how to keep such a quarantine sustainable over time both through targeted relaxation as we suggest but also through safe provision of services to the quarantined and increased infrastructure for at-home economic productivity 25 more workers may be required for maintaining a quarantined population over time additionally continued compliance with quarantine may require a variety of measures including enforcement education from public health officials and infrastructure for alternatives to traditional social and entertainment options furthermore policymakers should use other tools to supplement quarantine policy including contact tracing and other containment measures successful quarantine policy can more quickly bring disease levels down to a level where more targeted tools can control future outbreaks our simulations suggest that quarantine policy alone cannot end a pandemic without a level of enforcement that may not be realistic and one that necessitates extreme economic costs thus policymakers should quickly incentivize vaccines and other medical treatments our study has several limitations since there is no recent data on longterm health quarantines it is unknown how individuals will react to lengthy restrictions related to infectious disease once more information on individuals responses becomes available their behavior should be incorporated into later models we also do not model any individual-level differences in behavior or disease spread this model could also be modified to incorporate the effects of testing and to have probability of infection depend on job type our model does not allow for any differences in disease spread between new and repeated contacts 26 27 28 additionally due to the newness of covid-19 the exact disease parameters and the effects of seasonality are not precisely known 29 30 because of the uncertainty surrounding disease parameters which change as the covid-19 situation progresses our numbers should not be taken as literal predictions but rather as illustrating the consequences of different policy approaches during a fatal infectious disease outbreak of lengthy duration making policy decisions with longer term consequences in mind is essential our model provides a framework for making such decisions that takes into account differences within the population and disease changes that may occur over time we provide evidence about what quarantine policies may allow for minimal deaths while maximizing economic productivity we find that once infection levels are somewhat controlled very gradual relaxation of the restrictions on younger groups can minimize health consequences and economic damage the manuscript ug and ds contributed equally to this work we declare no competing interests  cc-by-nc-nd 40

antibody testing for healthcare workers and overlooked societal implications kunal vakharia   the discussion that has continued since the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome virus and avian influenza epidemics has focused on the potential for immunity among the general population and the moral obligation to treat that is often faced by healthcare professionals and institutions1 2 the current pandemic continues to spread rapidly and there is an ever-growing unease about jump-starting the country the world and the economy again although these are important factors to take into consideration there are some unique challenges faced with the current coronavirus covid-19 that transfigure this conversation into one about responsibility with the superfluity of different antibody tests coming into the market with different specificities and sensitivities the word antibody engenders a certain sense of relief or comfort that may not be practical addressing the general population although our understanding of vaccinations and immunity to disease is predicated on the idea of igm antibodies being the first to develop to fight off an infection followed by igg antibodies remaining longer term coronavirus may not be something that can be as easily pre-empted as other illnesses that have vaccines and that generate a similar response with a virus that potentially generates a significant proinflammatory state in a multiorgan system fashion it is hard to understand the potential for immunity the risk with repeat infection the potential for viral mutations and the long-term impact of this situation3 4
 in addition to the challenges of immunity the idea of antibodies creates a challenge for understanding the true epidemiological nature of the spread of covid-19 although the majority of public health professionals and institutions understand that antibody testing is not a free pass to restarting the economy the fact that this is primarily an epidemiological study is misunderstood by a majority of the public and can easily be misconstrued to be comparable with immunity gathering epidemiological data about the spread of covid-19 and its potential impacts on different demographics and populations is important4 this information can be used to work to better solutions for segregated minorities and for targeted and widely infected populations the need to understand the pattern of spread is important to allow for better long-term planning on how to manage this pandemic as well as how to manage potential disease in the future when looking from the lens of a bioethicist the potential beneficence to underserved populations as well as the entire global community is immense and unparalleled5 the argument is not whether this potential benefit from a public health outreach containment and understanding is critical for better preventing disease spread but simply if this potential benefit outweighs all the other potential risks even in the past couple of weeks large cities primarily new york city have seen a large efflux of the wealthy out of the densely populated core6 a recent surge in articles has highlighted the inequity and lack of justice surrounding the antibody testing movement and spread of the disease among the wealthy and the more indigent populations in larger cities this inherently widens the wealth gap that already exists in the usa but even more importantly helps determine where resources should be allocated how hospitals should or should not proceed with cases and where the potential long-term impacts will need more care in the future all these details are not necessarily immediately realised but form a broader public health narrative that can be used to curb such vast discrepancies in the future in addition to discrepancies seen between disparate populations healthcare workers face a distinct challenge although the idea of antibody testing is great from an epidemiological perspective it sadly offers limited benefit from a medical standpoint the challenge arises particularly in the medical community and exaggerated at the front lines when the discourse surrounding antibody testing remains around the idea of herd immunity and using antibody testing to determine where people work and the extrapolated idea of immunity passports although slightly dystopian in its view the idea of immunity passports is being felt at micromanagement levels as well workers who have had only a minor illness when testing positive for covid-19 or those whose antibody tests return positive and who may have been asymptomatic carriers at one point are designated survivors the notion of survivorship like with patients with cancer is not held in the same regard when antibody testing is mixed with survivorship it offers a shield of protection that blinds many to understanding this disease in its entirety people are suddenly confronted with a moral obligation towards volunteerism in place of the current voluntarism as noted by the hastings center there are many who are falling on either side of the covid-19 antibody debate the potential implications of antibodies and whether they confer immunity are being hotly contested and draw similarities to the great vaccine debate and whether the risks of vaccination outweigh the benefits7 as a society the moral obligation to work towards an idea of herd immunity is natural but fraught with so many uncertainties it is hard to justify parallel discourse with the growing literature and data suggesting the possibility of mutations unequal impacts on different people and the potential repercussions of the spike protein for those with igg immunity already can society in good faith adopt a moral prerogative to put antibody-positive people in the front line or does the uncertainty and possible long-term health consequences mean that these people should be a protected population ethically the central tenets of most of our discussions revolve around the ideas of non-maleficence beneficence justice and autonomy although autonomy is regarded as important but sometimes justifiably sacrificed for the greater good does autonomy and the right to know supersede the potential lack of control and lack of knowledge that antibody testing may confer although the covid-19 pandemic is unique the usa has faced a similar conundrum before in the 1990s when the hiv epidemic was in full throttle and our understanding limited mandatory testing was debated but there were no effective or consistent ways to enforce the difficult logistical and legal problems that arose similarly there are many challenges and potential for stigmatisation that arise with covid-19 testing as well healthcare workers form a group of individuals who recognise the potential of covid-19 the impact it has had and are still willing to go to work and continue to face the challenge although morally understandable prudence dictates that healthcare personnel at high risk of exposure regardless of their antibody status take full precautions with every encounter unlike the hiv epidemic covid-19 is aerosolised and spreads not by knowingly taking sexual or intravenous risk but even by unknowingly being exposed if antibody testing had no impact on the daily workings of a hospital department did not change an individuals exposure risk and had no effect on the precautions everyone must take then why take the test is it a risk to the patient simply to take a blood test and confer next to no benefit from this information the epidemiological studies that could arise from testing exposed healthcare personnel are enormous the data may show the rate of conversion it may highlight safe practices and help change the way we handle certain situations in the hospital but tracing is incredibly hard with the number of contacts the number of transitions of care and the potential for every exposed surface being considered contaminated the biggest challenge faced by antibody testing may in fact be psychological there is no compendium of information that helps sift through the vast amount of data being collected on covid-19 or even the number of research papers being written on the subject scientific sharing is crucial at this time more than ever before but because of the lag in understanding can we justify the potential cost to those people who are antibody-tested when the hiv epidemic was becoming more prevalent the idea of giving antibody testing information to patients was focused on the idea that sharing information would lead to motivating a change in habits8 bad needle practices and recognition of sexual contacts were a feasible and understandable benefit to the potential psychological impact an antibody test would have on an individual9 in the current era a negative test can be deflating but how is this even possible how can a negative test be deflating to a healthcare worker it seems counterintuitive most people would be ecstatic that they did not test positive for antibodies to a potentially lethal virus the rationally irrational response is expected the higher your risk exposure the higher your contacts and the more isolated one feels the more likely it seems that healthcare personnel think they have had covid-19 or have antibodies although anecdotal many of these personnel are disappointed when they test negative and continue to protect themselves as they had before but knowing that they have not contracted the disease and that the worst may yet still be coming is a feeling that although pervasive in the current climate can weigh on anyone who has to face it daily in addition those who do test positive seem fearless they are the ones willing to go into any room and help out even without an n95 mask on these cavalier feelings particularly among younger physicians who feel that they will likely fight off covid-19 better are simply unsupported by the literature but cavalier actions can lead to a slippery slope of consequences recognising these psychological tolls is there any role to testing people to understand the epidemiological risks and not telling people their antibody status this flies in the face of autonomy and mirrors the earlier paternalistic sentiments of medicine in the early 1900s but also allows for more control of information and limits the spread of false predispositions this may not be the perfect answer but these are the two ends of the spectrum somewhere in between will likely be the safest ethical and social decision in these unusual circumstances where every action is magnified by a certain magnitude by the potential for public health benefits it is important to increase testing the centers for disease control has continued to expound the need to increase our testing capabilities and suggests that our current testing is not nearly where it needs to be10 there is built-up momentum for antibody testing and this will likely have beneficial repercussions regarding opening up businesses potentially helping allocate healthcare resources and focus our research on the best treatment modalities but this is not being realised at this time with the current knowledge of the virus and with the current rate of testing within a week the tests that have been done may be obsolete as the world begins to see reopening as a possibility there are really no ethical justifications not to notify patients about their antibody status if they are tested the focus on changing behaviours seen by prior epidemics has transformed during this pandemic it is a moral imperative more than the benefit to the community and public health that those who are tested undergo appropriate counselling because of the inundation of covid-19 stories research and data it is important to temper patients expectations guide them to understanding the ephemeral nature of testing and recognise the potential long-term consequences of this testing some might hear all of this and say that testing allows for us to be informed and more information is more power but implicitly in this statement is that medicine and healthcare professionals are morally obligated not only to serve their patients and their community but to make sure that they fully understand the ramifications of any test result with limited knowledge about the significance of covid-19 antibody testing at this time it is hard to use this to stratify work in a healthcare setting or to use it for any purpose beyond epidemiological studies on the spread of the disease  should and how can exercise be done during a coronavirus outbreak an interview with dr jeffrey a woods weimo zhu   the coronavirus disease covid-19 crisis is now present in china it started in december 2019 and has so far led 213 individuals died and at least 9066 infected in china by local time 1726 january 30 2020 it has also spread to a number of asian countries as well as to canada france germany and the united states as a result the chinese government has put several major cities in hubei province on lockdown and has thrown plans for the lunar new year holiday into chaos for millions of people on january 30 2020 the world health organization also declared the covid-19 outbreak a global health emergency because it could spread to countries that are not prepared furthermore to prevent the spread of the new and deadly virus all cities in china now have shut down most public places and facilities including parks leaving many people with no place to exercise as a result people may wonder if one should exercise at all during the outbreak and if so how these questions made journal of sport and health science remember some well-known studies done by my colleague dr jeffrey a woods and his team at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign uiuc in which they found a protective effect of exercise on mortality due to influenza in mice dr woods is a mottier family professor at uiuc his research focuses on the effects of exercise on the immune system the gut microbiome and aging he was among the first scholars to demonstrate that regular exercise can have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body and showed that exercise can improve the immune response to the flu vaccine in older adults i interviewed dr woods for the should and how questions zhu would you please tell the readers of journal of sport and health science a little bit about yourself for example where did you receive your training and what made you interested in exercise and immune function-related research woods i am currently an administrator and researcher at uiuc i received my phd from the university of south carolina usc at columbia under the direction of drs j mark davis and russ pate i had an interest in understanding how exercise affected the immune system because not much was known about it so i sought out co-mentors at the nearby usc school of medicine there i found drs eugene mayer and abdul ghaffar who took me on as an additional mentee to learn about the immune system and how to study it in the 1980s exercise immunology was a very new subfield for exercise science as time evolved it has been satisfying to see how important the immune system is to the normal tissue and organ functioning and pathophysiology and how it plays a role in exercise adaptation in muscle and other tissues zhu please tell us about your well-known exercise and flu studies12 including the purposes of the studies research design and major findings woods back in the 2000s we performed a series of studies in mice and people to understand how individual bouts of exercise and exercise training affect influenza infection and vaccination respectively in our animal studies we found that moderate endurance exercise 30 minday could protect mice from death due to influenza mice that exercised for longer durations 25 hday exhibited an increase in some illness symptoms but there was no statistically significant difference in mortality when compared to sedentary mice we concluded that moderate exercise could be beneficial and that prolonged exercise could be detrimental to influenza-infected mice for obvious reasons we have not performed this experiment in people we also did a large study to determine whether 10 months of regular endurance exercise could improve influenza vaccination responses in older adults a group that is at risk for infectious disease due to immunosenescence we found that regular moderate cardiovascular exercise could extend the protective effect of the annual influenza vaccination so that it maintained protective levels of antibodies throughout the entire influenza season ie into march and april in the northern hemisphere we concluded that regular moderate endurance exercise might be one way to boost the protective effect of annual influenza vaccination it is very important for all people to receive the annual influenza vaccine both influenza and coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infection that can lead to morbidity and mortality especially in those who are immunocompromised or who have no existing immunity to the viruses indeed while the covid-19 should not be taken lightly influenza is a much bigger problem but because it is relatively common and has been around for a long time it does not receive the attention that new viral outbreaks do the covid-19 is scary because it is new and we do not know a lot about it yet new viruses are always scary because we have little to no protective immunity against them and we do not have vaccines there is work going on to understand and develop preventive strategies to deal with this covid-19 threat however universal precautions to limit its spread are very important right now until a new vaccine or another strategy is available zhu based on your earlier studies as well as the progresses made in exercise and immunization over the past 15 years should people exercise during a coronavirus outbreak if so what are the guidelines woods it is safe to exercise during the coronavirus outbreak one should not limit the multitude of health benefits that exercise provides us on a daily basis just because there is a new virus in our environment however there may be some additional precautions to reduce your risk of infection if you are a social exerciser you might want to limit your exposure to exercise partners who have exhibited signs and symptoms of illness the problem though is that infected people may be infectious before they exhibit symptoms in some instances wearing a mask while exercising may be a way to reduce your exposure it is very important to make sure that if you are exercising on equipment in fitness facilities or gymnasiums that you make sure to disinfect the equipment before and after you use it when done exercising the most effective way to clean hands is to wet them with clean water then apply soap and scrub for at least 20 s before rinsing and drying with a clean towel hand sanitizers with at least 60 alcohol content may also be used but the us centers for disease control and prevention warns they are not effective against all germs this strategy should be used at all times not just because there is an acute viral outbreak avoiding touching your face and neck with your hands is also advised if you cannot disinfect them until a later time at this stage we know the virus is transmitted through airborne droplets and direct contact with infected people coronaviruses are primarily spread through close contact with another individual in particular through coughing and sneezing on somebody else who is within a range of about 3 to 6 feet from that person we do not know how long the virus remains viable on objects zhu will the guidelines apply to previously sedentary individuals woods it is safe for sedentary individuals to exercise or to start an exercise program physician consultation and approval may be needed for people with disease comorbidity orthopedic problems or advanced age as above there are prudent precautions that can be taken to limit infectious disease spread anything that increases your probability of coming into contact with an infected person or that compromises your immune system increases your risk of infection if you are sedentary it may be a good idea not to overdo it research suggests that unaccustomed strenuous or prolonged exercise might reduce the function of your immune system defenses as such avoiding long and stressful exercise sessions that you are unaccustomed to might be a good idea zhu what about the people who already got infected by flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or the current covid-19 in china should they still do exercises woods typically one can exercise moderately with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms eg runny nose sinus congestion mild sore throat however i would recommend against exercising if you are experiencing any of these symptoms severe sore throat body aches shortness of breath general fatigue chest cough or fever you should also seek medical care if you are experiencing those symptoms typically recovery from respiratory viral infections takes 23 weeks which corresponds with the time it takes your immune system to generate cytotoxic t cells necessary to clear the virus from infected cells after this period when symptoms are gone it is safe to begin exercising regularly but you may want to take it slow at first zhu while many research studies examined the impact of a relatively long-term exercise intervention 812 weeks34 others reported that even a single bout of exercise can help boost ones immune function5 so how quickly can one benefit from an exercise bout woods i believe that even a single exercise bout can be beneficial but regular exercise provides a much bigger benefit molecular and cellular events take place within seconds to minutes following the beginning of an exercise bout or period of physical activity this is why there is so much work right now examining sitting time and how often physical activity should be interspersed with inactivity to promote health the historic thinking has been that exercise promotes a fight or flight stress response that mobilizes immune cells to get ready for impending infectious or noninfectious challenges accompanied by physical activity this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective where physical activity might lead to injury or harm zhu what about intensity it seems that most studies and reviews say that the intensity of the exercises should be kept moderate however campbell and turner6 have recently challenged this belief and claimed that there is no harmful effect on immune function even when a vigorous bout of exercise intervention is employed what is your view on the appropriate intensity of exercise for improving immune function woods the report from campbell and turner6 focuses on highly fit individuals who compete in and are accustomed to long endurance high-intensity events while i believe there is merit in the evidence they provide to refute the conclusions for that population studies where sedentary people are forced to exercise at high intensities for prolonged periods might paint a different picture there are few such studies due to the ethics and safety concerns and there are many other variables that contribute to natural infections that would need to be accounted and controlled for in such studies the best studies would be ones that control exercise and infectious disease exposure in people these are difficult to ethically perform in people and it would be very difficult or impossible to get approved by institutional review boards animal models including ours as mentioned may provide valuable insights into this argument and there are many studies demonstrating that prolonged unaccustomed exercise can increase infectious disease morbidity and mortality these studies were not reconciled in the campbell and turner6 article however as with all animal models there are limitations such as species differences stress associated with forced exercise the type of pathogen and timing of exercise in relation to infection that would need to be taken into account before a firm conclusion could be drawn zhu while most published studies have been focused on the impact of aerobic exercise on immune function recent research studies have found resistance training and bodymind exercise such as tai ji quan known also as tai chi and yoga could also be helpful to the immune function what is your view and recommendation on these types of exercises woods there have been some more recent studies aimed at determining the role of resistance training and high-intensity interval training on various immune parameters my take of the literature is that there are still very few studies on this to make firm conclusions we published a study in 20077 examining the influence of 5 months of tai ji quanqigong could influence the immune response to influenza vaccination in older adults we found significant increases in the magnitude and duration of antibody responses in tai ji quanqigong participants when compared to controls while i am unaware if these data have been replicated a recent systematic review on the effects of yoga concluded that yoga might be beneficial for those suffering from diseases with an inflammatory component8 zhu you have many firsts in the area of exercise and immune function would you please list a few top questions that the field should address so that young researchers can address some of these questions woods while there has been much progress in understanding the impact of exercise on our immune systems there is still much we do not know and the challenge is that we have known about these questions for some time but limitations of human experimentation and a dearth of good animal models have hindered progress questions such as shown below are key questions for the field to be moving forward1what are the mechanisms whereby exercise affects various aspects of immune functioning2how do various acute and chronic exercise paradigms affect immune system omics measures3does exercise cause epigenetic changes in our immune systems4do exercise-induced changes in immune functioning translate into health benefits5how does exercise impact the gut microbiome and gut immunity6what are optimal exercise dose-responses for various disease states zhu finally you have been very supportive of chinese scholars and have trained some excellent graduate students from china you have also often reviewed the research works submitted from chinese laboratories based on your observation and experience which areas should the chinese scholars and laboratories further improve and focus on woods yes i get many inquiries from chinese and other international students about potentially working in my laboratory as a pre-doctoral student the main advice that i would give these students is to make sure that you have a a strong academic record that includes basic science courses ie chemistry physiology b evidence of basic science wet laboratory skills and c tangible research output ie abstracts publications and presentations in your field i would also caution about using cold call e-mails that do not reflect careful thought and research relative to the individual you are contacting you should read the work and understand the research interests of the professor you are contacting while also making a case that you have strong interests and skills in this area most of the chinese scholars i have mentored came to me on recommendation from someone i know and trust eg another us or international professor or student thus it is important to create a network of people in your field of interest you can do this by interacting with people at scientific meetings if that is not an option due to cost or circumstance i would recommend trying to find any connection between you your institution or your current mentor and someone at a target institution of study as for manuscripts coming from chinese or international laboratories submitted to english-language journals my recommendation would be to make sure that the manuscript has been carefully edited for spelling and grammar relative to the english language no matter how good the science is if the presentation is poor it will reflect poorly on the work  covid-19 obsessive-compulsive disorder and invisible life forms that threaten the self frederick aardema   in the eyes of the general public those with obsessive-compulsive disorder ocd are commonly viewed as germophobic and excessive cleaners who compulsively wash their hands the same behaviors are now encouraged to lower ones risk of infection and the spreading of covid-19 not surprisingly alarming media reports have referred to the current epidemic as a personal nightmare or worst-case scenario for those with ocd collie 2020 kingkade 2020 a recent clinical guide on how to manage ocd under covid-19 echoes similar anxieties suggesting that those with ocd might be more affected than any other group of individuals with a mental illness fineberg van ameringen drummond et al 2020 it is a reasonable hypothesis that stress and anxiety as the result of the current pandemic may worsen mental health issues or even cause mental problems issues among those previously unaffected the 2013 sars outbreak had an immediate and longer-term psychological impact among health care workers nickell et al 2004 maunder et al 2014 likewise a significant negative psychological impact is anticipated among the general public given experience from previous pandemics brooks et al 2020 taylor 2019 however the extent to which these effects are particularly relevant to those with ocd is not known irrational fear of contamination is only one specific manifestation of ocd other common forms of ocd have little direct relationship to viruses and germs including those with harm-related obsessions concerns about symmetry and checking related compulsions even among those with obsessional fears of contamination its not all about viruses and germs but it may also revolve around an entirely different categories of contaminants eg pesticides mold radioactivity chemicals lead asbestos electromagnetic energy and even disinfectants in other words the high level of heterogeneity and selectivity both across and within symptom subtypes is incongruent with the notion that covid-19 is always directly relevant to ocd it is quite possible that the negative effects of the current pandemic will be stronger in some individuals with ocd as a clinician it is not difficult to imagine that those with harm-related obsessions may suddenly start to develop obsessions about infecting others likewise those with contamination fears may have a more difficult time than usual as current events squeeze their way into the obsessional narrative yet even here we have to be careful not to overgeneralize for example one client with contamination fears was pleasantly surprised to see everyone else engage in the same behaviors as herself she no longer had to feel embarrassed using protective gloves or refusing to shake hands it was a welcome reprieve from the usual stigma self-blame and shame that the disorder tends to bring along however she took protective measures for a different reason than covid-19 she washed her hands because of a fear of acquiring hep c she had no obsessional concerns about the coronavirus in effect she was protected from any negative effects thanks to the high resilience and impermeability of her specific obsession ocd is an extremely slippery disorder immune to generalizations always stubbornly refusing to be boxed into a corner this is also reflected in the aforementioned clinical guide noting difficulties with disentangling normal and abnormal fears of contamination thereby raising concerns on how to deal with symptoms of ocd during the current pandemic fineberg van ameringen drummond et al 2020 on the surface there appears to be a new normal where that what was previously considered exaggerated and abnormal now seems entirely justified and normal indeed when do irrational fears of contamination start to diverge from entirely normal and rational fears what is it exactly that makes an entirely justified fear of contagion different from obsessional fears of contamination the current communication will address these questions through a consideration of recent developments in research on feared-self perceptions in ocd aardema  wong 2020 first it will be shown that the personalized meaning attached to viruses and germs including the personification of viruses as entities that possess human-like characteristics allows for a positioning towards these life forms that enable them to not only threaten the physical body but also the self second it will be argued that a fear of contamination becomes obsessional due to a fear of inner corruption where compulsions serve to safeguard the self rather than just the body third the differences between normal and abnormal fears of contamination will be illustrated through the specific manner that ocd clinically manifests itself in comparison to normal and even exaggerated non-obsessional fears of contagion finally the paper concludes with some clinical recommendations for psychoeducation and specific cognitive interventions during treatment for ocd in the context of the current pandemic as pointed out by schlozman 2014 on any objective level viruses and germs are interpersonally boring they do not have any personality or volition they just are what they are microscopic entities that do whatever they do sometimes causing disease and death none of these characteristics are likely to cause ocd if they did then most infectious disease specialists would suffer from this disorder and apart from seeing the value of frequent handwashing sneezing in your elbow and not touching your face there is no evidence they are more likely to suffer from ocd than anyone else yet the meaning we can attach to these life forms is quite different in our imagination they can be like monsters out to get us and even though the bogey man did not get you today it might always do so tomorrow schlozman 2014 we all tend to personify viruses and germs early on the chinese president xi labelled the coronavirus a devil virus as if it were a malevolent entity out to get us with the intent to wipe out humanity blanchard 2020 likewise other politicians and decision makers have referred to the coronavirus as the invisible enemy or the hidden enemy while simultaneously developing battle plans and going to war to fight an enemy that is unable to return the same sentiment serhan 2020 the current coronavirus has also been ascribed local identity and nationality as the wuhan virus and the chinese virus the naming of viruses after their place of origin has occurred throughout history in the personification of viruses eg middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus although more recently formally abandoned because of unnecessary stigmatizing effects on nations and its people world health organization 2015 yet these names continue to be used even though viruses and germs do not have a nationality nor do they carry any passports it gives them a lot more identity than they deserve which incidentally is a phrasing that inadvertently gives them identity as well it is quite difficult to talk about germs and viruses without simultaneously implying they have sentience volition and personality it is not unique to those with ocd alone and occurs throughout the general population in many situations it seems relatively harmless like in childrens cartoons that show naughty delinquent germs running across the screen being chased by heroic white blood cells although the personification of viruses and germs has been found to be associated with heightened fears of contamination among non-clinical controls riskind  richards 2018 it is unlikely to play any direct causal role in ocd nor would a tendency to personify viruses and germs be necessarily expected to differentiate between normal and obsessional fears of contamination however the personification of viruses and germs illustrates how these life forms are not only a physical threat but can also represent a psychological threat as an enemy or invader able to threaten the self connelly and macleod 2004 indeed the wider literature suggests that those with ocd might be particularly vulnerable to experience viruses and germs as a psychological threat due to an already fragile and incoherent identity aardema  wong 2020 this brings us to a historical fear of inner corruption among those with ocd in a recent historical analysis of obsessions aardema and wong 2020 observe that while fears of contagion and disease have always existed a fear of viruses and germs did not exist until the end of the 19th century until germ theory became more widely accepted as a scientific account on the spread of disease before this time ideas on the origin of disease were not as established either viewed as the result of evil influences or considered to spread through bad air from decaying organic matter in addition views on what constituted a contaminant was quite different in earlier times prior to the 17th century historical records that describe obsessive-compulsive fears of contamination are scarce to non-existent instead earlier accounts more commonly describe a fear of inner corruption as the result of evil influences luibheid  russell 1982 p 212 kempe 14362015 and later on in theological doctrines derived from the notion of original sin bunyan 1666 as well as secular notions of inner corruption as the devil that exists inside all of us mcadams 1993 in other words the historical evolution of ocd suggests that a fear of mental contamination might be more central to an understanding of this disorder than fears of physical contamination that is in the obsessional case physically oriented forms of contamination represent a historical continuation of a fear of inner corruption through other means germ theory while providing a scientific objective account of disease has never completely succeeded in depersonalizing the origins of disease in the eyes of the general public allowing microscopic life to not only threaten the physical body but personal identity as well in lessons learned from the 2014 ebola outbreak schlozman 2014 observed the following on the true insidious danger of infectionwe personify an illness and then we attribute the personality of the illness to those who are unlucky enough to have the disease the infected individuals go from being unique person to simply persons with ebolathe disease which we have personified becomes the person himself and the person therefore loses his personhood
 the personification of disease including the viruses and germs that cause them allows these life forms to not only threaten the physical body but also to threaten and psychologically pollute the self this issue is particularly germane to ocd which has been proposed to be characterized by feared self-perceptions driving their symptoms both with regards to the occurrence of repugnant obsessions and more recently obsessional fears of contamination aardema  oconnor 2007 aardema wong audet melli  baraby 2018 the specific traits and self-related qualities feared by those with ocd are varied and diverse but a fear of inner corruption is a common theme throughout the historical clinical and empirical literature on ocd aardema  wong 2020 in particular the seminal work of rachman 1994 has highlighted constructs closely related to a fear of inner corruption especially in relation to the notions of pollution of the mind and mental contamination representing a sense of inner dirtiness arising from sources other than visible physical contaminants radomksy coughtrey sahfran rachman 2017 in other words in the case of obsessional fears of contamination it may not really be about any of the objective characteristics of viruses and germs but instead how these personified life forms desecrate and violate ones own self and personhood not dissimilar from feelings of contamination that may arise following imagined or actual violation fairbrother  rachman 2004 elliott  radomsky 2012 indeed despite the allowances provided by germ theory for an objective fear of microscopic life early accounts of germaphobia do not always clearly identify a genuine fear of viruses or germs or even any specific disease resulting from it but instead they appear to describe an intangible fear revolving around the desecration and violation of the self hammond 1883 as cited in aardema and wong 2020i have no particular apprehension of contracting small-pox or any other disease i can specify it is an overpowering feeling that i shall be defiled in some mysterious way that presses me with a force i cannot resista subtle influence whatever it may be that is capable of passing through my gloves to my hands
 those with fears of physical contamination are often unable to exactly describe what they might be contaminated with nor do they necessarily express any obvious concerns with the consequences of contracting viruses and germs like death or disease this difficulty with expressing fears in concrete terms is consistent with the notion of feelings of contamination arising from a fear of inner corruption and the perceived violation of the embodied self it may also help to explain the ego-dystonic nature of obsessions where the person is able to intellectually recognize that the objective characteristics and consequences of germs and viruses form no realistic basis for their fears yet at the same unable to distance from the intense feelings of contamination that arises from their association with the psychological underlying theme of inner corruption recent evidence supports the notion that concerns about physical or contact contamination resulting in washing behaviors is closely intertwined with feelings of mental contamination or pollution that arises from a fear of ones own identity being tainted or corrupted krause wong giraldo-omeara aardema  radomksy 2020 in addition improvements in feared self-perceptions during psychological treatment is significantly associated with lessened concerns about physical contamination aardema wong audet melli  baraby 2018 this suggests that an obsessional fear of germs and viruses is something entirely different than any normal fears and washing behaviors that arise due to a pandemic it is not even the same as an exaggerated fear of contamination phobic-like responses to a pandemic due to overestimating the probability of danger likely exists but these tendencies are not unique to ocd and are present in a variety of anxiety disorders tolin worhunsky  matlby 2004 instead what makes a fear of contamination truly obsessional is when this threat becomes personal not solely in terms of its potential objective outcomes but how it is perceived to corrupt and taint the self via the psychological meaning attached to contracting viruses and germs ocd is unique in comparison to other disorders characterized by high levels of anxiety yet at the same time is able to masquerade as a normal fear and even as a phobic aversion this makes it easy to assume those with ocd will be particularly affected by the current pandemic as the result of a catastrophic or exaggerated reaction similar to those with a phobia however ocd is not a phobia the early work of oconnor  robillard 1995 reports several inconsistencies in the notion of a parallel between phobic aversion and ocd the first inconsistency is that ocd is highly selective within a particular category of feared objects and substances where for example a person checks for the presence of pieces of paper near a radiator for fear of fire yet is unconcerned whether or not the stove is left on those with phobia do not show the same degree of selectivity fears revolve around a consistent objectively quantifiable category of objects or situations where they avoid all spiders or all heights or all planes in contrast obsessional fears are highly idiosyncratic and domain-specific with variations within even specific subdomains of any particular subtype like the case of the client who feared the hep c virus but showed no heightened concerns about the coronavirus this high level of selectivity can even have a protective effect against the negative effects of a pandemic as compared to other disorders that are characterized by a more generalized tendency to overestimate threat the second inconsistency is that in ocd the selective categorization of aversive stimuli is in association with another theme where for example dirt is only classified as dirt if associated with any particular person obsessional fears are conditional on the idiosyncratic meaning attached to feared objects substances or events above and beyond the objective and visible features of an object or event hence on the surface it may appear that those with ocd fear dirt viruses and germs but it is really about what these represent or symbolize especially in relation to an underlying feared self-theme that allows them to threaten the self beyond any potential objective effects like disease or death third those with ocd often do not pay any attention to reality and may not even be able to report what they try to accomplish by washing or cleaning they do not necessarily know what a virus or germ looks like anymore than a regular person while those with a simple phobia know exactly what they fear while threat itself is almost always a concern in ocd this relates to how the aversive stimulus is perceived to threaten the underlying self-theme consequently the function of washing behaviors among those with ocd is entirely different from any normal or even exaggerated reactions to the current pandemic first and foremost they are carried out to safeguard and protect against dangers to the self as opposed to the physical body finally obsessional fears are the result of a running narrative that is grounded in the imagination as opposed to reality those with ocd are not actually acting upon the demands of the real world when engaging in rituals and compulsive behaviors the person with ocd may act as if or even believe that they are acting upon reality when they fear contagion but they are really acting upon their own imagination the symbolic nature of their fear is confused with reality in a failure to fully appreciate the imaginary origin of obsessional fears it is for the same reason that obsessional concerns typically arise in inappropriate contexts that are not directly related to events and situations occurring in the here and now the out-of-context occurrence of obsessions has recently found empirical support in a recent experimental task that found intrusions occurring without evidence significantly predict symptoms of ocd audet wong radomksy  aardema 2020 in contrast intrusions occurring with evidence did not predict symptoms even though these were associated with higher levels of distress in other words obsessional fears arise without there being any direct evidence for risk of infection for example a fear of a virus finding its way through the walls as opposed to feelings of discomfort when someone walks up to you to shake your hands in the middle of a pandemic in the case of the latter someone with obsessional fears of contamination will obviously experience anxiety but this reaction does not necessarily indicate ocd the thought about being contaminated would be an entirely normal intrusive thought even when it occurs to someone with obsessional fears of contamination in other words a truly obsessional reaction occurs not on the basis of direct evidence pertinent to the here and now but as the result of an overreliance on the imagination that takes real objects events and facts out of context due to its association with the vulnerable self-theme of inner corruption recent clinical guidelines on how to manage ocd under covid-19 advise to pause or adapt ongoing cognitive-behavioral therapy during the current pandemic at least for those with fears of contamination these guidelines note how the difference between normal and abnormal fears of contamination can be difficult to tell and given potential risks to clients with engaging in exposure and response prevention erp pharmacotherapy is proposed as a first option for clients with contamination fears however the unique features of ocd make a different set of recommendations possible in particular there are evidence-based cognitive approaches that align strongly with a cognitive formulation of fears of contamination as outlined in the current paper oconnor aardema  pelissier 2005 julien oconnor  aardema 2016 first and foremost it would advise that therapists engage in psychoeducational efforts that highlight the difference between normal and obsessional fears of contamination learning how to tell the difference between normal and obsessional doubts is already an intrinsic part of inference-based cognitive therapy for ocd oconnor  aardema 2012 it teaches those with ocd that obsessions typically occur out-of-context and without any direct evidence justifying the doubt specific examples in line with recent events can be provided that illustrate the differences between normal and obsessional fears of contamination for example an urge to wash ones hands following grocery deliveries or after physically bumping into another person in the street is entirely justified in the context of the current pandemic it is a concern that occurs in-context with direct evidence for potential contamination and aligns with the facts about possible contamination next examples can be provided highlighting the unique features of obsessional concerns but applied to a situation that is neutral to the client for example in the case of the client with highly specific fears of acquiring the hep-c virus a parallel was drawn with covid-19 referring to one of the many possible scenarios that the client believed might result in acquiring hep-c the proposed obsessional scenario by which she might acquire covid-19 included someone walking by in front of the house who looked pretty old might perhaps live in residency for the elderly with other contaminated individuals may have touched things outside of the house which then could have been somehow brought into the house by the children resulting in the entire family being infected when applied in this manner clients are usually readily able to recognize the imaginary nature of the reasoning while also realizing that they justify their own fears in a similar manner thereby reducing the credibility of their own obsession in the words of the clientin a way i can see how all these covid fears invalidate my concerns about hep c it makes sense people take measures to protect themselves from covid there is real evidence to be concerned about covid but with hep c there is nothing like that theres no epidemic it does not spread easily and i have no specific risk for getting it its a fine line between reality and imagination and yet for some reason it does not cross over into covid-19 when i see people walking less than 6 feet away from me my ocd does not latch onto that it does seem like this covid thing puts the ocd in context it makes me ask myself do i really need to wash my hands for hep c
 it deserves to be noted that this client had already significantly improved as the result of cognitive therapy and psychoeducation efforts can be more challenging earlier in treatment however none of this retracts from the message that cognitive interventions can be successfully utilized in treatment during the current pandemic to illustrate the falsehood of obsessions alongside with other cognitive techniques and interventions that aim to reduce the credibility of the obsession oconnor  robillard 1999 oconnor koszegi aardema van niekerk  taillon 2009 in addition cognitive interventions addressing the underlying vulnerable self-themes have been successfully incorporated into an inference-based approach to ocd aardema  oconnor 2007 while inference-based cognitive therapy does not include exposure it is an approach that has been successfully combined with erp van niekerk brown aardema  oconnor 2014 the current pandemic has raised specific concerns about erp where exposure exercises might put patients at risk indeed in the context of the current pandemic some forms of exposure for fears of contamination go against social distancing guidelines and might reasonably be expected to increase ones risk of contagion if not followed yet an inference-based perspective would expect less problems in the administration of erp if exposure exercises align themselves fully with the differences between normal and abnormal fears of contamination as outlined in the current paper that is since obsessional fears are irrational fears of contamination that occur out-of-context and without any direct evidence there should be no risks in exposing individuals to situations where this applies this is not exposure with safety behaviors included but exposure that more specifically target the unique characteristics of obsessional fears after all the whole point of exposure is to relieve those with ocd from fears that occur in unrealistic situations not to get rid of adaptive fears and expose them to risk social distancing measures might make devising exposure exercises more difficult but those with obsessional fears of contamination are quite capable of fearing situations without any actual risk or physical contact so there should be plenty of opportunities for exposure that are safe for the patient to perform erp does not necessarily need to include putting ones hand in the toilet or hugging random people on the street the differences between normal and obsessional fears of contamination outlined in the current paper may help to assist with devising appropriate exposure exercises one might even hypothesize that targeted exposure exercises that are based on the differences between normal and abnormal contamination will be more effective than those that haphazardly target contamination in an exaggerated manner although this is an empirical question that requires further testing the current paper has explored fears of contamination in the context of the current pandemic drawing upon the historical and recent empirical literature emphasizing the role of feared-self-perceptions and in particular a fear of inner corruption giving rise to obsessions it proposes that obsessional fears of contamination can be explained by the interaction between the psychological meaning attached to contracting viruses and germs the specific feared qualities that the person most fears acquiring and the ensuing imagined effect of corrupting the self it is not the objective features of viruses and germs that underlie obsessional fears nor is it an exaggerated fear but rather how these life forms threaten the self consequently those with ocd are never right about washing their hands in response to an obsession in effect they are trying to remove dirt that is not really there while the current communication is based on recent empirical evidence on the role of feared self-perceptions in ocd there is a need for both cross-sectional and experimental research to test some of the ideas and predictions derived from the current conceptualization the model would predict that a fear of of inner corruption and the specific qualities and traits they fear acquiring is closely aligned with the negative qualities and psychological meaning ascribed to contracting contaminants like viruses and germs resulting in the occurrence of out-of-context obsessions and compulsive urges to wash and clean to preserve a normal unblemished sense of self in addition in line with recent findings it would predict that therapy specifically targeting a fear of inner corruption results in reduced physical contamination fears mediated by reductions in mental contamination aardema wong audet melli  baraby 2018 krause wong giraldo-omeara aardema  radomksy 2020 the potential effects of the current pandemic on mental health should not be underestimated the current paper does not deny that current concerns and anxieties about covid-19 may cause contribute to or worsen symptoms in individuals however this effect may not be as specific to ocd as assumed since it is not just a heightened concern about danger that characterizes this disorder but rather whether or not threats are associated with an underlying vulnerable self-theme in some individuals with ocd recent events might be incorporated or strengthen obsessional narratives leading up to obsessional fears of contamination and contagion but these can never form any real justification for the reality of an obsession that arises from the imagination for any specific obsessional effect to occur a fear of viruses and germs has to hit the persons vulnerable self-theme and the extent to which it is able to do so remains to be seen for the same reason therapy addressing feared self-perceptions might be particularly beneficial for those with obsessional fears of contamination the author is a recipient of a senior research scholar award from the quebec health research fund fonds de la

maunder et al 2003 nickell et al o connor 2002 radomksy et al 2018 the current special issue article was assigned to an independent editor for review the author has no conflicts of interest to declare  covid-19 and globalization santiago mas-coma malcolm jones k aileen marty m   the world is experiencing a major pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 the coronavirus causing covid-19 this disease first entered the human population in hubei province china in mid-november 2019 and manifested in wuhan the largest metropolitan area of hubei when a cluster of patients were admitted to hospital with a severe pneumonia of unknown cause in early december although humanity has survived previous pandemics by infectious agents the present one is unprecedented in its capacity to take advantage of modern globalization allowing for massive transborder spread at a surprising speed when writing these lines the pandemic affects 181 countries and territories with around 1084000 infected subjects more than 58000 deaths and 225000 recovered patients according to the johns hopkins university 1 the sars-cov-2 virus is optimized to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 using the viruses spike protein ace2 is a membrane-associated and secreted enzyme expressed predominantly on endothelium 2 but also present in cells of the alveolus enteric cells and in epithelial cells of the oral mucosa 3 the capacity of this virus to develop and replicate in the oral mucosa and thus in the upper parts of the respiratory system allows for easy transmission similar to flu viruses this upper respiratory involvement and high viremia at the beginning of the infection allows for transmission to other subjects even before the appearance of symptoms which additionally to subjects showing a very mild clinical picture poses a great epidemiological problem which also happens with influenza viruses 4 of asymptomaticpresymptomatic carriers the difficulties in detecting asymptomatic carriers who often do not know they are infected undoubtedly facilitates the spread and appearance of unexpected disease foci whose traceability becomes impossible in several cases 5 moreover sars-cov-2 shares characteristics well known in other animal coronaviruses among them its capacity to survive for several days outside the hosts body helps explain how sars-cov-2 spreads by contact 6 although of an undoubtedly lower epidemiological role this capacity indicates a significant difference from flu viruses this is important when considering the additional faecal shedding of this virus 7 although the impact of climate characteristics typical of the end of spring and summer eg high temperatures longer uv radiation in the longer days and a lower environmental humidity causes interruption of the transmission of flu viruses and underlie their seasonality climatic changes are not likely to have a great impact on covid-19 transmission dynamics as evident by its already logarithmic spread in countries with warmer climates the very high temperatures experienced in many countries of the northern hemisphere linked to the climate change phenomenon in recent years eg temperatures higher than 40 c could have a negative impact on the transmission capacity of the virus although for the aforementioned reasons those factors alone are unlikely to alter the level of transmission when considering that we are still without specific clinical treatments useful antivirals and vaccines and other technologies to fight the virus and that the successful development and deployment of such advances are many months away there is no other way to face the very fast spread of this disease than using the old methods of isolation of infected subjects and quarantines of populations towns and cities extending restrictions to whole countries 17 ideally these measures are coupled with diagnostic detection isolation and treatment of all clusters of infection contact tracing is as important as simple isolation there is simply no time to waste at the present level of the epidemic another question arises concerning the capacity to modulate the epidemic curve in western democratic countries and in islamic countries a priori the relatively fast success of china in controlling the disease does not seem to be something we can extrapolate outside of china differences in the capacities of political regimes to impose restrictions on the one hand and personal ideologies traditions and ways of life on the other hand suggest that it is unlikely for countries to be able to reach chinas success at such a speed anyway the way in which south korea succeeded with its emphasis on testing treating and isolating all cases coupled with testing and isolating all close contacts of covid-19 persons provides provides optimism unfortunately data on the numbers of infected people in several countries including those with very numerous populations do not appear credible differences in methodology and coverage in the implementation of diagnostic tests are undoubtedly furnishing biased pictures which do not allow for significant country comparisons nor a present global analysis or for an optimal global strategy in that sense the recent call by who to increase diagnostic test application goes in the right direction although the capacity of many of the countries seems to fall below this aspiration viral genome analyses of sars-cov-2 reveal a very slow mutation rate along its spread although this would help facilitate the development of efficient vaccines vaccine development for a virus that has antibody-mediated enhancement is tricky thus a vaccine to impede sars-cov-2s ability to become seasonal or to reduce its seasonal impact is challenging recent work on the evolution of sars-cov-2 using computational analyses strongly indicate that natural selection within a human or human-like ace2 receptor permitted alteration to the most variable part of the coronavirus genome namely the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein allowing optimal binding to the human ace2 to arise 8 this shift in rbd led to its current easy spread among and within humans mutation of the sars-cov-2 genome relating to pathogenicity are less variable thus it does not seem likely for this virus to readily become less pathogenic to humans in the near future as happened with other previously emerging viruses eg swine influenza this adds to the question of immunization will recovered subjects keep an effective immune status and if yes for how long more seriously is the question of whether a previous infection with sars-cov-2 could expose the individual to more serious disease when confronted by an altered form of sars-cov-2 in the manner that dengue virus does thus underlining the question of how the characteristic of antibody-enhanced infection of sars-cov-2 and of other coronavirus challenges not only the notion of immunity from having been infected but the development of a safe and effective vaccine in china and elsewhere in the world most of the population is still susceptible because to date there is no proven previous contact with the virus this raises many serious questions regarding the threat of subsequent waves of infection it is evident that everyone is learning from the present situation with this one health disease 1718 from clinicians to virologists epidemiologists veterinarians scientists of all kinds and even economists psychologists politicians and a wide spectrum of other professionals but the reaction of governments decision makers supranational institutions and international agencies merits an extra analysis evidence indicates a zoonotic origin which reminds us of the origin of the avian influenza or bird flu pandemic by h5n1 similarly first detected in guangdong province in china in 1996 91718 it is evident that after what has happened with covid-19 and its social impact and future economic repercussions china and other nations where citizens frequently have close contact with wild animals will need to implement strict control measures to avoid a similar pandemic to appear in their territory again china has an immense international commerce reflected in its exchange of people and products with almost all countries and therefore its public health measures or lack thereof can have great consequences for all nations in developed countries of the northern hemisphere it is hard to understand why supranational agencies and expert institutions did not understand the magnitude of the risk posed by such a singular virus nor of its capacity to take advantage of globalization with an astonishingly rapid worldwide spread indeed the crucial characteristics of covid-19 lie in its transmission pathways existence of asymptomaticpresymptomatic carriers and survival potential in the external environment which were already explained and transmitted to the world by the chinese colleagues since mid-january so many scientific publications during the last two decades about the capacity of globalization to facilitate the spread of infectious agents seem to have been ignored worldwide spread of viruses following different transmission ways as hiv virus ebola virus aedes mosquito-borne viruses as those of zika chikungunya and dengue yearly vaccine problems posed by the quick mutating seasonal flu viruses seem to have been useless models now in comparison to the very fast spreading new virus how is it that in early january after the recognition that this virus was incubating in china no leaders seriously considered high risk of an accelerated rate of disease spread posed when chinese people returned to other countries from their visits to china for the celebration of chinese new year for covid-19 we learned early on that there are marked differences in pathogenicity based on age groups with a pronouncedly higher mortality from the age of 60 it is difficult to understand that no developed country prioritized control measures to be applied to aged peoples residences many deaths could have been avoided was no one in these agencies analyzing age-dependent data initial inaction subsequent slow reaction 10 and lack of consensus agreements memorandums of understanding by neighbouring countries despite repeated warnings by who suggest that the role of agencies put in place in the past precisely to prevent situations such as the present one will need to be re-analyzed the deceptive presentation of countries within the european union each acting as if each were working alone unavoidably poses the question about the usefulness of having a european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc stockholm it seems inevitable to conclude that this agency failed in passing the correct message and failed to make the needed timely efforts to convince the leaders of european countries surprisingly the us suffered from similar mistakes as the european countries including a pronounced delay in creating tests and in its inexplicable descensions to produce testing criteria that obscured community spread coupled with a heavy reluctance by the us cdc and us governmental officials to change the testing criteria significantly until mid-march and the dearth of equipment including lack of needed personal protective equipment including surgical masks and facemasks 11 and insufficient quantities of mechanical ventilators for the patients and lack of surgical capacity for hospital beds and icu space much of this reflected the reduction of the strategic national stockpile which had been built up throughout the usa in the beginning of this century and slowly degraded to only two locations maryland and california plus the reduction of the global health and security unit a unit responsible for pandemic preparedness in the white house national security staff 12 the loss of the once robust strategic national stockpile for a minimal stockpile is particularly lamentable in light of the reality that in the absence of specific treatments non-pharmacologic approaches rely on supportive therapies with oxygen and ventilatory support and other equipment coupled with needed ppe that once formed a large part of that strategic national stockpile were no longer readily available nationwide too often governments focus their defense primarily against other nations and other ideological human actors world leaders forget that mother nature is the most potent bringer of doom from massive cyclones destructive wildfires to horrific pandemics lessons from all this should be learned and appropriate corrections implemented in the near future once the present picture begins to clear the short-term scenarios of the present situation pose many questions china is now suffering from the boomerang of the pandemic and is obliged to recreate barriers to avoid the re-entry of covid-19 to its territory after they detected the reintroduction by travelers coming from outside of china in a country with such a massive population where the vast majority still has not experienced covid-19 and thus has no previous immunological contact with this virus the risk of a second wave is very high in europe and north america no country has yet reached the peak of the epidemiological curve and there is a great disagreement in the mathematical models being used one important aspect appears obvious the successful experience of china in its rapid control of the outbreak cannot be easily extrapolated to occidental democracies where individual freedom is a largely internalized concept nor do leaders outside of china have the capacity to impose these measures at the level of the chinese regime 13 what will happen in countries of the indian sub-continent the middle-east and south america where crowded living is traditional mass gatherings are usual and the national health systems are far from sufficient also remains an open question the possibility of the appearance of subsequent secondary peaks cannot not be underestimated we should also take great interest in analyzing the thus far incomprehensible and considerable differences in mortality rates between different countries eg china-italy and between different areas inside the same country lombardia compared to its neighbouring areas inside italy none of the explanations so far proposed clarify this in the mid-term the subsequent scenario in the southern hemisphere must be considered nearly all south american caribbean and african countries have limited national health systems with insufficient capacity to prevent spread of covid-19 and to mitigate death and disabilities several of these nations quickly decided to close frontiers although generally too late as they already had the disease inside all indications reveal that the southern hemisphere will not escape from the massive problems of this disease a worrying scenario for their immediate future the problem is coupled to the question of the extent to which developed countries will manifest the will and the capacity to help low and middle countries the outbreak in the southern hemisphere is flaring now and this is happening while the higher income nations are still struggling over their own issues in i implementing control measures ii trying to recover from the immense social and economic impacts and iii concentrating in impeding re-entry of the virus by foreigners nations everywhere must recognize that in this era of massive global exchange of persons and goods leaving the outbreaks soring anywhere posses a risk everywhere the potential long-tern scenario of likely secondary waves of infection is also concerning a second wave may be more devastating than the first one as happened in other pandemics in history several factors must be considered i once the peak of the epidemiological curve is reached there will still be many people who are not exposed to the virus and ii we still do not know whether covid-19 infection furnishes a protective immunization status or worsens the outcome of second infection nor do we know anything about the length of such an immunological response the fast speed of this pandemic and the unavoidable time needed to discover and develop useful medications antivirals and vaccines advocates strongly for the urgency of quickly implemented public health measures of hygiene respiratory hand and environmental case detection with proper case management and isolation coupled with social isolation and population quarantines of a duration which may differ according to the objectives such as buying time to i avoid the collapse of local health systems ii for the discovery of useful treatments antivirals and vaccines dealing with a potential antibody enhanced infection as with sars may pose difficulties in getting a vaccine and iii have sufficient capacity in terms of icu beds ventilators and other equipment needed to save lives besides health professionals on the frontline we need psychologists to help people adapt to the confinement measures economists to analyze economic consequences as well as scientists research develop and analyze for safety and efficacy useful treatments antivirals and vaccines and epidemiologists to analyze the quickly changing epidemiological data as well as other engineers and others to innovate solutions all of this is not only crucial but urgent 1417 regarding epidemiological data it is evident that data on infected subjects from the different countries are only indicative but cannot be compared diagnostic test application ie test availability and number of health personnel for sample taking and analysis differs markedly between countries this does not mean however that these data are not internally useful for a country to follow their epidemiological curve and evaluate the success of their control measures applied the recent preliminary results of the observational studies of infected and control patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and an antibiotic drug with previously demonstrated action against zika and ebola viruses azithromycin are promising despite the limitations of a small sample size short-term outcome follow-up and lack of positive response by 10 of the infected subjects this appears to be one of the first antiviral drug combination to show serious promise as a cure to covid-19 and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of covid-19 worldwide 15 another combination with promise is hydroxychloroquine with remdesivir more recently the mechanisms of antiviral effect the risk-benefit ratio and the thresholds of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have been reviewed and attention has been drawn to the need for high-quality evaluation protocols of the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine as a post-exposure drug for people exposed to sars-cov-2 infection ie people with close contact with positive tested patients including home and medical caregivers 19 additionally scientists public health experts doctors and experts in infectious diseases should advise governors and other decision makers and be ready to answer requests from the different media our expert role is crucial now in transmitting the appropriate information to the people we must be very careful in measuring the words we use to avoid misunderstandings a good example was the initial insistence by governments to downplay the outbreak of the disease thus when it became plain that the spread of the disease in their countries could be significant and could produce severe even deadly disease and that strict measures implying individual freedom restrictions should be implemented a wave of criticism and disbelief immediately followed because people did not understand this change another example has been the continuous reference to flu to help people understand the transmission and the clinical characteristics of the disease the consequence has been that people immediately considering though that covid-19 was not so serious thus complicating subsequent efforts to help people and even decision makers understand that covid-19 is not a flu the way of referring to age-group dependent pathogenicity and mortality also led the youth to think this disease was not relevant to them which led to massive problems in convincing the youth of their responsibilities in following isolation measures and hygienic standards the next problem is to help people understand that reaching the descending arm of the epidemiological curve does not necessarily mean the end of the local epidemic and that it does not exclude the possibility for further peaks to appear the temporality concept is not easy to explain though models exist thus no one knows how long it will take to reach the descending arm of the epidemic in each area and whether in neighbouring areas it will follow the same pattern most branches of the media are not accustomed to interviewing scientists and similarly many scientists are not used to explaining their science in laymans terms scientists must adapt their messages so as to convey the information in a way that laymen can understand we must recognize that most of the lay audience has virtually no serious background knowledge about health infectious diseases or epidemiology the task may be very difficult but it is also vital we must be available and we must communicate otherwise the media will call on non-expert people who are likely to provide misleading information the risk from the dissemination of inappropriate information is obvious even more at a time where people confined to their homes dedicate significant amounts of time to obtain information through the different media economists are logically highly concerned about the economic impact of control measures and go on giving priority to the economic side of the crisis even though plenty of models existed that show the economic impacts of the disease most economists are challenged by the social and economic depth of the covid-19 pandemic they are struggling to understand that better control soonest though of apparent great in economic losses can ultimately lead to much less total economic loss and to faster recovery they have not yet grasped that prolonging the outbreak causes far more economic damage than that of taking drastic measures to end the pandemic globally as soon as possible similarly many governmental leaders have difficulties in changing their political chip after decades of repeating respective party priorities there is an important role for the scientific societies in domains related to the present pandemic national societies are a good tool to channel appropriate advise up to government decision makers we know that globalization and climate change are giving rise to new scenarios in which new infectious agents have more opportunities to originate and similarly can facilitate spread of already existing agents which take the advantage to enhance their geographical spread and can perhaps lead to worse pandemics than the present one 16 a message to the people is needed to help all persons understand that this changing world unavoidably implies higher probabilities for such situations and that wide research results suggest that other epidemics or pandemics may appear in the future and to plan for and maintain trained persons with appropriate access to needed equipment and supplies and an easily expanded surg capacity understanding the lessons of this pandemic and incorporating those lessons at all levels should lead us towards improving our preparedness in all sectors to mitigate risks from the inevitable next pandemic  what can we learn from the time evolution of covid-19 epidemic in slovenia ioan bldea  a recent work doi 101101doi 10 2020 indicated that temporarily splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the spread of sars-cov-2 virus the fact that soon afterwards on may 15 2020 the two million people slovenia was the first european country proclaiming the end of covid-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective motivated by this evolution in this paper we investigate the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in slovenia with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of covid-19 infections noteworthily the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption it is solely based on raw epidemiological data out of the results presented here the most important one is perhaps the finding that while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate  by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state they only improve the -value by  15 as compared to the much bearable state of social and economical life wherein justifiable wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforcedfollowed significantly for behavioral and social science our analysis of the time dependence   t may reveal  an interesting self-protection instinct of the population which became manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement in the unprecedented difficulty created by the covid-19 pandemic outbreak 1 mathematical modeling developed by epidemiologists over many decades 2-7 may make an important contribution in helping politics to adopt adequate regulations to efficiently fight against the spread of sars-cov-2 virus while mitigating negative economical and social consequences the latter aspect is of paramount importance 8 also because if not adequately considered by governments currently challenged to deciding possibly under dramatic circumstances and formidable tight schedule it can jeopardize the healthcare system itself as an effort in this direction we drew recently attention 9 to the general fact that the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus in smaller groups can be substantially slowed down as compared to the case of larger populations in this vein the time evolution of covid-19 disease in the two million people slovenia certainly deserves special consideration as on 15 may 2020 concluding that this country has the best epidemic situation in europe prime minister janez janka declared the end of the covid-19 epidemic within slovenian borders 10 subsequent developments only four new cases between 15 and 24 may 11 cf table 1  have fortunately given further support to this declaration attempting to understanding and learning from this sui generis circumstance is the very aim of the present paper thanks to long standing efforts extending over many decades a rich arsenal of theoretical methods of analyzing epidemics exists most of them trace back to the celebrated sir model 2-7 wherein the time evolution of the numbers of individuals belonging to various epidemiological classes susceptible s infected i recovered r etc classes is described by deterministic differential equations unfortunately those approaches need many input parameters 1213 that can often be reliably estimated only after epidemics ended 14 which un-avoidably compromises their ability of making predictions as an aggravating circumstance one should also add the difficulty not encountered in the vast majority of previous studies how do the input parameters needed in model simulations change in time under so many restrictive measures wearing face masks social distancing movement restrictions isolation and quarantine policies etc unknown in the pre-covid-19 era estimating model parameters from data fitting in a certain time interval to make predictions can easily run into a difficulty like that described in the first paragraph of section 23 as shown below our approach obviates the aforementioned difficulty we will adopt a logistic growth model in a form which is different from that often employed in the past 15 16 17 18 19 see sections 23 and 3 for technical details this model is considerably simpler than sir flavors and already turned out to be an appealing framework in dealing with current covid-19 pandemic issues 913 logistic functions see equation 2 below were utilized for studying various problems 20 21 22 23 24 25 studies on population dynamics of epidemic populations 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 were also frequently based on the logistic function nevertheless as anticipated there is an important difference between the present approach section 23 and all the other approaches of which we are aware the latter merely justify the logistic model by the fact that recorded disease numbers followed a sigmoidal curve shortcomings of this standpoint are delineated in the beginning of section 23 the strength of the approach presented in section 23 is that we do not use data fitting rather we use raw epidemiological data to validate the logistic growth and straightforwardly extract the time dependent infection rate which is the relevant model parameter for the specific case considered and makes it possible to compare how efficient different restrictive measures act to mitigate the covid-19 pandemic and even to get insight significant for behavioral and social science to briefly remind standard logistical growth in time t of an infected population n  nt follows an ordinary differential equation containing two constants input model parameters the intrinsic infection rate  0 and the so called carrying capacity n in a given environment the latter has a fixed value to which the population saturates asymptotically lim t nt  n this can be seen by straightforwardly integrating equation 1 with the initial condition nt tt 0  n 0  which is often recast by using the half-time   t 0  1  ln n n 0  1  nt t  n2 noteworthily for the discussion that follows equation 2 assumes time-independent model parameters in epidemiological language nt gives the cumulative number of cases at time t plotted as a function of t the derivative with respect to time throughout assumed a contiguous variablet  dndt representing the daily number of new infections is referred to as the epidemiological curve  before proceeding with the data analysis let us briefly summarize relevant public heath measures social distancing and movement restrictions imposed during the covid-19 crisis in slovenia 11 33 the first case of coronavirus was confirmed on march 4 2020 imported via a returnee traveling from morocco via italy 34 on 10 march the government banned all incoming flights from italy south korea iran and china the land border with italy was closed for all but freight transport indoor public with more than 100 persons were prohibited sporting and other events with more than 500 participants were allowed only without audience  the blue curve of figure 2a depicting the evolution of total covid-19 infections in slovenia underlying data are collected in table 1  has an appealing similarity to the logistic s-shaped curve depicted in figure 1  one would be therefore tempting to follow numerous previous authors 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 who claimed that the logistic model applies merely because of the apparently good data fitting still to claim that a description based on a model like that of equation 2 is valid checking that the model parameters do not depend on the fitting range t 1  t 2  is mandatory for the specific case considered here this means that fitting numbers of infected individuals in time range t 1  t  t 2 should yield within inherent statistical errors values of n and  independent of t 1 and t 2  and like in other known cases 35 36 this is just the stumbling block for the logistic function approach delineated in section 21 in particular the infection rate  should not depend on how broad the is the range t 1  t 2  however we checked by straightforward numerical calculations that it does given the real epidemic timeline delineated in section 22 the infection rate must indeed depend on time   t if the contrary was true all containment measures would be useless but when  depends on t equations 2 and 3 no longer apply they were deduced by integrating out equation 1 assuming a time-independent  fortunately rather than merely inquiring how good the fitting curve based on equation 2 is we are able to directly check and demonstrate see below the validity of a time-dependent logistic model merely based on the real epidemiological reports to this aim we recast the differential equation 1 which is the basic definition of the logistic growth not to be confused with the logistic function of equation 2 as follow when put in this way one can straightforwardly get insight in how to proceed one should plot the ratio of the daily new cases to the cumulative number of cases numerator and denominator in equation 4 respectively as a function of the cumulative number of cases and inspect whether the curve is linear or departs from linearity is the decrease linear like anticipated in the ideal simulation presented in figure 1b  we have the demonstration that the logistic growth model applies the curve constructed as described above using the covid-19 epidemic reports for slovenia table 1 noteworthily the low- regime comprises two periods lockdown and lockdown easing to quantify the differences between these two periods we used equation 4  we believe that especially the two results shown in figure is that what really matters is not to keep everyone at home italian approach but rather to impede virus transmission german approach eg by wearing masks adequate hygiene and social distancing infection transmission does not strongly increase upon easing as long as face masks and social distancing prevent sars-cov-2 virus spreading one should add at this point -an important fact that appears to be currently inadequately understandthat along with a less pleasant effect of a short-term slight increase of the daily new cases a moderate increase in the infection rate also has a positive impact it reduces epidemic duration compare the right tail the green and orange curves in figure 3b  ii the fact that the carrying capacity n does not change upon lockdown easing is equally important this is the maximum number of individuals that can be infected in a given environment rephrasing the maximum number of infected individuals does not increase when the lockdown is released the total carrying capacity of a given environment does not change from a methodological perspective one should emphasize the important technical strength of the approach proposed above which made it possible to arrive at the aforementioned conclusions it is only the differential form equation 1 of logistic growth employed that obviates the need for any additional theoretical assumption the traditional approach of validating the logistic model by blind data fitting using its integral counterpart equation 2 does not work for covid-19 pandemic applications because the model parameter  can and does depend on time this time dependence   t is essential to properly assess and make recommendations on the efficiency of the restriction measures to be enforced against sars-cov-2 virus spread and just because in its differential form utilized here the logistic model merely requires directly measurable epidemiological quantities daily reportst and cumulative number of cases nt cf equation 1 makes in the present unsusual situation this model an alternative preferable to other more elaborate sir-based flavors the latter models contain a series of quantities that cannot be directly accessed experimentally governments confronted to taking decisions under unprecedented time pressure cannot await confirmation of often speculative theoretical hypotheses needed in data processing before ending let us also note that monitoring the t-timeline allowed us to get insight also relevant for behavioral and social science the self-protection instinct of the population became manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement cf section 23   flattening the curve insights from queueing theory sergio palomo jamol pender william massey robert hampshire c gerald ford r  the worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus was first identified in 2019 in wuhan china since then the disease has spread worldwide as it currently spreading in the united states policy makers public health officials and citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the united states healthcare system they fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities most countries and states in america have introduced mitigation strategies  corresponding author such as social distancing to decrease the rate of newly infected people ie flattening the curve in this paper we analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary poisson arrival rates with this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources this allows us to characterize how aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system we also demonstrate how flattening the curve impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time of the peak demand for the hospital resources finally we present empirical evidence from china south korea italy and the united states that supports the insights from the model  the coronavirus was first identified in wuhan a city of over 11 million people in chinas hubei province in december of 2019 covid-19 the disease caused by the coronavirus grew by several thousand per day in china between late january and the peak of their epidemic in early february the number of infections appearing each day has decreased there significantly this was mainly due to stringent containment efforts however the outbreak is now a global pandemic large outbreaks in south korea iran italy spain and the united states have all sparked interest in coronavirus research as of april 19th 2020 there have been 2432092 cases and 166794 deaths confirmed worldwide also the world health organization has officially named covid-19 a global pandemic the spread of the virus has been rapid with 208 countries now having reported cases lawmakers and public health experts such as national institute of allergy and infectious diseases director dr anthony fauci have been encouraging social distancing as a measure to flatten the curve this implies that we want to push down the peak number of infected people and spread it out over time many people understand how flattening the curve impacts the healthcare system from an empirical or qualitative perspective see goebel 8  however there is little quantitative research in this area and relatively little research on how much pushing is needed to flatten the curve in this paper we model the potential demand for hospital resources like beds ventilators medical staff as an infinite server queue with non-stationary arrival rates we use as our simple examples of unimodal arrival rate functions the scaled gaussian distribution density and the scaled gamma density functions we then derive explicit expressions for the peak mean number in the queueing system as well as the time of this peak our paper has two main goals the first one is showing the global community how operations research represented here by queueing theory helps us understand the impact of covid-19 on the healthcare system the other goal is showing that by leveraging insights from queues with time varying rates leads to simple descriptions of the hospital patient dynamics for the covid-19 pandemic more specifically we show using a scaled gaussian arrival rate and a scaled gamma arrival rate how to calculate the time of the peak infection rate the peak mean number of infected people and the time between the peak hospitalization rate and the time of the peak number of patients we use an infinite server queueing model to demonstrate the impact of social distancing and flattening the curves of arrival rates and mean counts of on hospital capacity operationally we can learn from the situations we have already observed in china europe and new york city to avoid similar outcomes in other places from the data we see that every hotspot has its own curve see hilk et al 11  one important advantage of our work is that it can be used to study each individual curve for individual regions around the world the geographic and temporal clustering of outbreaks have the potential to create a health care system collapse many states in the united states have imposed stay at home orders to contain the spread of the disease however since many people are asymptomatic we can show through the analysis of our queueing examples that containment measures implemented in recent days may take weeks to have an observable effect in the data although hospital bed capacity is an important concern for health care officials it is not the most crucial bottleneck for providing critical care when patients need it after observing many deaths in italy many experts and government officials are concerned about the number of available ventilators patients who become critically ill need individual ventilators but they have become a scarce resource equally important resources are medical specialists and staff members that can supervise the patients in their beds and operate the ventilators properly fundamentally this paper strives to help healthcare managers understand what supply is needed for all these lifesaving resources at the peak of the ultimate curve for their aggregate demand the contributions of this work can be summarized as follows  given a non-stationary arrival rate we derive an expression for the mean number of infected individuals using an infinite server queue  using the infinite server queue model we derive the exact time of the peak load and the value of the peak load  using our peak load calculations we determine the value of flattening that needs to be done in order to make the peak load infection value below a pre-specified capacity level  we study the impact of the duration of the virus on the peak load dynamics of hospital resources and how it affects our flattening policies  we characterize the nonlinear relationship between flattening the curve and the time lag between the peak rate of newly admitted patients and the peak demand for hospital resources we also show how the lag can be observed in real data we model the number of patients as a m t g queueing model there are two important reasons to begin with the m t g queueing model even though it has an infinite number of servers and this does not seem realistic from a practical perspective the first reason is that the m t g queue is very tractable since the distribution is known in closed form for any non-stationary arrival rate the second reason is that the m t g queue is the best type of queue one can hope for where everyone is immediately served and no one ever waits for service from the perspective of the covid-19 epidemic this means that anyone who wants a bed gets a bed immediately or who ever needs a ventilator gets a ventilator immediately in this regard the m t g infinite server queue is an upper bound for queueing models with a finite number of servers and without abandonment since it represents the dynamics if the manager had access to an infinite amount of resources and is not resource constrained moreover the infinite server queue has a history of being used to staff finite server systems see for example jennings et al 12  feldman et al 7  liu and whitt 15  massey and pender 16  thus the infinite server queue serves as the first step to understanding more complicated systems in this section we state the closed form formulas for the m t g queueing model which exploits the results of eick et al 5 6 for the time varying infinite server queue in the paper of eick et al 5  they use the properties of the poisson arrival process and use poisson random measure arguments to show that the m t g queue q  t has a poisson distribution with time varying mean q  t as observed in eick et al 5 6  q  t has the following integral representation where u is the time varying arrival rate and s represents a service time with distribution g g  1  gt  ps  t and s e is a random variable with distribution that follows the stationary excess of residual-lifetime cdf g e  defined by 25 remark as a point of emphasis we would like to remind readers that the word curve in this paper maps to two different things the arrival rate function and the mean offered load the general public might call these the infection rate and the number of patients in the hospital moreover there is a causal relationship between the two curves ie you need to flatten the first one in order to flatten the second one in this section we describe the dynamics of the m t g queue whose arrival rate is driven by a gaussian distribution function thus the arrival rate function t is given by the following expression where  is mean of the gaussian distribution  is the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution   is the number of total expected number of infected individuals over the lifetime of the epidemic and  x is the probability density function of the standard gaussian distribution ie one of the important things to observe is that the standard gaussian pdf is bounded from above ie 28 figure 1  plot of gaussian arrival rate functions using the gaussian pdf as our arrival rate gives us the following integral relationships in figure 1  we plot two gaussian arrival rate functions the blue curve is a gaussian  10   4 and the red curve flattened curve is a gaussian  20   4 by increasing the standard deviation by a factor of 2 we have reduced the peak value of the arrival rate by a factor of two this follows from the mode of gaussian being inversely proportional to the standard deviation  now that we have a full understanding of the gaussian arrival rate function that we will use for patient arrivals we can leverage insights from non-stationary queues to understand the dynamics of the total number infected and how long they stay infected theorem 21 the m t g queueing model with a gaussian distribution arrival rate has a poissonq mg t distribution where the mean q mg t is the solution to the following ordinary differential equation and the solution is given by moreover for any value of t we have that proof we actually start with the solution of the queue length given in equation 213 the solution is easily given by the formula from eick et al 5 since we have that 214 to find the differential equation one simply takes the derivative of the solution with respect to the time parameter t the reason that we get the final expression in equation 213 is that the derivative of the gaussian distribution yields the first hermite polynomial times the gaussian pdf finally the bound on the standard gaussian density function yields the bounds on the queue length this completes the proof table 1  comparison between regular and flattened curves peak values and times    100 in figure 2  we plot the same two gaussian arrival functions given in figure 1  however to the right of each arrival curve we also plot the subsequent queue length when an exponential distribution is assumed for the service distribution the parameters for each curve and the service distributions are given in table 1  table 1 and figure 2 yield many observations the first observation is that we see that both arrival rate curves intersect with the queue length at the peak queue length this is a nice property and can be explained by first noticing that es  1  1 in our example thus at the peak queue length we know the time derivative of the queue length is equal to zero ie 2 15 this implies that at the time of the peak queue length t  we have a second observation is that for this value of the service distribution es  1 the peak arrival rate is larger than the peak queue length we find that for the flattened arrival curve the value of the peak queue length is closer to the value of the peak arrival rate than in the non-flattened case this implies that even though one might flatten the curve and reduce the peak arrival rate by one half it does not mean that the peak queue length are also reduced by one half we observe that the queue peak queue length is 91 of the peak arrival rate in the non-flattened curve while it is 97 of the flattened curve in addition to finding the solution of the queue length we can compute an expression for the time of the peak queue length we know that the time of the peak arrival rate occurs at the mode  and our goal is to understand the lag effect ie the length of time the peak queue length occurs after the peak arrival rate occurs theorem 22 suggests that the time of the peak queue length occurs after the peak arrival time   this is generally well known in the queueing literature however this is an important fact for the covid-19 outbreak as it helps determine exactly from the peak number of infections when the peak load will be seen in the healthcare system theorem 22 the time of the peak queue length is the solution to the following fixed point equation proof the proof is found in the appendix table 2  comparison between regular and flattened curves peak values and times    100 table 3  comparison between regular and flattened curves peak values and times    100  in figures 3 -4  we plot our gaussian arrival curves with their respective queue lengths in figure 3  we set the mean service time to be es  2 and in figure 4  we set the mean service time to be es  10 on the left of the both figures 3 -4  we plot the actual arrival rate and the actual queue length however on the right of figures 3 -4 we plot the actual queue length but an arrival rate that is scaled by the mean service time es we observe that the in the unscaled plots on the left the arrival rate does not intersect with the queue length at the peak however in the scaled plots on the right we observe that the arrival rate intersects with the queue length curve at the queue length peak this verifies equation 216 again finally we observe in table 1 that by reducing the arrival rate peak by one half reduces the queue length peak by one half when es  1 however we observe in tables 2 -3 that as we increase es we see a smaller reduction in the peak queue length certainly we expect the infectious period to be longer than one day for covid-19 so our theoretical results imply that we may need to do more flattening of the curve as patients spend more time infected theorem 23 the time of peak queue length is bounded by the following upper and lower bounds proof first we observe that from theorem 22 that t  solves the following fixed point equation now to prove the upper bound on the peak time one observes that the numerator is bounded by the standard gaussian bound given in equation 239 for the lower bound one just recognizes that both expectations e s e   t   se  and e  t   se  are non-negative to make an equivalence with the last equality we use the equality between the expected stationary excess random variable and the second moment of the service distribution ie  this completes the proof theorem 23 provides upper and lower bounds on the time of the peak queue length numerically one can use a bisection algorithm in order to explicitly determine the time of peak infection once the time of the peak infection is known then one can use theorem 21 to determine the queue length value at that peak time as well as the value of the peak infection this provides estimates on the number of ventilators or beds needed at the peak time of infection theorem 24 let q mg t be a m t g queueing model with a gaussian distribution arrival rate if c is the maximum capacity queue length for all values of t then the value of   that flattens the peak queue length below c is given by 220 proof we know the queue length is bounded by the constant now we let the constant equal the capacity and solve for the standard deviation to get 223 in this section we specify the service distribution to be a constant although the constant assumption for the service time is quite unrealistic this will simplify many of the complicated equations and yield simple insights our first result shows the queue length can be described by an ode and the solution is simply an integral of the arrival rate evaluated at the current time and the current time minus the constant service rate finally we also show that the lag between the peak arrival rate and peak load is equal to half of the service time corollary 25 the m t d queueing model with a gaussian distribution arrival rate is the solution to the following ordinary differential equation and the solution is given by finally the time of the peak is equal to 228 proof this follows from standard analysis and the symmetry of the gaussian distribution when the service time distribution is exponential the mean queue length q  t solves the autonomous ordinary differential equation 229 the subsequent ordinary differential equation is linear and has a closed form solution given by the following expression q  t  q 0 e t  e t t 0 se s ds 230 corollary 26 the m t m queue with arrival rate given by a gaussian distribution with parameters has the following closed form expression for the mean transient queue length theorem 27 when the arrival rate is a gaussian function and the service time is given by an exponential distribution then the lag in the time between the peak arrival rate and the time of the peak queue length is given by the following expression proof the proof is given in the appendix thus for the exponential distribution we have an explicit formula for the lag in terms of the  function this function is related to conditional expectations of gaussian random variables and is related to the inverse mills ratio ie in the context of operations research the  function has been analyzed in resource sharing settings in hampshire et al 9 10  as well as in the context of using risk measures for staffing multi-server queueing systems in pender 21  in this section we describe the dynamics of the m t g queue whose arrival rate is driven by a gamma distribution function thus the arrival rate function t is given by the following expression where  is shape parameter of the gamma distribution  is the rate parameter gamma distribution   is the parameter unlike the standard gaussian the gamma distribution is not guaranteed to be bounded unless the parameter   1 thus for the remainder of this paper we assume that   1 under this condition we have that using the gamma pdf as our arrival rate gives us the following integral relationships one reason for using the gamma distribution is that it is not symmetric like the gaussian distribution from some of the data that we see in practice the arrival rate distribution does not appear to be symmetric and may have a heavy tail for example in figure   we see that the tail of the data is heavier than the gaussian distribution tail this fact of the data encourages us to explore the gamma arrival rate function which is asymmetric in figure 5  we plot two gamma arrival rate functions the blue curve is a gamma  5   5 and the red curve flattened curve is a gamma  10   5 by increasing the variance by a factor of 2 we have reduced the peak value of the arrival rate by a factor of two this follows from the mode of gamma being inversely proportional to the standard deviation  now that we have a full understanding of the gamma arrival rate function that we will use for patient arrivals we can leverage insights from non-stationary queues to understand the dynamics of the total number infected and how long they stay infected theorem 28 the m t g queueing model with a gamma  distribution arrival rate has a poissonq mg t distribution where the mean q mg t is the solution to the following ordinary differential equation and the solution is given by moreover for any value of t and   1 we have that proof we actually start with the solution the solution is easily given by the the formula from eick et al 5  to find the differential equation one simply takes the derivative of the solution with respect to the time parameter t finally the bound on the standard gaussian density function yields the bounds on the queue length theorem 29 the time of the peak queue length is the solution to the following fixed point equation  proof in order to find the peak queue length we need to set the time derivative of the queue length to zero ie  q t    0 245 now using the differential equation given in equation 2 41 we have isolating t  by itself on the left hand side we obtain  this completes the proof what is nice about this result is that it decomposes into two parts the first part is the mode of the arrival rate function which in the case of the gamma distribution occurs at 1   the second part is the positive shift from the mode of the arrival rate function which is  this also implies that the peak queue length occurs after the peak arrival rate like in the gaussian case  in this section we use some of the data on covid-19 infections and deaths which was made available through johns hopkins university website dong et al 4  in figure 7  we plot the number of confirmed infections per day in the countries of china south korea italy and the united states one immediately can tell these countries apart since the confirmed cases start earlier in china then south korea then italy and then finally the united states we also observe that as of april 16th it appears that the united states has hit its peak and is on its way down on each of the plots we also overlay a gaussian and gamma distribution function to get a sense what distribution parameters best fit the data for china the best gaussian fit was a gaussian   314101   23   828 and the best gamma fit was a gamma   369218   675   25 for south korea the best gaussian fit was a gaussian   34914   42   1637 and the best gamma fit was a gamma   31220   94   2 for italy the best gaussian fit was a gaussian   440393   60   2679 and the best gamma fit was a gamma   340126   957   15 for the united states the best gaussian fit was a gaussian   1295233   80   1472 and the best gamma fit was a gamma   1768739   17   2 in figure 8  we plot the arrivals and deaths per day from january 22nd to april 16th normalized by their maximum value arrival  black dots deaths  red dots for china south korea italy and the united states the maximum confirmed infections was 15 136  851 6557 and 35098 respectively moreover for china south korea italy and the united states the maximum confirmed deaths was 252 11 919 and 4591 respectively we observe that for most all countries except italy the largest number of deaths lags the largest number of confirmed infections this is the lag effect that we observe in our queueing models this lag effect also inspires our construction of a new way to view the lag effect in figure 9  we plot the cumulative distribution function of the total number of arrivals and deaths for the countries of china south korea italy united states japan and germany this plot matches the quantiles of the arrivals to the quantiles to that of the deaths in this plot we observe for 5 out of the 6 countries that the cdf of the death count lags behind the arrival cdf the only country that does not follow the lag effect is japan and this observation is consistent with japan not testing its citizens enough montanari 19  moreover we also observe that the lag effect is most pronounced in south korea which has done a great job of testing its citizens and keeping them alive kim 14  if we rank the countries according to their lag effects it is from best to worst south korea germany china united states italy japan this method of viewing the arrival and death cdfs allows one to understand the impact of testing and the quality of the healthcare system in that country these observations are also confirmed in table 6 where we plot the lag according to the quantile levels in the cdf plots given in figure 9  country q  1 q  2 q  3

prescriptive guidance on how to flatten the demand for hospital resources first we show that the peak number of hospitalized patients is inversely related to flattening the rate of arriving patients theorem 21 this insight provides a mechanism through the standard deviation parameter  to control the peak number of hospitalized people however the effectiveness of social distancing on flattening the curve ie increasing  remains an open question as a result in order to avoid overcrowding flattening should be inversely proportional to the amount of hospital capacity additionally we find that flattening the curve has a smaller impact on the peak number of patients when the service times are long this means the longer patients stay in the hospital the more society must flatten the curve in order to achieve the same capacity level in the three examples with an exponential service distribution and a gaussian arrival rate we flattened the peak arrival rate by 50 however we see that the peak queue length was reduced by 47 42 23 respectively for es  1210 for the gamma arrival rate setting we see that a 33 reduction in the peak arrival rate we obtain a 31 and 16 reduction respectively for es  110 a key takeaway from the queueing analysis is that the time of the peak arrival rate of infected patients does not coincide with the time of the peak of number of hospitalized people or deaths there is a time lag we characterize this lag exactly for the simplified queue model theorem 22 first we show that the peak number of infected lags behind the peak number of new infected individuals surprisingly there is a nonlinear relationship between flattening the curve and the time lag between the peak rate of newly admitted patients and the peak demand for hospital resources theorem 22 moreover we show in theorem 62 that the lag  is bounded by the mean service time for an exponential distribution ie this analysis also implies that as we flatten the curve ie increase  the lag converges to the mean service time 1   in this paper we present a simple infinite server queueing model of the number of infected people with covid-19 this analysis can be used to understand how many people will become infected need a hospital bed or need a ventilator we show how the dynamics of the number infected explicitly depends on the arrival rate function we explore two arrival rate functions the first is symmetric and is given by a gaussian distribution function and the second is is asymmetric and is given by a gamma distribution function we explicitly calculate the time of the peak queue length the peak queue length and its dependence on the duration of infection despite the insights derived in this paper this is not the whole story and many questions still remain in what follows we outline some of the important questions that still remain and need to be studied by leveraging operations research tools and techniques hospitals have prided themselves on the efficiency that comes with just-in-time supply management and minimizing empty beds thus saving on hospital costs however as a result they are often not equipped for an epidemic surge such as this one despite our efforts to understand the impact of covid-19 on the healthcare system there is plenty of additional research that needs to be done in order to understand emerging complexities one area of importance is to understand the effects of surges in arrivals into the healthcare system some recent research has studied queueing models with self-exciting point processes that model random surges in demand see for example daw and pender 1 2 3  pender 21  niyirora and pender 20  massey and pender 18  these types of models would generalize our model in this paper but they are more complicated and would disguise the easy to understand insights from simpler models in this work we have not explicitly analyzed the impact of testing and lags in testing for the coronavirus it has been shown through empirical analyses that testing delays can have a huge impact on the reported numbers of positive cases and health outcomes see for example ryan-mosley 23  we believe that more research in understanding how testing can affect the spread of the disease is important it is clear from our cdf plots in figure 9 that testing is important for predicting deaths that are to follow finally we are observing in some cities that it is important to use demographic information for understanding the impact of covid-19 on particular communities or regions of the country in the city of chicago it has been observed that even though african americans make up roughly 30 of chicagos population african americans make up 52 of cases of covid-19 and 68 of deaths see for example reyes et al 22  also in nyc it has been reported that covid-19 is impacting low-income communities much harder than those that are well off wilson 24  recent work by kahara and pender 13 combines queueing theory with demographic information to get a deeper understanding of blood donation dynamics and it is clear that similar demographic analyses are also needed to understand the full impact of covid-19 on marginalized populations proof first we observe that from theorem 22 that t  solves the following fixed point equation thus if we define x to be a unit exponential random variable then we have   e   e  2 2 2     2                e   e  2 2 2      662 now it remains to prove the following equalities e   x      e   e  2 2 2      666 for the first equality we define g to be a gaussian random variable and we will exploit  sars-cov-2 and covid-19 a genetic epidemiological and evolutionary perspective manuela sironi seyed hasnain e tung phan fabio luciani marie-anne shaw m sallum anice marzieh mirhashemi ezzaty serge morand fernando gonzlez-candelas   pathogen x the hypothetical unknown potentially devastating microorganism capable of causing a major pandemic friedrich 2018 now has a name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 despite warnings and preparedness efforts by who and other health agencies the rapid spread of covid-19 which in less than 4 months has moved from affecting a few persons in wuhan hubei province china to more than 5 million people in almost every country in the world coronavirus research center httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml visited on may 21th 2020 has caught by surprise most governments and public health systems the result cannot be evaluated yet but the over 300000 officially recognized deaths and the economic social and political distresses caused by this epidemic will certainly impact our world in the coming months probably years in light of the wave of disinformation and mistrust by wide sectors in the public towards experts and scientists views on how to stop this pandemic we feel the need to bring a scientific perspective on the source causes uses and possible ways to halt the spread of this new coronavirus from a basic science perspective that marking the core nature of this journal blending genetics virology epidemiology and evolutionary biology population genetics and population biology what did they bring to the epidemiology of transmissible diseases an e-debate 2001 the novel human coronavirus sars-cov-2 responsible for the current covid-19 pandemic was first identified in december 2019 in the hubei province of china zhu et al 2020 after sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus to emerge and spread in human populations phylogenetic analyses showed that as sars-cov sars-cov-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus genus betacoronavirus zhou et al 2020b recently the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv indicated that sars-cov-2 is to be classified within the species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus coronaviridae study group of the ictv 2020 mers-cov subgenus merbecovirus is more distantly related to sars-cov-2 than sars-cov in the aftermath of the sars and mers epidemics intense efforts were devoted to identify the animal reservoirs of these viruses and to reconstruct the chain of events that led to the human spillovers it is now known that both viruses originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts normile and enserink 2003 killerby et al 2020 in particular the progenitor of sars-cov emerged through recombination among bat viruses and subsequently infected palm civets and other small carnivores eventually spilling over to humans cui et al 2019 mers-cov was most likely transmitted from bats to dromedary camels decades earlier than the first human cases were registered mller et al 2014 mers-cov displays limited human-to-human spread and most cases resulted from independent zoonotic transmission from camels cui et al 2019 it is thus unsurprising that the closest known relatives of sars-cov-2 are two bat coronaviruses batcov rmyn02 and batcov ratg13 identified in horseshoe bats rhinolophus malyanus and r affinis respectively zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b both batcovs display an average nucleotide identity of 95 with sars-cov-2 although with variations through the genome and they were detected in bats sampled in yunnan province china in 2019 and 2013 before the first detection of sars-cov-2 in humans zhou et al 2020b both the place and timing of batcov rmyn02 and ratg13 detection as well as their levels of identity with sars-cov-2 indicate that these viruses are not direct progenitors of the sars-cov-2 pandemic strain but clearly support the view that the latter had an ultimate bat origin zhou et al 2020b fig 1a in analogy to sars-cov and mers-cov several lines of evidence suggest that an intermediate host was responsible for the cross-species transmission of sars-cov-2 to humans first most although not all early covid-19 detected cases were associated with the huanan seafood and wildlife market in wuhan city where several mammalian species were traded huang et al 2020 this is reminiscent of the circumstances associated with the initial phases of sars-cov spread as palm civets were sold in wet markets and their meat consumed cui et al 2019 second in vitro experiments have shown that in addition to bats sars-cov-2 can infect cells from small carnivores and pigs zhou et al 2020b experimental in vivo infection and transmission in ferrets and cats was also reported kim et al 2020 shi et al 2020a third viruses very closely related 855 to 924 sequence similarity to sars-cov-2 were very recently detected in malayan or sunda pangolins manis javanica illegally imported in southern china lam et al 2020 the analysis of these viral genomes indicated that pangolins host at least two sub-lineages of sarbecoviruses which are referred as the guangdong and guangxi lineages after the locations where the animals were sampled lam et al 2020 fig 1a and b viruses in the guangdong lineage share high similarity with sars-cov-2 in the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein this same region is instead the most divergent between batcov ratg13 and sars-cov-2 lam et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b this observation is very relevant as the binding affinity between the spike protein and the cognate cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 in the case of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is a major determinant of coronavirus host range haijema et al 2003kuo et al 2000 mccray jr et al 2007 moore et al 2004 schickli et al 2004 indeed coronaviruses use a surface spike glycoprotein to attach to host receptors and gain entry into cells walls et al 2020 it is a homo-trimeric protein formed by two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit contains an n-terminal domain connected by a linker of variable length to the receptor-binding domain rbd in various coronaviruses the n-terminal domain ntd and rbd contribute to define host range lu et al 2015 the s2 domain participates in membrane fusion duquerroy et al 2005 comparison of the complete spike protein as well as of the ntd indicated higher similarity of sars-cov-2 with ratg13 than with pangolin coronaviruses fig 1a domain based sequence analysis indicates that sequence variations are majorly confined to the s1-domain 16 variable sites than to the s2-domain fig 1c and mutations were observed in both ntd and rbd interestingly an insertion yltpgd is present only in the ntd of sars-cov-2 ratg13 and guangxi pangolin coronaviruses but absent in related bat coronaviruses in guangdong pangolin viruses the region is not fully covered by sequencing fig 1d this motif forms a conformational cluster at the exposed ntd regions of the spike trimer and may contribute to determine host range however as mentioned above within the rbd sars-cov-2 shows higher identity with pangolin viruses belonging to the guangdong lineage than to ratg13 fig 1b and d structural analysis of the binding interface between sars-cov-2 rbd and human ace2 shows a strong network of polar contacts pdb id 6m0j lan et al 2020 sars-cov-2 rbd mediates these polar interactions through lys417 gly446 tyr449 asn487 gln493 gln498 thr500 asn501 gly502 and tyr505 with ace2 fig 1e these residues which participate in polar interactions with the host protein are almost completely conserved with pangolin coronaviruses of the guangdong lineage fig 1d one possible explanation for this observation is that the rbds of sars-cov-2 and guangdong pangolin viruses have been progressively optimized through natural selection convergent evolution to bind ace2 molecules from humans and pangolins and possibly other non-bat mammalian species lam et al 2020 an alternative possibility is that recombination events among coronaviruses hosted by bats pangolins and possibly other mammals originated the progenitor of sars-cov-2 lam et al 2020 cagliani et al 2020 it is presently impossible to disentangle these two alternative scenarios and only the sequencing of additional related sarbecoviruses might eventually clarify the evolutionary history of sars-cov-2 rbd it is also worth mentioning here that as previously noted andersen et al 2020 the similarity of the sars-cov-2 rbd with that of viruses only recently sequenced from pangolins can be regarded as a major evidence against the circulating theory that sars-cov-2 is the result of deliberate human manipulation in any case these data do not necessarily imply that pangolins had a role in the emergence of sars-cov-2 and in its spread to humans as these animals might have in turn contracted infection from a bat or other reservoir moreover the sars-cov-2 spike protein displays a unique feature that is not shared with either batcov ratg13 or the pangolin viruses namely the presence of a furin cleavage site insertion prra at the s1-s2 junction walls et al 2020 fig 1d and f this feature also absent in sars-cov was suggested to increase viral infectivity andor pathogenicity walls et al 2020 andersen et al 2020 it is presently unknown how and when sars-cov-2 acquired the furin cleavage site but it is equally unexplored whether it affects any viral phenotype or if it contributed to adaptation to humans or other hosts importantly though the presence of a similar insertion in a virus isolated from wild bats is another strong indication in favor of a natural animal origin of sars-cov-2 zhou et al 2020a although for the reasons mentioned above an as-yet unidentified intermediate host is likely to have played a role in the zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2 in the wuhan market or elsewhere the possibility that sars-cov-2 was directly transmitted from bats to humans cannot be discarded indeed serological surveys on people living in proximity to bat colonies in yunnan province indicated that direct bat-to-human transmission of sars-cov related coronaviruses might occur wang et al 2018 in general wild animal trade might reduce the ecological barriers separating humans from coronavirus hosts including these bats or other mammals however the observation that some early covid-19 cases had no apparent epidemiological link to the huanan seafood and wildlife market huang et al 2020 opens the possibility that the virus originated elsewhere and that the crowded market only contributed to the spreading of the epidemic clearly wide sampling of coronavirus diversity in different mammals in china and neighboring countries will be necessary to track down the progenitors of sars-cov-2 the scenarios described above implicitly imply that whatever the source of the zoonotic transmission sars-cov-2 emerged and adapted in another host eventually spilling over to humans andersen et al 2020 it cannot however be excluded that before being recognized in december 2019 sars-cov-2 had been circulating for a while in humans maybe causing mild symptoms the acquisition of some key viral mutations during unrecognized human transmission might have then fostered the current pandemic strain characterized by sustained human-to-human transmissibility and virulence in this case the identification of such mutations and the assessment of the role of the above-mentioned furin cleavage site insertion would be of paramount importance nonetheless it should be kept in mind that extreme caution should be exerted when ascribing phenotypic effect to mutations that arise during viral spreads grubaugh et al 2020 here again mers-cov and sars-cov have lessons to teach whereas in the case of sars-cov changes in the spike protein rbd contributed to the adaptation of the virus to human cells wu et al 2012 qu et al 2005 mers-cov adaptation to our species occurred with limited changes in the rbd cotten et al 2014 forni et al 2015 however during an outbreak of mers-cov in south korea viral strains carrying point mutations in the spike rbd emerged and spread kim et al 2016 notably whereas these rbd mutations were found to decrease rather than increase binding to the cellular receptor they facilitated viral escape from neutralizing antibodies kim et al 2016 kim et al 2019 rockx et al 2010 kleine-weber et al 2019 this suggests that changes in the spike protein do not necessarily arise as an adaptation to optimize receptor-binding affinity even more emblematic is the case of sars-cov orf8 encoding an accessory viral protein in the early stages of the epidemic sars-cov strains acquired a 29-nucleotide deletion in orf8 chinese sars molecular epidemiology consortium 2004 together with the observation that the encoded protein is fast evolving in sars-cov strains this finding was taken to imply that deletions in orf8 were driven by natural selection and favored human infection lau et al 2015 the evidence for adaptation was subsequently not confirmed and recent data indicate that the 29-nucleotide deletion most likely represents a founder effect causing fitness loss in bat and human cells forni et al 2017 muth et al 2018 this observation clearly indicates that a mutation sweeping at high frequency in the viral population does not necessarily represent a selectively advantageous change clearly huge gaps remain in our understanding of sars-cov emergence and adaptation to our species most likely acquisition of inserts in the spike protein and remodeling of the rbd did not occur in a single animal-to-human jump event the majority of relevant changes might have been present in a reservoirintermediate species and only minor changes may then have been required to gain full transmissibility in humans alternatively the progressive optimization from multiple zoonotic events may have followed short events of human-to-human transmission over an extended period of time this has been earlier observed during mers transmission entailing repeated jumps of mers-cov from camels cui et al 2019 accumulation of mutations in ntd and rbd during global and local transmissions further strengthens the likelihood that the progenitor virus may have been transmitted among humans over time adapting to become more efficiently transmitted in people in a nutshell the missing knowledge about the reservoirintermediate host of sars-cov-2 as well as about the extent of its distribution in wild and domestic animals raises concerns about zoonotic transmissions if pre-adaptation routinely occurs as these viruses incubate in animal reservoirs there is a high probability for new pandemics to recur thorough surveillance of animal populations and early diagnosis in people will be necessary to prevent future covid-19 like pandemics climate variability is known to affect the outbreaks of many infectious diseases morand et al 2013 vector-borne diseases such as

describes the changes that sars-cov-2 viruses underwent since they became widely recognized as pathogenic in december 2019 through mid-april 2020 it depicts relationships among hundreds of viral sequences sub-sampled from the thousands of sequences available at the time of writing as rendered for real-time evaluation by the nextstrain consortium httpsnextstrainorgncov using data from gisaidorg one feature establishes without question the usefulness of this tree contemporaneously sampled viruses each depicted by its own color are perfectly chronologically organized in this rendering each sample circle was colored to indicate when it was sampled the rainbow pattern means that each virus has undergone a nearly equal amount of change note too that the viruses do not bunch up at the tips of the tree but are situated throughout we need not guess when and where ancestors lived because we can see them lastly no branches protrude to any great extent eliminating the fear of being misled by tree artifacts introduced by recombination although recombination contributed to the origins of this viral group ji et al 2020 boni et al 2020 and future recombinations cannot be discounted this does not appear to have been a major force over this five month period by so faithfully reproducing these samples known chronology this tree should earn our trust the total number of points at any column encompassing different time intervals informs about the sampling success at those times there are only a few sequences from the early weeks before january 15 followed by a clear increase until the beginning of february around february 5 then chinese researchers see below almost completely ceased to deposit sequences in gisaid and only a few sequences were being obtained from other countries this period corresponds to the silent spread of covid-19 throughout most countries asymptomatic infections were not detected hence no virus samples were available for sequencing and we lack detailed information on how the virus was spreading this period also corresponds to a bout of diversification that can be observed in the upper part of the tree with many new sublineages stemming from pre-existing lineages the times of these diversification events are inferred from the application of a constant rate of evolution of 8  104 substitutions per site per year the constancy of this evolutionary rate is difficult to be evaluated at this stage in the evolutionary history of the virus given the very short time elapsed since its appearance by the end of february the situation changed drastically as many more sequences became available for analysis when the pandemic exploded and cases accumulated rapidly in many countries see below the same tree fig 4
 now colored to show each samples geographical origins as shown on the accompanying map note that isolates from china dominate the oldest branches of the tree the first isolates sequenced came from wuhan china where the epidemic was first recognized therefore it is logical that they should appear first what other epidemiological inferences can we draw from tracing the path of this virus evolution 
human infections may have commenced months before the recognized outbreak in wuhan most human pathogens originate as pathogens of other animals they occupy a spectrum emerging from those exclusively transmitted among animals to those primarily transmitted among other animals to those that have lost their dependence on non-human reservoirs and ultimately those no longer capable of being transmitted excepting from person to person wolfe et al 2007 the human drama now unfolding began in earnest in the latter months of 2019 the tree above records the viruss subsequent proliferation and spread but what can be said about preceding events serological evidence suggests that people living the vicinity of bats harboring sars-like viruses are frequently exposed to such infections wang et al 2018 more surveillance will be needed to truly understand how often and under what circumstances such exposures take place nor can we yet appreciate what proportion of such exposures eventually lead to a virus becoming established as a human pathogen acknowledging this broader context what do the phylogenetic data say about the proximate origins of sars-cov-2 more surveillance among the viruses of suspected animal reservoirs bats most especially will be needed to confidently estimate when and where this virus first took a firm foothold in people early reports lam et al 2020 zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b identified batcov ratg13 and rmyn02 as the closest isolates to sars-cov-2 and it has been proposed that these lineages diverged between 40 and 70 years ago boni et al 2020 assuming constancy in the evolutionary rate which is also problematic as discussed above a few months may have elapsed between human acquisition of the virus and its recognition by the medical and public health communities in december 2019 molecular clock analyses suggest a time for the most recent common ancestor of all current sars-cov-2 lineages in octoberdecember 2019 van dorp et al 2020 if further sampling identifies more genetically proximate enzootic viruses then the estimated times for separation and diversification may likewise change lacking such additional sampling it seems fair to suspect from the available evidence that an exclusively human chain of transmission may have gone undetected for some months before galvanizing public attention 
some lineages took root outside of china note that clusters of viruses define foci of transmission some of these represent expansions outside of china for example a group almost exclusively composed of red dots near the bottom of the figure indicate a viral lineage that took root in the united states these mostly came from the state of washington although wyoming virginia and other states are included in the group within this cluster a few dots different to red indicate likely exports from the usa to other countries such as australia taiwan iceland and india nevertheless inferences about epidemiological processes drawn exclusively from genome information must be taken very cautiously villabona-arenas et al 2020 
long-distance travel spread closely related viral isolates although most of the isolates in the group discussed above were sampled from patients in the american pacific northwest a few blue dots in that group denote australian isolates demonstrating air travel as a powerful disseminating force specific introductions ie from china to germany from germany to italy from italy to iceland gudbjartsson et al 2020 that accord with known travel histories are recapitulated in phylogenetic networks reconstructed from viral rna sequences for example the phylogeny accords with other evidence that the virus was introduced to europe by early january olsen et al 2020 spiteri et al 2020 stoecklin et al 2020 
community transmission occurred weeks before local outbreaks were recognized early efforts in the united states to manage the virus focused on limiting travel from suspected endemic regions and early testing was limited to travelers returned from such places meanwhile the virus had already established footholds as discovered when nasal swabs collected for monitoring community transmission of influenza were discovered to harbor the rna of sars-cov-2 nearly identical viruses were found in residents of seattle who had no direct contact with one another this sounded the alarm that the virus was actively circulating in the community a fact that would soon be tragically borne out by a critical surge in illness and death bedford et al 2020 fauver et al 2020 
multiple independent introductions of the virus a parallel process was soon to play out in new york based on the viral phylogeny it appears the virus was established in new york at least seven times primarily from europe while travel restrictions focused on perceived threats from china south korea italy and iran gonzalez-reiche et al 2020 the occurrence of red dots in nearly every clade of the tree even clades composed mostly of european isolates underscores this point this is equally true for europe because nearly every clade of the tree includes green dots denoting samples of european origin this tree includes relatively few isolates from australia blue dots but the same phenomenon is evident australia received virtually every basic type of sars-cov-2 
the global south has not been sampled nearly enough a complete description of the virus evolution would necessitate vast and representative sampling with diagnosed cases as of mid-april numbering in the millions and in the face of untold numbers of undiagnosed cases how much confidence should we place in trees reconstructed from only hundreds or thousands of isolates biologists have means to assess internal consistency enabling many facets of the recorded history to be viewed by now as impervious to egregious sampling error nonetheless it is clear that the available evidence neglects to inform us much about the epidemic this is for lack of attention not for lack of virus even in the most affluent of societies the virus is exploiting preexisting social inequities yancy 2020 as the virus takes root in africa south america and other under-resourced regions evolutionary epidemiologists should assume responsibility for understanding and communicating all that can be learned about how where when and why the pandemic is unfolding there the toll of this disease will be multiplied where patients cannot access therapies and where clinicians cannot protect themselves there the behavior of the virus may or may not parallel patterns so far described we will not know if we do not look sars-cov-2 was first detected in human bronchoalveolar lavage bal specimens by unbiased illumina and nanopore sequencing technologies and a real-time rt-pcr assay using pan-betacoronavirus degenerate primers targeting a highly conserved rdrp region zhu et al 2020 the sars-cov-2 isolation was performed in different cell lines including human airway epithelial cells vero e6 and huh-7 cytopathic effects were observed in human airway epithelial cells 4 days after inoculation but not in vero e6 and huh-7 zhu et al 2020 for safety cdc recommends that clinical virology laboratories should not attempt viral isolation from clinical specimens collected from covid-19 patients under investigation puis because sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered virus and its genome is very divergent from those of hcov-229e -nl63 -oc43 and -hku1 several commercially available multiplex naat tests biofire filmarray respiratory panel eplex respiratory pathogen panel nxtag respiratory pathogen panel respifindersmart22kit and others for the detection of respiratory organisms in clinical virology laboratories were predicted no cross-reactivity with sars-cov-2 phan 2020 at that time several different protocols for laboratory-developed tests ldts were developed and they were available on the who website httpswwwwhointwho-documents-detailmolecular-assays-to-diagnose-covid-19-summary-table-of-available-protocols while the cdc assay was designed for specific detection of three different regions of the n gene the assay developed by corman et al 2020 aimed to amplify three different regions of the rdrp n and e genes since sars-cov-2 continues to spread around the world and the number of potential cases increases rapidly faster and more-accessible testing is extremely needed thus many companies are racing against the clock to develop commercial test kits to detect sars-cov-2 more quickly and accurately more than fifty rt-pcr-based diagnostic tests are currently available in the us that have been granted the fdas emergency use authorization httpswwwfdagovmedical-devicesemergency-situations-medical-devicesemergency-use-authorizationscovid19ivd these tests can qualitatively identify sars-cov-2s rna in the lower respiratory tract bronchoalveolar lavage sputum and tracheal aspirate and upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs recently the fda approved emergency use for a portable fast swab test for sars-cov-2 which can provide results in less than 15 min the idnow covid-19 abbott illinois can be used at a point-of-care in doctors offices urgent care and hospitals lateral flow immunoassays are another rapid point-of-care diagnostic test which has been widely used the sofia 2 sars antigen fia is the first covid-19 antigen test to be granted the fdas emergency use authorization this lateral flow immunofluorescent sandwich assay is used with the sofia 2 instrument intended for the qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid protein antigen from sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs another diagnostic approach would be to devise blood tests for antibodies against sars-cov-2 many companies around the world have raced to develop antibody tests the qsars-cov-2 iggigm rapid test cellex inc was the first antibody test being approved by the fda this test is intended to qualitatively detect igg and igm antibodies against the sars-cov-2 in human serum plasma and whole blood together with increased availability of commercial rt-pcr-based diagnostic tests important questions about immunity to the novel coronavirus will be answered soon the use of serological tests is complementary to those based on direct detection of viral rna because they indicate that the individual has developed specific immunological response to the virus which usually takes a few days after infection hence a negative result does not necessarily mean that a person is not infected - this might have occurred too recently to have developed the immune response and a positive results does not necessarily mean that the person has an active infection consequently these tests are essential to obtain a more precise estimate of the total number of infections in a population and in which proportion they are expected to be immune to a future infection by the virus its main use is in epidemiological surveillance rather than in clinical diagnostics early application of community surveys for seroprevalence have suggested far more widespread community exposure than has been supposed based merely on the reporting of diagnosed cases suggesting for example that by mid-april as many as one in five residents of new york city may have been exposed with diminishing exposure rates less proximate to the outbreaks epicenter recently clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr based nucleic acid detection technology has emerged as a powerful tool with the advantages of rapidity simplicity and a low cost wang et al 2020 a recent study reported that the crispr-based assay was used to detect sars-cov-2 in the patients pharyngeal swab in china ai et al 2020 the turn-around time tat of crispr was 2 h much faster than rtpcr 3 h and mngs 24 h ai et al 2020 the fda authorized a covid-19 test that uses the gene-editing technology crispr sherlock crispr sars-cov-2 kit has been developed by sherlock biosciences inc although host genetics is likely to be important for the outcome of infection because of the nature of the disease we only have preliminary information on the heritability of susceptibility to coronavirus infections ie estimates of the proportion of phenotypic variability due to genetic factors heritability a time and place-specific measurement for a population provides an indication of likely success in the hunt for susceptibility loci and low values for heritability of 20 would indicate that very large sample sizes might be needed to detect genetic effects williams et al 2020 have reported high heritability in the range 4050 of covid-19 symptoms in a classical twin study williams et al 2020 in addition the apparent differences in susceptibility seen between ethnic groups could be due in part to human genetic variability niedzwiedz et al 2020 report a higher risk of confirmed sars-cov-2 infection not accounted for by variables such as socioeconomic differences in some minority ethnic groups as included in the uk biobank niedzwiedz et al 2020 the genetic contribution to the outcome of infection will be complex since some of the underlying health conditions associated with death from coronavirus infection are known to have a significant genetic contribution the difficulties of family-based studies whilst controlling for exposure leaves us with case control association methodology ultimately the high numbers of affected people will facilitate genome wide association studies gwas or even studies of whole genome or exome sequence particularly where genotypic information is already available as is the case for uk biobank participants in the short term we are likely to see a number of candidate gene studies for susceptibility to coronavirus infection per se loci coding for viral receptors provide obvious candidate genes nevertheless the major question is why some individuals develop life-threatening immune-mediated pathologies where knowledge of genetic variation may contribute to our understanding of key mediators of the immune response most relevant albeit limited information on the allelic diversity contributing to susceptibilityresistance to date has used sampling from the sars cov 2003 epidemic and a little information has been gleaned from the mers-cov 2012 epidemic sample sizes are small and results sometimes conflicting hence no firm conclusions can be drawn there are several studies identifying genes of interest from mouse models kane and golovkina 2019 and some information from interspecies comparisons hou et al 2010 sironi et al 2015 to date candidate genes for published human studies have included pathogen receptor genes and loci controlling innate and adaptive immunity s1 spike proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 on cell membranes catalysing the cleavage of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii and countering the activity of ace mers-cov binds to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 cd26 an immunoregulatory serine exopeptidase particularly considering indications of relevance from cross-species comparisons sironi et al 2015 there has been a surprising lack of interest in these 2 candidate loci for susceptibility to infection per se a small low-powered case control study with information on anti-sars-cov antibody status did not show any associations between sars phenotypes and ace2 polymorphisms in a vietnamese population itoyama et al 2005 genes coding for functionally associated molecules such as transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 which cleaves and activates viral spike glycoproteins are also worthy of study iwata-yoshikawa et al 2019 lopera et al 2020 have just reported a phewas of 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokine and cardio-metabolic markers but not specific sars-cov-2 infection markers in relation to ace2 and tmprss2 variation lopera et al 2020 amongst immune response related loci mhc class i and class ii allelic associations are to be expected particularly through mhc class i restriction of cd8 t cells lin et al 2003 ng et al 2004 wang et al 2011 keicho et al 2009 mhc associations are relevant for susceptibility to disease per se disease pathogenesis and response to vaccination there are a few follow up studies eg of hla a0201 restricted sars-cov epitopes for cd8 t cells zhao et al 2011 but investigation of such highly polymorphic loci needs to be more comprehensive other loci with some information on allelic associations include those coding for icam3 dc-sign cd209 chan et al 2007 chan et al 2010 and dc-signr cd209l li et al 2008 and widely studied loci such as mbl zhang et al 2005 ip et al 2005 and cd14 in particular the inflammatory response associated with sars suggests a number of candidate loci eg ahsg zhu et al 2011 ifng chong et al 2006 cd14 yuan et al 2007 and ccl5 rantes ng et al 2007 nevertheless some relatively small studies have resulted in some conflicting findings being noted eg for mbl yuan et al 2005 and dc-signr li et al 2008 more recently loci of interest have been identified using mouse models after infection with sars-cov where pathology can be well studied these include trim55 and ticam2 kane and golovkina 2019 trim55 codes for an e3 ubiquitin ligase present in smooth muscle around blood vessels affecting lung pathology by controlling airways and immune cell infiltration deficiency was relevant to lung injury although susceptibility alleles were not reported gralinski et al 2015 ticam2 knockout mice were highly susceptible to disease with some evidence of allelic heterogeneity ticam2 is an adaptor for myd88-independent tlr4 signaling contributing to innate immunity gralinski et al 2017 these genes require complementary studies in human populations to date phenotypes employed for human genetics have been limited susceptibility to infection per se some measures of morbidity and mortality for both candidate gene studies and gwas finding totally resistant individuals for an unaffected control group is hard since for covid19 despite the occurrence of asymptomatic individuals many show very mild symptoms of disease there is scope for development of phenotypes particularly relating to the most pertinent issues of pathogenesis and control of immune responsiveness perhaps immediate research could focus on critical and potentially useful phenotypes eg severity of disease sufficient to require a ventilator or antibody responses identification of a susceptibility gene with no a priori hypothesis is difficult for an active acute viral infection but candidate genes potentially controlling these phenotypes would include those from both innate and adaptive immunity published gwas which might be of interest for suggesting susceptibility loci tend to have used phenotypes from chronic rather than acute conditions eg copd whether conducting genotypephenotype studies or simply measuring immune responses age and sex are clearly major factors in the outcome of infection with sars-cov-2 and will require careful consideration in all analyses immunity and pathology will be influenced by many factors including genetics age sex viral dose and underlying health problems the interactions between these factors will also be important gubbels bupp et al 2018 covid19 particularly affects the elderly with age a key consideration in any study design as are sex differences which are known to be important for respiratory infections in general kadel and kovats 2018 although both innate and adaptive immunity are required to mount an effective immune response and despite the tools for investigation of the relevant loci being available the lack of candidate gene studies for coronavirus infection even prior to covid19 including information on mhc associations has been noted not only will variability in amino acid sequence be important such as that influencing mhc restriction but also the levels of immune mediators possibly driven by promoter variation timing of responses is another area for exploration rockx et al 2009 discuss molecular mechanisms of age related susceptibility in coronavirus infected mice and development of pathology via the host response aged mice showed a greater number of differentially expressed genes when infected than young mice including elevated interferon and cytokine genes indicating a different host response kinetics in old versus young mice a number of immune response moleculesgenes are of interest including toll-like receptors tlrs proinflammatory cytokines and the appropriate signalling pathways both adaptive and innate immunity are recognized to decline with age goronzy and weyand 2013 nikolich-ugich 2018 and although in the past adaptive immunity has been the focus of attention there is now cumulative evidence for a decline in innate immunity with age changes occur in neutrophil macrophage dendritic cell and nk populations and there are changes in tlr expression with an overall distinct but not uniformly lower expression in later life particularly in macrophages and consequent major changes in tlr mediated responses solana et al 2012 the innate immune system of the frail elderly is often in a state of heightened inflammation but this higher basal production of proinflammatory cytokines does not necessarily translate to a generally elevated andor effective response fulop et al 2018 in particular the incidence of and mortality from lung infections increase sharply with age with such infections often leading to worse outcomes prolonged hospital stays and life-threatening complications such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome the review by boe et al 2017 covers research on bacterial pneumonias and pulmonary viral infections and discusses age-related changes in innate immunity that contribute to the higher rate of these infections in older populations regulation of adaptive immune function appears to be diminished in old versus young adults and decreased tlr responses are associated with the inability to mount protective antibody responses to flu vaccine kollmann et al 2012 in addition the pre-existing b cell repertoire restricts the quantitative response in the elderly goronzy and weyand 2013 b cell maintenance and function in aging has been well reviewed and is of particular relevance when considering responsiveness to vaccines evoking primary versus memory humoral responses kogut et al 2012 the age-related rise in proinflammatory cytokines is also associated with reduced response to vaccination oh et al 2019 it is known that vaccination with tlr5 targeting adjuvants in elderly patients enhances flu vaccine responsiveness without increasing inflammation goronzy and weyand 2013 we know multiple host factors including age and sex are important for disease outcome of coronavirus infection and a systems approach has been suggested for the study of disease pathogenesis schfer et al 2014 however to date we do not know the relative importance of factors such as host and pathogen genetic variability whilst we can draw some comparisons with other similar acute respiratory infections such as influenza sars-cov-2 presents unique and urgent challenges there is an unprecedented opportunity to obtain large sample sizes and the need to understand the role of human genetics in the outcome of infection with sars-cov-2 is well recognized kaiser 2020 information on infection with sars-cov-2 is being added to health data eg inclusion in the uk biobank with its 500000 volunteers wwwukbiobankacuk
 the scale of the current pandemic is stimulating free access to human genetic studies as they progress and data sharing for combined analyses with multiple diverse partners from academia and industry eg the covid19 host genetics initiative wwwcovid19hgorg
 hopefully useful information will be produced at a rate not previously seen for a transmissible disease there is limited knowledge on the mechanisms driving immune response against covid-19 a recent work thevarajan et al 2020 showed that a strong adaptive response across b and t cells was mounted during symptomatic phase in a 47-year-old woman from wuhan hubei province in china that successfully cleared the virus within two weeks increased antibody-secreting cells ascs follicular helper t cells tfh cells activated cd4 t cells and cd8 t cells and immunoglobulin m igm and igg antibodies that bound the covid-19-causing coronavirus sars-cov-2 were detected in blood before symptomatic recovery and with a peak around day 79 since onset of symptoms these immunological changes persisted after full resolution of symptoms at day 20 these findings based on a single subject support the hypothesis that a rapid multi-factorial immune response against covid-19 can be mounted within a week and with evidence of recruitment of t and b cells as well as macrophages before resolution of symptoms and that this rapid response may correlate with positive clinical outcome severe cases on the other hand seem to have disrupted immune responses several early case reports have demonstrated the presence of cytokines release storms which demonstrate the presence of severe inflammatory responses in these patients characterised by increased interleukin il-2 il-7 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor interferon- inducible protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- and tumor necrosis factor-6 mehta et al 2020 immunogenomics analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf and also from blood samples across two different studies from china wen et al 2020 liao et al 2020 also revealed clear immunological features characterizing severe cases the overall message based on these early studies point towards the polarization of a macrophage response in the lungs associated with severe disease conversely patients that recovered had increased cytotoxic t cell response compared to severe cases specifically analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf from 3 severe and 3 mild covid-19 patients using single-cell rna sequence scrna-seq combined with t cell receptor sequences revealed a distinct population of monocyte-derived fcn1 macrophages in balf samples from patients with severe disease while patients with mild disease presented increased levels of fabp4 alveolar macrophages liao et al 2020 these cells were found highly inflammatory and strongly associated with cytokine storms notably immunogenomics analysis on blood samples from 5 patients that had early recovery versus 5 patients that recovered late wen et al 2020 confirmed the findings in balf namely that mild disease was associated to clonally expanded cytotoxic cd8 t cells which suggest that a specific t cell response may be at play in controlling covid-19 infection in the lungs several vaccine trials are underway carrying great promise for sustainable solutions to future epidemics httpswwwwhointblueprintpriority-diseaseskey-actionlist-of-candidate-vaccines-developed-against-sarspdf with so far 33 vaccines listed accessed on april 25th 2020 from a vaccine point of view it remains to be seen whether a strong humoral response mediated by neutralizing antibodies can be successfully mounted without side effects and whether t cell responses could be also generated by a vaccine based on current knowledge it appears that severe cases are associated with a sustained virus-specific immune response with evidence of a hyper-inflammatory response causing severe lung damage notably recent work revealed that sars-covid-19 specific cd4 and cd8 t cell responses are identified in 70 and 100 of convalescent patients respectively thus supporting the notion that viral specific adaptive response can be mounted and maintained griffoni et al 2020 the fact that all arms of the immune responses are activated in patients that clear the virus while in severe disease cytokine storms occur along with lymphopenia suggests that a broad t and b cell-based vaccine should be considered shi et al 2020b data on sars-cov-2 so far revealed that several epitopes can be targeted by neutralizing antibodies response previous work on a sars-covmacaque models investigating host response in the productively infected lungs revealed unexpected interactions between the presence of antispike igg s-igg prior to viral clearance and the alveolar macrophages liu et al 2019 the latter population was found to undergo functional polarization in acutely infected macaques demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics however the presence of s-igg prior to viral clearance abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted mcp1 and il-8 production and proinflammatory monocytemacrophage recruitment and accumulation the authors commented that patients who died of sars displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory absence of wound-healing macrophages and faster neutralizing antibody responses whereas blockade of fcr reduced such effects therefore vaccine development should consider possible host responses that exacerbate disease and alternative therapies should be also considered in combination with vaccines to avoid virus-mediated lung injury the current covid-19 pandemic has impacted on many aspects of social economic personal and behavioral matters of our daily life we still do not know when we will completely recover from these effects and when life will return to be normal it may never be the same as it used to be or with luck an effective vaccine becomes widely available and the return takes only a few months but the pandemic has also exposed scientists and the processes of scientific advancement by focusing on what the experts had to say about the new virus how to control its spread how to treat those infected or what to expect if different social measures should be taken it has shown that science advances through uncertainties and that different opinions and interpretations are frequent especially when moving through unexplored fields and a new pathogen is almost inevitably one such field and when it has such a dramatic impact on the health of so many people the need for urgent answers puts an extraordinary additional pressure on the daily work of scientists in little more than four months we have learned a lot about sars-cov-2 and covid-19 we know that it is a new coronavirus closely related to those usually found in bats and quite oddly in an endangered species malayan pangolins but we do not know how the jump from a yet unknown intermediate species to humans occurred and how the virus was capable of being so easily and efficiently transmitted among individuals of our species from what we have learned from other zoonotic spillovers it seems clear that several factors have concurred in this jump including ecological cultural and possible behavioral we know that recombination is frequent in coronaviruses including sarbecoviruses but we do not know whether this process played a significant role in the emergence of sars-cov-2 as a new pathogen all the evidence gathered so far undermines the possibility that the virus was created in or escaped from a laboratory proximate to the city where the initial infections were detected sars-cov-2 is highly transmissible even by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected persons which makes its spread very difficult to control this can be observed in its fast expansion in just a few weeks to almost every country in the world and the poor efficiency of border closures as implemented by most governments to stop it when these have been put in action the virus was already circulating within borders genomic epidemiology of the virus is allowing a live monitoring of the viral spread and has revealed differentiation in several lineages some clearly resulting from ongoing local circulation which also show the frequent exchange across borders even from distant countries and continents globalization shows its dark side in this fast spreading pandemic there are substantial differences in the natural history of infection these were observed from the very start of the epidemic with a much more severe presentation in aged persons and those with additional pathologies those differences have persisted but as the number of infected persons has grown continuously the cases of serious even fatal infections in younger persons have become more frequent nevertheless there are still many unknowns around the differences in susceptibility progression and outcome of the infection by sars-cov-2 that as in other infectious diseases probably depend on a complex interaction of host pathogen and environmental factors several large-scale analyses encompassing all three kinds of factors are underway and hopefully will shed light on this critical point currently there are many additional unknowns highly relevant for the possibility of recovering a more or less normal lifestyle there is no specific and highly efficient treatment yet there are several vaccine candidates in the making but we are still at least months away from their availability for the general population we do not even know whether those infected by sars-cov-2 will develop a strong immune response or a weak one and how long it will last nor whether the virus will have a seasonal behavior or will circulate all year round in the meantime the most important measures to prevent a generalized spread of the virus and a collapse of health systems the main reason behind the social and economic disruption caused by covd-19 are still social distancing contact tracing and testing the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  cultural convergence insights into the behavior of misinformation networks on twitter liz mcquillan erin mcaweeney alicia bargar alex ruch  how can the birth and evolution of ideas and communities in a network be studied over time we use a multimodal pipeline consisting of network mapping topic modeling bridging centrality and divergence to analyze twitter data surrounding the covid-19 pandemic we use network mapping to detect accounts creating content surrounding covid-19 then latent dirichlet allocation to extract topics and bridging centrality to identify topical and non-topical bridges before examining the distribution of each topic and bridge over time and applying jensen-shannon divergence of topic distributions to show communities that are converging in their topical narratives  the covid-19 pandemic fostered an information ecosystem rife with health mis-and disinformation much as covid-19 spreads through human interaction networks davis et al 2020  disinformation about the virus travels along human communication networks communities prone to conspiratorial thinking oliver and wood 2014 lewandowsky et al 2013  from qanon to the vaccine hesitant actively spread problematic content to fit their ideologies smith et al 2020  when social influence is exerted to distort information landscapes centola  macy 2007 barash cameron et al 2012 zubiaga et al 2016 lazer et al 2018  macy et al 2019  large groups of people can come to ignore or

based on a conspiracy theory chan et al 2020 to ingesting harmful substances misrepresented as miracle cures olaughlin 2020  continuous downplaying of the virus by influential people likely contributed to the climbing us mortality and morbidity rate early in the year bursztyn et al 2020  disinformation researchers have noted this unprecedented infodemic smith et al 2020 and confluence of narratives understanding how actors shape information through networks particularly during crises like covid-19 may enable health experts to provide updates and factchecking resources more effectively common approaches to this like tracking the volume of indicators like hashtags fail to assess deeper ideologies shared between communities or how those ideologies spread to culturally distant communities in contrast our multimodal analysis combines network science and natural language processing to analyze the evolution of semantic user-generated content about covid-19 over time and how this content spreads through twitter networks prone to mis-disinformation semantic and network data are complementary in models of behavioral prediction including rare and complex psycho-social behaviors ruch 2020  studies of coordinated information operations francois et al 2017 emphasize the importance of semantic messages effectiveness and network layers messengers effectiveness we mapped networks of conversations around covid-19 revealing political health and technological conspiratorial communities that consistently participate in covid-19 conversation and share ideologically motivated content to frame the pandemic to fit their overarching narratives to understand how disinformation is spread across these communities we invoke theory on cultural holes and bridging cultural bridges are patterns of meaning practice and discourse that drive a propensity for social closure and the formation of clusters of like-minded individuals who share few relationships with members of other clusters except through bridging users who are omnivorous in their social interests and span multiple social roles pachucki  breiger 2010 vilhena et al 2014  while cultural holesbridges extend our ability to comprehend how mis-disinformation flow in networks and affect group dynamics this work has mostly focused on prosocial behavior it has remained an open question if cultural bridges operate similarly with nefarious content as with beneficial information as the costs and punishments of sharing false and potentially harmful content differ tsvetkova and macy 2014 2015  this work seeks to answer that question by applying these theories to a network with known conspiratorial content we turn to longitudinal topic analysis to track narratives shared by these groups while some topical trends around the covid-19 infodemic are obvious others are nuanced detecting and tracking subtle topical shifts and influencing factors is important danescu-niculescu-mizil et al 2013  as new language trends can indicate a group is adopting ideas of anti-science groups eg climate deniers the vaccine hesitant differences between community interests breadth of focus popularity among topics and evolution of conspiracy theories can help us understand how public opinion forms around events these answers can quantify anecdotal evidence about converging conspiratorial groups online to capture these shifts we analyze evolving language trends across different communities over the first five months of the pandemic in bail 2016  advocacy organizations effectiveness in spreading information was analyzed in the context of how well their message bridged different social media audiences a message that successfully 1 account activity includes tweet text timestamps follows and engagement based relationships over accounts 2 language classification was done with pycld3 httpsgithubcombsolomon1124pycld3 combined themes that typically resonated with separate audiences received substantially more engagements we hypothesize topical convergence among communities discussing covid-19 will 1 correlate with new groups emergence and 2 be precursed by messages combining previously disparate topics that receive high engagement we use activity 1 from 57366 twitter accounts recorded january-may 2020 and acquired via the twitter api non-english tweets 2 were excluded from analysis we applied standard preprocessing removing punctuation and stop words 3  as well as lemmatization of text data in total 81348475 tweets are included we use latent dirichlet allocation lda combined with divergence analysis jensen-shannon wong  you 1995 to identify topical convergence as an indication of the breadth and depth of content spread over a network we expect that as communities enter the conversation topical distributions will reflect their presence earlier than using network mapping alone we first mapped a network using covid-19 related seeds from january-may 2020 we then applied lda to the tweet text of all accounts that met inclusion criteria discussed below tracked the distribution of topics both overall and for specific communities calculated bridging centrality measures to identify topics that connect otherwise disconnected groups we constructed five network maps that catalogue a collection of key social media accounts around a particular topic -in this case covid-19 our maps represent cyber-social landscapes etling et al 2012 of key communities sampled from representative seeds hindman  barash 2018 of the topic to be analyzed we collect all tweets containing one or more seed hashtags and remove inactive accounts based on an activity threshold described below we collect a network of semistable relationships twitter follows between accounts removing poorly connected nodes using k-core decomposition dorogovtsev et al 2006  we apply a technique called attentive clustering that applies hierarchical agglomerative clustering to assign nodes to communities based on shared following patterns we label each cluster using machine learning and human expert verification and organize clusters into expert identified and labeled groups our maps can be seen as monthly snapshots of mainstream global conversations around coronavirus on twitter these maps were seeded on the same set of hashtags coronavirusoutbreak covid19 coronavirus covid covid19 covid-19 to allow a comparison in network structure and activity over time for the first three months accounts that used seed hashtags three or more times were included for subsequent months covid-19 conversations became so ubiquitous that we benefited from collecting all accounts that used seed hashtags at least once mapping the cybersocial landscape around hashtags of interest rather than patterns of how content was shared reveals the semi-stable structural communities of accounts engaged in the conversation 4 this research defines a document as all tweets for a given account during a single week monday-sunday concatenated and uses a matrix of tf-idf scores in place of raw word frequencies 5 with  being a measure of document topic density as  increases so does the likelihood that a document will be associated with multiple topics and  being a measure of after extracting and cleaning the tweets text we create an lda model lda requires a corpus of documents a matrix of those documents and their respective words and various parameters and hyperparameters 4  lda by design does not explicitly model temporal relationships therefore our decision to define a document as weekly collections of tweets for a given user allows for comparison of potentially time-bounded topics we use gensim ehek  sojka 2010 to build and train a model with the number of topics k 50 and two hyperparameters   0253 and   0946 5  all tuned using optuna 6 to optimize both for coherence score and human interpretability lda then maps documents to topics such that each topic is identified by a multinomial distribution over words and each document is denoted by a multinomial distribution over topics while variants of lda include an explicit time component such as wang and mccallums 2006 topics over time model or blei and laffertys 2006 dynamic topic model these extensions are often inflexible when the corpus of interest has large changes in beta distributions over time and further impose constraints on the time periods which would have been unsuitable for this analysis applying lda with k  50 yielded topics see appendix a that can be distinguished by subject matter expert analysis a substantial portion of topics related to covid-19 politics at national and international levels international relations and conspiracy theories we also identified a small subset of social media marketing andor peripheral topics which covered animal rights inspirational quotes topic 10 and follow trains topics 23 and 32 topic word density as  increases so does the likelihood that topics use more words from the corpus lda is a generative latent variable model which assumes all observed documents are generated by a set of unobserved topics hyperparameters have a noticeable impact on the assignment of documents to topics 6 httpsoptunareadthedocsioenstableindexhtml in addition to topics derived from lda we extracted hashtags screen names and urls from tweets as possible cultural content that bridges communities for each week we construct an undirected multimodal graph where each node represents a cluster topic or content clusters have edges to topics with a weight representing average topic representativeness among cluster members and edges to cultural content with a weight according to the number of unique cluster members using said content divided by maximum usage of an artifact of that type after constructing the graph we calculate nodes bridging centrality which adjusts betweenness centrality with respect to neighbors degrees to better identify nodes spanning otherwise disconnected clusters hwang et al 2006  we select the top 20 bridges by node type for further investigation all five maps are visibly multipolar with densely clustered poles and sparsely populated centers 7  this indicates that strongly intraconnected communities are involved in the conversation despite its global scope and each geographic and ideological cluster has its own insular sources of information -there is a dearth of shared global sources of information 7 we visualize the map network using a force-directed layout algorithm similar to fruchterman-rheingold 1991 -individual accounts in the map are represented by spheres pushed apart by centrifugal force and pulled together by spring force based on their social proximity assign a color to each account based on its parent cluster this lack of cohesion or center to the network is not unusual for a global conversation map as dense clusters often denote national subcommunities however the first coronavirus map covers a time period in which the outbreak was largely contained to china with the exception of cases reported in thailand toward the end of january 8 during this time the chinese government and its various media outlets would be expected to form that core informational source as noted in previous studies and reporting of health crises historical distrust in governing bodies makes consensus from the medical and science community challenging particularly in online spaces 9 this in turn creates voids of both information and data for bad actors to capitalize up our pipeline yielded a large set of results detailing the cultural convergence of clusters over time in the covid-19 network maps and the topical bridges that aided this convergence the qanon community is a particularly apt example since researchers studying this topic have qualitatively noted the recent acceleration of qanon membership since the beginning of the pandemic and its convergence with other online communities the aim of the qanon case study is to illustrate the power of this cultural convergence method and reflect similar results we see in numerous groups across our collection of covid-19 map clusters qanon is a political conspiracy theory formed in 2017 lafrance 2020 the community maintains that there is a secret cabal of elite billionaires and democratic politicians that rule the world also known as the deep state as the theory goes donald trump is secretly working to dismantle this powerful group of people given trumps central role and the vilification of democratic politicians this farright theory is most commonly adopted by trump supporters researchers that study the qanon community have hypothesized an accelerated qanon membership since the beginning of the pandemic breland  rangarajan 2020  conspiratorial threads like the plandemic that asserts covid-19 was created by bill gates and other elites for population control are closely tied to qanons worldview our results support the hypothesis that over the course of the pandemic the qanon community has not only grown in size but the qanon content and concepts have taken hold in other communities further our results show that this fringe ideology has spread to broader more mainstream groups the qanon community started as a fringe group that has notably gained momentum both in our covid-19 networks and in real life the first q congressional candidate was elected in georgia and is favored to win the house seat itkowitz 2020  qanon has attracted mainstream coverage as well strauss 2020 cbs news 2020 lafrance 2020  in accordance with these real-world impacts our time series of maps illustrate a similar process of qanon spreading to the mainstream online both in network and in narrative space prior to the pandemic qanon was a fringe conspiracy concentrated on the network periphery of trump support groups as figure 3 illustrates the qanon community was less than 3 of the conversation around covid-19 in february 2020 by april 2020 this community comprised almost 5 of the network and was composed of increasingly dense clusters in february the qanon group had a heterophily score of 09 whereas in may scores for qanon clusters ranged from 557-2077 at the same time there is consistent growth in the number of documents assigned to the qanon topic 28 from 122019 to 52020 our cultural convergence method depicted the topics that supported this shift and the groups that adopted qanon concepts and content over time that process within a few groups is outlined below all of the network maps in figure 2 feature a large us right-wing group indicating that this group was prominently involved in the coronavirus conversation both these maps demonstrate what we refer to as mega clusters loud online communities with a high rate of interconnection this interpretation is supported by both topical and non-topical bridging centrality measures for example after the assassination of iranian major general qasem soleimani in early january we see usiran relations topic 28 narratives acting as a bridge between several us right-wing communities uscanuk right-wing in blue above who use this topic to connect with each other as well as with accounts who in later months we will see come together to form distinct qanon and conspiracy theory communities while documents from these groups make up a relatively small proportion of all documents within the topic at first they become more prevalent over time the usiran relations topic topic 28 becomes the dominant bridge in numerous and geographically diverse clusters by mid-march and continues to hold that spot through mid-april we also find that us right-wing clusters converge topically at the same time as usiran becomes more of a bridge at the start of our analysis the similarity between the topical distribution of these clusters is relatively low for example the us trumpmaga support i and us trump black supportpro-trump alt-media clusters have a divergence score of 03312 during the week of 12302019 indicating minor overlap by 3302020 the same clusters have a divergence score of 05697 and by 5182020 their divergence score reaches 06986 over double compared to three months earlier beginning the week of march 16th we see qanon making significant gains in narrative control of the network with qanon related narratives ie topic 11 acting as one of the strongest bridges maximum bridging centrality for topic 11 is 04794 between communities including conspiracy theorists on both the right and left and the us right wing this persists throughout the remainder of march and into midlate april with april being the first month we see more than one distinct qanon community detected in our network maps again this engagement is supported by the convergence of topic 49 over the analysis period in january these groups have relatively minor similarities in their topic distributions 03835 though these similarities become much larger by mid-march 06619 and continue to increase through the end of the analysis period in mid-may 07150 it is notable that before we are able to detect distinct qanon communities through network mapping they are already making connections to more established communities within the covid network through this content area in terms of overall map volume the right-wing group was the third largest in the january map with 159 and the largest in the february map with 226 overall since march leftleaning and public health clusters gained a foothold in the conversation our results show the right-wing groups were pushed to the periphery of the maps since march and at the same time subsumed by the fringe qanon conspiracy by the end of april hong kong protest related narratives topic 8 replaced qanon as the strongest bridge however given that april and may each have several distinct qanon communities it is possible that qanon topical content is being contained within those newly coalesced communities rather than bridging formerly distinct communities while hong kong protest related narratives are more culturally agnostic this is supported by the lack of magaus right wing clusters in later months and relational increase in qanon clusters in the beginning of the pandemic the volume of clickbait news sites which tend to spread unreliable and sensational covid-19 updates appeared between january to february the group made-up of these accounts and their followers increased from none in january to close to 6 of the map in february during this time many accounts from the alt-media and conspiratorial clusters exclusively and constantly tweeted about coronavirus some including the topic in their profile identity markers this is mirrored on other platforms for instance on facebook where we saw groups changing their names to rebrand into covid-19 centric groups while they were previously groups focused on other political issues these alternative news accounts are preferred news sources for clusters that reject mainstream news this sentiment is reflected in both alt-right and alt-left clusters that carry anti-establishment and conspiratorial views notably these two groups also engage with and share russian state media like rtcom regularly in the february map the dedicated coronavirus news group 58 which is composed of accounts that follow these alternative and often poorly fact-checked media sources was almost equivalent in size to the group of those following official health information sources 74 by march conspiratorial accounts and altright news sources like zero hedge and breitbart were missing from the top mentions across this map and were replaced by influential democrats such as bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio-cortez and left-leaning journalists such as jake tapper and chris hayes in line with the trajectory of more mainstream voices becoming engaged in the conversation as the outbreak progressed fringe voices became less influential in our maps over time these changes could represent a mainstreaming of coronavirus conversation which in turn makes the center of the map more highly concentrated or the reduced share of a consolidated us right-wing community discussing coronavirus online our results show that preference for qanon concepts converge on both ends of the political ideological spectrum this supports the horseshoe theory frequently postulated by political scientists and sociologists that the extremes of the political spectrum resemble one another rather than being polar opposites on a linear political continuum in march-may the qanon topic was an important bridge between alt-left and alt-right clusters the lowest divergence being 073 on 33020 and 050 on 5182020 in the same cluster the topic remained a dominating bridge each week across our maps suggesting that this bridge is a strong tie between the alt-left and alt-right groups independent of the pandemic the alt-left is often vocal on anti-government social justice and climate justice topics from our results we can also see that qanon is also a topical bridge between accounts following alt-left journalists and environmental and climate science organizations 0 77 on 33020 and 075 on 5182020 this suggests that while the far-right is easily drawn to qanon content because of the anti-liberal bend there are other channels such climate activism that act as channels for the qanon conspiracy to spread the multi-modal approach to cultural convergence helps us better understand the highly dynamic nature of overlapping conspiratorial strands our findings highlight that conspiratorial groups are not mutually exclusive and this approach models some of the driving forces behind these convergences the qanon case study is a fraction of the results yielded by this approach and highlights important insights into cultural and topical interconnections between online groups further work will explore the glut of results generated by applying this approach to the ongoing time series mapping of covid-19 other topics such as a time series of maps around the recent black lives matter protests will also be explored  from diversity to coordination a european approach to covid-19 alessio pacces m maria weimer  the covid-19 pandemic is changing the face of europe member states divergent responses to this crisis reveal a lack of unity in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe at best this undermines the effectiveness of health protection within the european union eu at worst it risks breaking up the union altogether divergent national responses to covid-19 reflect different national preferences and political legitimacy and thus cannot be completely avoided in this article we argue that these responses should be better coordinated without coordination the price for diversity is high firstly there are damaging spill-overs between member states which undermine key pillars of european integration such as the free movement of persons and of goods secondly national policy-making is easily captured by local interest groups our proposal is that the eu indicatesnot mandatesa european exit strategy from asymmetric containment policies of covid-19 in particular the eu should help member states procure and validate tests for infection and immunity the eu should also indicate ways in which testing could be used to create safe spaces to work thereby restoring the free movement of persons and of goods we see a great advantage in such eu guidance it could improve mutual learning between member states which have faced different timings of the epidemic and learned different lessons although the local political economy has so far delayed learning and undermined cooperation the eu can mitigate both effects and indicate the way for europe to resurrect united from the ashes of covid-19  the covid-19 pandemic is rapidly changing the face of europe in a european union eu founded on the idea of free movement borders are being erected in an interconnected world countries are trying to shield themselves from a threat that is global and does not respect border checks nor carry a passport the covid-19 pandemic is a transboundary challenge of proportions unseen since the creation of the eu arguably challenges like these are why we have the eu in the first place to enable effective collective action in the face of transboundary problems that no member states can address on their own the eu is a global regulatory power especially in the field of risk regulation and has an institutional structure in place to address public health emergencies however paradoxically in the current situation national governments are calling the shots their divergent responses to this crisis seem to reveal a lack of unity in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe at worst they risk breaking up the eu altogether what explains the diversity of national public health responses to covid-19 1 and what is the price europe is paying for it moreover what is the appropriate role of the eu in this crisis in this essay we will address these questions by combining two perspectives on the pandemic a risk regulation and an economic perspective our analysis reveals certain uncomfortable truths about the interplay between science and politics on the one hand and the need to balance european unity with pervasive diversity when it comes to national attitudes to risk on the other the main argument is this there are good reasons for why member states are in charge of public health responses to pandemics and other health threats the eu does not have legal nor a sufficiently strong democratic-political authority to take the lead on covid-19 especially given the current scientific uncertainty however decentralised and uncoordinated crisis management causes significant spill-overs that are damaging to eu public health the economy and to core european values the eu must turn diversity into a strength and do what it does best enable coordination and mutual learning and organise solidarity after initial mistakes and weak coordination in the first weeks of the crisis the eu must now take the lead in orchestrating a coordinated and safe european exit strategy with a focus on testing the eu offers the necessary tools to accomplish that member states must use them containing the spread of covid-19 is an exercise of emergency risk regulation on an unprecedented scale under normal circumstances eu risk regulation is a challenging task 2 the current crisis takes these challenges to a new level before taking measures policy-makers have to understand the nature and magnitude of a given risk for which they rely on scientific advice science is also required to identify a risk ie the likelihood of harm in the first place covid-19 for example is an invisible risk 3 because only special tests can identify who is infected and our lack of understanding of the real numbers of infections is an enormous challenge while science is crucial it is often uncertain and inconclusive there is substantial uncertainty with regards to the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 eg how the disease spreads whom it affects death rate etc 4 as a consequence policymakers must make decisions in the face of incomplete and rapidly changing scientific knowledge this exacerbates the political challenge of risk regulation as is painfully illustrated by covid-19 as containment policies entail enormous economic social and human costs policy-makers must weigh trade-offs and make political choices about how these costs ought to be distributed this produces conflicts and tests european solidarity as we will discuss further below the eu has experience with navigating such challenges eu law provides a number of principles that aim to address them public health responses to covid-19 have to follow the principle of risk analysis 5 this principle ensures a balance between science and politics by dividing decision-making into two stages first a risk assessmentcarried out by scientific expertsensures the scientific objectivity and quality of regulation 6 second risk managementa task assigned to policy-makersensures the political responsibility and democratic legitimacy of regulation while scientific advice is crucial it remains advisory in nature risk managers can deviate from it with good reasons and must take a range of non-scientific considerations into account to paraphrase a famous pronouncement of the eu general court in pfizer the risk managers public authority derives from their democratic legitimation ie control by and accountability towards representative democratic institutions scientific risk assessors although they have scientific legitimacy have neither democratic legitimacy nor political responsibility scientific legitimacy is not a sufficient basis for the exercise of public authority 7 this does not diminish the importance of scientific advice but recognises a core dilemma science while performing crucial cognitive tasks cannot provide answers to political and hence normative questions 8 risk managers carry the political responsibility of deciding whether action is warranted and what kind of action this entails difficult political economic and ethical choices which vary from one society to another which risks societies are willing to accept and what the levels of protection should be are decisions for democratically accountable institutions 9 risk managers are however not fully free to determine how much health protection is desirable both the eu and member states when managing covid-19 risks must ensure a high level of public health protection 10 they must also respect the precautionary principle which is triggered by the scientific uncertainty around covid-19 the principle requires early and anticipatory action while a zero-risk approach is not allowed the precautionary principle requires policy-makers to protect public health without having to wait until the reality and seriousness of risks become fully apparent or until the adverse effects materialise 11 it also requires them to prioritise public health over economic interests 12 with pandemics the need for early action even before cases start to go up is extremely important 13 even if they seem like an overreaction at first while precautionary measures must be proportionate it is questionable how much room for proper proportionality there is in emergency situations 14 to paraphrase a world health organization who expert waiting for perfection when containing a pandemic means being too late 15 eu law of public health emergencies assigns the tasks of risk assessment and risk management to different levels of government while the eu ensures a more or less harmonised risk assessment of covid-19 national governments are primarily responsible for managing the pandemic including for the application of the precautionary principle this has to do with eu competences it is well knownyet worth stressingthat the eu is a union of conferred powers according to the eu treaties health policy is a national competence 16 member states as the signatories of the treaties have granted the eu only limited powers for public health emergencies under the current eu regulatory framework 17 the role of the eu is to support national crisis management it mainly acts as a hub for rapid information exchange and coordination of national crisis responses there are in principle good reasons for this division of tasks between the eu and the member states the organisation of national health systems is complex and varies across member states different approaches are rooted in national culture and history in federal member states such as germany competences for public health are a matter of subfederal entities eg the lnder national governments are best placed to assess the availability of resources and critical infrastructures training of staff and equipment as well as the expected behaviour of citizens in a crisis after all trust in doctors and governments is shaped by cultural attitudes and is a factor in determining the effectiveness of emergency measures such as social distancing and lockdowns it is therefore not surprising that member states adopt different responses to covid-19 18 11 bse

httpswwwtheguardiancomworld2020mar12how-do-coronavirus-containment-measures-varyacross-europecmpshareiosappother they carry the political responsibility for their crisis management vis--vis their citizens eu institutions especially the european commission do not possess the same level of political authority 19 nor are they subjected to the same kind of democratic accountability as national governments the lack of proper eu risk management powers in health emergencies could be seen as a weakness in contrast we hold that under certain conditions this could become a source of strength if used effectively by the member states eu mechanisms of coordination and support can foster very powerful mutual learning and solidarity while respecting legitimate diversity 20 how well this potential is realised depends on the political will of national governments divergent national responses to covid-19 cannot be avoided yet they can and must be better coordinated without effective coordination there is a high price to pay for diversity an issue to which we turn next according to the economics of federalism which level of government should decide on covid-19 depends on the tension between different criteria 21 for instance diverging local preferences support decentralised solutions but may result in cross-border spillovers different responses to the epidemic may allow countries to learn from each other but also result in conflicts of interest that undermine cooperation in this section we discuss the drawbacks of decentralised policy-making on covid-19 because different communities attach different values to health protection and face different costs from containment measures decentralised risk management meets the preferences of a society more efficiently even under uncertainty 22 the understanding of the precautionary principle varies considerably across countries for example at the time of writing 23 the netherlands and sweden have laxer containment policies than the rest of the eu admittedly reflecting a lower risk and uncertainty aversion than other countries this variation was higher in the beginning of the outbreak the disadvantage of decentralised containment policies is cross-border spill-overs for instance if a dutch resident can freely travel to belgium having stricter containment measures belgian residents bear the effects of dutch risk management 24 the response to this problem has been to reintroduce border controls within the eu with the exception of countries having comparable containment policies this admittedly temporary measure may not seem harmful when most people in the world are encouraged to stay at home however border checks and restrictions are here to stay for some time because when measures are lifted in some countries they will still be in 19 weimer supra note 2 20 on the diversity challenge in eu risk regulation see ibid 21 place in some others and this dissonance might be repeated in several rounds as part of a gradual exit strategy until a vaccine is found the significant restriction of the free movement of persons is likely to undermine everyones sense of belonging to the eu moreover closing borders reduces interstate labour mobility which is part of the bigger problem of covid-19 as a global supply shock a second cross-border spill-over of different risk management choices stems from the disruption of supply chains 25 covid-19 is not only a medical but also an economic emergency compared to a normal recession output will fall also because some production must be halted or reduced to prevent excessive contagion inputs such as equipment and labour incompatible with social distancing get scarcer and reduce the supply of certain goods 26 this already affects countries differently depending on their specialisation and openness to trade but the difference will be exacerbated by the different timing of containment and exit policies countries in lockdown must cope with shortages of goods and impose them on others not only because of underproduction but also due to hoarding export bans and other restrictions reduced mobility of scarce inputs is not only inefficient from a global perspective but also incompatible with the eu internal market it undermines the free movement of goods such freedom has already been restricted with respect to medical equipment prompting a response by eu institutions 27 we expect an increase of these protectionist reactions as more goods become scarce with the spreading of the disease this reflects a more general problem asymmetric covid-19 policies create conflicting interests that in turn undermine cooperation between states diversity in approach and timing of policies against covid-19 could lead countries to compete with each other and learn the optimal reaction also considering local preferences faster than if they were to coordinate given the uncertainty around covid-19 the benefit of a spontaneous convergence towards optimal solutions would outweigh the drawbacks of cross-border spill-overs and conflicts of interest because these would also quickly disappear 28 we doubt however that effective solutions would emerge from regulatory competition soon enough firstly scientific information is produced too slowly compared to the speed of the outbreak secondly policy-makers react to the saliency of the outbreak rather than to scientific information as a result the optimal amount 25 of convergence occurs with a delay if at all leaving countries to deal with unnecessary conflicts of interest and spill-overs between them because covid-19 spreads so rapidly scientists lag behind with the generation of relevant information about the virus data on contagion hospitalisation and deaths come in imprecisely and with delay nevertheless a team of epidemiologists at imperial college london icl has recently modelled contagion and the impact of policies thereupon in the absence of widespread testing or a vaccine there are two policy options for containment mitigation which seeks to slow down contagion by moderate social distancing to build herd immunity and suppression which seeks to avoid contagion as much as possible including lockdowns until a vaccine is found one icl study found that in the usa and the uk mitigation policies would still lead to a sheer number of secondary deaths as the healthcare system becomes congested people who would otherwise survive die lacking access to intensive care units icus 29 the lesson for countries having a similar icu surge capacity is that suppression policies are the only way to avoid congestion in the initial phase of contagion another finding from icl is that the suppression policies implemented in italy averted up to 80000 deaths in a month 30 there is a method in economics to calculate how much a life is worth for a specific society the value of statistical life vsl 31 however coarse and controversial it may be particularly because it consistently underestimates the value of human life for lower-income people 32 the vsl gives an idea about the economic benefit of averted deaths in italy where the vsl is approximately us5 million and the gdp about us2 trillion one month of lockdown was worth up to 20 of gdp confronted with covid-19 politicians worldwide have initially argued that there is a trade-off between protecting health and protecting the economy 33 this sounds odd in light of the above back-of-the-envelope calculations even assuming that the epidemic does not change the behaviour of individuals the life-saving benefit of containment policies largely exceeds foregone output at least in situations comparable to italy moreover the abovementioned trade-off reflects a misconception it wrongly assumes that people adopt social distancing only if the government tells them to do so 34 this reasoning neglects that facing widespread contagion along with the likely congestion of the healthcare system many individuals would implement social distancing anyway and fail to produce output because they get sick die or are afraid of either compared to government intervention 29 n ferguson d laydon and g nedjati-gilani report 9 -impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions npis to reduce covid-19 mortality and healthcare demand imperial college london preprint 16 march 2020 individual reaction and panic would have a much worse impact on the economynot to mention issues of inequality and social unrest even in the absence of precise estimates of contagion and mortality rates there is no economic reason to delay containment moreover delays are also contrary to the precautionary principle 35 however policy-makers invariably delayed action until congestion of the healthcare system became a foreseeable problem in their own country policy-makers have not learned from the experience of other countries political economy explains these delays 36 politicians tend to react to an emergency rather than anticipating it this is particularly the case with non-linear phenomena such as epidemics contagion starts very slowly but becomes politically salient only when it escalates people would consider unwarranted any restriction introduced before the spill-overs from contagion become visible in that phase interest groups bemoaning the economic cost of containment prevail in the political discourse 37 this undermines policy-makers learning from scientists and from the experience of other countries denial is only reversed when the gravity of the situation becomes salient the prospect of letting citizens die because of icu congestion is not politically palatable but then the disease spreads exponentially and there is no time to ponder the policy options as convergence has not happened quickly enough coordination would seem preferable to regulatory competition unfortunately delays have undermined the incentive of countries to cooperate countries may be pursuing mitigation or suppression of contagion these strategies are incompatible and for the time being unstable mitigation without massive testing may have to turn into suppression when icu capacity nears saturation as happened in the uk suppression is not sustainable both psychologically and economically for as long as it seems likely to take until a vaccine is found 38 countries that have suppression in place such as italy will have to suspend it and reinstate it depending on icu inflows therefore countries facing covid-19 have different interests at different times exacerbating spill-overs and potential conflicts yet because containment policies are unstable every country needs an exit strategy coordinating on the exit strategy would remedy spill-overs and conflicts while improving the effectiveness of the response to covid-19 in the next section we argue that the eu could play a decisive role in such coordination the eu offers important tools and institutional structures for coordination mutual learning and solidarity given these tools at no other time in history could the 35 see section ii above 36 see eg l zingales captured western governments are failing the coronavirus test pro-market 13

member states be better prepared in principle to face a global pandemic such as covid-19 yet they were not the success of the european fight against covid-19and probably the survival of the european project as suchdepends on member states making the most out of europe under the current circumstances let us first look at the tools that the eu makes available drawing lessons from previous outbreaks such as sars and bird flu h1n1 the eu has established a legal framework for public health emergencies the cross-border health threats decision 39 this aims to contribute to a high level of public health protection in the eu by ensuring the coordination of both risk assessment and risk management in public health emergencies an eu agency the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc ensures the coordination of scientific advice between the eu and national risk assessors it monitors the disease outbreak produces continuous risk assessments for the eu population as a whole and provides guidance for risk management it is also an important source of comparable epidemiological data for the member statesan aspect crucial for mutual learning about what may or may not work in the fight against the virus 40 moreover the commission has created a new expert group the eu advisory panel on covid-19 41 the panel directly advises commission president ursula von der leyen on measures to be taken at the eu level it also helps in coordination with the ecdc the commission develop guidance for member states to ensure consistent sciencebased and coordinated national risk management since the panel took up work on 17 march 2020 the commission has published the first eu-wide recommendations for community measures testing strategies and health systems resilience 42 in terms of risk management member states are obliged to coordinate their covid-19 measures in the so-called eu health security committee composed of national health ministers and chaired by the commission 43 the health security committee is a crucial forum for mutual consultation and regular information exchange among member states ideally scientific advice from the ecdc and the covid-19 panel and national risk management should be linked here with national health ministries explaining how they have considered eu advice as well as the reasons for their choices of containment policies this should also allow for some degree of external accountability for spill-overs 44 member states being made aware and considering the effects of national policies on other member states moreover member states should use the health security committee as a site to report both successes and failures of national approaches to covid-19 and be willing to adjust their policies accordingly this is where diversity can turn into a strength sharing national experiences in the 39 see above n 17 40 see g pisano r sadun and m zanini lessons above n 13 41 httpseceuropaeutransparencyregexpertindexcfmdogroupdetailgroupdetaildocid39740no1 42 httpseceuropaeuinfolive-work-travel-euhealthcoronavirus-responsepublic-healthena-european-teamof-covid-19-experts 43 art 11 of the decision see above n 17 44 fight against the pandemic in the health security committee may improve mutual learning 45 which is key in the fight against covid-19 the committee is also crucial for informing the commission about national healthcare capacities and needs thereby triggering mechanisms of eu-wide public health solidarity the eu health threats decision foresees such mechanisms via the possibility of voluntary public procurement of medicinal countermeasures and medical equipment preventing harmful competition for vaccines and medical equipment between eu member states is crucial and addresses the spill-overs resulting from the disruption of the free movement of goods and of supply chains 46 a joint eu procurement of these goods gives member states a strong bargaining position towards manufacturers it also allows for the distribution of such goods to places where they are most needed across europe currently the eu has launched four joint procurements of personal protective equipment eg masks ventilators and testing kits 47 because eu law only foresees voluntary public procurement only 25 member states are participating in these initiatives the voluntary participation is a problem as it undermines the eus capacity to act quickly and in the common european interest calls for more eu powers to purchase store and allocate medicines and equipment to fight infectious diseases are therefore justified 48 they are not in conflict with national responsibilities for risk management but rather are in support of them there are other ways in which the eu can address the spill-overs of decentralised risk management of covid-19 while at the same time strengthening the idea of europe as a schicksalsgemeinschaft 49 defining common criteria for legitimate border restrictions is key as the commission has done 50 the eu-wide scheme for export authorisation for medical equipment has helped with lifting national export bans initially imposed by some member states the creation of so-called green lanes 51 to ensure the free flow of critical goods and personnel contributes to public health protection and helps overcome supply problems in the eu this shows that the eu can be very creative with how it uses its powers and can also protect public health by using competences in other fields of policy above all the internal market 45 see g pisano r sadun and m zanini lessons above n 13 46 see section iii above 47 it has also used an eu civil protection mechanism resceu to set up a stockpile of medical equipment see https eceuropaeucommissionpresscornerdetailenip20476 48 things are moving quickly and it is difficult to assess how well coordination in the health security committee actually works at present 52 judging by the initial cacophony of us first responses until approximately mid-march 53 there was little coordination things do seem to have improved however national containment measures and approaches still differ but they are converging with most member states having adopted a combination of social distancing school closures public events bans and more or less stringent lockdowns 54 this is partially due to timing the more the virus spreads across the eu the more member states move to stringent measures figure 1  yet this also signals improved cooperation at the eu level the covid-19 advisory panel seems to have given scientific guidance more weight across the eu the commission recommendations drafted with its input are discussed in the health security committee and member states are asked to provide feedback and to report on how they have implemented the guidance the commission also asks member states to identify priorities for the future work of the panel thus steering its scientific work towards more responsiveness to local needs which is likely to improve the uptake of its advice in the future the committee also coordinates the redistribution of patients and health professionals across the eu in order to address more acute needs in some regionscountries 56 there are positive signs that although delayed the work of the health security committee is going in the right direction going forwards all efforts should be aimed at designing and implementing a european exit strategy on how to lift social distancing measures in a safe way testing the wider population to determine contagion and immunity is key to any such exit strategy 57 on the one hand creating a safe space to work in which people are either immune or not infected and distanced from anyone who could be is crucial to restarting the economies after the contagion is under control without risking a second peak of the outbreak on the other hand having an eu approach to labour mobility and physical production could overcome the current and foreseeable restrictions to the free movement of persons and goods for instance workers from different member states could participate in eu green zones that are free of contagion and so produce scarce goods 58 solutions of this kind would complement national approaches to the exit strategy but also promote more solidarity between member states although we have not addressed this economic solidarity between eu member states is in fact a precondition to restarting the european economies by way of exit from the containment measures 59 after initial mistakes and weak cooperation with regards to putting containment measures in place it is now high time and not less crucial to agree on a coordinated european approach to the exit strategy the commission and the health security committee will have to play an important role in this regard 60 the eu must help the member states obtain the equipment for extensive testing ie assessing eu-wide needs and availability of testing organising joint procurement of testing kits negotiating with industry and funding acquisition moreover test validation and the criteria for relaxing the containment measures must be coordinated between member states in order for the exit strategies to avoidand even remedythe negative spill-overs of the past as this paper went to press the commission published a roadmap for a coordinated eu exit strategy 61 member states initially resisted the publication of this document 62 some such as austria and denmark announced unilateral plans to relax covid-19 lockdowns that differed from the plans of other eu countries 63 the insistence of the commission addresses our key concern the longer the eu waits the less room will there be for coordination this could result in long-lasting damage to free movement and eu solidarity public health protection is equally at risk if national lockdowns are relaxed too quickly and are based on political opportunism or economic lobbying rather than commonly agreed science-based criteria differently from the former the latter take the still pervasive scientific uncertainty surrounding the virus into account 64 the initiative of the commission addresses these concerns it is a commendable first step towards delineating a common european framework on how to gradually lift confinement measures based on common principles of scientific advice coordination and solidarity at the same time however the roadmap still leaves ample margins for member states to continue restrictions of free movement in the presence of asymmetric situations and policies 65 more eu leadership seems to be in order particularly in the design and mutual recognition of testing and tracing policies 66 ultimately the ball is now in the member states court they must act in the common european interest and follow the commissions lead the fight against covid-19 is a marathon not a sprint europes survival will depend on how it handles the exit from this crisis in this article we noted the challenge stemming from different health policies in the eu while this difference reflects national preferences and political legitimacy it has produced negative spill-overs between member states we propose to turn this challenge into an opportunity our proposal is that eu institutions indicatenot mandatea european exit strategy from asymmetric albeit gradually converging containment policies of covid-19 in particular the eu should help member states procure and validate tests for infection and immunity the eu should also indicate ways in which testing could be used to create safe spaces to work thereby restoring the free movement of persons and of goods we see a great advantage in such eu guidance it could improve mutual learning between member states that have faced different timings of the epidemic and learned different lessons although as we showed the local political economy has so far delayed learning and undermined cooperation the eu can mitigate both effects and indicate the way for europe to resurrect united from the ashes of covid-19     since world war ii the coronavirus covid-19 is being considered to be the most life-threatening event that happened in the history of mankind it is a new family of coronavirus that changes its rna structure frequently as the virus had spread all on a sudden and the spread rate could not be predicted in prior only a few countries have been able to control the penetration of this virus the main reason behind their successful control was the ability to trace the contacts of the infected persons promptly and put them into isolation 1  to slow down the coronavirus spread three measures have been proven effective i contact tracing ii social distancing and iii quarantine in particular contact tracing plays a leading role in containing the spread when the r-value is below 10 since the outbreak began different countries adopted different types of contract tracing strategies based on their socio-economic conditions a vast majority of these methods operate through smartphonebased mobile apps according to the statistical portal it has been found that in 2019 almost 507 billion people in the world are using mobile phones as a medium of communication and an estimated 67 of the world population has a mobile phone the statistics also reports that in 2014 the smartphone users were around 38 which increased to 50 by the end of 2018 2  it has been reported that the number of smartphone users worldwide today surpasses three billion 2  from this growth it is expected that the number of smartphone users will grow by one billion in a period of five years 3  4  therefore contact tracing can be easily done using mobile phone apps but the challenge is how the collected data can be handled securely and what information should be collected 5  in addition peoples willingness to install the apps as well as the availability of smartphones in all areas of a society is also a major challenge according to ferretti et al 6  7  if 60 of the population of a country install the contact tracing app the spread rate will automatically slow down after collecting the data the next obvious question is how to warn people effectively many approaches are now under consideration such as contact tracing narrowcasting broadcasting and so on to alert people regarding the possibility of being infected or tracing the likely infected persons contact trajectory 8  accurate contact tracing data is vital for providing timely exposure notices for that purpose users personal information such as mobility details of the persons the suspected user contacted etc has to be disclosed the app can provide the data with reliable accuracy only if the collected information is sufficient but more information leads to increased breach of privacy which is a major concern these days for a clear understanding of the privacy concerns related to smartphone app-based contact tracing one needs to know how such apps operate in practice a typical contact tracing app works as follows the app should be installed on an individuals cell phone and the bluetooth of the phone must always remain on when two users having the same app installed reach in close proximity the app exchanges a unique identifier using bluetooth which is stored either in the phone storage or in a centralized database if a person is found to be covid-19 positive his mobile is taken to collect all the mobile numbers that had so far been stored in this mobile and then those persons are informed as soon as possible however the authors in 9 raised some valid questions regarding the method being used in the bluetoothbased contact tracing app such as how the anonymity of a user be protected from the app provider how to prevent the snooper to access individuals data through this app what measure the authority will take in case of contacted persons after knowing their details and so on therefore not only finding the infected or likely infected person is enough but how to inform them or what measures should be taken to confine them is also important in the pandemic situation in addition solutions that seem effective for some countries may not be appropriate for other countries due to different social norms to address the aforementioned challenges in smartphone app-based contact tracing of covid-19 we propose the idea of using mobile phone users geolocation data for contact tracing the proposed model does not require bluetoothwi-finfc enabled cell phones since the responsible authorities will collect the data directly from the network providers the procedure is detailed in the following sections meanwhile the rest of the paper is organized as follows section ii presents an extensive review of existing systems section iii focuses on the details the proposed model section iv compares the proposed model with existing systems from different viewpoints then experimental results are presented in section v finally conclusions are drawn in section vi after the declaration of who as covid-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30th january 2020 10 11 and a pandemic on 11th march 2020 12  many countries developed different contact tracing apps to monitor and control the spread in the country according to a cnn report the health code app 13 that is being used in many parts of china works as follows the app asks people about their symptom as well as their travel history the possibility of being in contact with a covid-19 positive patient their workplaces residential addresses phone numbers passport numbers national identity number etc will be verified after verification a color code will be sent to the persons mobile phone named as qr code whose color can be either red green or amber users with red code will have to go under government quarantine or selfquarantine for 14 days users with amber code will go to quarantine for 7 days but users with green code are considered to be risk-free the major problem in this app is if a person intentionally provides wrong information regarding his travel information or symptom or being in close contact with a covid-19 positive patient then he will get a green code and will likely affect more people before being identified south korea was among the first few countries that were affected by the novel coronavirus after china hence in south korea the first confirmed cases were reported on 20th january 2020 14  even though in the initial stage the number of affected people in south korea was quite high but they didnt go for any lockdown or roadblock or aggressive immigration control strategy rather they used a trace test and treat strategy which proved very effective as within a short period the curve of newly confirmed cases as well as deaths had been flattened at around mid-march 15  to control the spreading the government of south korea sent all the travelers who came from abroad into self-quarantine during the quarantine state the travelers forcefully used a self-diagnosis app and updated their health status regularly so that the government can trace whether there are any suspected symptoms 16  at the same time the government also sent all of the individuals who had direct contact with those travelers to self-quarantine as well and followed the same monitoring scheme but the main problem in this tracing process arose when the collected data was shared among many authorities such as police health insurance central government agencies health care professionals health care associations and others hence it is a direct violation of data privacy law in south korea 15  but during the pandemic situation such law can be relaxed and that was what south korea did at that time besides it was suggested that if such a situation happens again aggregated data rather than an individuals can be shared to all the concerned sectors to control the misuse of data 15  in march 2020 singapore ministry of health first released a contact tracing app called tracetogether and its ble-based protocol bluetrace 17 where the tracing will be done through mobile phones bluetooth technology for tracking purpose a person has to install the app and bluetooth must be turned on always a unique token is generated in the persons mobile during installation whenever two persons are in close proximity their phone will exchange that token through bluetooth and preserve that token number in the phone storage 18  the pan-european privacy-preserving proximity tracing pepp-pt 19  a joint project between germany france and italy proposed a centralized data center based on bluetooth low energy ble-based tracing technique where any traveler travelling within eu countries can use the same app to let the government know his contacted persons list without needing any additional contact tracing app there are several major problems in the ble-based tracing systems following both centralized and decentralized approaches first if the person does not use a smartphone featuring bluetooth connectivity then there is no way he or she can be traced we acknowledge that in a first world country like singapore or germany most of the people use smartphones but not necessarily everyone keeps the bluetooth connectivity enabled in hisher device at all time second although bluetooth technology is considered as a cheap reliable and low power consuming option any malicious user may access the information stored in the mobile devices through the bluetooth link 20 21 22  in 21  naveed et al explained the security issues of using mobile bluetooth technology for android devices and in 23 the authors showed the security issues in the ios platform data privacy is thus a major concern in bluetooth based apps for any contact tracing app the main goal is to inform the person that he or she has been exposed to the virus however with bluetooth-based apps even if the person has not been in touch with any infected person but within the bluetooth range of the person the user of the phone will be flagged as a suspected one and may be subject to social bullying it may also create a mass confusion if the number of such false alarm increases significantly on the other hand if we consider the scenario of a developing country like bangladesh nigeria etc where coronavirus is creating phobia among people as medical facilities to support the massive number of patients are not adequate and many hospitals are not even treating patients with other problems due to the suspicion of coronavirus this type of contract tracing app will create mass panic rather than mass awareness and people will face social harassment in general two types of data can be collected by using these apps one is proximity which will show with whom the user has been in contact and location which will show in which area the user has roamed 8  both may cause false positive alarms and false-negative alarms 8  a falsepositive alarm will happen if the person who is identified being in contact either by location information or contact information may just pass the area at that time and didnt even come in direct contact with the infected person a falsenegative alarm means the app is failing to identify any suspected person which may happen due to many reasons as we have discussed earlier interestingly many existing works suggest decentralized solutions because less sensitive data can then be shared with central authorities and thus the end users privacy can be preserved 24 25  however the risk of the decentralized solution compared to the centralized solution is still a tradeoff and beyond the scope of this work while most of the contact tracing apps are now using the ble-based tracing technique some researchers are also thinking about storing users mobility information and only hand over this information only when found covid-19 positive 26  in terms of data security and privacy this is more secure as logging the location without the contacts stored information is less private in 27  the authors proposed a bluetooth based contact tracing app contain where they showed that the identity of the user will be completely anonymous and at the same time they experimented different timing of turning the bluetooth on random decentralized centralized of the mobile to compare the results they found in their experimental results that even if the bluetooth is turned on only when the user goes to any public gathering the performance of the app is better than if it is turned on randomly during different times of the day we have found that most of the covid-19 contact tracing apps released so far are based on location proximity-based contact tracing location-based hotspot reporting and selfreported symptom tracking 17 19 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33  on the other hand if the location data can be obtained from cellular mobile phone networks then the issues related to the ble-based tracing technique can be eliminated as well as the technological requirements eg phones with bluetooth and smart features can be waived the authors of 34 have proposed an outdoor location tracking technique of mobile devices in a cellular network they have shown that the proposed technique is nearly 88 accurate in urban areas the tracking performance is the best with median accuracies of up to 112m it is also found that the cellular systems show promising positioning performance in indoor environments as well 35  in this paper we propose a contact tracing approach using cellular sim card geolocation data as opposed to the blebased tracing techniques in the proposed model a confirmed covid19 patients mobile number will be passed to the corresponding mobile operator to find its mobility information for the past 7 days the operator will use the geolocation information to trace the mobility as shown in fig1  in the proposed model no bluetooth wi-fi nfc enabled cell phone is needed as the operator will use the geolocationbased tracing approach by getting the location data directly from the base station to identify the likely infected persons this method can avoid panic spread among people as it does not require continuous warning about their possibility of getting infected the responsible authority can then identify the riskiest persons based on the intensity of contact with covid-19 positive patients and instruct them to go for isolationtest if necessary in addition if a person feels to have developed any symptoms of covid-19 the proposed method can also perform an initial screening by checking whether the cell phone number is enlisted in the list of suspects in this section we present the proposed cell phone geolocation-based contact tracing model we structure the overall framework in three operational phases each phase has specific activities the phases and their operations are discussed below in this phase the primary data for the covid-19 patients will be collected from the designated test centers then the infected areas will be shown using any map services eg google map the activities to be performed at this stage are described below and the process is depicted in fig 2  whenever a person visits a covid-19 test center two basic information such as the current address and the active mobile phone numbers must be recorded in the local register of the test center if the person is found to be covid-19 positive then the previously recorded information ie address and phone numbers must be reported to the central database at this point the number of infected persons in an individual area eg division district city road etc will be calculated an application will be in place eg ios or android app or web application etc where anyone can do a simple registration with the mobile number the registered user can search for a particular location and get the number of infected persons around it via any map services eg google map in the second phase we focus on how the government can identify the likely infected persons the cell phone number of the covid-19 positive patients can be traced to find out the possible occurrences as shown in fig 3  here any other cell phone user who came in near proximity eg 2 meters to the infected person during the last 7 days lies in the suspected list but the mass people do not need to install any kind of application as the location data latitude and longitude will be collected from the cell phone network therefore this process is not limited to the use of smart phones rather we can get the data for any type of cell phone eg feature phone users the step-by-step process is illustrated below and the process is depicted in fig 4  after getting the data ie the list of infected persons from the central database each mobile number will be sent to the corresponding mobile operator to get the mobility information latitude and longitude of the respective cell phone users during the prior 7 days at the same time the operator will also be asked to provide the mobile numbers of the active cell phone users within those infected persons mobility zones within a given distance the mobility zone information acquired from the previous figure 2 flow diagram of phase -i step will then be sent to all other operators to identify all of the active cell phone users inside the zone at that time all the cell phone numbers obtained from step 1 and 2 will be stored in the central database marked as possible infected cell phone numbers step 04 if a particular number is found to appear multiple times in the possible infected cell phone numbers list then those cell phone users will be instructed to go for isolation covid-19 test as appropriate at this phase if a person feels physically uncomfortable and wants to go for a test the application can help to make the decision and predict the intensity for this purpose we propose activities as follows in stepwise and the process is depicted in fig 5  through the application any person can search whether the corresponding cell phone number is enlisted in the suspected list if the cell phone user is already suspected by the application the person will be instructed to answer some questionnaires which can be taken from 36 37 38  the sample question set is shown in table 1  the answers will be verified and analyzed in real-time with a predefined answer set finally after the analysis if the person is found to be possibly infected then the person will be instructed to go for a covid-19 test these three phases are combined to form the proposed contact tracing method and the overall flow is depicted in fig 6   the strongest aspect of the proposed contact tracing method is that it is not limited by advanced technological requirements eg smartphone bluetooth wi-fi nfc and so on the only requirement is that every individual has to carry the cell phone with an active sim card with 5112 billion unique mobile users 67 penetration globally even higher in urban areas where covid-19 has the worst effect mobile phone geolocation data seems to be the most viable means of contact tracing recently a few articles have summarized different approaches proposed in the literature for minimizing the spread during this outbreak of covid-19 39  40  most of the approaches are modern technology facilitated the common approaches are broadcasting selective broadcasting unicasting participatory sharing private kit safe paths etc each of these approaches has its strengths and limitations raskar et al have provided a detailed summary of the approaches named above 39  we have reviewed the detailed comparison presented in 39 and analyzed different aspects of each method the comparison of strengths and limitations of existing and the proposed methods is outlined in table 2  the comparison factors are illustrated below as per the proposed model as the mobility information will be collected from the mobile operators it is obvious that the data will be accurate in the proposed model we will not collect the locations verbally as a result we can say that the data will be precise and accurate there will be no adaptability issue as the person does not need to carry out any predefined activity people will continue their day-to-day activities and what everybody does most of the time they will carry their cell phones the privacy issues are considered in the viewpoints of carriers local businesses users of the proposed model and the non-users these issues are discussed below  there will be no privacy risks for the carriers as the personal information will not be publicized only the infected count will be made public via any map services eg google map while identifying the adjacent persons of a particular cell phone user the location information will not be made public also because the proposed model works in a centralized manner the location data will be used only for predicting infection probability of the respective user there will be very low privacy risks for the local businesses as the locations where the carrier visited will not be made public the privacy of the users will be protected as the application will collect the location data from the sim card operator not from the device location through bluetooth or other means there may be privacy violations for the non-users as the users and non-users are somehow connected via social relationships but this is common for other contact tracing methods as well when a person is diagnosed as covid-19 positive the family members or friends may endure the same unintended consequences of the event the consent issues are considered in terms of the carriers businesses and users of the proposed model these issues are illustrated below the proposed model is considered to operate in such a way where the information about the patients will be recorded before the test of covid-19 as a result there will be no way to hide the details of the carrier afterward therefore no consent will be needed as it is a casual and normal practice the consent of local businesses in the proposed model mainly depends on the government policies the consent of the users is required for the proposed model during the registration the user will be asked to provide the cell phone number even when the user wants to check if heshe made any contact with any covid-19 patient the cell phone number needs to be sent to the operator for a crosscheck the systematic challenges are considered in terms of carriers businesses and users of the proposed model the issues are described below there is a very low risk of misinformation as the location data will not be taken from any user input rather the data will be collected from the sim card operator the proposed model can reduce panic to some extent as the users of the model can check the initial status and also the intensity while staying at home  data accuracy issue  risk of misinformation  limited by technological requirements unicast  low risk of mass panic  data accuracy is high  no privacy for the user  not helpful for the mass people participatory  users privacy is protected from mass people  there can be fraudulent activity  mass user adoption is low  full consent is needed from the covid-19 carrier private kit safe path  overall accuracy is high  moderate to low privacy risk for the covid-19 carrier  limited by technological requirements  full consent is required from the covid-19 carrier  high accuracy of location data  users cell phones must not be smartphones rather any phone with an active sim card  to collect the data no user application is needed  less false negative issue  the user has to carry the cell phone it is expected that there will be no fraudulent activities as the application will not require any open connection eg bluetooth nfc etc the proposed model is designed with a view in mind about the security concerns of the carriers as well as the users important information as only the cell phone number which is already a public entity is needed to operate the proposed method there is a very low chance of security holes equal access is the main strength of the proposed model as it is not limited by any technological requirement eg smartphones battery certain os etc rather only a cell phone is needed there are almost no bad impacts on the socioeconomic factors for the proposed model sometimes it is dependent on the governments practice if there is any finally the overall comparison of existing contact tracing approaches with the proposed approach is provided in table  ii in terms of major strengths and limitations in this section we compare the proposed contact tracing method with existing technologies through numerical examples to understand the real impact of our proposed system and to make a realistic comparison with the existing solutions based on ble technology we have generated the mimic of an actual contact tracing scenario based on some real statistical measures in the scenario we have used the poisson point process ppp for a circular area of radius 1 we have scaled a distance of 100 meters to unity for ease of presentation the percentages of smartphone users and any type of mobile phone users are considered as the density parameters of ppp for generating two separate sets of data we consider bangladesh as a typical example of developing countries to show the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach according to the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs and bangladesh statistics 2018 the total population of bangladesh is 1627 million 41  according to the bangladesh telecommunication regulatory commission btrc the total number of mobile phone subscribers is 162290 million 42 and the total number of mobile internet subscribers is 93101 million at the end of april 2020 43  as the total number of mobile phone subscribers is almost identical to the total population we assume that almost 100 people have a mobile phone of some kind note that the official data of unique mobile users is not available during this analysis we are considering the percentage of smartphone users based on the total number of mobile internet subscribers thus we can say that almost 58 of bangladeshi people are using smartphones without loss of generality we assume that people need smartphones to be able to use the ble-based tracing app now we use the value of the density parameter for any type of mobile phone users as l  100 and for smartphone users as l  58 in poisson point process based on this assumption we simulate the data for both type of mobile phone users in cartesian two-dimensional space we have repeated the simulation four times so that we can make a reliable inference with a more accurate performance measure in order to understand the dispersion of the points we use scatter plots figs 7 and 8 and covariance measures it is apparent that the points in any type of mobile phone users fig 8  are more condensed than the points simulated based on only smartphone users fig 7  the covariance analysis in table iii is also supporting this observation to draw the same inference as the covariance is always smaller for the points in any type of mobile phone users l  100 than smartphone users l  58 according to the official statistics 18 of the people who were tested for covid-19 in bangladesh were found positive 44  so we have randomly selected 18 of the points as covid-19 positive and marked with red dots in fig 7 and fig 8  then we have measured the euclidian distance of every point with respect to the red points likely covid-19 positive finally we have counted the points which were within a 3-meter radius of any of the covid-19 positive points similarly we count the same considering the 2-meter distancing strategy the contact tracing performance comparison for a maximum of 3-meter distance is shown in table iv  here we can see that for each of the four trials the count of contact tracing using any type of mobile phone is higher than that of smartphone users during the trials the highest percentage of change with respect to smartphone users is 300 and the lowest is 100 the average count of contact tracing for any type of mobile phone users and smartphone users is 20 and 775 respectively these observations clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed tracing strategy the contact tracing comparison for a maximum of 2-meter distance is shown in table v  where we again notice that for each trial the count of contact tracing using any type of mobile phone is higher than that of smartphone users during the trials the highest percentage of change with respect to smartphone users is 26667 and the lowest is 60 the average count of contact tracing for any type of mobile phone users and smartphone users is 95 and 425 respectively these two contact tracing comparisons are depicted graphically in fig 9 and fig 10  next we extend the performance comparison to the case of two other countries eg india and south korea because south korea is ranked at the top of the list for smartphone usage 95 and india at the last 24 based on the total population 45  in india 24 of the total population use smartphones 40 people use mobile phones that are not smartphones and 35 people do not use any mobile phone at all therefore we simulate the data for india with the density parameter l  24 for smartphone-only users and l  64 for any kind of mobile phone users on the other hand in south korea 95 people use smartphones and 5 use a mobile phone that are not smartphones so for south korea we consider the density parameter l  95 for smartphone-only according to covid-19 case statistics for both the countries it is found that in india 416  of people were found positive after test 46 and it is 106  in south korea 47  we have used these percentages to consider the covid-19 positive points the country-wise contact tracing performance of existing and proposed schemes is shown in fig 11  from fig11  it is noticeable that the count of contact tracing is higher for most of the time when any type of mobile phone users geolocation is considered than smartphone-based apps the percentage of changes with respect to smartphone users for each of the countries is also given in fig 12   to slow down the spreading of the deadly virus termed as the novel coronavirus there is no alternative to finding out the infected persons as well as those who came into close contact with an infected person then taking proper measures considering this fundamental approach many countries have already developed contact tracing applications which are showing promising results but with significant privacy concerns in this paper we have addressed the privacy issue by avoiding any smartphone-based apps for contact tracing through wireless connectivity eg bluetooth wi-fi nfc etc the proposed model uses mobile users geolocation data directly from the mobile operators by doing so the overall contact tracing performance improves significantly while preserving users privacy   emerging virus diseases can we ever expect the unexpected colin howard r nicola fletcher f   over the past two decades there has been mounting interest in the increasing number of viruses causing unexpected illness and epidemics among humans wildlife and livestock all too often outbreaks have seriously stretched both local and national resources at a time when health-care spending in the economically developed world has been constrained importantly capacity to identify and control emerging diseases remains limited in poorer regions where many of these diseases have their origin emerging disease is a term used with increasing frequency to describe the appearance of an as yet unrecognized infection or a previously recognized infection that has expanded into a new ecological niche or geographical zone and often accompanied by a significant change in pathogenicity1 the key message is that these are representative of constantly evolving infections responding to rapid changes in the relationship between pathogen and host among 1400 pathogens of humans over 50 of these have their origins in animal species that is are diseases or infections naturally transmitted between vertebrates and humans world health organization according to woolhouse and colleague2 emerging or re-emerging pathogens are far more likely to be zoonotic viruses are over-represented in this group moreover viruses with rna genomes account for a third of all emerging and re-emerging infections emerging pathogens are typically those with a broad host range often spanning several mammalian orders almost certainly many of these infections have been the result of the development of agricultural practices and urbanization figure 1 recent interest in emerging infections has focused on three key areas first how the interplay of climate environment and human societal pressures can trigger unexpected outbreaks of emerging disease second the understanding of how viruses can transmit between a reservoir and new host species third identifying those aspects of the disease process that offer opportunities for therapy and prevention to these must be added a broader understanding of how viruses evolve over time clues to which are now being uncovered through looking closely at genetic elements of the host genome responsible for resisting virus invasion meeting these objectives will provide a more rigorous basis for predicting virus emergence our environment is changing on an unprecedented scale climate change needs to be distinguished from climate variation change is where there is statistically significant variation from the mean state over a prolonged period of time the most notable manifestations have been the increasing climatic conditions initiated by changes in sea surface temperatures in the pacific known as the el nio southern oscillation in the summer of 1990 an el nio event occurred which in turn led to a period of prolonged drought in many regions of the americas and the emergence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome conversely a sudden reversal in sea temperature in the summer of 1995 resulted in heavy rainfalls especially in columbia resulting in resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and equine encephalitis vector-borne diseases are judged as highly sensitive to climatic conditions although the evidence for climatic change and altered epidemiology of vector-borne disease is generally regarded as particularly sensitive to temperature even a small extension of a transmission season may have a disproportionate affect as transmission rates rise exponentially rather than linearly as the season progresses climatic change can also bring about altered vector distributions if suitable areas for expansion become newly available again the effect may be disproportionate particularly if the vector transmits disease to human or animal populations without pre-existing levels of acquired immunity with the result that those clinical cases are more numerous and potentially more severe increased temperatures and seasonal fluctuations in either rainfall or temperature favor the spread of vector-borne diseases to higher elevations and to more temperate latitudes56
aedes aegypti a major vector of dengue is limited to distribution by the 10 c winter isotherm but this is shifting so threatening an expansion of disease ever northward7 the relentless change inflicted by humans on habitats in the name of progress has also had a marked effect on rodent habitats outbreaks of bolivian hemorrhagic fever in bolivia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the united states have been clearly associated with abnormal periods of drought or rainfall leading to unusually rapid increases in rodent numbers of all species of mammals rodents are among the most adaptable to comparatively sudden changes in climate and environmental conditions small climatic changes can bring about considerable fluctuations in population size inhabiting desert and semidesert areas particularly in food quantity and quality a prolonged drought in the early 1990s in the four corners region of the united states led to a sharp decline in the numbers of rodent predators such as coyotes snakes and birds of prey but at the end of the drought heavy rainfall resulted in an explosion in pion nuts and grasshopper populations which in turn resulted in a rapid escalation of rodent numbers among them deer mice carrying hantaviruses a similar set of circumstances occurred in the beni region of bolivia in the 1960s when a period of prolonged drought was followed by rain an exponential rise in the numbers of calomys callosus field voles followed exacerbated by the use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt in use at that time to reduce mosquito numbers this had the unfortunate consequence of reducing the local peridomestic cat population that had hitherto kept feral rodent numbers in check the consequence of these sharp climatic changes was the emergence of bolivian hemorrhagic fever caused by the arenavirus machupo this pattern of severe oscillations of rain and drought markedly affect murine species and insect vector numbers and act as an indicator that disease emergence may occur in the period following such changes a similar pattern of events occurred in 1994 when in venezuela an outbreak of what originally thought was due to dengue virus was in fact another example of the emergence of a novel arenavirus8 evolving in the old world murines are a comparatively recent introduction into the new world most probably via the bering land isthmus some 2030 million years ago whilst other rodents have declined in number murine rodents have thrived especially in peri-urban areas this means that although species diversity has become less with fewer genera represented those remaining have multiplied many times over it is among species of the family muridae that reservoir hosts of arenaviruses and hantaviruses are to be found in south america deforestation has accelerated exponentially since the beginning of the twentieth century and in the amazonian basin and parts of southeast asia has had a profound effect on local ecosystems particularly by constraining the range of natural predators instrumental in keeping rodents insects and other potential carriers of infectious disease under control9 the reduction in biological diversity can trigger the invasion and spread of opportunistic species heralding the emergence of disease through increased contact with local human populations arthropod-borne infections such as congo-crimean hemorrhagic fever could pose a substantial risk to both humans and livestock in europe should climatic conditions raise further the ambient spring temperature infected immature ticks carried on migratory birds would molt in much greater numbers although such an enhancement in molting might be offset by a significant reduction in the number of migratory birds10 air travel represents a major risk factor for the global spread of a new infectious agent it is estimated that over 100 million passenger journeys by air are made every year it is feasible to visit as many as three continents in a few hours this is in marked contrast to just 50 years ago when many people rarely if ever traveled any distance from their place of residence frequent air travel is now regarded as a major contributing factor to the spread of emerging diseases this is vividly illustrated by examining the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus in 2003 when the infection was disseminated from china to at least 17 countries in less than a week based on the events of 2003 hufnagel11 have designed a mathematical model that simulates accurately the spread of sars virus to countries that experienced four or more cases the utility of having a model means that once preliminary data are available a prediction can be made as to those regions most at risk moreover the work shows how difficulty if would be to contain an outbreak by vaccination alone were one available once the statistical information is available such a model can be used to predict those regions most at risk in the event of any future sars epidemic were a vaccine available the initial spread of virus might be contained if only a third of the population were immunized in the regions where the outbreak is focused this assumes an index case made a single air journey however this increases substantially to 75 in the event of an index case making two journeys with the whole population requiring vaccination if the same passenger made three trips analysis of air traffic from mexico at the start of the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic suggests the risk of spread is particularly great when the volume of air traffic is high but resources to report and trace diseased individuals is restricted12 ground transport offers a more favorable route for transmission approximately 17 of all ravel in europe is by public ground transport in contrast air travel represents less than 02 of all passenger kilometers traveled13 in contrast to airliners public trains buses etc are rarely fitted with high efficiency particulate air hepa filters it is not only humans that travel the international air transport association estimate that around 80 000 wild-caught animals are air freighted each year many being placed in holding facilities close to populated areas whilst in transit even mosquitoes may be carried it is thought that west nile virus wnv entered the united states as a result of an infected mosquito surviving the air journey from the middle east to new york city in 199914 the incursion of wnv into north america is an excellent example of a virus expanding into an ecological niche where transmission-competent vectors are already present once established in and around the new york area the availability of vertebrate hosts most notably corvids together with optimal climatic conditions for vector populations enabled the rapid spread of wnv across the united states epizootic outbreaks have occurred frequently with an escalating number of neurological cases among the immunocompromised and the elderly15 among all species of mammals members of the family muridae have been the most successful and are found in almost all habitats this family has species that are the natural hosts of almost all arenaviruses and hantaviruses as noted above rodents are highly susceptible to climate and ecological change resulting in variable population numbers among the fastest reproducing mammals field voles can have over 15 broods per year each with an average of six pups this in turn considerably increases the risk of human exposure to any pathogens they may carry as well as stimulating such pathogens to undergo mutational adaptations to the changing ecosystems rodents thrive on contaminated food and water and are excellent swimmers that rodents constitute an important part of the earths biomass is manifested by estimates of rodents consuming at least a fifth of the worlds output of grain the preeminent property of the arenaviruses is the establishment of a long-term chronic infection in their principle murine reservoir although rodents are divided into over 30 families worldwide arenaviruses are found mainly within two rodent families the muridae and cricetidae eg field voles lemmings gerbils each arenavirus is not necessarily found distributed throughout the populations of any particular host reservoir however the natural reservoirs of the old world arenaviruses are members of the genera mastomys and praomys these rodents included within the family muridae frequent human dwellings and food stores and as a result humans become infected through exposure to the rodents urine nearly all arenaviruses found in the americas are associated with cricetid rodents of open grasslands and forest hantaviruses have emerged as major causes of zoonotic diseases again associated with exposure to rodents belonging to the family muridae there is a tight relationship between virus and its native rodent host with each rodent species being infected with a single virus outbreaks of human disease are thus intimately related to the geographical distribution of the host reservoir the agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is associated with the murine species apodemus agrarius a common field rodent found throughout most of the northern hemisphere this rodent invades outbuildings and food stores entering homes when rodent numbers increase as a result of changing environmental factors for example abnormal rainfall this is best exemplified by the emergence of sin nombre virus in the four corners region of the united states in 1993 the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome the emergence of this agent was totally unexpected the four corners outbreak instigated intensive research into how fluctuations of rodent populations precipitate outbreaks of human disease abnormal weather patterns and increased rainfall results in a dramatic increase in the vegetation providing food for rodents thus the environment is able to suddenly sustain a rapidly expanding number of animals as population sizes explode the chances of rodents encroaching into peridomestic areas and households also increases especially when the over abundance of food comes to an end as a consequence there is a rise in the incidence of human illness as individuals have a much greater chance of coming into contact with excreta from persistently infected animals the chance of virus switching into other rodent species also becomes a greater possibility as rodent territories expand and overlap switching to a new rodent host can have a profound effect on virus evolution adaptation of hantaviruses to new hosts can stimulate the development of new virus phenotypes and hence expansion into new ecological niches examples of this include the divergence of saaremaa virus from dobrava virus nemirov et al17 have suggested this has been the consequence of dobrava virus switching from yellow-striped field mouse apodemusflavicollis to a agrarius the striped field mouse the result is a virus with presumed reduced pathogenicity for humans other examples of host switching include transmission of monongahela virus from peromyscus maniculatis to p leucopus eventually giving rise to new york virus18 and the crossing of puumala virus from clethrionomys species to lemmus species and onto microtus species giving rise to the topografov and khabarovsk virus lineages19 during an investigation of the 1998 hendra virus outbreak in queensland australia it was noticed that grazing horses often sought shelter under trees containing bat roosts wild fruit bats in such roosts were found positive for virus and neutralizing antibodies found in otherwise healthy bats20 similarly the related nipah virus found in malaysia and bangladesh has also been associated with pteropus bats youngsters had been exposed to the secretions of fruit bats when picking fruit or processing date palm oil from bat-infested trees bats have long since been known as the principal hosts of lyssaviruses with distinct phylogenetic differences for example between rabies virus strains circulating in bats and terrestrial mammals such as foxes raccoons and dogs the link between genetic variability and spatial epidemiology among the lyssaviruses gives a particularly good insight as to how viruses of wildlife can adapt and emerge into different animal populations rabies virus in europe has switched host many times over the past century adapting rapidly to new hosts as the virus expands into new species with time rabid bats exhibit abnormal behavior losing their natural fear of humans and thus present a greater risk of transmission to humans despite the availability of vaccines and post-exposure prophylaxis rabies remains a major zoonotic threat21 given the increasing evidence of bats as reservoirs of emerging infections22 it is worth considering the evolution and diversity of these mammals nearly 1000 species are distributed throughout the world with the majority in areas close to the equator where food sources are most abundant belonging to the mammalian order chiroptera bats are broadly divisible into the old world fruit-eating bats 180 species suborder megachiroptera and the microbatssome 800 species grouped into 17 families within the suborder microchiroptera insectivorous bats are all microbats bats evolved around 50 million years ago with the fruit bats evolving along a very different path to the insect-eating species bats are found in most terrestrial habitats with species distribution varying widely some being restricted to a single island others being found across continents among the latter is miniopterus schreibersii from which negredo et al23 isolated lloviu virus from a cave in north-eastern spain schreibers bats are found throughout southern europe as far south as south africa and as far east as japan fruit-eating bats are not normally cave dwelling normally forming roosts in tree-tops or crevices in decaying trees and thus present opportunities for spread to humans many bats travel long distances for food especially fruit-eating species who respond to ever varying supply of food and who must compete with birds and other animals flights covering distances of 1520 miles from the roost is the norm although some species will forage over a distance of 30 miles in a single night while both insectivorous and fruit eating bats have been shown to harbor zoonotic viruses fruit-eating bats represent the biggest risk for human contact most of the flesh of fruit is discarded from the mouth of feeding animals thus providing ample opportunity for virus spread several species hypsignathus monstrosus epomops fraqueti myonycteris torquata have been successfully infected with ebola virus sustaining the presence of virus in organs and blood for as long as 3 weeks asymptomatic ebola virus infection has been reported in insectivorous bats trapped in central africa and recent exposure to fruit bats has been a feature of at least one outbreak24
rousettus aegyptiacus is one species in which antibodies to both marburg and ebola viruses have been found rousettus species are the exception despite being fruit-eaters these bats form roosts deep within caves marburg virus sequences have also been found in wild-caught rhinolophus eloquens and miniopterus inflatus25 intriguingly filovirus elements have been found in some mammalian species leading to the suggestion that filoviruses have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts over many millennia26 pigs have been implicated in several outbreaks of emerging infections starting in september 1998 clusters of human cases of encephalitis began to be reported from the malaysian states of perak and negri sembilan by far the most extensive outbreak was in the village of sungai nipah near the city of bukit polandok almost all of the cases had a direct link to the local piggeries and coincided with accounts of illness amongst pigs 1 to 2 weeks beforehand a total of 265 cases were notified with mortality approaching 40 in march 1999 infection developed in 11 singaporean abattoir workers handing pig carcasses one of which proved fatal initially these outbreaks were believed due to japanese encephalitis je but a number of cases had been vaccinated previously against je virus and there was no evidence of je virus antibodies among the remainder the link with hendra virus soon followed after the isolation of virus from an infected pig farmer the new agent now named nipah virus after the locality it was first reported shares 80 sequence homology with hendra virus with both viruses now being regarded as members of the henipaviruses within the paramyxoviridae family it is clear that nipah virus is widely distributed across northeast india bangladesh and southeast asia with phylogenetic analyses revealing the virus to be diverging within specific geographical localities since balayan et al27 first showed that pigs could be infected with hepatitis e virus hev there has been interest in the zoonotic potential of this agent especially in rural areas of the indian subcontinent where a high mortality rate is frequently observed amongst pregnant women hev appears ubiquitous in pigs and poultry regardless as to whether there is evidence of infection in the local community pigs become infected around 3 months of age but suffer only a mild transient infection the worldwide distribution of infected pigs means there is ample opportunity for transmission especially in southeast asia where most pigs are kept in family smallholdings antibody prevalence as a result is higher than compared to the general population for example hsieh et al28 found 27 of taiwanese pig handlers were seropositive compared to 8 in the general population swine had become infected by the fecaloral route with pig feces containing large quantities of virus it is not clear whether humans have been directly infected via this route or if there is a common source or reservoir cross-species transmission is likely to be dependent upon genotype most swine isolates are genotype 3 or 4 whereas the majority of human infections are of genotype 1 and 2 pigs are not alone in being susceptible to hev with various reports of rats lambs dogs cats goats cattle and chickens also being susceptible chicken isolates are only 62 identical in genome sequence with human and swine isolates leading to the suggestion that hev in poultry may represent a distinct genus29 as with swine hev serological studies have shown that approximately 70 of poultry flocks in the united states are infected with hev30 there is no evidence of transmission from poultry to humans but of course this could change especially since work so far has shown isolates are genetically heterogeneous and thus adaptation could readily occur swine in the philippines have been found to act as reservoirs for reston virus a filovirus related to ebola and marburg viruses this was discovered during an unusually severe outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome reston virus was first identified in 1990 among non-human primates imported from the philippines to several primate handling facilities in the united states and europe but in contrast to its african relatives reston virus does not appear to cause human illness although there is ample evidence of reston viral antibodies in primate holding facilities31 and among those working with swine32 pigs are susceptible to human avian and swine influenza viruses and thus play an important role in the epidemiology of human influenza influenza a virus is one of the comparatively few viral respiratory pathogens of pigs currently three subtypes circulate in swine h1n1 h1n2 and h3n2 in contrast to human influenza the properties of swine influenza differ from region to region the predominant subtype in europe is of avian origin most likely introduced into pigs in 1979 from wild aquatic birds such as ducks in contrast there are two distinct subtypes circulating in north america the classical h1n1 subtype introduced into pigs shortly after the 1918 human pandemic and the second a reassortment between h1n1 with either h3n2 or h1n1 viruses domesticated pigs have often been regarded as a mixing vessel for influenza viruses and reassortment of the seven viral gene segments presenting an opportunity for new human strains to arise until 2009 however swine influenza was not regarded as a significant cause of serious disease in humans cases of human infection began to emerge towards the end of april 2009 in what is normally regarded as the influenza season in the northern hemisphere beginning first in mexico the new virus subtype often referred to as swine flu by the popular press spread rapidly throughout the world in a matter of weeks analyses of human isolates quickly showed the unusual nature of this swine-origin influenza virus as being a triple reassortment virus containing genes from avian human and classical swine influenza viruses the ancestors of this virus had probably been circulating in pig populations for over 10 years but had remained undetected33 at the time there was considerable uncertainty as to the pathogenic potential of this virus but data soon showed the severity for humans to be less than that seen with the 1918 pandemic but on a par with the 1957 hong kong pandemic transmissibility appeared higher than is normally the case for seasonal influenza with a higher than normal attack rate importantly younger age groups appeared more susceptible possibly due to partial immunity among older cohorts as a result of being infected during previous pandemics frequent contact with companion animals such as dogs cats and horses provide additional opportunities for the transmission of animal diseases to humans although companion animals have been kept within households over the centuries the number of known emerging infections from such sources is remarkably few dogs in particular have been domesticated for over 8000 years and occupy a prominent position in the daily life of many societies search for the cause of respiratory disease in dogs is thus a particular focus for veterinary virologists and the application of modern molecular screening techniques has uncovered a number of canine homologues of human viruses the discovery of a canine flavivirus distantly related human hepatitis c virus hcv raises some intriguing questions as to the origin of hcv in human populations34 although evidence was found of virus in the canine liver there is as yet no evidence of this canine hepatitis c-like virus causing liver disease in dogs whether or not hcv first emerged from dogs remains speculative but the finding of virus in the respiratory secretions of infected dogs certainly indicates a ready route of transmission to humans the finding of novel flavivirus in dogs has promoted a search for related viruses in other companion animal species by first generating a serological assay using expressed ns3 protein from the canine flavivirus burbelo et al35 have recently found a related virus in eight of 36 seropositive horses belonging to owners in the state of new york there was no supporting evidence of clinical disease among all the animals tested this does not preclude a pathogenic potential for humans of course as with the canine flavivirus described above any persistence of the newly described virus appears to be much lower than the average 50 seen in humans infected with hcv whether or not hcv originates in evolutionary terms from either dogs or humans studies indicate that hcv most likely originated from animal species a conclusion that has hitherto been difficult to accept as hcv does not cause disease in non-human primates as is the case with hepatitis b and other causes of viral hepatitis wild animals held or bred in captivity have long fascinated human societies there is an increasing trend particularly in more affluent economic countries to keep wild animals as pets it is estimated that approximately 350 000 wild caught animals are traded around the world each year adding to the risk of potentially zoonotic infections crossing the species barrier into humans the finding of a new arenavirus in boa constrictors boa constrictor suffering from snake inclusion body disease36 has raised interesting questions as to how common such viruses might be among captive wild animals intriguingly sequence data from this arenavirus showed diversity compatible with a pre-existing relationship between host and virus over time moreover sequences were found homologous to those present in arenaviruses causing severe hemorrhagic fever eg lassa virus but surprisingly the snake arenavirus also shared glycoprotein sequences with filoviruses this would suggest there has been segment recombination at some point in time with a filovirus that subsequently evolved to be the ebola and marburg viruses of today the keeping of small rodents and mammals has been linked to zoonotic disease for many decades lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus transmitted as a result of handling persistently infected hamsters being a prime example the keeping of prairie dogs is common in the united states and indirectly led in 2003 to an outbreak of monkey pox in the state of wisconsin37 this totally unexpected occurrence was the result of housing prairie dogs intended for sale in close proximity to small rodents imported from the african continent most notable rope squirrels funisciurus spp and gambian giant rats cricetomys spp although there were not fatalities among the 81 reported cases it presented an opportunity for the spread of monkey pox into the feral mammal population of north america it remains to be seen if wild animals become a source of monkey pox outbreaks in years to come38 a worrying complication is the emergence of mild human infections due to vaccinia virus successfully used in the control and eradication of smallpox transmitted from herds of diary cattle in brazil and in buffaloes in india these instances of feral vaccinia may have originated from human vaccines being inadvertently introduced into livestock from whence the virus has been reintroduced into their keepers to cause a disease resembling cowpox39 there is also evidence for vaccinia virus infection among black howler allouata caraya and capuchin monkeys cebes apella inhabiting the amazonian rainforest viruses must bind to one or more receptors on the surface of the target cell in order to enter and infect cells new diseases can emerge when viruses evolve the ability to bind to either a new receptor in a novel target host species or use the homologue of an existing receptor in a new species in 2002 an outbreak of sars coronavirus occurred in hong kong and spread to individuals in 37 countries40 there is wide acceptance that sars-cov crossed into the human population of southern china in 2002 from himalayan civets panguma larvata as well as from racoon dogs nyctereutesprocyonoides and chinese ferret badgers melogalemoschata however there is evidence that at least some of these animal infections were the result of cross-transmission in the wet markets of guangzhou and that wild examples of these species caught in the wild did not show evidence of sars-cov infection more exhaustive studies of wild animal populations found sars-cov in chinese horseshoe bats41 however virus from bats could not be isolated directly in human cells adaptation through palm civets or other species seems to be required before adaptation to humans can occur in order to infect humans sars coronavirus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor but no bat coronavirus has been shown to use bat or human ace2 as a viral receptor raising questions on the mechanism used by coronaviruses to make the species jump from bats to humans42 mutations in the ace2 receptor-binding domain of the s spike protein particularly substitutions of lysine to asparagine at residue 479 k479n and serine to threonine at amino acid 487 s487t are both required for adaptation to human cells42 recent evolutionary studies have revealed that bats have coevolved with an as yet unknown factor that drove rapid evolution of the residue of bat ace2 that interacts with sars coronavirus and that ace2 utilization preceded the emergence of sars coronavirus capable of infecting humans this virus could have pre-existed in bats or could have been a newly created virus resulting from recombination between two bat coronavirus43 this phenomenon may be widespread in animalpathogen interactions for example studies on the evolution of transferrin receptors in canine species demonstrate that canine parvovirus is a re-emerged and not a novel pathogen in dogs44 these evolutionary studies of cellular receptors provide valuable insight into the factors that govern the evolution of receptor use in cross-species transmission influenza viruses can emerge in new hosts through adaptation of the surface haemagglutinin structures to receptors on the new host plasma membrane influenza a viruses originate in aquatic birds preferentially binding to sialic acid residues on the surface of avian or human cells however avian influenza viruses have a higher affinity for sialic acid linked to the galactose unit via an 23 bond whereas human influenza viruses have a higher affinity for sialic acid linked via an 26 configuration45 this reflects the pathology of the disease in birds where the main target organ is the gastrointestinal tract whereas sialic acid on the human respiratory tract contains predominantly 26 linkages influenza virus preferentially replicates in non-ciliated cells of the upper respiratory tract during the early stages of the human illness whereas avian viruses have a preference for 23 sialic acid-coated ciliated cells found only in the lower respiratory tract receptor specificity therefore does not necessarily mean that cross-species transmission will give rise to the same pathology as seen in the donor species although much is known regarding the interactions between influenza a viruses and host cell receptors there is considerable subtlety in these interactions that is not yet understood for example influenza h9n2 virus circulates widely in birds throughout asia yet does not seem to cause significant human morbidity despite an increased affinity for sialic acid linked via 26 linkages46 the study of arenaviruses offers an excellent opportunity for revealing the molecular basis of co-evolution of viruses with their rodent host and their potential emergence as a human pathogen phylogenetically arenaviruses are divisible into old world and new world according to geographical origin with the new world arenaviruses subdivided further into three clades a b and c clade b viruses are pathogenic for humans and share with members of clade a an ability to recognize transferrin receptor 1 tfr1 on cell surfaces although both clade a and clade b viruses recognize murine tfr1 only clade b viruses have evolved the capacity to also bind human tfr1 a single amino-acid change in the viral g1 envelope glycoprotein appears sufficient for this expansion of host range to humans intriguingly arenaviruses may have merged as human pathogens by more than one independent pathway of adaptation clade c new world arenaviruses share with old world arenaviruses an affinity for -dystroglycan a highly conserved cell surface protein involved in adhesion to the extracellular matrix in binding -dystroglycan these viruses can bypass the early endocytic pathway through uptake into smooth vesicles47 as with receptor usage small changes to other viral proteins may have a profound outcome on whether or not a new host can support virus replication one example is hepatitis c virus a member of the flaviviridae family attempts to culture the virus in cell monolayers were unsuccessful until a strain from a japanese patient with fulminant hepatitis jfh-1 was isolated this strain contains a modification in the polymerase gene ns5a which for reasons that are incompletely understood has permitted the generation of chimeras representing all of the hcv genotypes that are infectious in culture48 high rates of nucleotide substitution rates exhibited by rna viral genomes ensure that rna viruses can adapt rapidly to changes in the levels of host immunity the availability of suitable vectors and the ecology of any animal reservoir infected mammalian cells are deficient in the necessary repair mechanisms to correct errors in template transcription these errors are preserved if they do not prevent the formation of new infectious virus particles for example there have been multiple independent cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency virus siv from chimpanzees to humans which have given rise to pandemic group m and non-pandemic groups n and o clades of hiv-1 a single amino acid change in the gag-encoded matrix protein m30r is present in these cross-species transmissions furthermore when hiv-1 encoding the gag mutation was passaged in chimpanzees this mutation reverted this provides evidence for host-specific adaptation during the emergence of hiv-1 and identifies the viral matrix protein as a modulator of viral fitness following transmission to the new human host49 a number of rna viruses possess segmented genomes reassortment of individual segments may occur in the event of a single cell being infected simultaneously with two genotypically distinct viruses reassortment event are known to play a major role in the emergence of new influenza virus strains leading to major changes in pathogenicity for animals and humans alike this process is increasingly recognized as occurring among other rna viruses containing structurally distinct genome segments for example the bunyaviruses in 1997 an outbreak of rift valley fever was detected in northeastern kenya and western somalia following a period of abnormal rainfall around 370 human deaths were recorded mainly in the garissa region of kenya surprisingly however there was evidence of rift valley fever virus rfv infection in only 23 of cases the cloning of pcr products revealed the existence of a new recombinant bunyavirus one that contained the l and s rna segments of bunyawera virus and an ill-defined m segment distantly related to ngari virus a bunyavirus previously reported from senegal in 197950 ngari virus is widely distributed across sub-saharan africa and as far south as madagascar the result in the garissa outbreak was the emergence of a new recombinant virus with substantial virulence for humans this new recombinant virus occurred independently of rfv infection during the outbreak the number of infections also the result of environmental factors that equally resulted in an elevation of rfv activity although not a zoonosis the recently described schmallenberg virus of ruminants in europe illustrates how unexpectedly members of the bunyavirus genus within the family bunyaviridae can spread preliminary analyses of the s rna segment show a close relationship between schmallenberg virus and members of the simbu serogroup normally found in asia51 genetic recombination is known to pay an important role in generating new coronaviruses and such events may increase the likelihood of cross-species transmission as well as determine the severity of disease outcome52 this may explain the greater genetic diversity of sars-cov isolated from bats compared to humans and civets there is a marked difference between human sars-cov and bat sars-like coronavirus in the s gene bearing the cellular receptor domain with only 7678 amino-acid identity in the major spike s protein proinflammatory responses also play a pivotal role in determining disease outcome with viruses manipulating host innate immune responses in order to promote entry and dissemination and host cells have also evolved countermeasures that give rise to genetic arms races with both virus and host competing against the other following initial infection of a host cell many host restriction factors recognize viruses and directly inhibit replication hiv and siv are recognized by several host restriction factors in their respective primate hosts tripartite motif-containing protein 5 trim5 is a species-specific host restriction factor that restricts the replication of hiv-1 in old world monkeys such as rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys rhesus trim5 restricts hiv-1 infection by interacting with the hiv-1 capsid at an early stage of infection and is believed to be involved in the innate immune response to retroviral infection recent studies investigating experimental cross transmission of siv from sooty mangabeys have revealed that trim5 exerts selective pressure during the initial stages of cross species transmission to rhesus macaques due to attenuation of infection rather than an outright block to infection53 however rhesus trim5 does not restrict siv isolated from macaques and human trim5 does not restrict hiv-1 infection54 although the introduction of single amino-acid mutation in the spry domain of trim5 can restore its ability to recognize and restrict hiv55 different primate orthologues of trim5 have recognition specificities for different retroviral capsids and infection is only blocked when recognition occurs56 similarly apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3g apobec3g and tetherin are two host proteins that restrict the replication of retroviruses including hiv and siv by inducing degradation of the viral proteins and by inhibiting viral release the retroviral proteins viral infectivity factor and viral protein u counteract apobec3g and tetherin respectively5758 recently a study of four african green monkey subspecies which can be infected with divergent strains of siv highlighted that even in nonpathogenic infection there is ongoing evolution of simian apobec3g in the absence of ongoing disease in response to these changes both natural isolates from long-term infected individuals and viruses from experimentally infected individuals adapt to retarget the host restriction factor59 these studies highlight the ongoing conflict between virus and host and may contribute to the species specificity of closely related retroviruses recent studies have shed light on factors that determine the pathogenicity of siv and hiv-1 in different host species hiv-1 and siv infection of humans and rhesus macaques respectively are associated with chronic immune activation and production of tumor necrosis factor- from macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation60 in contrast in chronically infected sooty mangabeys the macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide is inhibited figure 2 a finding consistent with a suppressed chronic immune activation in non-pathogenic infection that is not observed in pathogenic infections there have been several recent examples of viral subversion of the host innate immune system in order to promote infection and dissemination viruses must cross epithelial and endothelial barriers in order to invade organs such as lung gut and brain which are protected by sheets of polarized cells that restrict the passage of substances across these layers these do not express viral receptors on their apical surfaces human type 5 adenoviruses use two receptors constitutive androstane receptor car and 35 integrin in order to infect airway epithelial cells although the mechanism of infection at the apical surface has been unclear since both viral receptors are not expressed at the apical side of the cells yet both are required for viral infection car and 35 integrin are not normally available for viral binding being a component of tight junctions and the basolateral membranes of polarizedepithelia respectively however macrophages respond to viral infection by secretion of il-8 cxcl8 that in turn triggers the delocalization of 35 from the basolateral membrane to the apical cell surface thus transforming the cell into a potential host for replication61 thus it is conceivable that viruses crossing from one species to another may utilize secondary receptor elements shared between closely related species as a means of initiating infection in a new host in a landmark study everitt and colleagues62 have shown that the action of interferon-inducible trans-membrane protein m3 ifitm3 can profoundly alter the course of influenza virus infection in humans the genotypes of ifitm3 found in hospitalized patients correlated with lower levels of ifitm3 expression leading to uncontrolled virus replication in the lungs and lower respiratory tract disease in those individuals with no acquired immunity to the infecting virus genotype measles virus initially infects macrophages and dendritic cells in the airway before crossing the airway epithelium and infecting lymphatic organs measles virus uses slamcd150 as a viral receptor but this is not expressed on all target cells which led to the notion that another receptor was also used for measles virus infection using well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cell sheets several groups elegantly demonstrated that following measles replication within lymphoid tissue virus uses the junction protein nectin-4 to bind to the basolateral lung side of polarized epithelia where it replicates and disseminates to nave hosts6364 these studies highlight the necessity of using in vitro culture systems that closely mimic the physiology of the cells in vivo65 ebola viruses can effectively inhibit host interferon type i responses mainly due to the inhibitory properties of vp35 macrophage infection induces proinflammatory cytokines promotes endothelial leakage and stimulates bystander apoptosis of lymphocytes although the latter does not abrogate the development of a specific cd8 cytotoxic t-cell response expression of tissue factor on the surface of macrophages triggers a coagulation cascade thus promoting hemorrhage domains on vp35 block the function of the helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 which in concert with melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 are cellular sensors of virus infection and trigger a type i interferon response interestingly the vp35 structures are largely similar between pathogenic ebola virus and the not pathogenic to humans reston virus however the reasons why ebola reston is not pathogenic for humans remain unclear ebola virus vp24 also contributes to the inhibition of innate immunity by preventing the accumulation of antiviral siginal transducers and activators of transcription stat-1 in the nucleus there are some differences between how interferon signaling is suppressed between marburg virus and ebola virus marburg virus blocks both stat-1 and stat-2 activation through the effects of vp40 rather than vp35 as is the case with ebola virus66 recent studies have revealed that lassa virus can also suppress interferon signaling through the c terminal domain of its nucleoprotein which both resembles and functions similar to an endonuclease it can hydrolyze dsrna but not ssrna or dna67 this is the first time a virus has been shown to have dsrna specific exonuclease activity and in addition the first time a virus has been shown to counteract ifn responses by blocking interferon regulatory factor 3 translocation to the nucleus by actually digesting the pathogen-associated molecular pattern there is evidence that ebola and marburg viruses have co-evolved with one or more mammalian reservoirs taylor and colleagues26 have suggested that filoviral gene sequences are present in the genome of small mammals as diverse as shrews and south american marsupials this latter observation indicates that other filoviruses are yet to be discovered in the new world or that south american species harbored ancestral filoviruses that gave rise to present day ebola and marburg viruses outbreaks of emerging diseases vary widely in duration frequency and case numbers some can be predicted as occurring annually for example influenza whereas many decades may elapse between episodes as is the case with marburg virus planning a single integrated strategy against all eventualities is therefore almost impossible a task compounded by considerations as to likely emergence of escape mutant in populations vaccinated against known diseases the emergence of strains resistant to antiviral therapy or even the recycling through livestock of attenuated vaccines designed for use exclusively in humans improved epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases is the foundation for immediate and long-term strategies for combating emerging diseases this needs to be supplemented by adequate training of clinicians and diagnostic microbiologists in all aspects of the control of infectious disease unfortunately cutbacks in available resource have marginalized specific training in emerging infections in many countries as well as limited the availability of containment facilities necessary for the safe handling and characterization of positive isolates this shortfall in capacity is most acute in sub-saharan africa where many serious outbreaks occur although it has to be said that progress has been made most evidently in gabon and uganda where specialized facilities aided by the us centers for disease control now complement local expertise integration with the veterinary community is essential several one medicine programs have been instigated to better serve economically developing nation strengthen their overall capacity to react quickly and effectively in the face of emerging disease outbreaks it is imperative that veterinary scientists are involved in any suspected zoonotic outbreak valuable time was lost in 1999 when the first cases of west nile virus occurred in new york city among both humans and birds68 historically there has been little integration of animal and human public health yet the techniques and methods for diagnosing and controlling infectious disease are similar regardless of affected species difficulties can arise in correctly identifying the cause of a human disease as being zoonotic for many years chronic fatigue syndrome was regarded as being viral in origin a view apparently confirmed when lombardi et al69 reported xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus xmrv as a possible etiological agent this virus was found during a study of human prostate tumor cells that contained integrated dna sequences homologous to retroviruses these workers went on to claim the presence of xmrv in around 100 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome with subsequent estimates of 33 prevalence among blood donors however these results were not reproducible70 and a lack of sequence diversity in presumptive isolates characteristic of retroviruses undergoing transmission from person to person strongly suggested the presence of a contaminant71 this link with xmrv has been retracted but serves to illustrate the inherent difficulties in associating disease with a specific etiological agent objective interpretation of the data was also hindered by public pressure groups frustrated by the scientific communitys apparent lack of progress in defining the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome technology can play a major role in predicting disease emergence as for example the use of satellite imagery to detect changing patterns of vegetation in response to rainfall the use of satellite maps taken over east africa accurately predicted the outbreak of rfv amongst livestock as a consequence of increased vector activity72 the use of the internet has become an essential tool in containing disease outbreaks allowing for rapid dissemination of serological clinical and molecular sequencing data such rapid communications played a vital role in combating the sars outbreak in 2003 and also in identifying the spread of swine-origin h1n1 influenza virus in 2010 time is of the essence in the control of emerging disease outbreaks with delays leading inevitably to an escalation in numbers of cases that can threaten to overwhelm both locally available manpower and capacity73 the immediate closure of hospitals was pivotal in limiting the spread of ebola virus in the original outbreaks in sudan and zaire in 1996 the importance of early recognition and the availability of local expertise has been confirmed recently as this year in uganda where the discovery of the bundibugyo strain of ebola virus in 2000 led to the strengthening of capacity at the virus research institute at entebbe by the us centers for disease control several outbreaks have occurred in uganda over the past decade recent cases of ebola virus in july and august 2012 have been rapidly diagnosed as a result of this regional investment in infrastructure thus preventing its spread to kampala the ugandan capital however outbreaks may spread even in countries fully equipped to deal with infectious disease outbreaks unless there is the foresight to critically review clinical and epidemiological data quickly and instigate the appropriate control measures the slow reaction led in 2003 to the spread of sars virus from hong kong40 emergence of new infectious diseases is not a new phenomenon however it is arguably the rate at which new infections are being discovered that has accelerated in the past half century it is some comfort that emerging viruses linked to disease are invariably newly identified member species within well-characterized virus families but this may change as we discover vast numbers of hitherto uncharacterized viruses in what is now commonly referred to as the virosphere indeed it is reckoned by some that viruses represent the largest proportion of biomass on the planet if one takes into account an almost infinite number of viruses in the oceans if this is the case the human immune system does well to protect the species against a constant challenge from viruses constantly mutating and adapting to the environment and ecosystems around us viruses can evolve faster than mammals by many orders of magnitude being near instantaneous compared to the scale of mammalian adaptation over years and decades this may be less so for arthropod-transmitted viruses where the generation time of the vector is measured in weeks if not days thus emergence of vector-borne diseases represent a major threat in the short term once conditions for adaptation result in emergence and an extension of host range as a consequence as was the case for chikungunya virus in 200557 predicting the rate of virus evolution is difficult however most approachable is the prediction of single point mutations viruses are over-represented among emerging diseases particularly those with rna genomes as their replication results in a higher rate of mutation compared to those with dna genomes considerable data exists for influenza a viruses for example how can the effects of emerging diseases be mitigated a number of criteria need to be addressed table 2 first surveillance is key and for this to be effective there needs to be an effective integration of medical and veterinary public health surveillance systems as vividly illustrated by the incursion of west nile virus into north america in 1999 second effective training in the early diagnosis of disease requires an emphasis on clinicians being skilled in recognizing that the early signs of infection may represent something unique and potentially serious third it is for those that govern communities to recognize and take into account the likely impact of environmental developments on ecosystems and disease emergence taking environmental impact studies beyond conservation of natural habitats and species finally much more needs to be done to understand how viruses overcome the innate immune response when crossing the species barrier considerable international effort is now being made to collect and record samples of viruses and microorganisms from wild animal populations and potential arthropod vectors in order to expand the current molecular databases by making available extensive catalogues of genome sequences it is expected that newly emerging agents would in future be more readily identified and thus control measures put in place much more rapidly once passage between humans becomes the sole route of transmission a virus can no longer be regarded as causing an emerging disease at this juncture a balance has been found between the evolving viral genome and the ability of the human immune response to limit the infective process thus at any one moment in time many emerging diseases can be viewed as in this process of adaptation prior to reaching the typical hostparasite balance a balance between replication and survival of the host in the long term however we need to adopt a holistic approach whereby the drivers of emergence are measured in terms of accelerating those processes of adaptation and co-evolution within ecosystems disease emergence is but one manifestation of the challenge the human race has to meet as our environment is threatened by mankinds use of the resources our planet has to offer the only certainty is that as human societies become ever more grouped in cities and impose ever widening environmental change the emergence of new disease threats from unexpected directions will only increase we must think laterally and always expect the unexpected  illicit wildlife trade wet markets and covid19 preventing future pandemics a aguirre alonso richard catherina hailey frye louise shelley   as the world continues to struggle with the unprecedented ramifications of covid19 two central questions are being asked where did this novel virus come from and how can we prevent future pandemics although there is no definitive answer as to the origins of the virus specialists in the field of immunology and microbiology have suggested that covid19 occurred naturally choudhury 2020 there is significant evidence to suggest that live animal markets or wet markets in wuhan china are the original source of transmission of the virus a major indication is that some of the first patients to test positive for covid19 had connections to the wet markets in wuhan broad 2020 p 3 additionally the causative virus known as sarscov2 is a betacoronavirus that originated in bats much like sars and mers diseases centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2020 an examination into these forms of contagion supports the hypothesis that covid19 potentially transmitted from bats to another susceptible animal such as a pangolin and then to a human choudhury 2020 transmission may have occurred at the wildlife market or while en route to the wildlife market where illicitly traded wildlife may be sold it is currently unknown as to precisely how the virus was transmitted from animals to humans but the threat of bats spreading disease has been a longheld concern for public health officials and biological researchers viruses that are transmitted from animals to humans are very dangerous to human life due to the absence of herd immunity among the population this article will explore the connections among the current pandemic liveanimal markets the spread of animalrelated diseases and the illicit wildlife trade and will include a set of policy recommendations prescribed to prevent future outbreaks stemming from these issues to explore the connections between bats and covid19 we reviewed academic literature and scientific journals on bat ecology and conservation emerging zoonotic diseases the covid19 outbreak and wet markets in china we used websites of authoritative bodies such as the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the world health organization who we looked at scholarship and reports addressing the illicit wildlife trade from prominent intergovernmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations such as the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc and traffic we also reviewed reporting from news media outlets such as the new york times and the wall street journal although it could be several years before any final conclusions are drawn on the origins of the covid19 outbreak there is still substantial evidence that it originated in bats biological and epidemiological research indicates that different species of bats may potentially carry multiple strands of the virus very similar to that of the current coronavirus the los angeles times stated scientists estimate that 3 out of 4 new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals su 2020 at the institute of virology in china a horseshoe bat rhinolophus affinis identified as ratg13 was discovered to be carrying a form of coronavirus which shared 96 of its dna with sarscov2 ridley 2020 although this information provides compelling circumstantial evidence it does not prove that this particular species of bat contributed to or assisted in the spread of covid19 however this does not mean that another species of bat does not carry this form of coronavirus that can then be shared with humans in perspective humans share 96 of our genome with chimpanzees bat conservation trust 2020 experts are not certain as to how sarscov2 was transmitted to humans it may have been transmitted through another susceptible animal such as a pangolin the most illegally traded mammal in the world conciatore 2019 past research has shown that bats are central to the dissemination of covidlike diseases among animals and humans although rodents bear the responsibility for spreading the bubonic plague during the fourteenth century bats present a unique danger as reservoirs for zoonotic viruses hosting even more bacteria and diseases than rodents luis et al 2013 p 3 therefore bats have been much studied as transmitters of viruses to humans through close contact or direct consumption humans cause harm to bats not only through consumption but also by contributing to their loss of habitat as a consequence of environmental destruction bats seek new areas to feed sometimes causing them to come into contact with livestock that will be eventually sold in open markets plowright et al 2015 pp 34 additionally habitat destruction can cause bats to shed and contract more viruses further increasing the likelihood that they will transmit disease olival 2016 p 7 bats are frequently stored and sold in wet markets and are often transported alongside large groups of uncommon and illicitly traded animals that are consumed by humans this form of transportation and storage allows the spread of pathogens between bats and different sometimes exotic and rare creatures that can carry and advance diseases under severe stressful situations the concern over pathogens being transferred from bats to humans is widespread not only among public health professionals but also has been much studied by academics the american society for microbiology published a report entitled identification of a novel coronavirus in bats which stated the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus sarscov highlights the importance of virus surveillance in wild animals poon et al 2005 p 2001 it further explains the identification of severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus sarscov in civet cats and other wild animals in live animal markets suggests that this novel human pathogen emerged as a result of an interspecies transmission poon et al 2005 p 2001 this report illustrates how other coronaviruslike illnesses in animals have been previously identified as potential sources of transmission to humans in fact this is not a recent discovery and concerns existed already in 2007 that there was a serious danger to human life a university of hong kong study at that time found that the presence of a large reservoir of sarscovlike viruses in horseshoe bats together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern china is a time bomb cheng lau woo  yuen 2007 p 638 indeed this warning was unheeded and the failure to act on this insight has contributed to the most serious global pandemic in a century this global health crisis originating from zoonotic transmission is not novel in fact over the last 20 years several deadly diseases are thought to have originated from live animal or wet markets wet markets are where fresh meats produce and animals are often stored to be sold in openair environments in close proximity with little to no health safety precautions or sanitation measures these wet markets exist across the world and in china they often contain foreign rare and sometimes endangered species that are sold among other goods by traveling suppliers wet markets facilitate and heavily contribute to the practice of illicit wildlife trade and in turn this practice has led to the spread of zoonotic diseases among the animals and to customers at markets transportation and storage of animals for wildlife trade at these markets enables the spread of diseases from animals to other animals as one science writer reports live meat markets are perfect laboratories for creating new viruses stressed animals shed more viruses and are more susceptible to infections and cages are often stacked on top of each other facilitating exposure nuwer 2020 exotic meats that are traded illegally such as pangolins are less likely to be inspected for health risks and may come into contact with bats while in transit additionally because these rare animals are often from remote areas they may be more likely to carry diseases that humans have never come into contact with hemley 2020 the conditions the live animals are subjected to in wet markets create a petri dish for the spread of diseases in china and in some other asian countries these markets are prevalent because consumers view wet markets as fresher not expensive and providing rare types of creatures that serve as status symbols or are believed to possess unique healing elements daszak olival  li 2020 p 7 yet the spread of disease from the live and exotic animals represents the biggest threat for instance wild carnivores birds reptiles and primates that are traded in these markets carry pathogens from every taxonomic origin therefore pathogens such as newcastle disease can jump from wild to domestic birds and pathogens such as simian foamy virus and chlamydophila psittaci can be transmitted from wild animals to humans gmez  aguirre 2008 p 17 there is a welldocumented history of regional and even global pandemics originating from the transmission of diseases from animals to humans due to the practice of wet markets and illegal wildlife trafficking in april 2020 the united nations un acting head of biodiversity stated countries should move to prevent future pandemics by banning wet markets that sell live and dead animals for human consumption but cautioned against unintended consequences greenfield 2020 public health officials in the united states and around the world have pointed to wet markets and illegal wildlife trading as conduits for the transfer of disease the transference of diseases from animals to humans may transpire through the consumption proximity or mixing of animals or their byproducts typically animals are susceptible to different types of diseases once a strand is introduced into the human population it can be spread from human to human and cause an outbreak or potential public health emergency relatively recent epidemics such as ebola middle east respiratory syndrome mers bird flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and swine flu are all examples of diseases that have originated through the transfer of disease to humans from animals for example the highly pathogenic asian avian influenza a h5n1 virus or bird flu is highly contagious and it occurs when humans come into direct or close contact with infected or already diseased poultry cdc 2018 therefore the significant risk factors for infection include visiting or mixing animals in live poultry markets similarly while the swine flu is sporadic in humans infections are typically the result of exposure to infected pigs within live markets fairs or the pork industry cdc 2019a unfortunately due to the nature of infections there is still a lot of information left unknown about how some of these outbreaks originated in the case of ebola and based on the analyses of similar viruses scientists believe it is animalborne with bats or nonhuman primates such as apes or chimpanzees being the most likely source cdc 2019b another example would be in 2003 when sars broke out in the southern province of guangdong in china experts believe this outbreak is the result of an unknown animal reservoir some experts have suggested bats and the spread occurred through other animals such as civet cats world health organization who 2020 during its initial outbreak sars resulted in more than 8000 cases in over 25 countries similar to sars mers began as the result of a zoonotic virus in saudi arabia although different practices other than wet markets or animal reservoirs led to the outbreak of mers the method of transfer is the same animal to human who 2019 the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases dr anthony fauci insisted on a global closure of wet markets because the current crisis is a direct result of this practice guzman 2020 after the sars outbreak china attempted to institute a similar more stringent ban on wildlife trade but this has eroded over time su 2020 several conservationists and medical professionals including members of the chinese academy of sciences hoped this ban would be permanent but the markets and trade routes returned after the crisis ended who 2020 it is certain that without cooperative comprehensive and enforced policies on wildlife trade and of endangered species such as the pangolin in place there will continue to be a spread of global sickness and international loss of life global law enforcement to address the illegal trading in exotic animals for consumption or possession represents a high priority in preventing future animal to human disease transmission to address this problem countering illicit wildlife trade must be a higher priority of interpol the international police body and of regional and law enforcement bodies but this trade is highly linked to transnational crime that requires corruption to operate therefore there needs to be much more attention paid to dismantling crossnational illicit networks addressing corruption and following the money linked to this trade moreover the role of corporate actors as part of the supply chain for this illicit transit needs much more attention much illicit wildlife trade flows through freetrade zones in asia and they must be held much more responsible for the cargo that goes through their ports shelley 2018 p 193 a targeted ban could be effective and have fewer unintended consequences than an outright ban focusing on the most likely vectors of zoonotic diseases could protect public health without the negative effects of a blanket ban although a ban on wild animal and wet markets would lower the number of opportunities for chinese consumers to come into contact with meat infected with infectious agents there is the chance that underground markets will pop up therefore allowing the sale of a limited category of meat in markets as the chinese government is now considering would preserve peoples access to food an overarching ban could destroy these peoples livelihoods or even lead to a black market facilitated by corruption with even greater risks samuel 2020 enforcement of regulations are essential and inspections must be carried out to ensure that meat from exotic animals is not disguised as meat from domestic animals there are certain aspects of this pandemic that might make a total ban on wet markets politically viable the markets in china were closed temporarily after the sars outbreak in 2003 though this ban did not last long samuel 2020 this time might be different however the sars outbreak resulted in around 800 deaths worldwide while the death toll from covid19 has caused over 432000 deaths as of june 15 2020 with the recommendations of experts and the drastic toll of covid19 shutting down the wet markets may be politically possible even if wildlife markets are banned outreach will be necessary to drive down demand for a black market consumption of wild animals from wet markets is influenced by chinese and asian culture which holds that wild animals and their byproducts have healing powers eating rare animals has also become a status symbol signifying that the consumer is wealthy daszak et al 2020 p 7 in addition chinese culture places a great deal of emphasis on the freshness of the food being consumed this concept of freshness extends to perceptions of food quality healthiness and taste with fresher always being better food from a grocery store is seen as less fresh than food from wet markets some chinese consumers will make trips to easily accessible wet markets every day zhong crang  zeng 2020 p 179 dealing with the underground markets will require convincing people that they should not buy from underground wet markets this could be done through public health outreach campaigns that inform people of the dangers of exotic meats and markets that have live wild animals research has shown that public health outreach campaigns can work the first antismoking campaign given federal funds by the united states government showed impressive results inspiring 18 million smokers to attempt to quit and 104000 to quit for good in 2014 cdc 2016 although there are crucial differences between cigarettes and meats from animal markets in terms of addiction and their places in different cultures the concept may have applicability in convincing people not to buy food from wild animal markets future research by the health medical and environmental community must be combined with research on illicit trade and corruption a transdisciplinary approach has been taken in the one health perspective but this approach has not gone outside the scientific perspective aguirre et al 2019 wilcox aguirre de padua siriaroonrat  echaubard 2019 going forward these barriers among academic disciplines must be bridged to consider all the risks to public health addressing and preventing pandemics requires an array of transdisciplinary research research must focus on the central causes of the spread of zoonotic diseases such as illicit wildlife trade and wet markets public health conservation biology and illicit trade scholars should collaborate on addressing the facets of supply chains corruption and trade that may contribute to zoonotic transmission there will need to be much more work with the business community to follow the supply chains linked to illicit trade in wildlife governments will need to get involved as well and take action to suppress the wildlife trade in order to prevent future outbreaks those who are part of the illicit wildlife trade have not taken off days during this crisis lockdown policies and the changing dynamics of international travel have resulted in multiple changes to the supply chains for illicit wildlife trade trade by air has been slowed due to quarantine regulations and transportation by road has been complicated by roadblocks and checkpoints particularly at borders the trade is still happening by sea however additionally because governments have closed so many national parks poachers have taken the opportunity to go after animals that are not being as closely guarded as before the combination of transportation difficulties and unwatched national parks has led to stockpiling of products in the illicit wildlife trade without addressing these issues now the trade could come roaring back as lockdowns are lifted wildlife justice commission 2020 p 5 this outbreak was caused by an array of factors including the conditions of wet markets the illicit wildlife trade and environmental destruction a multipronged approach will be necessary to make sure this never happens again on the illegal trade aspect policymakers will need to address the source of demand for these products the wet markets shutting down the wet markets or at least strictly regulating them and banning the sale of live wild animals will be necessary to address the problem of zoonotic diseases hopefully this pandemic will convince government officials that these markets need to be dealt with and convince scholars to study the intersection of illicit trade and public health conflicts of interest none declared  analysis on novel coronavirus covid-19 using machine learning methods milind yadav murukessan perumal m srinivas   covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus which has first been originated in wuhan city hubei provinces of china 1 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is a new type of virus family that has not been earlier identified in people the virus seems to be transmitted mostly through the minute respiratory droplets via coughing sneezing or when people interact with each other for some time in close proximity these droplets can then be inhaled or they can land on surfaces that others may come into touch with who can then get contaminate when they contact their eyes mouth or nose the novel coronavirus can live on different surface like few days stainless steel and plastic and few hours cardboard and copper however the amount of viable virus declines over time and may not always be present in sufficient numbers to cause infection in humans the symptoms of this virus can be experienced in between 1 to 14 days from the day of infection from then it has been spreading at the speed of knots giving no time to prepare against a newly identified infectious and notorious virus which have compelled the who to declare covid-19 as a pandemic 3 due to its fast human to human transmission and people got infected in every continent and it had already taken so many lives the statistics and graph for increasing cases active cases have been shown in the figure 1
 symptoms of coronavirus change in severity from having no symptoms at all being asymptomatic to having fatigue cough fever general weakness sore throatmuscular pain and in the most extreme cases sepsis severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndromeand septic shock all potentially leading to death reports show that clinical deterioration can occur quickly often during the 14 days of disease of late anosmia loss of the sense of smell have been reported as a one of the symptom of a coronavirus infection there is already conformation from many regions such as italy china and south korea that patients with committed sars-cov-2 infection have developed anosmiahyposmia in some cases in the absence of any other symptoms still there is no proper treatment drugs or vaccine for coronavirus disease several random drugs are being tried to target the virus on severely affected coronavirus patients however the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomized controlled trials several clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness but results are not yet available as this is a new virus no vaccine is currently available although work on a vaccine has already started by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide it may be months to more than a year before a vaccine has been tested and is ready for use in humans 5 till today covid-19 has been infected the citizens of more than 212 countries leads to 3747356 patients out of which 258970 people had lost their lives and 1250693 people 6 gets recovered but due to the virus bi-phasic nature there may be chances of infection again in those recovered cases due to an insufficient number of test kits ventilators oxygen tanks hospital beds and unavailability of proper treatment or vaccine it is very important to analyze the growth rates of positive cases number of recoveries and other factors that affect the growth of this virus to the same extent proper arrangements can be made to prevent losses of lives and to have proper insights of the condition for example based on the analysis of data the government can have the prior information to the number of cases till a particular day and before that day they can arrange all the necessary medical equipment or which mitigations to be done to prevent losses of lives nowadays machine learning methods have been widely used in healthcare field 7 8 and for having much faster and efficient prediction of covid-19 infected person in this work the support vector regression svr 9 10 11 model is used to solve the four different types of covid-19 related problems the proposed method will be fitted into the dataset containing the total number of covid19 positive cases and the number of recoveries for different countries like mainland china us italy south korea and india and with the help of the proposed method to predict the future number of total cases active cases and recoveries these tasks can help a countryregion to understand the spreading of the virus facilitateaware people start mitigations itll also help that regioncountry to be prepared for whats will happen in the future which may help in saving lives and agony and compare proposed method results with other well know regression models such as simple linear regression polynomial regression 12 and another task containing the weather data for regions like new york citynyc and milano italy to analyze the correlation between different weather parameters and the total number of cases pearsons method is used this will help in understanding the effects of weather conditions on the virus spread support vector machines svm 15 is a supervised learning algorithm this algorithm is used for classification and regression problems svr is based on the same principles as svm for classification ie to find a hyperplane in a d-dimensional space d is the number of features that uniquely classifies the data points svr uses a non-parametric technique which means the output from the svr model does not depend on distributions of the dependent and independent variables svr technique is basically dependent on kernel functions which allows for the construction of a non-linear model without changing the explanatory variables which helps in better interpretation of the resultant model in these algorithms a hyperplane is found that separates the different features the produced model by svm does not depend on the training points that lie outside the margin but instead depends on a subset of the training data as the cost function similarly in svr support vectors find the closest data points and the actual function represented by them we get closest to the actual curve if the distance between the support vectors to the regressed curve is maximum a hyperplane is a function that classifies the points in a higher dimension or other words hyperplanes are the boundaries that help in the classification of the data points if the margin for any hyperplane is maximum then that hyperplane is the optimal hyperplane the points which are closest to hyperplane are called support vector points and the distance of the vectors from the hyperplane are called the margins as shown in figure 2
 farther the support vector points from the hyperplane more is the probability that the points will be correctively classified in their respective region or classes thus the equation of the hyperplane in the d dimension can be given as1zl011x1l2x2l3x3l0i1nlixil0l1txbl1txwhere lil0l1l2
b  biased term l
0 and x  variables kernel is an important part of svr the kernel is a way of computing the dot product of two vectors x and y in some high dimensional feature space kernel trick is used in svr which simply means to replace the dot product of two vectors by the kernel function the outbreak of covid-19 is developing into a major international crisis and its starting to influence important aspects of daily life for example bans have been placed on hotspot countries international manufacturing operations have often had to throttle back production and many goods solely produced in china have been halted altogether in highly affected areas people are starting to stock up on essential goods such that in order to predict how the virus could spread across different countries and regions different regression models were to be used to predict the total number of positive cases the main goal of this task was to build and compare regression models that can predict the progression of the total positive covid 19 cases from different regions that may help mitigation efforts the advantage of doing this would be that we will have an idea about the number that will reach of many cases this will give the idea about the level of spread and in accordance to that the government and the citizens can make proper plans to handle the situation by taking measures to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation and other necessary actions predicting total number of cases in different regions are show in figure 3

countries the predicted values for the total number of cases till day 93 with simple linear regression method is 8733 with the polynomial regression method is 19248 and the proposed svr method is 16283 whereas the actual number of active cases was 18252 the accuracy for simple linear regression polynomial regression and svr were 555  9958  and 996  respectively since no vaccine for the virus has yet been discovered it is important to see how many of the patients will recover from this virus and how and when the epidemic will end the main objective of this task was to predict how many people were going to recover based on old recovery records such that in order to predict how many people will actually recover records for the number of recovered patients across different countries were taken the goal of solving this task helps us to understand how the epidemic will end ie how many patients will recover the advantage of doing this would be that we will have an idea about the number of patients that will recover from the infection from the older known methods since no vaccine or cure is yet discovered and by predicting the time that will be taken by all the patients to recover we will be able to understand how much time will it take to for this pandemic to end to prepare the dataset for this task firstly dates were converted to day number taking 22 jan 2020 as day 1 and 24 april 2020 as day 93 then total number recoveries till that day were extracted region wise in order of day number next the day number and recovery counts were scaled to observe clearer results for different affected countries a linear regression and a polynomial regression model was fitted and visualized to the dataset to predict the number of recoveries of affected patients in that particular region in the polynomial regression model the model was fitted with different polynomial degrees to find which degree curve fits best then in the urge to seek for better results an svr

shows different graphs that represent the rate of transmission of covid19 virus among people of different regions and is plotted with the number of newly found cases on each day on the y-axis and number of days on the x-axis in fig 6a shows the total number of newly found cases per day in mainland china the curve is dropped to zero after a certain point because according to the data no new cases are now found in china the predicted values for the newly found cases for day 93 with simple linear regression method is -505 with the polynomial regression method is -586 and the proposed svr method is 128 whereas the actual number of newly found cases was 0 the accuracy for simple linear regression polynomial regression and svr were 157 3405 and 379 respectively the total number of newly found cases per day in us region is shown in fig 6b the curve is rose to local maxima and is seen to be dropping with the number of days the predicted values for the newly found cases for day 93 with simple linear regression method is 8214 with the polynomial regression method is 3569 and the proposed svr method is 4560 whereas the actual number of newly found cases was 8130 the accuracy for simple linear regression polynomial regression and svr were 634 8993 and 921 respectively in fig 6c shows the total number of newly found cases per day in italy is plotted the curve is rose to local maxima and is seen to be dropping with the number of days the predicted values for the newly found cases for day 93 with simple linear regression method is 5030 with the polynomial regression method is 1920 and the proposed svr method is 2831 whereas the actual number of newly found cases was 3021 the accuracy for simple linear regression polynomial regression and svr were 5733 8351 and 9151 respectively the total number of newly found cases per day in south korea is shown in fig 6d the curve once rose to local maxima for limited time but dropped since then and did not rise with the increment of days the predicted values for the newly found cases for day 93 with simple linear regression method is 114 with the polynomial regression method is 121 and the proposed svr method is 8 whereas the actual number of newly found cases was 10 the accuracy for simple linear regression polynomial regression and svr were 00006 432 and 437 respectively in fig 6e shows the total number of newly found cases per day in india is plotted the curve keeps on rising to attain local maxima the predicted values for the newly found cases for day 93 with simple linear regression method is 920 1643 with the polynomial regression method is and the proposed svr method is 1378 whereas the actual number of newly found cases was 1453 the accuracy for simple linear regression polynomial regression and svr were 594 911 and 911 respectively correlation is a measure of association between two variables and the direction of their relationship the value of the correlation is always lesser than 1 and greater than -1 a value 1 or -1 means a perfect correlation between two variables if the coefficient approaches 0 the relationship between the two variables becomes weaker  sign indicates a positive relationship and - sign indicates a negative relationship most used types of correlations pearson correlation kendall rank correlation spearman correlation and the point-biserial correlation pearson correlation it is the measure of the degree of the relationship between linearly related variables pearson correlation is the most widely used correlation for the pearson correlation both the variables whose correlation is to be found are assumed to be normalized if not normalized then normalization should be performed first also the relationship between both the variables should be a straight line assuming that data is equally distributed about the regression line following is the formula which is used to calculate the pearson r correlation2rnababna2a2nb2b2where r is pearson r correlation coefficient between a b n is number of observations a indicate value of x and b is a value of y to perform this task weather data for new york city us and milan italy were scraped from a weather website 16 17 which consisted of wind speed humidity and temperature for the month of march then the total number of cases in these two cities was plotted on a graph for visualization then using pearson method correlation was found between wind speed humidity temperature and total covid-19 cases then to visualize the effects of correlated weather conditions and total positive cases different graphs were plotted figure 7
represents the correlation information of new york city and figure 7 a shows the correlation table for temperature humidity wind speed and total positive covid19 cases in new york city it is observed from the correlation chart the number of positive cases is mostly affected by temperature and humidity with relatively high modulus of coefficient value as 0382491 and 0354686 respectively 
figure 7 b is a graph that shows how temperature and total positive cases in nyc affect each other and it is observed that the number of positive cases decreases with an increase in temperature 
figure 7 c is a graph that shows how humidity and total positive cases in nyc affect each other and it is observed that the number of positive cases increases with an increase in humidity 
figure 8
represents the correlation information of milan city and figure 8 a shows the correlation table for temperature humidity wind speed and total positive covid19 cases in milan city it is observed from the correlation chart the number of positive cases is mostly affected by humidity as the modulus of coefficient value is 0290203 and for wind speed and humidity modulus of the correlation coefficient is 0350877 in figure 8 b a correlation graph between humidity and wind speed in milan city is plotted in this figure dark coloured bubbles show lower number of positive cases whereas lighter bubbles represent comparatively higher number of positive cases it is observed that despite the small correlation that exists between these variables it is found that the number of affected cases increases per day while humidity decreases in figure 8 c a correlation graph between total positive cases and humidity in milan city is plotted in this figure dark-colored bubbles show lower wind speed whereas lighter bubbles represent comparatively higher wind speed it is observed that as the number of positive cases increases and the humidity decreases the wind speed gradually increases with the number of positive cases in figure 8 d a correlation graph between total positive cases and wind speed in milan city is plotted it is observed that wind speed and total positive cases have a nonlinear shape covid-19 causes illness in humans and creates severe damage in the lungs however covid-19 has killed many people in the entire world in this paper we are proposing the support vector regression method based navel coronavirus analysis on five different tasks main novelty in this work is instead of simple regression line we use supported vectors also to get better classification accuracy the main advantage of doing the first task would be that this will give the idea about the level of spread and in accordance to that the government and the citizens can make proper plans to handle the situation by taking measures to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation and other necessary actions with the help of second task will have an idea about how well the mitigations are working and the actions that are taken till date how effective are they or how many cases have been prevented by this the advantage of doing third task would be that we will have an idea about the number of patients that will recover from the infection from the older known methods since no vaccine or cure is yet discovered and by predicting the time that will be taken by all the patients to recover we will be able to understand how much time will it take to for this pandemic to end with fourth task we will be able to observe and analyze how fast or slow the virus is spreading among regions therefore which areas needs more attention or not finally fifth task create better surroundings for the infected patient to reduce the spread the people can also be warned if they should avoid humidity or not and high temperature or no pearsons correlation method gives a clear understanding of the correlation between the spread and weather conditions in all tasks the proposed support vector regression method based coronavirus analysis given promising results compared with other well know regression methods on the first four tasks author agreement statement we the undersigned declare that

transforming work styles in an era of infectious disease mitsuru kodama   due to the impact of the novel coronavirus covid-19 an infectious disease the digital transformation of work styles around the world is progressing faster than ever with corona and looking ahead to after corona corporate strategies all over the world face major transformations in these circumstances the digital shift transformation in the historical nature of work styles has been garnering a lot of attention with demands for it rising in societies while the spread of iot ai 5 g cloud services etc is further accelerating this digital transformation kodama 2019 notably the global scale of the spread of infections of the novel coronavirus have increased demands for cloud services all over the world notable in this expansion is the demands for video conferencing tools which are indispensable for telework for example interest in online learning eg kodama 2000 2001b and online healthcare eg kodama 2001a 2002 is rapidly increasing while the implementation of telework and online seminars etc is rapidly progressing - after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus the stock price of zoom nasdaq zm a video conferencing software developer rose sharply in china ali baba offered chat and video conferencing services to 10 million companies free of charge and increased its memberships to 200 million other companies such as tencent bytedance that offers tiktok and baidu provide telework tools for free to over 18 million companies with a total of more than 300 million people teleworking in this way demand for video conferencing tools has skyrocketed all over the world - downloads of zoom in the second week of march 2020 were 14 times higher in the united states 20 times higher in the uk 27 times higher in spain and 55 times higher in italy compared to the average downloads per week in the fourth quarter of the last year from before the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid-19 to the present after the 2003 sars outbreak to the present the authors research team analyzed the use of collaboration systems such as various video conferencing tools and business chat in global corporations in europe the united states and asia that use these systems proactively through qualitative research methods such as ethnography participant observation action research and in-depth case studies prior research has shown that various it-related functions for information management it infrastructure and planning can bring performance benefits to businesses eg lu  ramamurthy 2011 mithas ramasubbu  sambamurthy 2011 although there has not been any detailed reportage on the various effects on business of particular it applications such as collaboration systems this article proposes new knowledge and research and practical implications from four research streams for exploratory research on the forms of usage and business effects business process reform such as product development supply chain reform decision making process reform knowledge management new business model creation etc of collaboration systems entailing a high degree of interaction communications collaboration etc among people and organizations the use of collaboration systems is spreading all over the world with typical corporate and organizational it applications such as business chat slack microsoft teams etc cloud services zoom spark skype for business etc video conferencing systems web conferencing systems and unified communications uc notably collaboration system video communications functions have been included in iphone facetime and various social networking services and can be seen across not only the b2b and b2c areas but also widely in c2c as shown in fig 1
 various collaboration systems are positioned on two factorfunctional axes video and audio quality and cost vs level of media integration these systems have common functions for video communications information sharing and groupware calling etc in this product positioning corporations organizations that pursue agility and efficiency in business processes skillfully use these systems depending on the characteristics of their business portfolios in particular in the business education healthcare and welfare fields new forms of services are beginning to become popular that entail the use of interactive video communications eg clifton jo longo  malone 2017 du plessis 2008 dub bourhis  jacob 2006 maher  prescott 2017 piotrowski  robertson 2017 zournazis  marlow 2015 video communications offer high-potential communications methods that hold promise for application in a wide range of fields from corporations through to families and individuals - not only do they faithfully convey image information but have also long held promise as methods of personal expression and as usage in the education healthcare and welfare fields or even for fusion with art etc eg kodama 1999  in addition in the era of global 5 g mobile telecommunications systems there are also hopes for these video communications functions as crucial broadband communications platforms for generating new virtual and video businesses using ai and iot on the marketing side the use of collaboration systems such as video conferencing tools has become increasingly popular for various reasons such as facilitating global business speeding up work in dispersed projects sharing information inside and outside of companies speeding up decision-making human resource development by conveying or passing on certain skills and know-how as well as improving motivation by facilitating telework and emergency measures for natural disasters etc eg bond-barnard fletcher  steyn 2016 garca-lvarez 2015 wolfe 2007 conversely on the technical side technical developments such as the spread of broadband such as the new 5 g mobile telecommunications systems voip and multimedia over ip lower costs the emergence of simple video conferencing systems and video conferencing software higher image quality and higher functionality hd telepresence 4 k 8 k etc a variety of mobile terminals smartphones tablets etc unified communications uc cloud services and aiiotvr have also caused video conferencing tools to spread these synergistic effects between the market and technology sides have further reduced the costs of collaboration system products services and communications including video conferencing tools which driven expansion of usage by users resulting in further cost reduction and market expansion - positive feedback triggered by these network effects kodama 2007 2009 see fig 2
 in information system is research covering it applications which are these collaboration systems the relationship between it and business process agility has been taken up as a key research theme luftman et al 2013 roberts  grover 2012 prior research has shown that various it-related functions for information management it infrastructure and planning can bring performance benefits to businesses eg lu  ramamurthy 2011 mithas et al 2011 moreover there has also been a focus on the impacts on business process agility of it resources and capabilities and their resultant impacts on business performance chen et al 2014 tallon  pinsonneault 2011 it capabilities are the ability to mobilize and deploy it-based resources in combination or copresent with other resources and capabilities bharadwaj 2000 p 171 and as mentioned in prior research various aspects of it functions security and risk management communication data management application infrastructure it equipment management and it architecture have been studied a series of empirical studies in prior research have shown that it functions are an important enabler of corporate performance eg chen et al 2014 kim shin kim  lee 2011 mithas et al 2011 queiroz tallon sharma  coltman 2018 in contrast much research has argued that the main impacts of it occur at the business process level and those impacts can be aggregated to the corporate level barua kriebel  mukhopadhyay 1995 melville kraemer  gurbaxani 2004 mithas et al 2011 setia sambamurthy  closs 2008 tallon 2007 this suggests that it process-level impacts are important in understanding the relationship between it functionality and corporate performance also some studies have reported that technical it skills and it infrastructure flexibility do not affect process performance ray muhanna  barney 2005 this research states that shared knowledge impacts process performance and further relaxes the links between it technology and process performance shared knowledge is developed and accumulated by organizations over a long period thus a shared body of firm-specific knowledge able to effectively utilize new it applications eg video conferencing tools takes years to evolve into numerous joint development projects therefore the development of shared knowledge is a path-dependent socially complex process accordingly such knowledge is valuable as the essence of building it capabilities and as long as it is unevenly spread among companies it has the potential to be an important factor in differentiating it capabilities because it cannot be imitated at low cost this research suggests the importance of the knowledge-based view eg grant 1996 nonaka  takeuchi 1995 of knowledge management etc in analysis of it capabilities in addition kodama 2013a  who discusses the relationship between in-house and external usage of video conferencing tools it applications with knowledge communities offers 2 insights first is the diverse communications and collaboration effects of video conferencing tools real-time communications and collaboration functions which combine and modify video voice and data bring about unique usage forms and structures in a company accordingly video conferencing tools promote the learning process which increases the frequency and type of meetings and the number of temporary meetings and meetings outside companies for specific projects etc second is the formation of new business networks and the promotion of knowledge creation activities nonaka  takeuchi 1995 with the implementation of video conferencing tools brand new dialogue and meetings begin new information flows and practitioners are moved to practical activities video conferencing tools increase meetings and facilitate the flattening of in-house organizations also as video conferencing tools enable communications without the participants having to physically go to a predetermined meeting location they enable design of new business networks that are free of constraints on speech ba and communities of practice in particular it has been clarified that regular meeting bodies develop into knowledge communities such as communities of practice weinger 1999 dependent on specific contexts and that video conferencing tools facilitate the formation maintenance and development of knowledge communities inside and outside of companies kodama 2020 however kodama 2013a 2013b does not clarify the characteristics of knowledge communities that use video conferencing tools the kinds of strategic and organizational contexts in which these knowledge communities use these tools how new business networks are formed or how knowledge creation activities are facilitated nevertheless from the theoretical and practical perspectives there is great significance in clarifying how video conferencing tools usage has positive effects on knowledge creation and more broadly knowledge management in what strategic and organizational contexts and with what type of it capabilities the micro organization view as the community-based view eg kodama 2013b wenger 1999 which is organizational analysis at the micro level has been suggested as important in this research existing research to date has focused on functional competencies especially management capabilities related to it infrastructure eg it infrastructure functions and infrastructure services such as security and risk management communications data management it equipment management it architecture etc however as it infrastructure has become commoditized it can no longer be a differentiating factor for companies eg bhatt  grover 2005 little attention has been paid to researching it application-related functions such as video conferencing tools nor attention paid to how businesses can profit from it applications nazir  pinsonneault 2012 however even it applications that enable companies to differentiate themselves tend to lose value quickly due to market changes the fast pace of it innovation and shortened it application lifecycles ross weill  robertson 2006 vessey  ward 2013 in such circumstances to realize the real benefits of it companies must build new it application portfolios that entail the positioning and utilization forms of various video conferencing tools as shown in fig 1 and pour continuous efforts into developing new systems and applications with new usage forms kappelman mclean johnson  torres 2016 luftman et al 2012 2013 however it is mostly unclear how capabilities of corporations utilizing it applications such as video conferencing tools affect agility efficiency and even creativity and to what degree agility impacts on corporate performance research on the impacts of it capabilities on new product development npd eg pavlou  el sawy 2006 is consistent with the aforementioned argument that the main impact of it occurs at the process level and shows that competitive advantage for npd is related to it-enabled dynamic capabilities teece 2007 and functional competencies various existing research to date has examined the functional competencies of it although there is very little research on dynamic it capabilities using it applications such as video conferencing tools that have a high potential to enable corporate differentiation strategy koch 2010 pavlou  el sawy 2011 roberts  grover 2012 notably almost nothing is known about the impacts of it-enabled dynamic capabilities for video conferencing tools on process-level outcomes such as business process agility and efficiency accordingly it is suggested that the micro strategy view as the dynamic capabilities view teece 2007 2014 teece pisano  shuen 1997 is important for the analysis of it capabilities in light of the above prior research reviews this article identifies some important remaining research issues - specifically the following three points1prior research on it applications has been limited to investigation at the macro corporate or business unit level2prior research does not clarify how it capabilities impact agility or efficiency or creativity at the micro organizational level or at the team or business community level nor does it clarify the mechanics of how changes to agility are brought about at the micro process level3it tools investigated in prior research cover a wide range of technical fields such as infrastructure systems and application systems but prior research does not clarify specifically what types of individual it tools eg collaboration systems such as video conferencing tools are involved in the above contexts of 1 and 2
 therefore from the above perspectives as a new approach to research of it capabilities longitudinal process level analysis and consideration of micro-it strategies and organizational dynamism that integrate the four research streams of not only the conventional information system-view but also the aforementioned knowledge-based micro organization community-based and micro strategy views the dynamic capabilities view are required in light of existing research to date as a new perspective in this era of infectious disease confronting humanity that cannot be avoided this article proposes the necessity to explore the business and social impacts of collaboration systems such as video conferencing tools - important corporate it applications that have a high potential to bring about differentiation strategies in particular it capabilities to effectively utilize video conferencing tools at the micro process level of organizations and teams business community level must be clarified because collaboration systems greatly affect the business processes and knowledge sharing of people and organizations community level and furthermore greatly affect innovation as knowledge creation activities as a future research approach from the perspective of integrating the four research streams of the main prior research of the micro strategy-view eg dynamic capabilities framework exploitation and exploration micro organization-view eg communities of practice strategic communities knowledge-based view eg knowledge creation knowledge integration knowledge boundaries and information systems-view it capabilities it will be necessary to extract a new theoretical framework and knowledge by clarifying it capabilities black boxing see fig 3
 the integration of these four research streams will be extremely important in clarifying black boxing of the micro-strategic and organizational dynamism of it-enabled dynamic capabilities and more broadly it-enabled capabilities this black boxing has not been clarified in detail in prior research with its focus on quantitative studies using statistical analysis the idea that companies incorporate it applications such as collaboration systems into the core of their it strategy not only to transform their businesses but also to generate new business models will become increasingly important over the long term in this era of infectious diseases facing humanity the it capabilities of companies that utilize it applications to innovate business and bring about new business models are not limited to the technical functions such as hardware and software of it applications but are heavily reliant on the knowledge especially intangible assets possessed by people and organizations kodama 2013a put differently the most important sources of lasting competitive advantage for most companies are not it applications themselves but condensed wisdom as the high-level knowledge of ideas know-how and skills to develop combine and use new it applications knowledge is also the dynamic capabilities eg kodama 2018 2019 teece 2007 2014 that underpin dynamic innovation activities to continuously bring about new creations while it applications themselves are the methods of acquiring various new knowledge and achieving innovation in other words capabilities that enable people and organizations to generate new knowledge through interaction with it applications are driving forces that maximize the use of it applications transform business and bring about new business innovation as practical implications this article proposes that clarification of the usage patterns and management effects of it applications such as collaboration systems will help companies to generate and develop it-enabled knowledge communities kodama 2013b within and between companies including customers and bring about strengthened corporate competitiveness in practice strategic use of collaboration systems has the potential to facilitate corporate exploration activities and enhance the creativity of people and organizations on the other hand strategic use of these systems also has the potential to facilitate enhanced speed efficiency and upgrades and improvements of existing knowledge utilization in corporate exploitation activities corporations organizations must take the with corona and after corona environments as an opportunity for self-transformation and further drive digital transformation of work styles this article has proposed new knowledge research and practical implications integrating four research streams for exploratory research on the usage forms and business effects of collaboration systems which have a high degree of interaction with humans and organizations  managing through a crisis managerial implications for business-to-business firms carsten lund pedersen thomas ritter c anthony di benedetto   the world is in crisis locked in the throes of an unprecedented economic lockdown as the coronavirus in the specific form of covid-19 takes its toll on societies around the world at the time of this writing countries have shut down vital parts of their administrations education sectors and economic activities whole industries including hospitality and air transport have essentially stopped functioning the closing of national borders limits free movement to a minimum anyway the related humanitarian crisis came as a shock to many people and new restrictions together with enormous challenges represent a discontinuity breaking from the past reality furthermore this crisis features immense volatility making it nearly impossible for people to imagine all the potential invisible dangers and visible changes simply put we are living in truly disruptive times but the notion of disruption is not new it has long appeared in business discussions executives have tried to understand be prepared for and even initiate disruption markides 2006  not every disruptive idea follows the trajectory predicted by clayton christensen 1997  but substantial energy has gone into preparing for business model disruptions along the lines that he outlined markides 2006  for example executives have tried to anticipate disruptions due to digital advances eg  platform business models eg cusumano  gower 2002  or new market orientations eg kumar scheer  kotler 2000  yet these types of preemptive measures were made obsolete by the truly unexpected and far-reaching disruptions created by the highly contagious virus which has already prompted a greater downturn than might have been caused by any alternative business models innovative technologies new forms of working or the like at the same time another important difference pertains to predicted durations digitalization the internet and connectivity through the internet-of-things have prompted shifts that remain relevant although the immediate crisis created by covid-19 may have mainly a temporary effect followed by a partial return to normal times its broader impact may be persistent and significant leading to the new normal of a post-corona world in this shift health care service preparedness must be rethought supply chain risk needs to be redefined online meetings likely will become the norm and virtual teaching may represent a critical channel for education in this sense the virus crisis represents a temporary discontinuity after which some aspects will return to their prior status even as others might be changed forever furthermore the crisis could have negative consequences for firms if not managed appropriately coombs 2007  while also offering an opportunity as long as decision makers perceive it accurately brockner  james 2008  for example environmental crises often have fueled human development throughout history revealing how they can create opportunities if exploited and managed wisely bernstein 1996  some firms that perform well during the crisis may gain new customers but other firms appear destined to fail how firms respond and react during the crisis arguably will determine at least partially whether they thrive with some notable exceptions eg andersson  mattson 2010 hermes  mainela 2014 naidoo 2010  business-to-business marketing has not remarkably focused much on crisis management yet business-to-business firms have encountered a multitude of recent crises from the dotcom bubble to the financial crisis to 911 to sars to brexit furthermore the covid-19 crisis is unprecedented to the extent that we lack any established knowledge to comprehend its consequences fully similar to most sectors in society business-to-business marketers lack relevant guidance for meeting the enormous challenges they face both marketing in general and industrial marketing management in particular have a long-standing tradition of conducting research with and for practitioners and accordingly we believe the business-tobusiness academic marketing community is uniquely well qualified to address these issues and concerns using theory-based reasoning to help support executives efforts to manage their firms through the covid-19 crisis and beyond against this backdrop we prepare this special issue on managing crises by establishing its strong focus on the managerial implications for business-to-business firms as derived from business-to-business marketing research we have two primary aims with this special issue first we seek to offer business-to-business marketing practitioners theorybased insights and practical implications the business-to-business marketing community can and should bridge the rigor-relevance divide by providing research-based practical implications that rest on a strong foundation of theory in accordance with this aim the articles in this issue can be purposefully shorter than typical industrial marketing management articles written mainly to argue for practical implications rather than make novel theoretical contributions second we emphasize the continuing need for crisis management research from a business-to-business marketing perspective such a research tradition should prove highly relevant for practitioners facing crises now and in the future in the next section we thus define a crisis and explicate its different phases following a discussion of crisis management in general we summarize some crisis management contributions in industrial marketing management we also zoom in on some selected theories and their implications for business-to-business marketers during the covid-19 era which in turn suggest areas for further research thus this editorial offers a terminology for discussing crisis and crisis management describes the current state-of-the-art of business-to-business crisis management literature and offers a research agenda  the word crisis has its etymological origins in the greek word krisis which denotes choice decision or judgment paraskevas 2006  it often refers to a turning point or decisive moment implying that the historical meaning of the word might presume some individualism rather than determinism in terms of reacting in volatile situations-at least connoting choice at some decisive moment however uses of the term also vary by disciplines and contexts see table 1  for example holsti 1978 p 41 refers to crisis as a much overused term which has become burdened with a wide range of meanings some of them quite imprecise and smith 2005 p 319 acknowledges that the definition of crisis has generated considerable debate within the academic literature and there is no real collective acceptance about the precise meaning of the term crisis management literature in particular comprises at least two main strands separated by their views of crisis as either an event or a process eg jaques 2009  a crisis could be a singular large event but it may be more useful to conceive of sequences of sub-events over time as in a process perspective such that this approach synthesizes elements from both strands of research accordingly we define a crisis as a sequence of events that can have substantial negative consequences if not managed appropriately in this definition an event is a delimited element with a beginning and end such that it happens or takes place internal or self-inflicted events can also be distinguished from external or other-inflicted and natural events eg faulkner 2001  depending on whether the event has been triggered by for example the organization itself eg misconduct poor work safety standards environmental damage bribery tax evasion or external factors eg a supplier has inappropriate safety measures hurricane ruins production facilities the phrase substantial negative consequences indicates the extent or importance of the damage caused by the event for organizations a crisis typically implies substantial losses interruptions to their usual operations or even bankruptcy we include the notion of being managed appropriately to acknowledge that organizations can act during a crisis even if they cannot influence its course or prevent a crisis completely they can react in more or less optimal ways to its occurrence in this way the substantial negative consequences might be due to the crisis but they also could result from inappropriate management by the firm alternative terms such as risk and disaster similarly appear in prior literature also with varying definitions from our perspective risk refers to the probabilistic likelihood that a crisis may happen and its often economic impact therefore we conceive of risk as preceding the crisis disaster generally pertains to nature-induced crises such as storms floods fires earthquakes or major accidents in this view a disaster is a subcategory of crisis a crisis can arise as different types eg natural disaster self-inflicted and take different forms eg immediate sustained extant crisis literature features debates about how many stages constitute a crisis lifecycle eg faulkner 2001 fink 1986 roberts 1994  following coombs 2007  a narrow view of crisis in its simplest form has three phases pre-crisis crisis and post-crisis however issue management literature also suggests the need to consider the period immediately before the crisis when it is building to identify and proactively react to early symptoms eg ansoff 1975  as well as immediately after the crisis when extraordinary activities are required to handle its effects before a new normal stage might be achieved which ensures that the firm learns and prepares madsen 2009  we therefore suggest a model with five distinct phases for our crisis analysis pre-crisis normality emergence occurrence aftermath and post-crisis normality  table 2  each phase differs in its content duration and managerial opportunities according to jaques 2007  a key weakness of crisis lifecycle models is that they presume the crisis is linear with events that take place in sequential fashion the coronavirus pandemic appears likely to run counter to such models considering the expert predictions that it might flare up again in intensity after a first wave and ebb therefore linear lifecycle models must be viewed as purposefully simplified to establish a conceptual approach rather than as natural laws alternatively the process could be described in circular terms similar to disaster management cycles with an emphasis on reducing the impact of rather than preventing disasters such that the management of a disaster entails continua of interrelated interdependent activities jaques 2007  framing crisis entails specifying who actor experiences what kind of crisis content at what speed pace an actor might be an individual group organization or network of organizations wilke  ritter 2006  these actors tend to exhibit significant differences in their perceptions and the impacts they experience for example the coronavirus crisis has affected countries framed as groups of individuals and of organizations at different times starting in china then hitting italy before denmark the different countries accordingly have entered different crisis phases at the moment china seemingly reached the end of crisis occurrence or beginning of crisis aftermath italy was in the midst of its crisis occurrence and some eastern european countries were in crisis emergence there may also be withincountry differences in the united states the coronavirus spread early in the state of washington then was noted in new york before it spread to other major cities in parallel different business units within a company can experience the impact of a crisis differently perhaps due to their geographical locations or work content for example in a single hospital the emergency units are extremely busy but elective surgery and dentistry units even may have closed to understand the content factor it is helpful to consider sub-crises for the coronavirus for example we might distinguish five different subcrises 1 contagion because of the highly contagious character of the virus many people may be infected this sub-crisis may entail several solutions such as a developing a vaccine so that spreading is irrelevant b eliminating the virus so there is no virus to spread c allowing the virus to spread and let humans develop immunity through infection eg 60 of the population is infected which table 1 definitions of a crisis authors definition of a crisis pauchant  mitroff 1992 p 15  disruption that physically affects a system as a whole and threatens its basic assumptions its subjective sense of self its existential core selbst 1978   in faulkner 2001 any action or failure to act that interferes with an organizations ongoing functions the acceptable attainment of its objectives its viability or survival or that has a detrimental personal effect as perceived by the majority of its employees clients or constituents table 2 phases of crisis may result in flock immunity and d social distancing the first two options are not immediately available the third option would evoke a different sub-crisis with devastating implications therefore governments mainly are implementing social distancing at large scales to limit spreading 2 covid-19 severe respiratory problems threaten peoples lives and require intensive health care thus this sub-crisis is concentrated among the approximately 5-10 of infected people its solution requires finding a treatment that can mitigate the most severe health problems to help patients survive and retain their health the current solution admits patients with severe symptoms to intensive care which leads to the next sub-crisis 3 healthcare the capacity of health care systems may be insufficient patients with severe respiratory problems need intensive care including respiratory support but the equipment to provide it is limited this limitation drives many political decisions without any alternative solutions to the contagion or covid-19 sub-crises many countries are stuck with social distancing measures which leads to another sub-crisis 4 business models social distancing has led to closures of multiple industries travel eg airlines airports cruise lines holiday destinations train and bus operators hospitality hotels restaurants bars theme parks concert and event operators sports professional leagues sports clubs olympic games betting firms fitness clubs brick-and-mortar retail retail outlets shopping centers consumer goods producers and service providers hair salons barbers theaters concert halls pet groomers even if they remain in operation many businesses have had to change their business models significantly such as letting employees work from home nearly all firms and adopting online solutions eg schools and universities counseling and therapists public administration for firms that are experiencing growth due to social distancing measures other elements of the business model sub-crisis become relevant such as capacity limitations for online retailers or the network capacity of internet providers 5 economic the massive lockdown of businesses and countries threatens a recession including high levels of unemployment longterm spending decreases in consumer investment markets more bankruptcies and so forth the distinctions among different sub-crises are important in that each one might have entered a different phase and they also are perceived differently by the various actors for example people with mild symptoms might be primarily affected by the contagion sub-crisis at an industry level the short-and long-term impacts of the business model sub-crisis vary by sector such that many universities managed to complete the spring 2020 semester by moving to an all-online format but the curtailment of campus visits by graduating high school students seems likely to affect their future enrollments different countries also might suffer distinct impacts of a potential recession finally the pace of a crisis captures elapsed time in different phases ritchie 2004 and parsons 1996 distinguish immediate crises little or no warning so the crisis emergence phase is very short emerging crises slower to develop with a long emergence phase and sustained crises which may last for months or years over a very long crisis existence phase each phase can vary from shorter or longer as illustrated in fig 1 steeper gradients indicate higher pace  the current coronavirus crisis or rather the five related sub-crises should be viewed through all of these lenses it originated with little or no warning immediate crisis short emergence in china actor it followed a gradual pattern with regard to contagion and healthcare across the world emerging crisis longer emergence and it seems likely to result in a subsequent economic crisis possibly sustained crisis as well as possibly recurring in waves of continued contagion cyclical crisis phases start over again as noted by jaques 2009  crisis management emerged after world war ii gaining prominence in the wake of the cuban missile crisis as well as legitimacy as a formal management discipline after the 1982 tylenol poisoning scandal and the 1986 chernobyl disaster tylenol sales rebounded to pre-crisis levels due to the swift and effective handling of this product harm crisis by the manufacturer johnson  johnson to this day it offers an excellent teachable example of effective crisis management latson 2014  some authors delimit crisis management to efforts after a crisis happens eg bundy pfarrer short  coombs 2017  whereas others regard the pre-crisis phases as important jaques 2009 or else highlight post-crisis learning as essential madsen 2009  we define crisis management as the intentional handling of a crisis in all five phases see table 3  in the pre-crisis phase organizations can seek to prevent if possible predict or prepare for it the differences among these three options are not trivial in some cases organizations have sufficient agency to prevent a crisis proactively bundy et al 2017 even propose that a pre-crisis prevention phase includes organizational preparedness changes to the culture design or structure can prevent system breakdowns and stakeholder relationships good relationships with stakeholders may reduce crisis likelihood these options are available prior to the crisis in the coronavirus setting they would have involved prevention through improved health standards or immediate containment of the first patients and preparation in the form of increased precautionary measures and health care capacity the prediction phase also can be informed by knights 1921 definition of risk as events for which the outcome can be assessed using probabilistic outcomes but uncertainty as hard to quantify such that its assessment cannot rely on any probabilistic foundation for example we know that pandemics arise with some regularity risk but the current version is exerting many unknown impacts on businesses for which we have no historical basis uncertainty nor does statistical regularity necessarily imply predictability makridakis hogarth and gaba 2010 use the analogy of earthquakes to establish this distinction we can predict that in the next 35 years the earth will experience about 44 earthquakes with intensities of around 75 on the richter scale but seismologists cannot say when or where they will hit beyond noting earthquake-prone zones in such cases it may be a better approach to prepare for different contingencies like firefighters who cannot predict when or where a fire will be but can train for different contingencies and stay ready in the emergence phase a crisis has not yet started but its signs become clearer depending on the pace actors still have a chance to prepare and potentially postpone the occurrence of the crisis with respect to the healthcare sub-crisis some countries increased their health care capacity as much as possible just before the crisis started there after having noted the developments in other countries where covid-19 had struck earlier other actors took other measures to postpone the crisis such as lockdowns once covid-19 began to spread health officials recommended such measures to flatten the curve and minimize its expansion noting that otherwise the health care system would be inundated and ultimately result in higher mortality rates once the crisis hits the organization must initiate crisis responses which usually are tactical in nature involving communication see coombs 2007  actions and behaviors consider actions by british petroleum after its texas city refinery explosion in 2005 or deepwater industrial marketing management 88 2020 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 horizon explosion in 2010 andersen  andersen 2014  depending on the type of crisis the organization might take different forms of action even if the crisis is unpredictable and evolving decision makers must follow logical patterns which can be especially difficult with insufficient or conflicting data furthermore decision-making speed is often of paramount importance suggesting that many decisions must be made on an ad hoc basis during the crisis this point is not to suggest that decisions are not thought through though simple cost-benefit analyses effect models stakeholder analyses and trade-off models are often involved yet decision making also cannot fall victim to analysis paralysis and accordingly the need for strong leadership tends to be pronounced in this phase of a crisis bundy et al 2017 emphasize the importance of crisis leadership characteristics of leaders and how they frame the crisis and stakeholder perceptions how organizations influence how stakeholders perceive and react to crises once the crisis is over there is a time immediately afterward focused mainly on rebuilding destroyed property eg after natural disasters giving overworked response units some time off eg fire brigades health care professionals and catching up on postponed or disrupted work flows eg replenishment of warehouses in this phase extraordinary activities precede the new normality the main managerial activities include recovery and remedy after the crisis the organization tries to revert to business as usual coombs 2007  in a simple categorization of outcomes after a crisis the organization may be worse off unable to revert to its original position might revert to its original position or it could be better off come out of the crisis strengthened in some way the outcome likely depends on different systems such organizations networks or countries systems that worsen after a crisis are vulnerable those that bounce back are resilient and systems that grow stronger due to adversity are antifragile manyena 2006 taleb 2012  these systemic outcomes also relate to how well-prepared organizations were in the pre-crisis phase and their actions during the three central crisis phases  finally the post-crisis phase offers opportunities to learn and prepare for future crises resulting in a circular process of crisis management in which the post-crisis becomes the pre-crisis bundy et al 2017 accentuate the importance of organizational learning from a crisis to identify new competitive opportunities as well as social evaluations of how stakeholders perceive the organizations responses to the crisis industrial marketing management has featured articles on crisis from its very beginning-the first article on the environmental crisis was published in volume 1 issue 2 may 1972  a search produced a list of 260 papers that include the word crisis after clearing the list of articles that do not address crisis management and instead refer to unrelated forms of crisis eg laari-salmela mainela  puhakka 2019 which pertains to identity crisis we are left with eight articles that offer theoretical contributions and managerial implications regarding how organizations can deal with a crisis table 4  this lack of research on crisis management is surprising particularly in light of the opportunities to study it following events such as 911 the 2008 financial crisis or the opening of the berlin wall overall business-to-business marketing research has paid little attention to crisis management and accordingly has offered few insights for marketing practice this situation needs to change we need a better understanding of how 2015 crisis emergence crisis occurrence conceptual ansoff 1975  dane and pratt 2007 business marketing business relationships and networks marketing orientation and so forth can contribute to managing ongoing crises and post-crisis realities overall the treatment of crisis and crisis management in industrial marketing management has been eclectic fragmented and partial there is no established stream of literature in the journal though-despite the importance and regular occurrence of crises and the potential impact of the marketing field on crisis management by leveraging market intelligence to predict and prepare and relationship management of particular interest for crisis occurrence for example considering the lack of meaningful contributions in marketing literature we might speculate that each crisis is unique and unpredictable such that findings from one cannot transfer to another but we do not subscribe to this view existing theories based on studies of previous crises can help organizations navigate through and after any crisis we thus outline some theoretical insights and managerial implications pertaining to the current coronavirus crisis as noted the aim of this special issue is to develop more detailed qualified managerial implications from theories to inform practitioners the field of business-to-business marketing contains theories relevant to the current crisis especially if applied to adapt some established constructs or models in addition we need established constructs to cross-pollinate these insights with evidence from crisis management fields we propose that managers should divide each crisis into relevant sub-crises analyze and include all five phases in their decision making in particular by thinking of the aftermath and post-crisis phases in their early decision making eg  ensure their future preparedness and learn how to prepare for and predict potential future crises the long tradition of studying value propositions in industrial marketing eggert ulaga frow  payne 2018 offers pertinent opportunities for combined considerations of resilience such a cohesive view might address whether a firms value propositions can remain resilient during a crisis in some industries the value propositions have been virtually unaffected in others existing value propositions have mostly disappeared similarly resilience notions could inform business network models to consider for example how business networks might increase or decrease resilience to a crisis networks can impose rigidity but also enhance responsiveness to external shocks for example hkansson  ford 2002  a key focus of business-to-business marketing is on salespeople and the management of boundary-spanning personnel walter 1999  industrial marketing has a plethora of insights to provide moreover the role of salespeople is likely to change substantially during a crisis personal meetings once seemed critical to maintaining business relationships but digital sales channels take priority during the covid-19 crisis how does such a shift affect business relationships and the quality of sales encounters organizations also need to provide new training to ensure their representatives online sales skills although we lack detailed insights into the specifics established literature and anecdotal examples may provide some tentative guidelines for these efforts rq2 how do relationships and relationship management change during a crisis and what impacts do they have on relationship outcomes during and after the crisis the empowerment of salespeople is critical to customer relationships and job autonomy enhances both employee and customer satisfaction anderson  huang 2006  employee autonomy also increases agility and creativity to help the firm be responsive and innovative in uncertain and dynamic environments pedersen 2019  the pandemic has created a completely uncertain environment so employees may need to take unconventional measures to manage their business relationships it is not unreasonable to anticipate that decentralizing decision power to salespeople salesperson autonomy will provide a more appropriate management model for sales channels in table 4 articles on crisis published in industrial marketing

crisis management industrial marketing management 88 2020 314-322 this era early evidence has shown that the haier group reached fullscale operations soon after the start of the pandemic when most manufacturers were just starting to open again partly due to its very decentralized set-up 1 for haier autonomy created resilience rq3 how does salespeople autonomy relate to crisis resilience other key topics in recent business-to-business marketing have involved omnichannel efforts and digitalization  omnichannel capabilities and the digitalization of business models arguably increase resilience in business models if an organizations business model and communication channels already had gone digital and been integrated prior to the crisis it is reasonable to hypothesize that this organization has shown greater resilience than its competitors without such expanded capabilities the coronavirus crisis provides verisimilitude for these popular topics in industrial marketing as well as a natural experiment for investigating these topics further rq4 how do business models eg digitalization omnichannel change during a crisis and what are the long-term effects of such changes the theory of disruption christensen 1997 cites three fundamental conditions first a new offering must initially perform worse than existing market offerings from incumbents in terms of performance second incumbents improve their market offerings to meet the most demanding customers needs along a sustaining trajectory and thus overshoot the needs of mainstream and low-end customers third the disruptive offering develops over time to meet the needs of mainstream customers better than an over-engineered incumbent offering and takes over major market share if not the whole market although the coronavirus pandemic is not disruptive in the sense of christensens 1997 theory it can help accentuate disruptive processes in established business markets in particular it certainly has put pressure on several established high-end solutions for example personal business meetings with customers have been replaced by video conferences typically seen as low-end low quality interaction modes even if the high-end option is not being disrupted per se by the low-end option the unavailability of high-end meetings provides a foothold for the online meetings to disrupt customer relationships as exemplified by the rapid growth in the use of zoom and other online meeting platforms after the crisis we anticipate that video conferences may retain a significant market share even if they seem unlikely to fully replace personal meetings as such the situation is not a true disruption in the christensen 1997 sense but it certainly is a troubling outcome for certain industries eg travel hospitality during and after the crisis to which extent does a crisis infuse disruption into a market the current coronavirus crisis is unique in terms of the number of fatalities its global reach and its economic impact however crises in general are not special they are a regular part of business as kash and darling 1998 p 179 note it is no longer a case of if an organization will face a crisis it is rather a question of when what type and how prepared the organization is to deal with it likewise anytime you ie managers are not in crisis you are instead in pre-crisis fink 1986 p 7  it is therefore of paramount importance that the businessto-business marketing community develops a better understanding of crisis management in industrial firms and business-to-business markets we have outlined some promising research avenues which is not meant to imply that the list is exhaustive or covers all of the many interesting aspects of crisis management for business-to-business marketing it merely highlights that there are ample research opportunities-and that industrial marketing management hopefully will be a platform for sharing and debating such contributions for here and now this special issue comprises 19 contributions of what executives should consider based on business-to-business marketing theories while we were astonished by the small number of crisis management studies already published in industrial marketing management we were evenly overwhelmed by the many submissions offered by authors from around the world in total we received 73 submissions on a call-for-papers that only offered about six weeks for preparing a contribution in order to offer a timely special issue we created a high-speed reviewing process with two reviewers and co-editor approval with an average turn-around time of only six days only papers with requests for minor revisions were invited to the next round to keep our set deadline targets this meant that a number of papers with potentially great contributions had to be referred to resubmitting a developed paper at a later point in time-thus there are great papers under development and there is a promising pipeline for developing a crisis management stream in the business-to-business marketing literature we are proud to present 19 contributions in this special issue-from many different corners of the business-to-business marketing literature-and with four clear overarching managerial imperatives for executives in business-to-business firms fig 2  and what is the impact of the crisis on our business model ritter  pedersen  2 think allocentric a crisis should not lead to egocentric thinking as this will not only destroy opportunities during the crisis but also in the aftermath and post-crisis era businesses can only thrive in a society if they take an active part in developing it sheth big challenges can be best solved together and openly chesbrough we are very thankful to all authors who have contributed in such fast and dedicated fashion we do hope that this special issue is of inspiration to fight the impact of the coronavirus on businesses and markets and we know that there are more insights on their way the coronavirus crisis presents enormous challenges to research and practice of business-to-business marketingbut also offers huge opportunities that we can and should explore and exploit together   coronaviruses an overview of their replication and pathogenesis helena maier jane erica bickerton paul britton anthony fehr r stanley perlman   coronaviruses covs are the largest group of viruses belonging to the nidovirales order which includes coronaviridae arteriviridae mesoniviridae and roniviridae families the coronavirinae comprise one of two subfamilies in the coronaviridae family with the other being the torovirinae the coronavirinae are further subdivided into four genera the alpha beta gamma and delta coronaviruses the viruses were initially sorted into these genera based on serology but are now divided by phylogenetic clustering all viruses in the nidovirales order are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses they all contain very large genomes for rna viruses with some viruses having the largest identified rna genomes containing up to 335 kilobase kb genomes other common features within the nidovirales order include 1 a highly conserved genomic organization with a large replicase gene preceding structural and accessory genes 2 expression of many non-structural genes by ribosomal frameshifting 3 several unique or unusual enzymatic activities encoded within the large replicasetranscriptase polyprotein and 4 expression of downstream genes by synthesis of 3 nested sub-genomic mrnas in fact the nidovirales order name is derived from these nested 3 mrnas as nido is latin for nest the major differences within the nidovirus families are in the number type and sizes of the structural proteins these differences cause significant alterations in the structure and morphology of the nucleocapsids and virions coronaviruses contain a non-segmented positive-sense rna genome of 30 kb the genome contains a 5 cap structure along with a 3 poly a tail allowing it to act as an mrna for translation of the replicase polyproteins the replicase gene encoding the non-structural proteins nsps occupies two-thirds of the genome about 20 kb as opposed to the structural and accessory proteins which make up only about 10 kb of the viral genome the 5 end of the genome contains a leader sequence and untranslated region utr that contains multiple stem loop structures required for rna replication and transcription additionally at the beginning of each structural or accessory gene are transcriptional regulatory sequences trss that are required for expression of each of these genes see subheading 43 on rna replication the 3 utr also contains rna structures required for replication and synthesis of viral rna the organization of the coronavirus genome is 5-leader-utr-replicase-s spike-e envelope-m membrane-n nucleocapsid-3 utr-poly a tail with accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3 end of the genome fig 1 the accessory proteins are almost exclusively nonessential for replication in tissue culture however some have been shown to have important roles in viral pathogenesis 1
 coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters of approximately 125 nm as depicted in recent studies by cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy 2 3 the most prominent feature of coronaviruses is the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion these spikes are a defining feature of the virion and give them the appearance of a solar corona prompting the name coronaviruses within the envelope of the virion is the nucleocapsid coronaviruses have helically symmetrical nucleocapsids which is uncommon among positive-sense rna viruses but far more common for negative-sense rna viruses coronavirus particles contain four main structural proteins these are the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins all of which are encoded within the 3 end of the viral genome the s protein 150 kda utilizes an n-terminal signal sequence to gain access to the er and is heavily n-linked glycosylated homotrimers of the virus encoded s protein make up the distinctive spike structure on the surface of the virus 4 5 the trimeric s glycoprotein is a class i fusion protein 6 and mediates attachment to the host receptor 7 in most coronaviruses s is cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease into two separate polypeptides noted s1 and s2 8 9 s1 makes up the large receptor-binding domain of the s protein while s2 forms the stalk of the spike molecule 10 the m protein is the most abundant structural protein in the virion it is a small 2530 kda protein with three transmembrane domains 11 and is thought to give the virion its shape it has a small n-terminal glycosylated ectodomain and a much larger c-terminal endodomain that extends 68 nm into the viral particle 12 despite being co-translationally inserted in the er membrane most m proteins do not contain a signal sequence recent studies suggest the m protein exists as a dimer in the virion and may adopt two different conformations allowing it to promote membrane curvature as well as to bind to the nucleocapsid 13 the e protein 812 kda is found in small quantities within the virion the coronavirus e proteins are highly divergent but have a common architecture 14 the membrane topology of e protein is not completely resolved but most data suggest that it is a transmembrane protein the e protein has an n-terminal ectodomain and a c-terminal endodomain and has ion channel activity as opposed to other structural proteins recombinant viruses lacking the e protein are not always lethal although this is virus type dependent 15 the e protein facilitates assembly and release of the virus see subheading 44 but also has other functions for instance the ion channel activity in sars-cov e protein is not required for viral replication but is required for pathogenesis 16 the n protein constitutes the only protein present in the nucleocapsid it is composed of two separate domains an n-terminal domain ntd and a c-terminal domain ctd both capable of binding rna in vitro but each domain uses different mechanisms to bind rna it has been suggested that optimal rna binding requires contributions from both domains 17 18 n protein is also heavily phosphorylated 19 and phosphorylation has been suggested to trigger a structural change enhancing the affinity for viral versus nonviral rna n protein binds the viral genome in a beads-on-a-string type conformation two specific rna substrates have been identified for n protein the trss 20 and the genomic packaging signal 21 the genomic packaging signal has been found to bind specifically to the second or c-terminal rna binding domain 22 n protein also binds nsp3 18 23 a key component of the replicase complex and the m protein 24 these protein interactions likely help tether the viral genome to the replicasetranscriptase complex rtc and subsequently package the encapsidated genome into viral particles a fifth structural protein the hemagglutinin-esterase he is present in a subset of -coronaviruses the protein acts as a hemagglutinin binds sialic acids on surface glycoproteins and contains acetyl-esterase activity 25 these activities are thought to enhance s protein-mediated cell entry and virus spread through the mucosa 26 interestingly he enhances murine hepatitis virus mhv neurovirulence 27 however it is selected against in tissue culture for unknown reasons 28 the initial attachment of the virion to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the s protein and its receptor the sites of receptor binding domains rbd within the s1 region of a coronavirus s protein vary depending on the virus with some having the rbd at the n-terminus of s1 mhv while others sars-cov have the rbd at the c-terminus of s1 29 30 the s-proteinreceptor interaction is the primary determinant for a coronavirus to infect a host species and also governs the tissue tropism of the virus many coronaviruses utilize peptidases as their cellular receptor it is unclear why peptidases are used as entry occurs even in the absence of the enzymatic domain of these proteins many -coronaviruses utilize aminopeptidase n apn as their receptor sars-cov and hcov-nl63 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor mhv enters through ceacam1 and the recently identified mers-cov binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 dpp4 to gain entry into human cells see table 1 for a list of known cov receptors
 following receptor binding the virus must next gain access to the host cell cytosol this is generally accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of s protein by a cathepsin tmprrs2 or another protease followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes s protein cleavage occurs at two sites within the s2 portion of the protein with the first cleavage important for separating the rbd and fusion domains of the s protein 31 and the second for exposing the fusion peptide cleavage at s2 fusion generally occurs within acidified endosomes but some coronaviruses such as mhv can fuse at the plasma membrane cleavage at s2 exposes a fusion peptide that inserts into the membrane which is followed by joining of two heptad repeats in s2 forming an antiparallel six-helix bundle 6 the formation of this bundle allows for the mixing of viral and cellular membranes resulting in fusion and ultimately release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm the next step in the coronavirus lifecycle is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic rna the replicase gene encodes two large orfs rep1a and rep1b which express two co-terminal polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab fig 1 in order to express both polyproteins the virus utilizes a slippery sequence 5-uuuaaac-3 and an rna pseudoknot that cause ribosomal frameshifting from the rep1a reading frame into the rep1b orf in most cases the ribosome unwinds the pseudoknot structure and continues translation until it encounters the rep1a stop codon occasionally the pseudoknot blocks the ribosome from continuing elongation causing it to pause on the slippery sequence changing the reading frame by moving back one nucleotide a -1 frameshift before the ribosome is able to melt the pseudoknot structure and extend translation into rep1b resulting in the translation of pp1ab 32 33 in vitro studies predict the incidence of ribosomal frameshifting to be as high as 25  but this has not been determined in the context of virus infection it is unknown exactly why these viruses utilize frameshifting to control protein expression but it is hypothesized to either control the precise ratio of rep1b and rep1a proteins or delay the production of rep1b products until the products of rep1a have created a suitable environment for rna replication 34 polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab contain the nsps 111 and 116 respectively in pp1ab nsp11 from pp1a becomes nsp12 following extension of pp1a into pp1b however -coronaviruses do not contain a comparable nsp1 these polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into the individual nsps 35 coronaviruses encode either two or three proteases that cleave the replicase polyproteins they are the papain-like proteases plpro encoded within nsp3 and a serine type protease the main protease or mpro encoded by nsp5 most coronaviruses encode two plpros within nsp3 except the -coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov which only express one plpro 36 the plpros cleave the nsp12 nsp23 and nsp34 boundaries while the mpro is responsible for the remaining 11 cleavage events next many of the nsps assemble into the replicasetranscriptase complex rtc to create an environment suitable for rna synthesis and ultimately are responsible for rna replication and transcription of the sub-genomic rnas the nsps also contain other enzyme domains and functions including those important for rna replication for example nsp12 encodes the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp domain nsp13 encodes the rna helicase domain and rna 5-triphosphatase activity nsp14 encodes the exoribonuclease exon involved in replication fidelity and n7-methyltransferase activity and nsp16 encodes 2-o-methyltransferase activity in addition to the replication functions other activities such as blocking innate immune responses nsp1 nsp16-2-o-methyl transferase nsp3-deubiquitinase have been identified for some of the nsps while others have largely unknown functions nsp3-adp-ribose-1-phosphatase nsp15-endoribo-nuclease nendou for a list of non-structural proteins and their proposed functions see table 2 interestingly ribonucleases nsp15-nendou and nsp14-exon activities are unique to the nidovirales order and are considered genetic markers for these viruses 37
 viral rna synthesis follows the translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes viral rna synthesis produces both genomic and sub-genomic rnas sub-genomic rnas serve as mrnas for the structural and accessory genes which reside downstream of the replicase polyproteins all positive-sense sub-genomic rnas are 3 co-terminal with the full-length viral genome and thus form a set of nested rnas a distinctive property of the order nidovirales both genomic and sub-genomic rnas are produced through negative-strand intermediates these negative-strand intermediates are only about 1  as abundant as their positive-sense counterparts and contain both poly-uridylate and anti-leader sequences 38 many cis-acting sequences are important for the replication of viral rnas within the 5 utr of the genome are seven stem-loop structures that may extend into the replicase 1a gene 3942 the 3 utr contains a bulged stem-loop a pseudoknot and a hypervariable region 4346 interestingly the stem-loop and the pseudoknot at the 3 end overlap and thus cannot form simultaneously 44 47 therefore these different structures are proposed to regulate alternate stages of rna synthesis although exactly which stages are regulated and their precise mechanism of action are still unknown perhaps the most novel aspect of coronavirus replication is how the leader and body trs segments fuse during production of sub-genomic rnas this was originally thought to occur during positive-strand synthesis but now it is largely believed to occur during the discontinuous extension of negative-strand rna 48 the current model proposes that the rdrp pauses at any one of the body trs sequences trs-b following this pause the rdrp either continues elongation to the next trs or it switches to amplifying the leader sequence at the 5 end of the genome guided by complementarity of the trs-b to the leader trs trs-l many pieces of evidence currently support this model including the presence of anti-leader sequence at the 3 end of the negative-strand sub-genomic rnas 38 however many questions remain to fully define the model for instance how does the rdrp bypass all of the trs-b sequences to produce full-length negative-strand genomic rna also how are the trs-b sequences directed to the trs-l and how much complementarity is necessary 49 answers to these questions and others will be necessary to gain a full perspective of how rna replication occurs in coronaviruses finally coronaviruses are also known for their ability to recombine using both homologous and nonhomologous recombination 50 51 the ability of these viruses to recombine is tied to the strand switching ability of the rdrp recombination likely plays a prominent role in viral evolution and is the basis for targeted rna recombination a reverse genetics tool used to engineer viral recombinants at the 3 end of the genome following replication and sub-genomic rna synthesis the viral structural proteins s e and m are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum er these proteins move along the secretory pathway into the endoplasmic reticulumgolgi intermediate compartment ergic 52 53 there viral genomes encapsidated by n protein bud into membranes of the ergic containing viral structural proteins forming mature virions 54 the m protein directs most proteinprotein interactions required for assembly of coronaviruses however m protein is not sufficient for virion formation as virus-like particles vlps cannot be formed by m protein expression alone when m protein is expressed along with e protein vlps are formed suggesting these two proteins function together to produce coronavirus envelopes 55 n protein enhances vlp formation suggesting that fusion of encapsidated genomes into the ergic enhances viral envelopment 56 the s protein is incorporated into virions at this step but is not required for assembly the ability of the s protein to traffic to the ergic and interact with the m protein is critical for its incorporation into virions while the m protein is relatively abundant the e protein is only present in small quantities in the virion thus it is likely that m protein interactions provide the impetus for envelope maturation it is unknown how e protein assists m protein in assembly of the virion and several possibilities have been suggested some work has indicated a role for the e protein in inducing membrane curvature 5759 although others have suggested that e protein prevents the aggregation of m protein 60 the e protein may also have a separate role in promoting viral release by altering the host secretory pathway 61 the m protein also binds to the nucleocapsid and this interaction promotes the completion of virion assembly these interactions have been mapped to the c-terminus of the endodomain of m with ctd of the n-protein 62 however it is unclear exactly how the nucleocapsid complexed with virion rna traffics to the ergic to interact with m protein and become incorporated into the viral envelope another outstanding question is how the n protein selectively packages only positive-sense full-length genomes among the many different rna species produced during infection a packaging signal for mhv has been identified in the nsp15 coding sequence but mutation of this signal does not appear to affect virus production and a mechanism for how this packaging signal works has not been determined 22 furthermore most coronaviruses do not contain similar sequences at this locus indicating that packaging may be virus specific following assembly virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis it is not known if the virions use the traditional pathway for transport of large cargo from the golgi or if the virus has diverted a separate unique pathway for its own exit in several coronaviruses s protein that does not get assembled into virions transits to the cell surface where it mediates cellcell fusion between infected cells and adjacent uninfected cells this leads to the formation of giant multinucleated cells which allows the virus to spread within an infected organism without being detected or neutralized by virus-specific antibodies coronaviruses cause a large variety of diseases in animals and their ability to cause severe disease in livestock and companion animals such as pigs cows chickens dogs and cats led to significant research on these viruses in the last half of the twentieth century for instance transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv cause severe gastroenteritis in young piglets leading to significant morbidity mortality and ultimately economic losses pedv recently emerged in north america for the first time causing significant losses of young piglets porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev mostly leads to enteric infection but has the ability to infect the nervous system causing encephalitis vomiting and wasting in pigs feline enteric coronavirus fcov causes a mild or asymptomatic infection in domestic cats but during persistent infection mutation transforms the virus into a highly virulent strain of fcov feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv that leads to development of a lethal disease called feline infectious peritonitis fip fip has wet and dry forms with similarities to the human disease sarcoidosis fipv is macrophage tropic and it is believed that it causes aberrant cytokine andor chemokine expression and lymphocyte depletion resulting in lethal disease 63 however additional research is needed to confirm this hypothesis bovine cov rat cov and infectious bronchitis virus ibv cause mild to severe respiratory tract infections in cattle rats and chickens respectively bovine cov causes significant losses in the cattle industry and also has spread to infect a variety of ruminants including elk deer and camels in addition to severe respiratory disease the virus causes diarrhea winter dysentery and shipping fever all leading to weight loss dehydration decreased milk production and depression 63 some strains of ibv a -coronavirus also affect the urogenital tract of chickens causing renal disease infection of the reproductive tract with ibv significantly diminishes egg production causing substantial losses in the egg-production industry each year 63 more recently a novel coronavirus named sw1 has been identified in a deceased beluga whale 64 large numbers of virus particles were identified in the liver of the deceased whale with respiratory disease and acute liver failure although electron microscopic images were not sufficient to identify the virus as a coronavirus sequencing of the liver tissue clearly identified the virus as a coronavirus it was subsequently determined to be a -coronavirus based on phylogenetic analysis but it has not yet been verified experimentally that this virus is actually a causative agent of disease in whales in addition there has been intense interest in identifying novel bat covs since these are the likely ancestors for sars-cov and mers-cov and hundreds of novel bat coronaviruses have been identified over the past decade 65 finally another novel family of nidoviruses mesoniviridae has been recently identified as the first nidoviruses to exclusively infect insect hosts 66 67 these viruses are highly divergent from other nidoviruses but are most closely related to the roniviruses in size they are 20 kb falling in between large and small nidoviruses interestingly these viruses do not encode for an endoribonuclease which is present in all other nidoviruses these attributes suggest these viruses are the prototype of a new nidovirus family and may be a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses the most heavily studied animal coronavirus is murine hepatitis virus mhv which causes a variety of outcomes in mice including respiratory enteric hepatic and neurologic infections these infections often serve as highly useful models of disease for instance mhv-1 causes severe respiratory disease in susceptible aj and c3hhej mice a59 and mhv-3 induce severe hepatitis while jhmv causes severe encephalitis interestingly mhv-3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade 68 most notably a59 and attenuated versions of jhmv cause a chronic demyelinating disease that bears similarities to multiple sclerosis ms making mhv infection one of the best models for this debilitating human disease early studies suggested that demyelination was dependent on viral replication in oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord 69 70 however more recent reports clearly demonstrate that the disease is immune-mediated irradiated mice or immunodeficient lacking t and b cells mice do not develop demyelination but addition of virus-specific t cells restores the development of demyelination 71 72 additionally demyelination is accompanied by a large influx of macrophages and microglia that can phagocytose infected myelin 73 although it is unknown what the signals are that direct immune cells to destroy myelin finally mhv can be studied under bsl2 laboratory conditions unlike sars-cov or mers-cov which require a bsl3 laboratory and provides a large number of suitable animal models these factors make mhv an ideal model for studying the basics of viral replication in tissue culture cells as well as for studying the pathogenesis and immune response to coronaviruses prior to the sars-cov outbreak coronaviruses were only thought to cause mild self-limiting respiratory infections in humans two of these human coronaviruses are -coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 while the other two are -coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 were isolated nearly 50 years ago 7476 while hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 have only recently been identified following the sars-cov outbreak 77 78 these viruses are endemic in the human populations causing 1530  of respiratory tract infections each year they cause more severe disease in neonates the elderly and in individuals with underlying illnesses with a greater incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in these populations hcov-nl63 is also associated with acute laryngotracheitis croup 79 one interesting aspect of these viruses is their differences in tolerance to genetic variability hcov-229e isolates from around the world have only minimal sequence divergence 80 while hcov-oc43 isolates from the same location but isolated in different years show significant genetic variability 81 this likely explains the inability of hcov-229e to cross the species barrier to infect mice while hcov-oc43 and the closely related bovine coronavirus bcov are capable of infecting mice and several ruminant species based on the ability of mhv to cause demyelinating disease it has been suggested that human covs may be involved in the development of multiple sclerosis ms however no evidence to date suggests that human covs play a significant role in ms sars-cov a group 2b -coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak that occurred in 20022003 in the guangdong province of china it is the most severe human disease caused by any coronavirus during the 20022003 outbreak approximately 8098 cases occurred with 774 deaths resulting in a mortality rate of 9  this rate was much higher in elderly individuals with mortality rates approaching 50  in individuals over 60 years of age furthermore the outbreak resulted in the loss of nearly 40 billion dollars in economic activity as the virus nearly shut down many activities in southeast asia and toronto canada for several months the outbreak began in a hotel in hong kong and ultimately spread to more than two dozen countries during the epidemic closely related viruses were isolated from several exotic animals including himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs 82 however it is widely accepted that sars-cov originated in bats as a large number of chinese horseshoe bats contain sequences of sars-related covs and contain serologic evidence for a prior infection with a related cov 83 84 in fact two novel bat sars-related covs have been recently identified that are more similar to sars-cov than any other virus identified to date 85 they were also found to use the same receptor as the human virus angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 providing further evidence that sars-cov originated in bats although some human individuals within wet animal markets had serologic evidence of sars-cov infection prior to the outbreak these individuals had no apparent symptoms 82 thus it is likely that a closely related virus circulated in the wet animal markets for several years before a series of factors facilitated its spread into the larger population transmission of sars-cov was relatively inefficient as it only spread through direct contact with infected individuals after the onset of illness thus the outbreak was largely contained within households and healthcare settings 86 except in a few cases of superspreading events where one individual was able to infect multiple contacts due to an enhanced development of high viral burdens or ability to aerosolize virus as a result of the relatively inefficient transmission of sars-cov the outbreak was controllable through the use of quarantining only a small number of sars cases occurred after the outbreak was controlled in june 2003 sars-cov primarily infects epithelial cells within the lung the virus is capable of entering macrophages and dendritic cells but only leads to an abortive infection 87 88 despite this infection of these cell types may be important in inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines that may contribute to disease 89 in fact many cytokines and chemokines are produced by these cell types and are elevated in the serum of sars-cov infected patients 90 the exact mechanism of lung injury and cause of severe disease in humans remains undetermined viral titers seem to diminish when severe disease develops in both humans and in several animal models of the disease furthermore animals infected with rodent-adapted sars-cov strains show similar clinical features to the human disease including an age-dependent increase in disease severity 91 these animals also show increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and reduced t-cell responses suggesting a possible immunopathological mechanism of disease 92 93 while the sars-cov epidemic was controlled in 2003 and the virus has not since returned a novel human cov emerged in the middle east in 2012 this virus named middle east respiratory syndrome-cov mers-cov was found to be the causative agent in a series of highly pathogenic respiratory tract infections in saudi arabia and other countries in the middle east 94 based on the high mortality rate of 50  in the early stages of the outbreak it was feared the virus would lead to a very serious outbreak however the outbreak did not accelerate in 2013 although sporadic cases continued throughout the rest of the year in april 2014 a spike of over 200 cases and almost 40 deaths occurred prompting fears that the virus had mutated and was more capable of human-to-human transmission more likely the increased number of cases resulted from improved detection and reporting methods combined with a seasonal increase in birthing camels as of august 27th 2014 there have been a total of 855 cases of mers-cov with 333 deaths and a case fatality rate of nearly 40  according to the european center for disease prevention and control mers-cov is a group 2c -coronavirus highly related to two previously identified bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 95 it is believed that the virus originated from bats but likely had an intermediate host as humans rarely come in contact with bat secreta serological studies have identified mers-cov antibodies in dromedary camels in the middle east 96 and cell lines from camels have been found to be permissive for mers-cov replication 97 providing evidence that dromedary camels may be the natural host more convincing evidence for this comes from recent studies identifying nearly identical mers-covs in both camels and human cases in nearby proximities in saudi arabia 98 99 in one of these studies the human case had direct contact with an infected camel and the virus isolated from this patient was identical to the virus isolated from the camel 99 at the present time it remains to be determined how many mers-cov cases can be attributed to an intermediate host as opposed to human-to-human transmission it has also been postulated that human-to-camel spread contributed to the outbreak mers-cov utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 as its receptor 100 the virus is only able to use the receptor from certain species such as bats humans camels rabbits and horses to establish infection unfortunately for researchers the virus is unable to infect mouse cells due to differences in the structure of dpp4 making it difficult to evaluate potential vaccines or antivirals recently a small animal model for mers-cov has been developed using an adenoviral vector to introduce the human dpp4 gene into mouse lungs 101 this unique system makes it possible to test therapeutic interventions and novel vaccines for mers-cov in any animal sensitive to adenoviral transductions in most cases of self-limited infection diagnosis of coronaviruses is unnecessary as the disease will naturally run its course however it may be important in certain clinical and veterinary settings or in epidemiological studies to identify an etiological agent diagnosis is also important in locations where a severe cov outbreak is occurring such as at present in the middle east where mers-cov continues to circulate the identification of cases will guide the development of public health measures to control outbreaks it is also important to diagnose cases of severe veterinary cov-induced disease such as pedv and ibv to control these pathogens and protect food supplies rt-pcr has become the method of choice for diagnosis of human cov as multiplex real-time rt-pcr assays have been developed are able to detect all four respiratory hcovs and could be further adapted to novel covs 102 103 serologic assays are important in cases where rna is difficult to isolate or is no longer present and for epidemiological studies to date there are no antiviral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses so treatments are only supportive in vitro interferons ifns are only partially effective against coronaviruses 104 ifns in combination with ribavirin may have increased activity in vitro when compared to ifns alone against some coronaviruses however the effectiveness of this combination in vivo requires further evaluation 105 the sars and mers outbreaks have stimulated research on these viruses and this research has identified a large number of suitable antiviral targets such as viral proteases polymerases and entry proteins significant work remains however to develop drugs that target these processes and are able to inhibit viral replication only limited options are available to prevent coronavirus infections vaccines have only been approved for ibv tgev and canine cov but these vaccines are not always used because they are either not very effective or in some cases have been reported to be involved in the selection of novel pathogenic covs via recombination of circulating strains vaccines for veterinary pathogens such as pedv may be useful in such cases where spread of the virus to a new location could lead to severe losses of veterinary animals in the case of sars-cov several potential vaccines have been developed but none are yet approved for use these vaccines include recombinant attenuated viruses live virus vectors or individual viral proteins expressed from dna plasmids therapeutic sars-cov neutralizing antibodies have been generated and could be retrieved and used again in the event of another sars-cov outbreak such antibodies would be most useful for protecting healthcare workers in general it is thought that live attenuated vaccines would be the most efficacious in targeting coronaviruses this was illustrated in the case of tgev where an attenuated variant prcv appeared in europe in the 1980s this variant only caused mild disease and completely protected swine from tgev thus this attenuated virus has naturally prevented the reoccurrence of severe tgev in europe and the us over the past 30 years 106 despite this success vaccine development for coronaviruses faces many challenges 107 first for mucosal infections natural infection does not prevent subsequent infection and so vaccines must either induce better immunity than the original virus or must at least lessen the disease incurred during a secondary infection second the propensity of the viruses to recombine may pose a problem by rendering the vaccine useless and potentially increasing the evolution and diversity of the virus in the wild 108 finally it has been shown in fipv that vaccination with s protein leads to enhanced disease 109 despite this several strategies are being developed for vaccine development to reduce the likelihood of recombination for instance by making large deletions in the nsp1 110 or e proteins 111 rearranging the 3 end of the genome 112 modifying the trs sequences 113 or using mutant viruses with abnormally high mutation rates that significantly attenuate the virus 114 owing to the lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines the best measures to control human coronaviruses remain a strong public health surveillance system coupled with rapid diagnostic testing and quarantine when necessary for international outbreaks cooperation of governmental entities public health authorities and health care providers is critical during veterinary outbreaks that are readily transmitted such as pedv more drastic measures such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be necessary to prevent transmission of these deadly viruses over the past 50 years the emergence of many different coronaviruses that cause a wide variety of human and veterinary diseases has occurred it is likely that these viruses will continue to emerge and to evolve and cause both human and veterinary outbreaks owing to their ability to recombine mutate and infect multiple species and cell types future research on coronaviruses will continue to investigate many aspects of viral replication and pathogenesis first understanding the propensity of these viruses to jump between species to establish infection in a new host and to identify significant reservoirs of coronaviruses will dramatically aid in our ability to predict when and where potential epidemics may occur as bats seem to be a significant reservoir for these viruses it will be interesting to determine how they seem to avoid clinically evident disease and become persistently infected second many of the non-structural and accessory proteins encoded by these viruses remain uncharacterized with no known function and it will be important to identify mechanisms of action for these proteins as well as defining their role in viral replication and pathogenesis these studies should lead to a large increase in the number of suitable therapeutic targets to combat infections furthermore many of the unique enzymes encoded by coronaviruses such as adp-ribose-1-phosphatase are also present in higher eukaryotes making their study relevant to understanding general aspects of molecular biology and biochemistry third gaining a complete picture of the intricacies of the rtc will provide a framework for understanding the unique rna replication process used by these viruses finally defining the mechanism of how coronaviruses cause disease and understanding the host immunopathological response will significantly improve our ability to design vaccines and reduce disease burden  cellular entry of the sars coronavirus implications for transmission pathogenicity and antiviral strategies sunil lal k ilona glowacka stephanie bertram stefan phlmann   the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in guangdong province china in 2002 and its subsequent spread in asia and canada clearly exemplified the vulnerability of societies and economies to a novel highly pathogenic respiratory agent stadler et al 2003 peiris et al 2003b the outbreak which was halted solely by the quarantine of exposed individuals and the use of conventional prevention measures such as surgical masks was paralleled by an international collaborative scientific effort to develop means for therapeutic and preventive intervention peiris et al 2004 stadler and rappuoli 2005 the basis for the development of successful antiviral strategies is a thorough understanding of the molecular biology underlying viral amplification and pathogenesis and many significant discoveries have been made in the sars field since the identification of the virus early in 2003 drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003a several of these findings provided important insights into the structure and function of the viral spike s protein which is used by the virus as the key to bind and enter host cells hofmann and phlmann 2004 the most well-known examples are the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the host factor which is engaged by the viral s protein for infectious entry into cells and the elucidation of the structure of the s protein receptor binding domain rbd in complex with ace2 li et al 2003 2005a these findings have major implications not only for vaccine and inhibitor development but also for our understanding of the sars zoonosis since adaptation of sars-s to robust usage of human ace2 was probably of key importance for efficient sars-cov spread in humans li et al 2005a 2005c in this chapter we will discuss how sars-cov gains access to target cells and how this process can be inhibited in addition we will review how the molecular interactions underlying sars-cov entry impact viral pathogenesis and interspecies transmission the sars-sprotein is a type i transmembrane protein which comprises 1255 amino acids and contains 23 consensus signals for n-linked glycosylation hofmann and phlmann 2004 s protein is synthesized in the secretory pathway of infected cells it contains an n-terminal signal sequence which mediates import of the nascent protein into the endoplasmatic reticulum where the protein is folded and modified with mannose-rich carbohydrates upon transport of the protein into the golgi apparatus most if not all of the high-mannose carbohydrates are processed into complex glycans nal et al 2005 evidence of o-glycosylation of sars-s has not been reported a novel dibasic er retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail of sars-s promotes accumulation of the s protein at the ergolgi intermediate compartment and the golgi region mcbride et al 2007 the sites where progeny particles are assembled stertz et al 2007 siu et al 2008 formation and budding of new particles are driven by the membrane protein m the envelope protein e and the nucleocapsid protein n huang et al 2004 hsieh et al 2005 siu et al 2008 interactions with the m protein might facilitate s protein incorporation into particles trimers of the s protein protrude from the viral envelope and provide virions with a crown lat corona -like appearance from which the name coronaviruses is derived the domain organization of sars-s resembles that of several well-characterized viral membrane proteins such as influenza virus hemagglutinin ha and human immunodeficiency virus hiv envelope protein env hofmann and phlmann 2004 these proteins employ comparable strategies to facilitate fusion of viral and host cell membranes and are termed class i fusion proteins kielian and rey 2006 they are distinguished from class ii fusion proteins kielian 2006 found for example on flavi- and alphaviruses by their distinct spatial organization and the particular configuration of the functional elements required for fusion with target cells class i fusion proteins are inserted perpendicular to the viral membrane and contain an n-terminal surface unit su and a c-terminal transmembrane unit tm the globular su interacts with cellular receptors while the tm promotes fusion of the viral and host cell membrane kielian and rey 2006 the latter process depends on the presence of a fusion peptide and two helical regions hr conserved elements which are intimately involved in the membrane fusion process fig 11 as discussed below the s protein and the aforementioned fusion proteins are adapted to usage by different cellular receptors therefore the su termed s1 of sars-s does not exhibit appreciable sequence homology to the respective sequences of other class i fusion proteins in contrast the functional elements in tm particularly the hrs are conserved between different class i fusion proteins consequently the tm termed s2 of sars-s shares homology with the corresponding sequences of other viral fusion proteins hofmann and phlmann 2004 which has important implications for development of antiviral strategies as discussed below
 the interaction of sars-s with ace2 is the first indispensable step in the entry cascade as discussed below it needs to be noted however that sars-s also binds to other cell surface factors and these interactions although being ultimately dispensable for infectious entry might profoundly alter infection efficiency thus it is well established that the calcium-dependent c-type lectin dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin dc-sign cd209 geijtenbeek et al 2000 and the related protein dc-signr l-sign cd209l phlmann et al 2001 bashirova et al 2001 bind to sars-s marzi et al 2004 yang et al 2004 jeffers et al 2004 khoo et al 2008 in a glycan-dependent fashion shih et al 2006 han et al 2007 dc-signr was detected in the lung on ace2-positive sars-cov-infected cells and on uninfected bystander cells chan et al 2006 while dc-sign expression was found to be induced upon sars-cov infection yen et al 2006 suggesting that these lectins might have ample opportunity to capture sars-cov in infected individuals despite the potentially important role of dc-signr in sars-cov infection the consequences of dc-signdc-signr collectively referred to as dc-signr engagement by sars-s for viral infectivity are largely unclear one group suggested that dc-signr function as bona fide receptors which facilitate viral entry into otherwise nonpermissive hela cells han et al 2007 dc-signr was also identified in a functional screen for receptors used by sars-cov for cellular entry jeffers et al 2004 further suggesting that dc-signr might support viral entry at least under certain conditions and probably with low efficiency in contrast three other studies failed to detect an appreciable receptor function for dc-signr but suggested that these proteins might enhance infectious entry into ace2-expressing cell lines marzi et al 2004 yang et al 2004 shih et al 2006 finally and in contrast to all aforementioned studies chan and co-workers provided evidence that dc-signr plays a protective role in sars-cov infection chan et al 2006 thus it was demonstrated that dc-signr-dependent uptake of sars-cov into cell lines might lead to viral degradation and might thus reduce viral infectivity for target cells chan et al 2006 in agreement with this finding evidence was obtained that the combination of certain dc-signr allelic variants which resulted in reduced sars-cov uptake in cell culture was associated with increased risk of sars-cov infection in humans chan et al 2006 albeit these findings are not undisputed tang et al 2007 zhi et al 2007 in any case most functional studies described above have in common that they were carried out with cell lines which do not adequately model type ii pneumocytes the major targets of sars-cov infection hamming et al 2004 ding et al 2004 to and lo 2004 mossel et al 2008 and further work with primary lung epithelium is required to help to elucidate the role of dc-signr in sars-cov infection notably a single study examined the impact of dc-signr-specific antibodies on viral spread in primary human airway epithelium cultured at the airliquid interface and observed no inhibition sims et al 2008 although it was not investigated if these lectins were indeed expressed by the cells examined finally it is worth mentioning that sars-s binds to lectins other than dc-signr such as the c-type lectin lsectin gramberg et al 2005 which is largely co-expressed with dc-signr and the consequences of these interactions for viral amplification have not been determined collectively it is clear that binding to dc-signr and related lectins has the potential to modulate viral spread in vivo it remains to be determined however if lectin binding augments or suppresses viral replication recently described knock-in mice for human dc-sign schaefer et al 2008 or signr1 a murine homologue of human dc-sign knock-out mice lanoue et al 2004 might be useful to clarify these questions a thorough understanding of the interface between sars-s and ace2 is key to the development of antiviral strategies targeting viral entry the domains and amino acid residues in sars-s and ace2 which contribute to the efficient interaction of these proteins were initially mapped by mutagenic analyses these studies identified amino acids 318510 in sars-s as an independently folded rbd which binds to ace2 with higher affinity than the full length s protein xiao et al 2003 wong et al 2004 babcock et al 2004 the rbd was also shown to be the major target of neutralizing antibodies he et al 2004a 2004b 2005 and several residues within amino acids 450490 were suggested to be critical for optimal ace2 engagement wong et al 2004 li et al 2005c in addition exploitation of species-specific differences in murine rat and human ace2 allowed the mapping of certain amino acid residues particularly l353 as important for receptor function li et al 2004 2005c these results were supported and extended by the subsequent solution of the structure of the rbd in complex with ace2 li et al 2005a the rbd consists of a core a five-stranded antiparallel -sheet and an extended loop which contains all amino acids making contacts with ace2 the extended loop also termed receptor-binding motif rbm comprises amino acids 424494 li et al 2005a and thus includes the residues defined by mutagenic analysis to be important for sars-s interactions with ace2 wong et al 2004 li et al 2005c the rbm contacts the n-terminal helix of ace2 and the loop between helices 2 and 3 moreover a portion of the rbm inserts between a short helix in ace2 amino acids 329333 and a -hairpin at ace2 residue l353 supporting the previously postulated contribution of l353 to appropriate spikereceptor interactions li et al 2005c conformational changes inherent to the peptidase activity of ace2 do not impact the availability of the s protein binding site li et al 2005a in agreement with the observation that an ace2 inhibitor which blocks peptidase activity and arrests ace2 in a closed conformation does not inhibit sars-s-dependent entry towler et al 2004 li et al 2005c collectively the functional and structural studies defined amino acids in sars-s and ace2 which facilitate the tight association of these proteins in addition the results highlighted that natural variation of these sequences might have important implications for sars-cov transmission and pathogenicity as discussed below horseshoe bats harbor sars-cov-related viruses and might constitute the natural reservoir of sars-cov lau et al 2005 li et al 2005b however the sequence homology between bat and human viruses is limited lau et al 2005 li et al 2005b thus the s protein of animal viruses does not contain an rbm-like sequence and does not use ace2 for cellular entry ren et al 2008 it is therefore probable that sars-cov was introduced into the human population via an intermediate host and palm civets which harbor viruses with high sequence homology to human sars-cov are possible candidates guan et al 2003 song et al 2005 notably the s proteins of human viruses from the 20022003 epidemic bind human ace2 with much higher efficiency than their palm civet counterparts li et al 2005c indicating that efficient spread in humans required adaptation of the sars-s sequence indeed sequence comparison revealed that the civet rbd contains four amino acid changes relative to the human sequence two of these changes are located outside the rbm and do not impact receptor interactions li et al 2005c in contrast the remaining two changes n human to k palm civet at position 479 and t human to s palm civet at position 487 afflicted residues making direct contact with ace2 and significantly decreased binding to human ace2 li et al 2005a 2005c thus n479 and t487 might be required for efficient spread in and between humans li et al 2005a 2005c li 2008 interestingly viruses isolated from sporadic sars cases in the winter of 20032004 which were not associated with severe disease or human-to-human transmission contained a serine at position 487 li et al 2005a further indicating that this amino acid might play a key role in human-to-human transmission and viral pathogenicity the potential for zoonotic transmission of sars-cov might also be determined by species-specific variations in the ace2 sequence thus murine and rat ace2 which do not rat or only inefficiently murine support sars-s-driven entry li et al 2004 2005c contain a leucine human to histidine mouse rat exchange at position 353 this exchange impedes formation of robust contacts with t487 in sars-s and thereby prevents murine and rat ace2 from efficiently supporting sars-s-driven cellular entry li et al 2005a in addition the rat but not the murine receptor contains a m82n exchange which introduces a glycosylation signal the glycan added to n82 blocks the interaction with l472 in sars-s and further decreases receptor function explaining why rat ace2 is less capable of supporting sars-s-driven entry than murine ace2 li et al 2005a these results in conjunction with the aforementioned variations in the rbd sequence highlight that the efficiency of the sars-s interaction with ace2 might be a critical determinant of interspecies transmission of sars-cov a novel human coronavirus nl63 was discovered by two dutch groups in the aftermath of the sars-cov outbreak van der hoek et al 2004 fouchier et al 2004 nl63 is a group i cov and shows high sequence similarity to the long-known human cov 229e the 229e virus like all other group i viruses described at the time of the nl63 discovery uses cd13 aminopeptidase n as a receptor for cellular entry hofmann and phlmann 2004 considering the specificity of group i viruses for cd13 and taking into account that the spike proteins of 229e and nl63 share 56 sequence identity van der hoek et al 2004 pyrc et al 2004 it was surprising that nl63 was shown to use ace2 and not cd13 for cellular entry hofmann et al 2005 this finding raised the question of whether both viruses use similar strategies to engage ace2 mapping studies revealed that an n-terminal unique region in nl63-s which was suspected to function as rbd is in fact dispensable for receptor engagement hofmann et al 2006 in contrast several motifs within amino acids 232 and 684 were found to be required for ace2 binding within an initial study and it was suggested that nl63-s might not harbor a single continuous rbd hofmann et al 2006 however subsequent analyses narrowed the region responsible for ace2 binding to amino acids 301643 and 476616 respectively and a sars-s rbm-like motif was identified in nl63-s li et al 2007 lin et al 2008 several amino acid substitutions in ace2 were found to alter ace2 usage by sars-s but not by nl63-s hofmann et al 2006 indicating that both s proteins might interact with different ace2 surfaces this interpretation is not undisputed li et al 2007 and solution of the structure of nl63-s in complex with ace2 might be required to clarify whether sars-s and nl63-s recognize ace2 differentially in any case it is clear that both viruses employ different mechanisms to activate membrane fusion once the s proteins have bound to ace2 thus it is believed that upon ace2 engagement sars-cov is internalized into endosomal vesicles where the ph-dependent cellular protease cathepsin l activates sars-s by cleavage simmons et al 2005 in contrast low ph and cathepsin activity seem to be largely dispensable for nl63-s-driven entry and it is at present unclear how nl63-s-driven membrane fusion is triggered huang et al 2006 hofmann et al 2006 nl63 is a globally distributed pathogen which is acquired early in childhood and does not usually cause severe disease pyrc et al 2007 this observation contrasts with the high pathogenicity of sars-cov and raises the question of which viral factors determine disease severity again s protein interactions with ace2 might play a central role thus a milestone discovery by imai and colleagues indicated that ace2 expression protects against development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards imai et al 2005 ace2 is an integral component of the reninangiotensin system ras a key regulator of blood pressure and as demonstrated by imai and colleagues imai et al 2005 lung function imai et al 2008 penninger et al 2008 knock-down of ace2 in a mouse model caused accumulation of angiotensin ii which promoted development of ards by signaling via the at1r receptor imai et al 2005 2008 penninger et al 2008 conversely inhibition of at1r and application of soluble ace2 protected against ards imai et al 2005 interestingly a soluble form of the s1 subunit of sars-s was shown to downregulate ace2 expression in vitro and in vivo kuba et al 2005 indicating that sars-s engagement of ace2 might promote sars development even in the absence of productive infection the s protein of nl63 exhibits a markedly reduced affinity for ace2 compared to sars-s mathewson et al 2008 and seems to engage the receptor in a different fashion hofmann et al 2006 suggesting that differential ace2 downregulation by sars-cov and nl63 could contribute to the differential pathogenicity of these viruses however it is largely unclear how sars-cov decreases ace2 expression and the effect of nl63 on ace2 levels has not been systematically investigated notably a recent study indicates that sars-s might promote shedding of the ace2 ectodomain by inducing ace2 cleavage by taceadam17 fig 12 a process that seems to be essential for infectious entry haga et al 2008 in contrast nl63-s did not induce appreciable ace2 shedding haga et al 2008 thus the previously observed ace2 downregulation by sars-s might have been due to proteolytic cleavage and dissociation of the ectodomain rather than ace2 internalization and degradation however it is unclear if shedding of the ace2 ectodomain actually exacerbates sars development considering that soluble ace2 protects against ards in a mouse model imai et al 2005
 class i fusion proteins usually require proteolytic cleavage to transit into an activated state hofmann and phlmann 2004 kielian and rey 2006 however the strategies to accomplish proteolytic activation can vary many fusion proteins are cleaved by subtilisin-like proteases in the secretory pathway of infected cells and proteolytically processed proteins are incorporated into virions this applies to the s proteins of most strains of murine hepatitis virus mhv a group ii coronavirus the membrane fusion reaction is subsequently triggered by binding of the cleaved s proteins to their cellular receptor ceacam-1 williams et al 1991 nash and buchmeier 1997 de haan et al 2004 qiu et al 2006 consequently entry is ph-independent and encompasses fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane of target cells nash and buchmeier 1997 de haan et al 2004 qiu et al 2006 the influenza virus ha is either cleaved by subtilisin proteases in the secretory pathway or by secreted proteases present in the lung lumen however subsequent binding to the receptor determinant sialic acid does not trigger membrane fusion but internalization into endosomal vesicles where fusion is triggered by low ph eckert and kim 2001 thus infectious entry of influenza viruses is ph-dependent and is facilitated by fusion of the viral membrane with endosomal membranes eckert and kim 2001 the sars-s protein employs a mixture of the entry strategies described above at present there is no evidence for appreciable cleavage of sars-s produced in infected cells xiao et al 2003 yang et al 2004 simmons et al 2004 yao et al 2004 hofmann et al 2004b with the exception of a single report wu et al 2004 it has been documented that the presence of furin can augment sars-s activity and that a furin inhibitor blocks sars-cov infection bergeron et al 2005 follis et al 2006 however cleavage of sars-s has not been detected under these conditions bergeron et al 2005 follis et al 2006 instead a seminal study by simmons and colleagues showed that sars-s is activated by the endosomal ph-dependent protease cathepsin l upon uptake into target cells and that cathepsin l activity is essential for infectious entry simmons et al 2005 cathepsin b can also contribute to sars-s activation but seems to be of minor importance compared to cathepsin l simmons et al 2005 importantly appropriate sars-s cleavage by cathepsin l seems to require a modest conformational rearrangement of sars-s simmons et al 2005 which is induced upon binding to ace2 beniac et al 2007 thus sars-s-driven entry is ph-dependent and relies on fusion of viral and endosomal membranes yang et al 2004 simmons et al 2004 2005 hofmann et al 2004b however acidic conditions are required for cathepsin activity and have no triggering effect on sars-s simmons et al 2005 the cathepsin l cleavage site in sars-s was mapped to t678 when recombinant proteins were employed bosch et al 2008 but evidence that t678 is important for sars-cov entry is lacking and cathepsin l-mediated cleavage of virion-associated sars-s in target cells remains to be demonstrated it is also unclear if cellular proteases other than cathepsin b and l can allow sars-s-driven entry into certain target cells an activating function of factor xa has recently been suggested du et al 2007 but the results await confirmation finally it is noteworthy that engineered cleavage of sars-s in virus-producing cells can ablate the need for cathepsin activity in target cells watanabe et al 2008 this finding highlights the need to analyze if sars-s is cleaved in primary lung cells and to determine if cathepsin activity is indeed required for viral spread in vivo  information pivotal to efforts aiming at the development of cathepsin inhibitors for antiviral therapy the functional organization of sars-s2 resembles that of the tms of other class i fusion proteins and sars-s-driven membrane fusion reaction follows the principles previously established for other class i fusion proteins hofmann and phlmann 2004 membrane fusion commences by insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane fig 13 in this context it is worth noting that sars-s in contrast to for example hiv env and influenza ha contains an internal fusion peptide which does not constitute the n terminus of s2 but may comprise amino acids 770788 sainz et al 2005 upon fusion peptide insertion the s2 subunit is connected with the viral and the target cell membrane subsequently the c-terminal hr termed hr2 folds back onto the n-terminal hr termed hr1 forming an energetically stable six-helix bundle structure in which hr1 and hr2 are oriented in an antiparallel fashion bosch et al 2003 tripet et al 2004 liu et al 2004 supekar et al 2004 ingallinella et al 2004 xu et al 2004 hsu et al 2004 thereby viral and target cell membranes are pulled into close proximity allowing the membranes to merge fig 13 peptides derived from hr2 which bind to hr1 and block the formation of the six-helix bundle are used for therapy of hiv infection este and telenti 2007 a similar approach was successful for blockade of sars-cov spread in cell culture bosch et al 2003 liu et al 2004 zhu et al 2004 yuan et al 2004 ni et al 2005 but the inhibitors developed were not as potent as those used to treat hiv infection one reason for the decreased potency might be inherent to the cellular location of the membrane fusion reaction the hiv env protein drives fusion with the plasma cell membrane and the target of the inhibitory peptides is readily accessible in contrast sars-cov fuses with endosomal membranes and inhibitors must be taken up into endosomes to efficiently block the fusion reaction potentially this could present a significant hurdle to the development of fusion inhibitors for therapy of sars-cov infection watanabe et al 2008
 the cellular entry of sars-cov is a multistep process which involves the formation of several transient intermediates all structures participating in the entry cascade are potential targets for inhibitors and the feasibility of several approaches to prevent entry has already been demonstrated the first step sars-s engagement of ace2 is an attractive target for both preventive and therapeutic approaches thus the immunization with the rbd has been shown to elicit neutralizing antibodies he et al 2004a 2005 and monoclonal rbd-specific antibodies which exhibit potent antiviral effects in animal models have been identified sui et al 2004 2005 rockx et al 2007 zhu et al 2007 in addition sars-s binding to ace2 can be inhibited by nonpeptidic molecules targeting the receptor huentelman et al 2004 and soluble ace2 was shown to block sars-cov infection hofmann et al 2004a and to protect against ards kuba et al 2005 making this approach particularly promising the s protein can also be targeted by lectins which bind glycans on the s protein and thereby block viral entry van der meer et al 2007 keyaerts et al 2007 albeit issues concerning potential toxicity and antigenicity remain to be addressed after binding to ace2 and uptake into target cells the s protein must be activated by cathepsin l and potent cathepsin l inhibitors are available simmons et al 2005 however the role of cathepsin l in viral spread in vivo remains to be assessed and knock-out mice reinheckel et al 2001 might be suitable tools for these endeavours finally inhibitors of the fusion reaction have been described bosch et al 2003 liu et al 2004 zhu et al 2004 yuan et al 2004 ni et al 2005 but optimization of available compounds and generation of nonpeptidic compounds is desirable in summary the approaches described above particularly combinations thereof should allow development of compounds suitable for effectively preventing or combating future outbreaks of sars-cov  products in a pandemic liability for medical products and the fight against covid-19 duncan fairgrieve peter feldschreiber geraint howells marcus pilgerstorfer qc   the global war against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes covid-19 is being fought by many countries on many fronts equipment is essential in any war 1 and it is no different when that equipment takes the form of medical supplies faced with the current pandemic a vast global demand has arisen for an array of products from test kits and chemicals personal protective equipment ppe hand sanitisers and other biocidal products ventilators and similar devices as well as medicines treatments and of course a vaccine producers are now scrambling to meet that demand by ramping up production developing modified and new products at astonishing speeds as well as manufacturing in novel ways so what of the legal considerations in this piece we explore from a legal perspective some of the issues that might arise and how existing legal concepts might respond our purpose is not to erect legal road blocks in the way of meeting demand for essential healthcare products quite the contrary it is to contribute to the consideration of the application of laws covering product liability and regulation at an early stage when ex ante measures such as providing warnings obtaining indemnities from government etc are still available to producers and lawmakers ii sars-cov-2 and medical products an overview the science surrounding the sars-cov-2 virus and the covid-19 respiratory disease it causes remains young 2 the virus is thought to be zoonotic in nature but there is yet to be consensus as to the animal source 3 studies of the genomic features of the virus including whether it is a product of natural selection in an animal host prior to zoonotic transfer or in humans thereafter are beginning to emerge 4 other projects are ongoing to track the evolution of the pathogen genome as the virus spreads across human populations 5 current genetic sequencing points to sars-cov-2 being a betacoronavirus closely linked to sars 6 the primary modes of transfer of the virus 7 are respiratory droplets ie by close contact with a person who is coughing or sneezing such that infected respiratory droplets come into contact with the mouth nose or eyes and contact routes be that direct contact with an infected person or indirect contact with surfaces or objects used by an infected person there is also some evidence for airborne and intestinal infection routes which is reflected in the world health organization who precaution recommendations 8 infection with the virus usually leads after an incubation period 9 to symptoms typically of a fever cough and shortness of breath 10 other symptoms have included chills muscle achespain sore throat conjunctivitis diarrhoea new loss of taste or smell rash on the skin or discolouration of fingers or toes and fatigue 11 wider symptoms have also been reported 12 but many cases are asymptomatic 13 no antiviral treatment is approved to treat those displaying symptoms of covid-19 the vast majority of those infected thought to be about 81 recover without the need for special treatment taking if required pain relief cough remedies rest and fluids a minority approximately 14 develop severe disease requiring hospitalisation and oxygen therapy and a yet smaller minority approximately 5 require intensive care and perhaps mechanical ventilation often for severe pneumonia 14 those who are older and have underlying health conditions are thought to be more at risk 15 although studies are ongoing as to why some young people with no underlying health conditions have developed severe illness 16 uncertainty remains as to the likely mortality ratethe who currently estimates this at 34 17 the first human cases emerged from wuhan china in december 2019 since then the spread has been fast and global with other hot-spots emerging in

deaths were expected with no measures taken 20 such modelling proceeded from the assumption that r 0 the reproduction number or the number of expected infections for each person with the virus assuming no pre-existing immunity was 24 21 as a result of this and similar modelling exercises 22 various interventions were imposed on populations to control the spread of infection such measures have ranged from individual isolation to social distancing school closures and ultimately general population lockdowns later work has suggested albeit with uncertainty that these interventions have had a substantial impact on transmission and a depressing effect on the effective reproduction number r e  possibly driving r e below 1 the threshold leading to reduced numbers of cases 23 further waves of infection are however possible upon the lifting of such measures 24 but the debate continues as to how other methods short of lockdown can be put in place to contain the spread such as the detailed tracing of cases seen in south korea 25 and how effective such measures will be 26 the covid-19 outbreak poses important regulatory problems for the procurement of appropriate medicinal

however the european regulatory system including the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra and european medicines agency ema has only changed inasmuch as decreasing the administrative and bureaucratic burden of submitting applications for marketing authorisation and clinical development programmes and speeding up the process 28 the fundamental objectives of demonstrating clinical efficacy and safety and evaluation of the risk-benefit of new products remain unchanged the ema has set out a comprehensive list of guidelines covering the practical implementation of the medicines directive 29 the ema is introducing regulatory administrative changes to speed up the development and approval of covid-19targeted medicinal products these include scientific advice the prime scheme and accelerated assessment together with conditional marketing authorisation procedures scientific advice for potential novel coronavirus treatments and vaccines will be free of charge 30 the prime scheme is for priority innovative medicines it is effectively a partnership between developers and regulators facilitating the generation of robust data on a medicines risk and benefit in terms of clinical efficacy and safety to enable accelerated assessment 31 the ema is also cooperating with the who to help the development of potential covid-19 treatments by facilitating large-scale clinical trials 32 and we review these potential treatments below in terms of vaccines the ema is assisting their development and two candidates have already entered clinical trials furthermore the ema is advising on the changes and protocols that may be needed to accelerate the operation and conduct of clinical trials 33 in the uk the mhra is introducing similar amendments to the administrative procedures governing potential covid-19 treatments and diagnostic medical devices the agency is developing a package of flexibilities to regulatory guidance in order to support the medicines supply chain and healthcare response to covid-19 34 in particular as regards clinical trials remote monitoring and remote access to medical records is allowed and there is no need to inform the mhra of a temporary halt and restart of trials a reduction of subject monitoring visits will not require substantial protocol amendments safety reporting timelines will not always be met and there will no requirement to report an increase in protocol deviations as serious breaches 35 as regards medicines regulation the mhra is implementing priority and expedited 28 mhra

assessment for national variations that impact the medicines supply chain as we shall discuss below the mhra is also providing an expedited service for enquiries processing applications for covid-19-related diagnostic devices and for device clinical investigations 36 for the latter protocol deviations eg to ensure reproducibility and specificity for antigen and antibody testing will not need to be notified very importantly the mhra has now 37 issued specifications for continuous positive airway pressure cpap machines and ventilators to ensure a continued supply of these critical medical devices during the covid-19 crisis similar new guidelines for protective clothing have now been issued as the foregoing has already revealed combatting the pandemic and its spread through populations as well as treating individual cases requires an array of medical products as the global reach of the virus has extended so too has demand for these supplies in this section we outline some of the products in question and how for the purposes of the discussion that follows it is convenient to categorise them from a legal perspective from an early stage in the pandemics progress the who has emphasised the importance of testing 38 in order to monitor trends in the disease detect new cases provide epidemiological information to make risk assessments and to guide the modelling of response measures 39 furthermore testing individuals enables those key workers in precautionary isolation to know whether they have the disease and should remain isolated or whether they can return to their important work 40 there are essentially two types of testing first are tests to confirm whether a person has covid-19 at the time of the test generally these antigen tests consist of nucleic acid amplification tests naats performed on samples often a nasopharyngeal specimen taken by swab that detect the unique sequence of virus rna such as real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing if necessary 41 including in the uk 43 testing can deliver a result in a matter of hours although more rapid antigen tests are also possible 44 the second type of test seeks to identify whether a person has had the infection in the past by detecting antibodies that attack the virus serological tests some difficulties with testing have started to emerge shortages of the chemicals required have been reported owing to the unprecedented demand 45 furthermore some rapid test kits purchased by national governments have proved unreliable in spain kits were reported achieving only 30 accuracy rates 46 and similar reports are emerging from other countries 47 as a result of such complaints in order to clear chinese customs chinese exporters must now provide a declaration and evidence that the product is registered in china and that it meets the quality standard requirements of the importing country 48 whilst many manufacturers are now developing or have developed antibody tests that allow individuals to obtain a result in a matter of minutes 49 public health england currently advises against their use 50 and their effectiveness continues to be studied 51 pursuant to the in vitro diagnostic medical devices ivd directive 9879ec test kits that are intended to be used by patients at home need to be assessed by a notified body in addition to the usual requirements of manufacturers to specify device performance characteristics and self-declare conformity with the safety and performance requirements in the

member states competent authorities has identified several devices with fraudulent documentation incomplete technical files and unsubstantiated claims 55 b personal protective equipment the widespread use of masks to prevent the transmission of sars-cov-2 can be seen daily on television news reports the use of masks was more common in asia even before the outbreak but extensive use can now be seen in other parts of the world some countries have gone further and have mandated their use 56 although that is not yet the approach of the who its guidance recommends use by those coughing or sneezing but only by a healthy person when taking care of someone else with the virus 57 scientific studies are beginning to quantify the extent to which the virus can travel in the air and the ability of a mask to reduce transmission from symptomatic individuals 58 on the back of that some argue that it is time to apply a precautionary principle to the wearing of such equipment 59 in addition to masks other ppe is required by healthcare workers as part of a package of administrative environmental and engineering controls 60 these include visorsgoggles surgical gloves gowns and aprons and

some protectionist national practices 63 measures are in place to ease the supply 64 to assist manufacturers to increase supply the european commission has provided a qa document concerning conformity assessment procedures for protective equipment summarising the regulatory standards and requirements that apply to different types of ppe 65 as well as regular manufacturers ramping up production mask design specifications for 3d printing have been made available and have resulted in individuals and small suppliers with access to such printing facilities manufacturing masks to meet demand 66 the potential use of such methods has resulted in specific guidance from the european commission as to the regulatory regime that applies 67 c chemical-based products as noted above one of the modes of transmission of the virus is through contact with contaminated persons surfaces or objects recent studies have shown 68 that coronaviruses can persist on inanimate surfaces such as metal glass or plastic for up to nine days at room temperature the period is shorter at higher temperatures a total of 316 of the viral load of an influenza virus can be transferred with a hand contact period of five seconds lower with a parainfluenza virus and it has been shown that on average a student will touch their face 23 times per hour with contact mostly being to the skin followed by the mouth nose and eyes other work considering the stability of sars-cov-2 in particular is also being undertaken 69 it is therefore unsurprising to find alongside guidance to populations regularly to wash or

currently reports that no pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of covid-19 but a number of medicines are being identified 92 and will soon be studied in clinical trials 93 for example the solidarity trial compares four treatment options to assess efficacy namely remdesivir 94 an ebola treatment lopinavirritonavir an hiv treatment interferon beta-1a a treatment for multiple sclerosis and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine malaria and rheumatology treatments 95 as well as monoclonal antibodies with activity against components of the immune system other work has shown that a single dose of ivermectin an anti-parasitic drug used in head lice treatments can deactivate the virus within 48 hours in cell culture its use as a treatment in humans remains unproven and depends on pre-clinical testing and clinical trials 96 in the uk the national institute for health and care excellence nice is reviewing its guidance for the diagnosis and

covid-19 might be effective as a treatment for those suffering with the disease 111 the production and distribution of products such as those discussed above 112 in the context of a pandemic gives rise to a number of legal issues that can be conveniently addressed by grouping them into relevant categories a fraudulent and counterfeit products first one might identify the deliberately fraudulent or counterfeit products which sadly appear when the unscrupulous seek to profit out of an emergency fraudulent products claiming to cure treat or prevent covid-19 are on the rise 113 a recent investigation by law enforcement and regulatory authorities from 90 countries revealed 2000 online advertisements related to covid-19 with more than 34000 unlicensed and counterfeit products advertised as corona spray coronavirus medicines or coronavirus packages being seized 114 by april 2020 the national cyber security centre ncsc in the uk had removed more than 2000 online scams including 471 fake online shops selling fraudulent coronavirus-related items 115 amazon itself has deleted over a million products for price gouging or falsely advertising effectiveness against coronavirus 116 plainly there is much room for enforcement action by national authorities including under the unfair commercial practice directive 117 b producers ramping up production manufacturing errors the next relevant grouping is where existing producers ramp up the production of existing products in order to meet demand as noted in the foregoing this has already been seen with manufacturers of chemicals ppe and medical devices at first 111 k duan et al the feasibility of convalescent plasma therapy in severe covid-19 patients a pilot study 2020 medrxiv httpsdoiorg101101202003 16  false information about the main characteristics of a product including risks and benefits which is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision he or she would not otherwise have done is regarded as a misleading commercial practice under art 61b for further information see the commission guidance swd20160163 final in england this directive is implemented by the consumer protection from unfair trading regulations 20081277 which in addition to specifying the authorities that have the duty and power to enforce the regulations reg 19 also provides for consumers rights to redress including a claim for damages in certain circumstances see section ii4a sight this is simply a case of a producer doing more of the same but in times of pandemic the pressure to increase supply quickly can come at a cost to increase production volumes some might be forced to use different raw materials where a ready supply of the usual is not available additional manufacturingquality control personnel some of whom might have been rapidly trained and so be less experienced different techniques for manufacturing or quality control etc all of these can potentially lead to the manufacture of products that deviate from the specification leading to manufacturing defects or non-standard products 118 of course these sorts of errors can arise in the other categories outlined below but they are perhaps most conveniently dealt with here can the circumstances of urgent demand serve as an important relevant circumstance in such a case if not ought the law to provide for exculpation in such cases or ought the law to continue to incentivise production in accordance with the product specification c novel producers and novel production methods the covid-19 outbreak has also resulted in new producers making products this can be producers repurposing production lines to make sought-after products eg hand gel or ventilators that they have not previously manufactured alternatively it can be those with access to small-scale novel production facilities such as 3d printers using them to produce in order to help meet demand eg printing ppe in addition to meeting applicable regulatory requirements potential liability for products so manufactured should be considered in some cases it might be straightforward to identify the producer in others such as where a person prints a respirator on a 3d printer using a specification created by a third party downloaded from the internet the position is less clear are both the printer and the designer liable then there is the role of government most usually this will be one of procurement rather than the actual production of product itself 119 however it might be called upon to provide indemnities to producers where insurance is not readily available then there are issues presented by the pressure on producers to develop new products there is of course a spectrum of development from products that might be based to varying extents on existing designs to others that are designed from scratch manysuch as pharmaceutical treatments and vaccineswill involve technical research and development all conducted at speed what should be the regulatory response to such challenges to what extent can the determination of liability be affected where the pressure to produce is driven by the pandemic how should the law balance the need to incentivise and quickly develop essential medical products with imposing responsibility for adverse effects as a means to ensure that individuals are not disproportionately burdened by them what can be learned from previous 118 responses to pandemics such as h1n1 and experiences across the atlantic where exemptions from liability are available these and other issues are considered below under the product liability directive pld 120 a producer is liable to compensate a claimant for damage caused by their defective product the absence of a specific defence for producing products as part of a response to a health emergency 121 as we have seen in other jurisdictions might be thought a cause for concern might a producer worry about future liabilities in a way that might stifle the innovation required to develop speedily a vaccine or medicinal response to the coronavirus or even exercise excessive caution when producing products essential to a response similar concerns were raised during the passage of the consumer protection act 1987 cpa through the uk parliament lord denning for example was concerned that strict liability ought not to hamper the development of new pharmaceuticals to combat aids that were for the benefit of humanity as a whole 122 in this section we consider a number of liability issues that the current emergency draws into sharp focus including whether the defectiveness standard is sufficiently flexible to be sensitive to the production of products in response to a pandemic liability under the pld is imposed on manufacturers producers strictu sensu those who present themselves as producers quasi-producers as well as those who import into the eu for commercial purposes importers 123 further liability can arise for suppliers where the producer cannot be identified by the claimant eg with unlabelled products and the supplier fails to provide the identity of the producer eu importer or their own supplier within a reasonable time 124 generally there will be little difficulty applying these concepts with respect to products put into circulation in response to the pandemic in the usual case a producer will be straightforward to identify that said and as we have seen there are reports of less usual methods of production during the pandemic consortia made up of a variety of organisations engaged in the production of say a ventilator will give rise to the question of who is the correct target for litigation where the defect can be attributed to a particular defective component the producer of that component may be chosen but under the pld the producer of the finished product will be jointly and severally liable to the claimant if the final product is also defective consortia are likely to find themselves jointly fulfilling the role of producers and jointly liable as such organisations engaging in such activities may wish to agree inter se how liabilities that might arise will be distributed in their contractual agreements as we discuss below governments may also step into the role of a producer to ensure speedy supply of a particular product such as a vaccine 125 where its functional activities constitute those of one of the categories of producer there is no reason in principle why a government cannot be liable 126 that said it is perhaps more likely that government will remain focused on its procurement role others might also find themselves fulfilling the role of a producer during the pandemic a school might make its own hand gel for use by students and staff or a hospital may use its 3d printer to make face masks because a ready supply of finished product is not available in such circumstances such organisations may well be acting as a producer just as the hospital in veedfald 127 was liable as manufacturer of a liquid used for flushing a kidney in preparation for transplant a defence is available to a producer who can prove that the product was neither manufactured by him for sale or any form of distribution for economic purpose nor manufactured or distributed by him in the course of his business 128 the court of justice of the european union cjeu has however adopted a restrictive interpretation of this and other defences thus in veedfald the fact that the liquid in question was manufactured by a hospital for a specific medical service for which the public did not pay and that was financed from public funds generated by taxation would not detract from the economic and business character of manufacture 129 organisations such as hospitals schools and employers 130 that engage in the manufacture of their own products may therefore wish to consider carefully the potential implications and the scope of their insurance thus if products are produced for an organisations own economic purposes so saving money by not having to purchase from other producers the defence is unlikely to apply by contrast if they can show that they produced without profit making the product available for free as a societal service the defence is likely to be available further issues are thrown up by the 3d printing of products used in the pandemic as we have seen componentsvalves for respirators and other ppe such as masks have been designed electronically and to meet demand are being printed by a multitude of organisations and individuals with access to 3d printing facilities such 3d printing 125 see thomson et al supra note 109 and the discussion below concerning vaccines 126 the pubic nature of the defendant in veedfald see note 127 below made no difference see 21 127 veedfald v arhus amtskommune case c-20399 2003 1 cmlr 41 cjeu 128 pld art 7c 129 veedfald supra note 127 21 cf ag 26 nor did the defence in pld art 7a apply the product was put into circulation because although it did not leave the hospitals sphere of control the person for whom it was intended was obliged to bring himself into that sphere of control see  16-18 130 in many jurisdictions employers also face additional considerations quite apart from those as producers of a product they might manufacture in england an employer owes duties of care at common law and under health and safety legislation towards their employees including in respect of equipment and ppe for use at work see eg a cowper what the law says about ppe responsibility 2020 369 bmj m1718 httpsdoiorg101136bmj m1718 furthermore even where the employer is not themselves a producer but supplies equipment produced by a third party to an employee for the purposes of the employers business under the employers liability defective equipment act 1969 the employer is liable just as much as the third-party producer where an employee suffers injury in the course of employment due to the equipment being defective or more accurately additive layer manufacturing involves the use of a computer-aided design cad file whilst this can be created by the user of the printer it is frequently made available by third parties be they professional or hobbyist and downloaded to then be used with a printer the file contains all of the information required for a 3d printer to then produce the physical item using one or more raw materials specified and depending on the capabilities of the printing system 131 as howells twigg-flesner and willett observe 132 when applying standard pld principles potential liability arises for those creating the physical product in their 3d printers notwithstanding that the reason for any defect might lie in defective instructions embedded in the cad file problems with the 3d printer or raw materials used or that the user of the 3d printer might be unaware of such problems in the context of the pandemic if ppe products are altruistically produced in this way and donated there is scope for the article 7c defence to apply furthermore as we shall see the defectiveness standard is sensitive to the producer using warnings to modify the level of entitled safety expectations in the product and thus a person printing a product might have some scope to warn that the product has only been manufactured to conform to the instructions on the cad file that was used organisations offering 3d printer services to end users might also argue that they are simply offering a service there may in any event be avenues of recourse for the user of a 3d printer down the chain of supply on the basis of other theories of liability a further related issue that arises is whether the producer of the cad file can be liable for recoverable damage caused by defects in the contents of the cad file this might arise where a person using a piece of ppe has themselves purchased the cad file and used a 3d printer to manufacture it is the cad file itself a product to which the pld can apply in theory the issue could apply to an array of informational products leaflets guidance booklets training videos etc that might be produced containing defective information about the virus and that when followed result in the user sustaining personal injury damage such as contracting the virus products covered by the directive are defined to be all movables even if incorporated into another movable or into an immovable product includes electricity 133 there has been debate but no eu case law as to whether or not informational products such as information within a book or map or software may constitute a product for the purposes of the pld 134 under the pld being wide enough to encompass such informationaldigital products there is no definitive answer and it is to be hoped that the european commission will take the opportunity of the current review of the pld to put beyond doubt that digital products are included within the directives scope 135 the central liability-imposing concept under the pld is that of defect the claimant establishes defectiveness by proving the product did not meet the standard set by article 6 pld viz it failed to provide the safety which a person is entitled to expect taking all circumstances into account those circumstances include three statutory factors that are marked out for particular 136 consideration 1 the presentation of the product 2 the use to which it could reasonably be expected that the product would be put and 3 the time when the product was put into circulation as the cjeu has now established determining the issue of defectiveness requires an objective assessment by reference to the public at large and the standard of safety a consumer may legitimately expect 137 where a product has an abnormal potential for damage viz the risks posed by the product having an abnormal unreasonable character exceeding the normal risks inherent in its use the product will be defective 138 thus a finding of defectiveness is a measure of risk it applies where a product exceeds a threshold level of risk of harm set dependent upon entitled expectations of the public at large 139 central to this exercise is the comparison of the impugned product with the ordinary or normal level of safety that the public is entitled to expect not absolute safety as assessed by the court following consideration of alternative real or even hypothetical comparator products 140 the application of these principles to assess the defectiveness of products produced in response to the coronavirus pandemic is likely to arise in a number of different ways some of which are considered below the issues are however linked by a central 135 this is a topic that has been discussed by the expert group on liability and new technologies see httpsec europaeutransparencyregexpertindexcfmdogroupdetailgroupdetailgroupid3592newsearch1 newsearch1 and expert group on liability and new technologies liability for artificial intelligence and other emerging digital technologies 2019 httpsdoiorg102838573689 see further howells et al supra note 131 in respect of contractual remedies note that chapter 3 of the consumer rights act 2015 and the digital content directive 2019770 extend conformity rules to software 136 see the words notamment and insbesondere in the french-and german-language versions of the pld see also a v national blood supra note 118 at  34ii 63 137 question 141  whether the fact of the pandemic can be a legally relevant circumstance to factor into the courts objective assessment of entitled safety expectations although the pandemic does not provide a defence as a matter of principle may the court take into account that production was to meet a public health emergency and that therefore the public is entitled to a lower level of safety than would otherwise be the case if so how much weightin the particular circumstancescan this factor be given during the plds lifetime there has been much debate as to which if any circumstances are off-limits for a proper defect assessment there has been little direct consideration by the cjeu but famously in a v national blood authority burton j held that considering all of the circumstances meant all of the legally relevant circumstances and that factors should be excluded from consideration where they fell outwith the purpose of the pld 142 whether the producer was at fault is one circumstance that uncontroversially falls into this category 143 more recently in wilkes the court adopted a more flexible approach    including which circumstances are relevant and the weight to be given to each 144 so what about the public health emergency presented by the pandemic a manufacturing defects the problem of the non-standard product the first scenario to consider concerns manufacturing defects the vast increase in demand for certain products has led to many producers drastically increasing the speed and volumes of production all other things being equal one would expect greater production volumes to result in a greater number of non-standard products being produced if the same proportion of a production run is defective and not picked up by quality control systems increasing volume will most likely result in a greater number of products with manufacturing defects being put into circulation traditionally liability has readily been found for manufacturing defects and one might anticipate no change in the attribution of liability just because total numbers increase however other things are unlikely to be equal as outlined above producers may be forced to change methodology raw materials personnel or approaches to quality control in order to meet demand whilst it might be that some changes have the happy side effect of improving the safety of the resultant product it is perhaps more likely that hastily made changes to production in order to meet demand will increase defect numbers can the fact that more product is being produced in response to the pandemic be a relevant circumstance we consider this unlikely non-standard products viz those that deviate from the producers intentions will inevitably be compared with the standard product those that do not so deviate 145 where that comparison reveals that it fails to offer the normal level of safety that the publicas objectively assessed by the courtis entitled to expect then one would expect liability to be imposed the fact that the pandemic has caused the producer to increase production does not change this the debate here has distinct resonance with whether the avoidability of the defect or the practicability or cost of precautionary measures should be considered in non-standard product defect cases such features have been held to be irrelevant 146 a conclusion broadly accepted in later analyses 147 this conclusion is we would suggest justifiable by reference to the economics increased production ought in general to mean increased profits for the producer particularly in an environment of high demand liability for lemons deviating from the norm is justifiable by reference to the ability of the producer to spread the risk through price or insurance across the greater volume produced 148 by the preventative effect that results by placing liability on the person best able to prevent the damage at the lowest cost 149 and the particular health interests at stake 150 b comparisons the group defect doctrine and the time at which the product was put into circulation in the case just considered defectiveness is considered primarily by reference to the comparison between the index product and the standard as comparator both the deviant and the standard product are manufactured at the same time in response to the pandemic but what about comparisons with products put into circulation prior to the pandemic are such comparisons legitimate health emergencies aside one would normally expect the passage of time to increase the level of safety of products that can legitimately be expected that is why one of the statutory factors that is taken into account by the court is the time at which the product was put into circulation article 61c article 62 also speaks to that issue by mandating that a product shall not be considered defective for the sole reason that a better product is subsequently put into circulation the present health emergency has the potential to give rise to reverse comparisons where a product produced in response to the pandemic is worse in terms of safety than a forerunner because of the circumstances of its manufacture or development an example might be a ventilator adapted at speed from an existing design in response to urgent demand but that turns out to be less safe than a previous model as a matter of principle and on standard principles there would seem to be no reason to rule out backwards comparison with safer forerunner products that would also apply where reliance is placed on the group defect doctrine developed by the cjeu in boston scientific there the court held that a product could be found defective as a result of its membership of a group of products that had a higher-thannormal risk of failure without the claimant needing to establish that the particular problem arose in the index product 151 ascertaining the normal risk in such cases is often an exercise in backwards comparison looking to previous groups such as batches or production series groupings defined by reference to production methods during the pandemic will engage with such principles that said as noted above one of the particular factors identified in the pld is the time when the product was put into circulation article 61c that wording it seems to us is wide enough not only to require the orientation of entitled safety levels to a place on a temporal scale of product development and safety enhancement but also by reference to other temporal factors insofar as they impact perhaps even temporarily on the legitimate safety expectations of the public at large thus during periods of wartime additional or different risks may arise that in turn might cause the entitled safety expectations of particular products to increase or decrease this is likely to depend on the nature of the product and the relevant risks that apply to its foreseeable use another example might be where during a particular time period a relevant risk that might otherwise be faced when using a product is limited or extinguished in some way thus the legitimate expectations as to safety in respect of clothing foreseeably to be worn in jungle regions where there is a high risk of a deadly mosquito-transmitted infection are likely to extend to such products providing protection to reduce that risk if the risk of contracting such a disease is drastically reduced to near zero through antimosquito measures then for products put into circulation subsequently the entitled safety expectations in respect of the clothing may reduce that can in theory remain the case even if say after a decade the disease makes a comeback and entitled safety expectations change again it seems to us that in the same way entitled safety expectations may in theory be modified during a period of a health emergency however we would emphasise two important points first the modification will not always be such as to lower entitled expectations indeed a court would be able to conclude that on an objective assessment legitimate expectations as to a particular aspect of safety have increased eg where foreseeable use of the product gives rise to a risk of infection of what is a novel virus secondly the court will need to distinguish carefully between temporal factors that impact on entitled safety expectations which can be taken into account under article 61c and those that merely impact a producers ability to manufacture in accordance with such expectations which as we have explained above are unlikely to be relevant within these limits article 61c is likely to provide some flexibility to argue that the publics entitled level of safety expectation has been affected c benefits and social utility a further way in which the pandemic might be relevant to the assessment of defectiveness concerns whether and the extent to which the benefits of a product may be weighed against its risks when considering whether it is defective the benefits of a sars-cov-2 vaccine covid-19 treatment or ventilator may be profound in the context of a health emergency if legally relevant they might weigh so as to lower the entitled level of safety expectation in respect of risks including even serious side effects a related issue considered in section v below is whether regulatory approval is relevant particularly where the processes of scrutiny or standards applied have altered in response to the health emergency early english cases ruled as a matter of principle that a products benefits should be left out of account by reference to the traveaux prparatoires 152 and purpose of the directive 153 later cases have reached the opposite result albeit making a distinction as to relevance in non-standard and standard product cases 154 other european jurisdictions such as germany have embraced considerations of riskbenefit more enthusiastically 155 at the european level the cjeu has not directly addressed the question although it is perhaps notable in boston scientific that defect was assessed without any reference to the benefits or utility of the product furthermore in w v sanofi the advocate general rejected a submission that a broad assessment of costbenefit was required when considering a vaccine 156 which of course provides benefits both to the user and society more generally through herd immunity however the advocate generals opinion was thought in the english case of gee to be directed at a particular submission in w and only to suggest that a balance of costs and benefits was not necessarily required 157 in the course of her discussion andrews j posited the example of a new chemotherapy drug that had proven advantages over others on the market but also had a rare and serious side effect she reasoned that it would be difficult to see how the level of entitled safety expectation could be evaluated without taking into account the products particular benefitsnamely the enhanced efficacy 158 yet this could be done by considering in particular the presentation of the product the presence or absence of a warning of a rare but serious side effect either a known risk or a discoverable one 159  could well provide the answer without recourse to arguments about efficacy or other product benefits indeed it might be thought odd were the pld to avoid a defect finding by reference 152 during the preparation of the pld the american chamber of commerce suggested to the commission that the definition of defectiveness should be amended to include specific language concerning unavoidably unsafe but useful products such as explosives selective weed killers pesticides and prescription pharmaceuticals and that this language should address a benefit-to-risk evaluation of the product see further a v national blood supra note 118  35i 43i 153 a v national blood supra note 118  68-69 71 154 to the benefits of a product where a known or knowable risk of harm was kept from the consumer thereby depriving them of an effective choice on running that risk other difficulties may arise in cases where the products benefits might vary any vaccine that is developed in response to the virus might initially be effective but later become less so with subsequent virus mutation it is fair to say that the issue remains controversial legally and ripe for further argument in the context of an emergency perhaps the most obvious way in which legitimate safety expectations may be lowered in the context of the pandemic is by a producer providing information and warnings accompanying the product as part of its presentation this must be considered by the court pursuant to article 61a pld 160 a product that poses a known or knowable additional risk because of production at a time of pandemic but that warns about that additional risk in its presentation allows a consumer autonomy of choice and selfdetermination even if such risks are not posed by comparator products including those developed earlier in time the entitled safety expectations as judged by the court are likely to be sensitive to such presentation a producer who provides a warning that a ventilator has not been subject to a particular material test because it has been rapidly adapted from an earlier design or the producer of a medicine who draws the prevalence and seriousness of the risk of a particular side effect to the attention of the user may succeed in altering the courts assessment of the level of safety that the public is entitled to expect from it a related issue is the relevance of the fact that many medical products will be provided to a user through a doctor or other learned intermediary in england the relevance of this factor has been controversial in a v national blood burton j refused to transfer knowledge of a risk possessed by the intermediary to the patient 161 later cases however have shown more flexibility in wilkes the court proceeding by agreement regarded the presence of an intervening healthcare professional as a relevant circumstance 162 from this discussion it follows that the more specific the warning and the more likely the warning is to reach the ultimate user of the product the greater the chance of the producer avoiding liability we see this as a particularly useful tool for a producer to alter legitimate safety expectations in the context of this pandemic it is only for damage caused by a defect in his product 163 that a producer will be liable whether damage is so caused and the extent of any such damage must be proved by the 160 a parallel arises when considering contractual liability public statements about the specific characteristics of the goods made by the producer go to quality pursuant to cra s95 161 a v national blood supra note 118  55-56 65 162  106-08 see also gee supra note 143  168-69 163 pld art 1 claimant 164 subject to eu principles of effectiveness and equivalence national rules of causation are applicable in claims brought under the pld 165 this will result in a claimants prospects of success on this issue varying depending on the jurisdiction in w v sanofi the cjeu gave some guidance in a case where a patient developed deteriorating symptoms of multiple sclerosis shortly after he was vaccinated against hepatitis b the court held that the burden of establishing causation would be excessively difficult for a consumer to discharge if national law prohibited recourse to circumstantial methods of proof and instead required proof through scientific or medical research 166 conversely national rules were not allowed to make it too easy for the claimant and thus evidence must be sufficiently serious specific and consistent to establish the defect as the most plausible explanation for the damage 167 in addition to scrutinising applicable national rules against such principles claims arising in the context of the pandemic may give rise to a number of particular causation issues first there are those cases where the use of the product is said to have caused a particular side effect such as in w v sanofi this type of issue is perhaps most likely to arise where the product is a medicine or vaccine but it could also be an issue where a device or piece of ppe is said to have caused an adverse reaction much here will depend upon the content of national rules and the precise factual picture concerning the side effect in question and its mechanism prevalence and link with the product both generically and individually in the particular case where even a non-defective product would carry the risk of developing a particular adverse effect the court may need to engage with controversies such as how defect is to be conceptualised 168 and whether it is necessary for the claimant to establish that the relative risk of the adverse event with the defective product was greater than 2 in order to succeed in the causal enquiry 169 a second type of case is where it is alleged that the defect in the product caused the claimant to become infected with the virus and thereby sustain recoverable damage a defect in a piece of ppe or in the composition of a hand gel or even in a vaccine might result in that product providing inadequate protection against infection by sars-cov-2 in such a case if a claimant becomes infected causation issues will 164 pld art 4 165 see w v sanofi supra note 138  25-27 r goldberg causation

requirement and if so and if so whether there is any discretion as to its application see rs carruth and bd goldstein relative risk greater than two in proof of causation in toxic tort arise as to 1 whether the claimant became infected as a result of the defect in the product as opposed to some other source and 2 whether even if she did she would have been likely to be infected and sustain the same or more serious damage in any event the burden in each case is on the claimant in england where there are competing potential causes the judge must be satisfied that the defect in the product was the more probable that may be straightforward enough where the competing explanations are themselves not improbable even if uncommon however the judge is not compelled to accept a remaining improbable theory after having eliminated impossible theories from those advanced by the parties 170 applying such an approach to issue 1 causation may prove very difficult to discharge whilst there is much still to learn about this particular virus and its mechanism of transmission current indications are that it is highly transmissible and infectious 171 this coupled with both an incubation period and increasing general prevalence throughout populations is likely to make the claimants task of proving the defective product as the reason for the infection more difficult these features are also likely to pose challenges where issue 2 arises the more other opportunities for infection the more likely it will be that infection and damage would have been sustained in any event even aside from infection there might be arguments as to whether the ultimate patient outcome would have resulted in any event would a patient who became infected due to a defective product have died anyway within a similar timescale some work suggests that although the death rate is higher than previous averages for the time of year given the profile of those most at risk a considerable proportion of the deaths might have occurred in any event 172 does it matter for causation purposes whether factually there would not have been a nondefective alternative product available to the claimant eg a non-defective ventilator instead of the rapidly produced defective one that was used other issues may also arise in relation to the chain of causation defective tests for either the virus or for antibodies to it may give false-positive or false-negative results a false-positive result that a person has the virus at a point in time is less likely to result in personal injury being sustained but harm resulting from a falsenegative result may extend beyond damage to the patient in question whose treatment might be delayed 173  and lead the person in question to engage in activities or not triggering contact tracing such that others become infected quite apart from the real practical issues about establishing the true cause of infection in a particular 170 see ide v atb sales limited 2008 ewca civ 424 ca

when the chain of causation can be said to be broken might prove important similarly with defective antibody tests a false-negative result that someone has not had the virus might lead to over-caution and perhaps pure economic losses not recoverable under the pld but probably not personal injury false-positive results might not only result in the patient exposing themselves to the risk of infection in a way that they would not have otherwise done 174 but also their increased exposure might lead to infection and them infecting others unknowingly article 7e pld provides the producer with a defence if he proves that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered this provides an exculpatory route for the producer when the defect could not have been known about it is most likely to arise in relation to the current pandemic when new products are being created such as vaccines medicines and test kits for existing products that are being adapted or used to treat covid-19 it would only be relevant if the virus created a danger by interacting with those products in a manner that could not have been anticipated the question addressed here is not so much about gaps in knowledge related to the virus and covid-19 of which we know there are many but rather about the lack of knowledge of risks posed by the product where the risk emanates from the interaction between the product and the viruscovid-19 there will be issues about the extent to which knowledge was discoverable based on extrapolations from the existing state of scientific and technical knowledge the development risks defence was one of the most controversial aspects of the pld it was not included in the original text and was forced upon the commission by member states concerned to protect innovative industry the reluctance of the commission to embrace the defence is reflected in it having being made optional 175 the commissions lack of enthusiasm for the defence also suggests that it was intended to have a narrow scope although its actual breadth will have to be derived from the text of the directive as interpreted by the court of justice the burden is squarely placed on the producer to establish the defence and further suggests a narrow role 176 the parameters of the defence define just how strict the products liability regime is 177 174 but see g lawton can you catch the coronavirus twice we dont know yet new scientist 25 march 2020 httpswwwnewscientistcomarticlemg24532754-600-can-you-catch-the-coronavirus-twice-we-dont-know-yet however even if the defence is narrowly construed that does not mean that the regime is oblivious to the challenge faced by those producing goods to meet emergencies our discussion of defect illustrated how many of the concerns of producers about unfair expectations of safety when responding to an emergency can be assuaged by taking into account the time at which the product was put into circulation or pragmatically adjusting entitled expectations by reference to warnings as to risk given by the producer this defence is about unknown and unknowable risks not about known risks in an uncertain environment in exploring the contours of the defence available under the pld guidance can be found in the decision of the court of justice in commission v united kingdom 178 the commission considered that the uks implementation of the defence was too generous the uks implementation determines knowledge by reference by the standards of the producer of products of the same description as the product in question and talks in terms of whether such a producer might be expected to discover the defect thus potentially introducing expectations into a test that seemed in the pld to be based on simple discoverability 179 the court relying heavily on the opinion of advocate-general tesauro found that the commission had not established that the uk was in breach because it could not then be said that the uk courts would not interpret the different wording in conformity with the directive the court made some pertinent comments on the substantive scope of the defence in particular it stated the defence was directed unreservedly at the state of scientific and technical knowledge including the most advanced level of such knowledge at the time when the product in question was put into circulation 180 the advocate-general explained that the logic was for the producer to bear only quantifiable risks but not development risks which are by their nature unquantifiable 181 hence the producer has to bear the foreseeable risks against which he can protect himself by taking either preventive measures by stepping up experimentation and research investment or measures to cover himself by taking out civil liability insurance against any damage caused by defects in the product 182 in a powerful indication that the defence was narrow in scope the advocate-general was clear that one isolated opinion would be sufficient to deprive the producer of the defence the court confirmed the defence was concerned with the most advanced state of knowledge 183 and whilst confirming the test was objective gave some relief to producers by 178 determining the relevant scientific and technical knowledge must have been accessible 184 the defence is intended to protect innovators against unknowable risks it does not protect against products that have discoverable defects but that were produced in haste to meet an emergency to the extent that products carry extra risk due to emergency production this is a matter for assessment under the defectiveness standard as advocate-general tesauro noted the practicability of measures is irrelevant to the defence 185 failure to apply normal testing or to undertake research ought in principle not to be excused by the emergency on one reading of the uk legislation it could be arguable that some knowledge that producers might normally be expected to have might not similarly be expected of producers manufacturing in an emergency however the court of justice has clearly cut off such an interpretation by equating knowledge with the most advanced state of knowledge anything that would have been discovered by established scientific and technical testing procedures would have been discoverable rather than manipulate principles that may affect later cases in more normal times and circumstances the emergency context should if at all be addressed as a sui generis matter possible options are considered in section vi below it was noted above that the speed of production may lead to increased manufacturing defects the defence has no application to such defects the german supreme court so held when imposing liability on the producer of a carbonated mineral water bottle 186 burton j in a v national blood authority 187 agreed with the caveat that the defence might be available on the first occasion such a defect arose it might be possible to quibble about this approach as the wording of the defence talks about discoverability of the defect and as science and technology have not enabled sufficiently accurate quality assurance testing there seems to be an argument the defence should apply however there seems to be a consensus that it does not apply to such manufacturing defects this also follows the logic of the advocate-general in that such manufacturing defects are foreseeable probably inevitable and so it is for the producer to determine what steps it takes to bear those risks certainly increased manufacturing flaws resulting from haste of production would not be covered by the defence the defence is intended to shield some design defects from liability given the lack of knowledge of the risks that rendered the product defective the key to understanding its scope is to determine how scientific and technical knowledge should be understood jane stapleton has been very critical of how the court of justice formulated its understanding of knowledge 188 she is worried that a random guess by someone without scientific training could prove to be correct and undermine the producers defence we have already seen there is a welter of speculation and misinformation 184 about the sars-cov-2 virus as medicines and vaccines begin to emerge we can expect even more stories and lay theories to emerge if one or more of these by chance turns out to be correct does that remove the defence it is unlikely the advocate-general referred to knowledge based on research 189 random guesses and speculation are not research he also said the producers conduct for the purpose of the defence should be assessed using the yardstick of the knowledge of an expert in the sector 190 although there may be debate about exactly what that encompasses it certainly excludes random guesses and lay speculation furthermore the chance discoveries of facts must have been accessible to the producer on the other hand the isolated opinion of one scientist that turns out to have been correct will constitute knowledge and remove the defence the logic is that the risk is quantifiable and so the producer has the choice of undertaking further investigation to assess its exposure or take out insurance however the minority opinion must be accessible advocate-general tesauro famously gave the example of a european producer not being expected to know the work of a manchurian academic published in a local scientific journal in chinese that does not go outside the region 191 it can be argued that this accessibility requirement was a creation of the court and that in fact with modern search engines language should not be such a barrier to accessibility as burton j in a v national blood authority 192 noted there are problems with the manchurian example for if manchuria was renowned for a product then research there may be highly relevant the example is strikingly relevant for covid-19 given the chinese origins of the virus and early experiences of how the virus affects humans it is undeniable that manchurian research will be vital to understanding this area an accessibility requirement raises a further issue of whether the knowledge that is kept private within a research laboratory of a pharmaceutical company amounts to knowledge for the purpose of the defence in an obiter statement burton j in a v national blood authority 193 considered that an unpublished document or unpublished research not available to the general public retained within the laboratory or research department of a particular company would not be considered accessible this would clearly be the case if the research was undertaken by another company a company might seek to suggest that it also covered its own research that had not been made public as the court makes an objective assessment of knowledge not linked to any particular producer such a result would be unfortunate and we consider unlikely where a producer in fact has the knowledge of the defect or knowledge that enables the defect to be discovered the defence is lost and the producer liable the company may also of course be found to be negligent on such facts but it might be able to argue that it acted with due care so long as those results it obtained remained isolated instances the most difficult question is to know whether the producer loses the defence at a stage before a specific risk was identified but at a time when the means to make that discovery 189 commission v united kingdom supra note 148 ag 21 190 ibid ag 20 191 ibid ag  23-24 192 a v national blood supra note 118 24 193 ibid 49 were known only rarely are discoveries accidents the most famous example of an accidental discovery is sir alexander flemings discovery of the antibiotic qualities of penicillin by noticing that on returning from holiday the mould on the culture prevented the growth of staphylococci for the most part though the knowledge required for almost all new discoveries normally exists in some form through a process of bringing that knowledge together to test hypotheses new knowledge is generated one approach is to maintain that until the creative leap is made of putting the information together and testing the hypotheses the defence should not be lost 194 however the advocate-general in commission v united kingdom talks about the defence being available only where it was impossible to discover the defect 195 pugh and pilgerstorfer therefore have argued that so long as there was the possibility of discovering the defect the defences should not be available 196 the difficulty is to work out what is meant by possibility certainly if there was a test or procedure available and it was simply not applied to a new vaccine or drug it is easy to see how it can be said that there was knowledge to enable the defect to be discovered equally bringing random pieces of knowledge not previously thought to be connected together with the benefit of hindsight might not be legitimately described as the basis for a possible discovery the more challenging case is where there is relevant related information such as about the vaccine or medicine and its effects on humans when used with viruses that are similar to covid-19 the exact effect of the drugs will only be established after testing but it is arguable that the knowledge to make it possible to discover the defect already existed even if no one had thought to make the connection the defect might not be reasonably discoverable but it may still have been possible to discover it it may be telling that the burden of proof is on the producer to show it was impossible to discover the defect given that most consumer products are subject to some standards and that many products are in fact highly regulated the impact of those diverse rules on the preconditions of liability has been a common feature of the case law and the relevant commentary the relationship between regulation and liability has however been a complex one even in normal times 197 the focus of legal analysis has traditionally been upon the impact of regulation on the notion of defect under the pld under english law the relevance of a products compliance with regulations has been examined in two recent cases in wilkes the judge indicated that whilst regulatory approval per se does not constitute an automatic defence it could nonetheless be relevant to the notion of defect as such approval may be evidence and in an appropriate case powerful evidence that the level of safety of the product was that which persons generally were entitled to 194 stapleton supra note 178 at 59 195 commission v united kingdom supra note 148 ag 7 196 pugh and pilgerstorfer supra note 178 197 see generally r goldberg medicinal product liability and regulation oxford hart 2013 ch 7 expect 198 in gee andrews j generally agreed with the so-called holistic approach in wilkes 199 warning however that the weight to be placed on such compliance is a matter of fact and degree in the individual case and it may be of no relevance at all 200 the judge nonetheless recognised that there may be cases where standards are highly relevant to the defect alleged as had been indicated in wilkes in an appropriate case compliance with    standards will have considerable weight because they have been set at a level which the appropriate regulatory authority has determined is appropriate for safety purposes 201 from these excerpts whilst the regulatory context is of relevance 202 it is also clear that there is no general regulatory compliance defence in english law 203 a similar approach has been taken in other countries in germany the bundesgerichtshof bgh has adopted the position that compliance with safety regulations or standards may be important but not a complete defence 204 in france supplementary language was added to the implemented provisions so as to emphasise this point article 1245-9 of the french civil code thus provides that the producer may be liable for a defect even though the product has been manufactured in accordance with the rules of the trade or of existing norms or where it was the subject of an administrative authorization the pld does of course envisage a limited defence of compliance with standards in article 7d where a defect is due to the compliance of the product with mandatory regulations that provision is a long way from being a broad compliance defence as it applies only where the product defect is specifically attributable to compliance with the statutory requirements 205  the defence has as a consequence rarely been invoked 206 it is true that in the current circumstances governmental bodies are becoming more closely involved in the production process of certain critical products than they would in normal circumstances 207 it would however be necessary for very precise standards to be prescribed by the public sector for say ventilators or for protective equipment and for those very standards to be the cause of the defect for the latter to be attributable to compliance with the regulatory requirement as required by the statutory wording under the cpa 208 more radical shields from liability have also been called for quasi-immunities for emergency products such as those that have been put into effect in the usa by virtue of the prep act which we review below are unlikely to be acceptable or desirable in europe 209 the issue that does arise in a european context is the extent to which emergency regulatory responses such as fast-track or modified procedures or potentially regulatory exemptions should be taken into account in any subsequent damages claim from a common law position it is well established within the tort of negligence that the fact that defendants were responding to an emergency at the time of their alleged negligence can affect the requisite standard of care 210 this is illustrated by cases concerning the emergency services in robinson v chief constable of west yorkshire a claim against the police when a passer-by was injured during the attempted arrest of a suspected drug-dealer on a busy high street lord reed underlined the importance of not imposing unrealistically demanding standards of care on police officers acting in the course of their operational duties 211 other cases have illustrated that the courts will take account of the fact that defendants were undertaking activities in the public benefit when they caused an accident 212 the uk legislator has also intervened to ensure that courts take into account the acts for the benefit of society and the dangers of requiring excessive precautions though it is unclear whether this has added anything to the approach already adopted under the common law 213 from the perspective of the pld we have already seen above that the regulatory context is likely to be relevant to the issue of defect to what extent however might that analysis be modulated or heightened in an emergency situation where somewhat different regulatory approaches are taken one argument might be that where regulatory demands are reduced and the processes accelerated then the entitled expectations of safety might also be lowered that might be seen as analogous to the common law position of modulating the standard of care in response to emergency conditions however it is to be noted that in the english cases where the defendant is not acting in an absolute emergency and does have time for considered thought the courts have given a nuanced response as to whether it is acceptable to subject others to greater risk of injury than is normally regarded as acceptable to avert a greater harm 214 moreover the underlying theme of the regulatory response to medicines in the current climate as outlined above is that the benchmark standard of appropriate benefit risk is still applicable even within the context of accelerated assessment procedures from this standpoint should the expectations of safety not also be maintained it might be thought that the integrity of and confidence in the regulatory framework for medicines is as important if not more important during emergencies than in normal times that will of course need to be informed by the delicate decision of how the fair apportionment of the risks inherent in modern technological production 215 should be made and one in which the fault of the producer is not the determining factor one approach would be for the government to bear the costs of damages from products supplied in an emergency this was the approach of the usa under the national swine flu immunization program of 1976 when plaintiffs were required to assert claims directly against the federal government but the exposure to limitless damages caused the usa to adopt a different approach in the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 that introduced a no-fault regime with caps on damages 216 unless governments steps in to become the producers of products related to covid-19 217 the question arises as to whether the current emergency warrants any adaptations being made to the existing liability rules these might take the form of the government undertaking to indemnify producers either contractually or based on a special law another option is to exempt certain products from traditional product liability laws finally alternative arrangements for dealing with the claims of victims related to the emergency might be foreseen previous health crises show that contractual indemnities have been accorded by governments to manufacturers in order to offset risks arising from emergency products and examples are emerging within the current pandemic 218 this was the case during the h1n1 pandemic in 2009 in that context producers of vaccines soughtand obtainedvery extensive indemnity clauses in respect of any injury sustained by those vaccinated due to side effects even though such clauses might have been thought questionable under normal contract law doctrines 219 this approach attracted criticism from many quarters and gave rise to a critical council of europe report 220 accompanied by a strongly worded resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe that stated inter alia that member states should ensure that the private sector does not gain undue profit from public health scares and that it is not allowed to absolve itself of liabilities with a view to privatising profits whilst sharing the risks 221 as a consequence member states were urged along with other measures to develop and implement clear national guidelines for dealing with the private sector and to co-operate with one another in negotiations with international corporations whenever necessary it is unclear whether this advice was heeded more generally the resolution was very critical of how the pandemic had been handled in general terms and statedsomewhat ominouslythat the assembly feared that the lack of transparency and accountability will result in a drop in confidence in the advice given by major public health institutions this may prove disastrous in the case of a next disease of pandemic scope which may turn out to be much more severe than the h1n1 influenza 222 this salutary experience illustrates that extreme caution needs to be exercised in terms of any indemnities offered to producers and that it is preferable for states to cooperate internationally in order to obtain a better result from contractual negotiations with product manufacturers in times of crisis the usa is one country that has provision for exempting producers from liability in public health emergencies the powers are contained in the prep act 223 these have already been invoked in the current crisis the department of health and human services issued a statutory declaration effective from 4 february 2020 that countermeasures to which the exemption applied were antiviral any other drug any biologic any diagnostic any other device or any vaccine used to treat diagnose cure prevent or mitigate covid-19 or the transmission of sars-cov-2 or a virus mutating therefrom or any device used in the administration of any such product and all components and constituent materials of any such product 224 drugs biologics 219 see fairgrieve and goldberg supra note 199 ch 6 220 and devices must however have an emergency use authorisation eua pressure to add respirators led to a fourth category of countermeasures being added in the families first coronavirus responses act 2020 to cover certain respirators approved by the national institute for occupational safety and health 225 those injured can make a claim under the countermeasures injury compensation program cicp this only covers serious physical injury viz one that warranted hospitalisation though there is no requirement for actual hospitalisation or that led to a significant loss of function or disability however compensation is limited to reasonable and necessary medical benefits andor lost wages death benefits are also available in the us context the coverage of healthcare costs is significant but this scheme is certainly less generous than the amounts attainable under a private law action there seems to be a surprising degree of acceptance in the usa that private entities acting in the public good should benefit from these immunities 226 in these scenarios it should be remembered that costs do not disappear if the harm is not compensated for it is just left to be borne by the unfortunate victim such a wideranging carve-out of liability leaving victims forced to accept much lower levels of state compensation is unlikely to be acceptable in europe and would require a significant amendment to the pld europe is more likely to nudge victims towards alternative forms of compensation than to deprive victims of their private law rights a more acceptable approach from a european perspective might be to develop no-fault compensation schemes these would seek to divert claimants from traditional private law ligation to a scheme that offers easier access to compensation albeit sometimes with lower amounts being available such schemes are common in relation to vaccine damage claims even where the victim receives lower compensation this solution may be palatable as that outcome will be chosen by the victim who in theory still has the option of litigating under normal rules and conditions such schemes must therefore be sufficiently attractive to victims 227 there are several motivations for treating victims favourably in some situations so as to justify the development of a no-fault response for them 228 these might apply to the victims of experimental testing kits medicines and vaccines used in an emergency if they cause harm there might for instance be sympathy for the victims where they are seen as guinea pigs for products that offered hope for the wider population there will also be a desire not to have a potentially large number of complex cases jamming the courts with complicated and drawn-out litigation this motive does not only focus on the plight of the victims but there will also be a desire to reduce transaction costs by avoiding unnecessary legal and experts fees that often make the legal system seem expensive and inefficient however a major motivation of vaccine damage schemes has been the social goal of promoting vaccination this is particularly important as vaccine programmes require high take-up rates to make immunity effective vaccine compensation payments help secure compliance with vaccination programmes this is evident in germany where the supreme court first provided assistance to victims of vaccines by extending a doctrine according to which the state must compensate a citizen forced to sacrifice hisher rights for the benefit of the public 229 this was then codified in the bundesseuchengesetz federal epidemics act bseuchg of 1961 230 in the uk it was noted in the british medical journal that the moral justification for compensation    is based on the social contract national immunization programmes not only aim to protect the individual but also to protect society    if individuals are asked to accept a risk even a very small one partly for the benefit of society then it seems equitable that society should compensate the victims of occasional unlucky mishaps 231 restoring public confidence in vaccination was cited by prime minister james callaghan when he wrote to lord pearson asking that vaccine damage be considered in the royal commission into personal injury compensation 232 in france there is a special compensation scheme for injuries caused by compulsory vaccinations 233 compensation is due whenever a claimant proves that an injury has been caused by a mandatory vaccine claims based on this special compensation scheme must be brought before a special compensation fund oniam 234 if a claimant is not satisfied with oniams proposal of compensation appeal can be made to an administrative court 235 adopting special schemes to deal with unique product liability circumstances is a familiar technique known to many european legal systems 236 acceptance of the no-fault regime may well turn on the level of benefits and ease of obtaining compensation the french system provides full compensation in line with civil liability 237 the german system provides generous social security benefits the uk has an upper limit of 120000 and awards will often be a lot less than tort damages for similar harm this contrasts with an average payment under the us national childhood vaccine injury act of over half a million dollars between 2006 and 2016 238 it is likely that the efficiency gains from no-fault liability will include not merely lower transaction costs but also lower payments to victims than under tort law to make such a voluntary system a realistic alternative the amounts need nevertheless to be sufficiently attractive however the conditions for recovery can even make a scheme that is less generous than the tort system appealing sadly to date the track record of state schemes has not been auspicious with the german scheme frequently contesting causation issues 239 and under the uk scheme a child victims case was taken to the court of appeal by the state arguing damages should not be assessed based on future needs 240 claims in the uk also often fail for want of causation recent figures show that over 65 of claims fail for that reason 241 the system can also be made attractive by proving alternative dispute resolution procedures that are more accessible than the traditional courts in the uk there is a special tribunal but as we have seen there remains an appeal route to the court of appeal times of crisis bring out the best and worst features of humanity tackling covid-19 has demonstrated the courage of health and essential workers and the ingenuity of researchers and engineers in producing products to prevent the spread of the virus treat the disease it causes and hopefully going forward immunise and protect the population there have also been instances of fraudulent claims and ineffective products being rushed to market and examples of profiteering however for those genuinely trying to produce products for the pandemic there is a degree of uncertainty engendered by producing at speed in the context of a virus about which knowledge is incomplete but about which new information is emerging rapidly there is also the prospect of the virus itself mutating regulatory practices have been amended to assist products entering the market as soon as reasonably possible but the unknown for any producer is any potential downstream civil liability producing in an emergency will not per se provide a defence to civil liability though it might 237 see generally s taylor medical accident liability and redress in english and french law cambridge cambridge university press 2015 ch 2 238 see hrsa data and statistics available at httpswwwhrsagovsitesdefaultfileshrsavaccinecompensationdatamonthly-stats-february-2019pdf admittedly this is under a different damages regime where medical expenses recovery is more significant than in europe 239 be a factor to be taken into account the above discussion has highlighted the range of issues that may be in play in any litigation making the outcome unpredictable products such as ppe sanitisers and ventilators have already been used or will be soon for them it is probably already too late to create an alternative legal regime the risks are highest for producers of medicines and particularly vaccines the victims of side effects from vaccines have the most pressing claims as they were both healthy before immunisation and immunisation is needed for the greater public good the price of any vaccine is likely to be high given the investment costs and potentially short-term need for vaccination if the virus is supressed if cover for legal liability has to be factored in this will further hike the price as insurers or selfinsuring pharmaceutical companies will have to assume a worst-case scenario companies may press for government indemnities but the track record has shown that these can be unfair towards states in a weak bargaining position when responding to public concerns in emergencies an alternative is to go down the us route of exempting goods supplied in an emergency to meet pandemics but we feel in europe that such a loss of rights is not acceptable or justified despite the circumstances instead the option of a no-fault regime should be considered 242 the risks of litigation are also present for the victims and instead of spending money on the costs of the litigation system it may be desirable to divert victims to a compensation fund however the sums available need to be sufficiently high that victims are not tempted to still risk turning to litigation to top-up the award compensation can be based on need rather than tort principles and economics suggests that they will be attractive if they represent a better bargain than gambling on the uncertain outcome of litigation some may advocate that curtailing litigation rights might be made a condition for accessing the fund though that would need to be considered carefully and may raise human rights concerns history shows that european governments usually respond to the needs of their citizens who suffer such tragedies 243 being proactive in establishing such a fund may both make any immunisation programme effective and reduce costs by giving industry some reassurance that it is unlikely to be overwhelmed by claims it also fits in with a philosophy that prefers to nudge citizens to make the choices the state wants rather than imposing a system and removing existing rights  effects of information-dependent vaccination behavior on coronavirus outbreak insights from a siri model bruno buonomo  a mathematical model is proposed to assess the effects of a vaccine on the time evolution of a coronavirus outbreak the model has the basic structure of siri compartments susceptible-infectious-recovered-infectious and is implemented by taking into account of the behavioral changes of individuals in response to the available information on the status of the disease in the community we found that the cumulative incidence may be significantly reduced when the information coverage is high enough andor the information delay is short especially when the reinfection rate is high enough to sustain the presence of the disease in the community this analysis is inspired by the ongoing outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus covid-19  aviruses can infect people and then spreading from person-to-person however this may happen with serious consequences well known cases are that of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which killed 813 people worldwide during 2002-2003 outbreak 29  and the more recent case of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers where a total of 2494 confirmed cases including 858 associated deaths were reported the majority from saudi arabia at the end of november 2019 30  therefore coronavirus may represent a serious public health threat the emergency related to the novel outbreak in china is still ongoing at time of writing this article and it is unclear how the situation worldwide will unfold the news released by media create great concern and behavioral changes can be observed in the everyday life of individuals even in europe where at the moment only few cases have been reported for example the fear of coronavirus has driven rapidly to sold out of protective face masks in pharmacies in italy long before the first case in the country was reported 1  a specific aspects of diseases caused by coronavirus is that humans can be reinfected with respiratory coronaviruses throughout life 19  the duration of immunity for sars for example was estimated to be greater than 3 years 34  moreover investigations on human coronavirus with infected volunteers has shown that even though the immune system react after the infection serum-specific immunoglobulin and igc antibody levels peak 12-14 days after infection at one year following experimental infection there is only partial protection against re-infection with the homologous strain 9  predictions or insight concerning the time-evolution of epidemics especially when a new emerging infectious disease is under investigation can be obtained by using mathematical models in mathematical epidemiology a large amount of literature is devoted to the use of the so called compartmental epidemic models where the individuals of the community affected by the infectious disease are divided in mutually exclusive groups the compartments according to their status with respect to the disease 3 4 10 21 24  compartmental epidemic models are providing to be the first mathematical approach for estimating the epidemiological parameter values of covid-19 in its early stage and for anticipating future trends 2 11 28  when the disease under interest confer permanent immunity from reinfection after being recovered the celebrated sir model susceptible-infectious-recovered and its many variants are most often adopted however where reinfection cannot be neglected the sirs model susceptible-infectious-recovered and again susceptible and its variants may be used under the assumption that infection does not change the host susceptibility 3 4 10 21 24  since the disease of our interest has both reinfection and partial immunity after infection we consider as starting point the so-called siri model susceptibleinfectious-recovered-infectious which takes into account of both these features see 25 and the references contained therein for further information on siri model when the epidemic process may be decoupled from the longer time-scale demographic dynamics i e when birth and natural death terms may be neglected one gets a simpler model with an interesting property in fact according to the values of three relevant parameters the transmission rate the recovery rate and the reinfection rate the model exhibits three different dynamics 18 20  i no epidemic will occur in the sense that the fraction of infectious will decrease from the initial value to zero ii an epidemic outbreak occurs in the sense that the fraction of infectious will initially increase till a maximum value is reached and then it decreases to zero iii an epidemic outbreak occurs and the disease will permanently remain within the population at time of writing this paper scholars are racing to make a vaccine for the novel covid-19 coronavirus available as of february 12 2020 it was announced that the first vaccine could be ready in 18 months 32  therefore it becomes an intriguing problem to qualitatively assess how the administration of a vaccine could affect the outbreak taking into account of the behavioral changes of individuals in response to the information available on the status of the disease in the community this is the main aim of this paper the scenario depicted here is that of a community where a relatively small quantity of infectious is present at time of delivering the vaccine the vaccination is assumed to be fully voluntary and the choice to get vaccinated or not is assumed to depend in part on the available information and rumors concerning the spread of the disease in the community the behavioral change of individuals is introduced by employing the method of information-dependent models 14 15 33 which is based on the introduction of a suitable information index such an approach has been applied to general infectious diseases 8 14 15 23 33 as well as specific ones including childhood diseases like measles mumps and rubella 14 33 and is currently under development for very recent papers see 5 22 35  therefore another goal of this manuscript is to provide an application of the information index to a simple model containing relevant features of a coronavirus disease specifically we use epidemiological parameter values based on early estimation of novel coronavirus covid-19 28  the rest of the paper is organized as follows in sect 2 we introduce the basic siri model and recall its main properties in sect 3 we implement the siri model by introducing the information-dependent vaccination the epidemic and the reinfection thresholds are discussed in sect 4 section 5 is devoted to numerical investigations the effects of the information parameters on the time evolution of the outbreak are discussed conclusions and future perspective are given in sect 6 since the disease of our interest has both reinfection and partial immunity after infection we first consider the siri model which is given by the following nonlinear ordinary differential equations the upper dot denotes the time derivative 18  here s i and r denote respectively the fractions of susceptible infectious and also infected and recovered individuals at a time t the dependence on t is omitted  is the transmission rate  is the recovery rate  is the birthdeath rate   0 1 is the reduction in susceptibility due to previous infection model 1 assumes that the time-scale under consideration is such that demographic dynamics must be considered however epidemics caused by coronavirus often occurs quickly enough to neglect the demographic processes as in the case of sars in 2002 2003  when the epidemic process is decoupled from demography ie when   0 one obviously gets the reduced model this very simple model has interesting properties indeed introduce the basic reproduction number r 0    it has been shown that the solutions have the following behavior 20  if r 0  1 then no epidemic will occur in the sense that the state variable i t denoting the fraction of infectious will decrease from the initial value to zero if r 0  1 1  then an epidemic outbreak will follow in the sense that the state variable i t will initially increase till a maximum value is reached and then it decreases to zero if r 0  1  then an epidemic outbreak will follow and the disease will permanently remain within the population in the sense that the state variable i t will approach after a possibly non monotone transient an endemic equilibrium e given by where the equilibrium e is globally asymptotically stable 20 and it is interesting to note that since the demography has been neglected the disease will persist in the population due to the reservoir of partially susceptible individuals in the compartment r from a mathematical point of view the threshold r 0  r 0  where r 0  1  is a bifurcation value for model 2  this does not happen for model 1  in fact when demography is included in the model the endemic equilibrium exists for r 0  1 where r 0      and therefore both below and above the reinfection threshold model 2 as well as 1 is a simple model which is able to describe the timeevolution of the epidemic spread on a short time-scale however it does not takes into account of possible control measure the simplest one to consider is vaccination we consider the scenario where the vaccination is assumed to be fully voluntary in order to emphasize the role of reinfection we assume that only susceptible individuals ie individuals that did not experience the infection consider this protective option when the vaccine is perfect ie it is an ideal vaccine which confer 100 percent life-long immunity one gets the following model where v denotes the fraction of vaccinated individuals and  0 is the vaccination rate in the next section we will modify the siri model 4 to assess how an hypothetical vaccine could control the outbreak taking into account of the behavioral changes of individuals produced by the information available on the status of the disease in the community we modify the siri model by employing the idea of the information-dependent epidemic models 23 33  we assume that the vaccination is fully voluntary and information-dependent in the sense that the choice to get vaccinated or not depends on the available information and rumors concerning the spread of the disease in the community the information is mathematically represented by an information index mt which summarizes the information about the current and past values of the disease and is given by the following distributed delay 12 13 14 16  here the functiong describes the information that individuals consider to be relevant for making their choice to vaccinate or not to vaccinate it is often assumed thatg depends only on prevalence 5 12 14 16  where g is a continuous differentiable increasing function such that g0  0 in particular we assume that in 6 the parameter k is the information coverage and may be seen as a summary of two opposite phenomena the disease under-reporting and the level of media coverage of the status of the disease which tends to amplify the social alarm the range of variability of k may be restricted to the interval 0 1 see 6  the delay kernel k t in 5 is a positive function such that  0 k tdt  1 and represents the weight given to past history of the disease we assume that the kernel is given by the first element erl 1a t of the erlangian family called weak kernel or exponentially fading memory this means that the maximum weight is assigned to the current information and the delay is centered at the average 1a therefore the parameter a takes the meaning of inverse of the average time delay of the collected information on the disease with this choice by applying the linear chain trick 26  the dynamics of m is ruled by the equation we couple this equation with model 4 the coupling is realized through the following information-dependent vaccination rate where the constant  0  0 1 represents the fraction of the population that chooses to get vaccinate regardless of rumors and information about the status of the disease in the population and  1 mt represents the fraction of the population whose vaccination choice is influenced by the information generally speaking we require that  1 0  0 and  1 is a continuous differentiable and increasing function however as done in 5 14  we take where   0 this parametrization leads to an overall coverage of 1 asymptotically for m   here we take   001 which means a roof of 99 in vaccine uptakes under circumstances of high perceived risk we also take d  500 14  note that this choice of parameter values implies that a 964 vaccination coverage is obtained in correspondence of an information index m  007 see fig 1  finally we assume that the vaccine is not perfect which is a more realistic hypothesis so that the vaccinated individuals may be infected but with a reduced susceptibility  the siri epidemic model with information-dependent vaccination that we consider is therefore given by the meaning of the state variables the parameters and their baseline values are given in table 1  note that 9 to get let us introduce the quantity which is the basic reproduction number of model 2 20  from the second equation of 9 it easily follows that where it immediately follows that if i 0  0 then assuming that i 0  0 and r0  v 0  0 and therefore s0  1 it follows that if p 0  1s0 then the epidemic curve initially decays if p 0  1s0 the epidemic takes place since the infectious curve initially grows from the first equation in 9 it can be seen that at equilibrium it must bes  0 therefore all the possible equilibria are susceptible-free since the solutions are clearly bounded this means that for large time any individual who was initially susceptible has experienced the disease or has been vaccinated looking for equilibria in the form e   r m  from 10 we get disease-free equilibria if  0 it can be easily seen from 12 that therefore there are infinitely many disease-free equilibria of the form endemic equilibrium we begin by looking for equilibria such that this implies that therefore  0 andr it follows that an unique susceptibles-free endemic equilibrium exists which is given by where which exists only if the quantity is the reinfection threshold when    c the disease may spread and persist inside the community where the individuals live note that in classical sir models the presence of an endemic state is due to the replenishment of susceptibles ensured by demography 20  which is not the case here the local stability analysis of e 1 requires the jacobian matrix of system 10 taking into account of 13 14 and that v 1  0 it follows the eigenvalues are and the eigenvalues of the submatrix the trace is negative and the determinant is so that e 1 is locally asymptotically stable i the stable endemic state e 1 can be realized thanks to the imperfection of the vaccine in the sense that when   0 in 9 the variable v is always increasing ii the information index in the form described in sect 3 may be responsible of the onset of sustained oscillations in epidemic models both in the case of delayed information see eg 12 14 16 17  and instantaneous information as it happens when the latency time is included in the model 7  in all these mentioned cases the epidemic spread is considered on a long time-scale and demography is taken into account the analysis in this section clearly shows that sustained oscillations are not possible for the short time-scale siri model with information table 1 5 we use epidemiological parameter values based on early estimation of novel coronavirus covid-19 provided in 28  the estimation based on the use of a seir metapopulation model of infection within chinese cities revealed that the transmission rate within the city of wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak was 107 day 1  and the infectious period was 36 days so that   027 day 1  therefore the brn given in 11 is p 0  385 of course in agreement with the estimate in 28  and the value  c  1p 0  0259 is the threshold for the infection rate for vaccinated individuals the relative susceptibility compared to an unvaccinated individuals is set   015 which means that vaccine administration reduces the transmission rate by 85 vaccine efficacy  085 this value falls within the estimates for the most common vaccine used in the usa where vaccine efficacy ranges between 075 and 095 see table 9 3 p 222 in 24  as for the relative susceptibility of recovered individuals we consider two relevant baseline cases i case i   02 this value is representative of a reinfection value below the reinfection threshold  c  i case ii   04 this value is representative of a reinfection value above the reinfection threshold  c  the information parameter values are mainly guessed or taken from papers where the information dependent vaccination is used 5 14  the information coverage k ranges from a minimum of 02 ie the public is aware of 20 of the prevalence to 1 the average time delay of information ranges from the hypothetical case of immediate information t 0 to a delay of 120 days the description and baseline values of the parameters are presented in table 1  the initial data reflect a scenario in which a small portion of infectious is present in the community at time of administrating the vaccine furthermore coherently with the initial data mentioned in sect 4 we assume that and clearly s0  1  i 0 according to the analysis made in sect 4 values of  below the threshold  c implies that the epidemic will eventually die out when  is above  c  then the disease is sustained endemically by reinfection this behavior is illustrated in fig 2  where it is considered the worst possible scenario where k  02 and t  120 days in fig 2  left panel the continuous line is obtained for   02 vaccination is not able to influence the outbreak due to the large delay however even though an epidemic peak occurs after three weeks thereafter the disease dies out due to the low level of reinfection the case   04 is represented by the dotted line as expected the reinfection is able to restart the epidemic the trend here captured for one year would be to asymptotically converge to the endemic equilibrium e 1  the corresponding time evolution of the information index m is shown in fig 2  right panel in particular in the elimination case   02 the information index reaches a maximum of 0002 approx which corresponds to a vaccination rate of 515 see fig 1  after that it declines but due to memory of past events the information index is still positive months after the elimination of the disease the social alarm produced in the case   04 is somehow represented by the increasing continuous curve in fig 2  right panel at the end of the time frame it is m  0022 which corresponds to a vaccination rate of 91 in summary a large reinfection rate may produce a large epidemic however even in this worst scenario the feedback produced by behavioral changes due to information may largely affect the outbreak evolution in fig 3 table 1 model 10 is given by the quantity more informed people react and vaccinate and this in turn contribute to the elimination of the disease therefore a threshold value k c exists above which the disease can be eliminated an insight on the overall effect of parameter k on the epidemic may be determined by evaluating how it affects the cumulative incidence ci ie total number of new cases in the time frame 0 t f  we also introduce the following index which measures the relative change of cumulative incidence for two different values say p 1 and p 2  of a given parameter p over the simulated time frame in other words the percentage variation of the cumulative incidence varying p from p 2  in fig 4 first plot from the left it is shown the case of a reinfection value   02 that is under the reinfection threshold it can be seen how ci is declining with increasing k in fig 4 second plot from the left a comparison with the case of low information coverage k  02 is given a reduction till 80 of ci may be reached by increasing the value of k till k  099 when the reinfection value is   04 fig 4  third and fourth plot that is above the reinfection threshold the catastrofic case is represented in correspondence of k  02 this case is quickly recovered by increasing k as we already know from fig 3  because of the threshold value k c  between 02 and 03 which allows to pass from the endemic to no-endemic asymptotic state then again table 1 ci is declining with increasing k this means that when reinfection is high the effect of information coverage is even more important in fact in this case the prevalence is high and a high value of k result in a greater behavioral response by the population in fig 5 it is shown the influence of the information delay t on ci in the case   02 ci grows concavely with t first plot from the left in fig 5 second plot a comparison with the case of maximum information delay t  120 days is given a reduction till 75 of ci may be reached by reducing the value of t till to very few days when the reinfection value is   04 fig 5  third and fourth plot that is above the reinfection threshold ci increases convexly with t  a stronger decreasing effect on ci can be seen by reducing the delay from t  120 days to t  90 and a reduction till 98 of ci may be reached by reducing the value of t till to very few days in this paper we have investigated how a hypothetical vaccine could affect a coronavirus epidemic taking into account of the behavioral changes of individuals in response to the information about the disease prevalence we have first considered a basic siri model such a model contains the specific feature of reinfection which is typical of coronaviruses reinfection may allow the disease to persist even when the time-scale of the outbreak is small enough to neglect the demography births and natural death then we have implemented the siri model to take into account of i an available vaccine to be administrated on voluntary basis to susceptibles ii the change in the behavioral vaccination in response to information on the status of the disease we have seen that the disease burden expressed through the cumulative incidence may be significantly reduced when the information coverage is high enough andor the information delay is short when the reinfection rate is above the critical value a relevant role is played by recovered individuals this compartment offers a reservoir of susceptibles although with a reduced level of susceptibility and if not vaccinate may contribute to the re-emergence of the disease on the other hand in this case a correct and quick information may play an even more important role since the social alarm produced by high level of prevalence results in turn in high level of vaccination rate and eventually in the reduction or elimination of the disease the model on which this investigation is based is intriguing since partial immunity coupled to short-time epidemic behavior may lead to not trivial epidemic dynamics see the delayed epidemic case where an epidemics initially may decrease to take off later 27  however it has many limitations in representing the covid-19 propagation for example the model represents the epidemics in a closed community over a relatively short time-interval and therefore it is unable to capture the complexity of global mobility which is one of the main concerns related to covid-19 propagation another limitation which is again related to the global aspects of epidemics like sars and covid-19 is that we assume that individuals are influenced by information on the status of the prevalence within the community where they live ie the fraction i is part of the total population whereas local communities may be strongly influenced also by information regarding far away communities which are perceived as potential threats because of global mobility moreover in absence of treatment and vaccine local authorities face with coronavirus outbreak using social distancing measures that are not considered here individuals are forced to be quarantined or hospitalized nevertheless contact pattern may be reduced also as response to information on the status of the disease in this case the model could be modified to include an information-dependent contact rate as in 5 7  finally the model does not include the latency time and the diseaseinduced mortality is also neglected at the moment the estimate for covid-19 is at around 2 these aspects will be part of future investigations  a new transmission route for the propagation of the sars-cov-2 coronavirus danchin

specific way to handle the epidemic  background a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 spread from the capital of the hubei province in china to the rest of the country then to most of the world to anticipate future trends in the development of the epidemic we explore here based on public records of infected persons how variation in the virus tropism could end up in different patterns warranting specific way to handle the epidemic we use a compartmental model to describe the evolution of an individual through several possible states susceptible infected alternative infection detected and removed we fit the parameters of the model to the existing data taking into account significant quarantine changes where necessary the model indicates that wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms and a second propagation route are compatible with available data for singapore and shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet and the epidemic size limited the alternative infection tropism the gut tropism and a secondary propagation route are validated hypotheses using a model fitted by the available data corresponding prevention measures that take into account both routes should be implemented to the benefit of epidemic control late in 2019 a novel coronavirus named sars-cov-2 later on was detected in mainland china originating from the wuhan province the importance of the disease took some time to be acknowledged 12  resulting in a fairly significant number of infected persons who subsequently spread the disease throughout china 3 all provinces had at least one case on january 30th then world-wide this makes it essential to explore the way the epidemic may spread in the near future in the present work we proposed several scenarios to this aim while it is obviously hazardous to advance models of epidemics before their course has been completely unfolded we think that it is helpful to evaluate methods meant to understand their ongoing course in particular by following how the epidemic developed at places other than its original site of onset we would be able to detect any unexpected development course that might be used by health authorities to react very early on this would be extremely useful to detect patterns created by socio-political measures meant to contain the disease or mutants of the virus which would result into higher contagion or virulence thus prompting a rapid response it has been established that coronaviruses are versatile in their preferred site of infection these viruses have the option to pass from a -gut tropism version to a -lung tropism-instance as was observed for other coronavirus outbreaks 4 5 6 7 depending on the infected person or virus spread dynamics coronavirus effects can be more or less severe the virus can either preserve its lung tropism with adverse impact or act as a -gut tropism version and be relatively harmless first reports established that the novel 2019 instance also induces gut symptoms 8  its genetic build up and evolution is still subject to intense research 9  this multifaceted behaviour may result in unexpected local courses of the epidemic as suggested in a scenario of a -double epidemic as proposed for the sars 2003 worldwide epidemic 10  except that in the present situation we would be witnessing the effect of a single epidemic with modulated effects and propagation depending on the affected patients and random virus mutations a secondary propagation route due to the versatility of the virus in addition to interfering with the immune response contagion may involve a variety of causes such as environments contaminated with virus carrier secretions dirty water effluents besides the expected direct contamination via aerosols this makes that the oro-fecal route should be considered as an important complement of contact with the virus recent information sustains this hypothesis 11 this was observed at the amoy gardens cluster of cases for sars 12 13  this observation prompted us to include in our model besides the major respiratory route a secondary propagation route which is not a direct human-to-human propagation but rather some indirect vector or environment element tofrom human a second important consequence of assuming the presence of an indirect route is that the selection pressure on virus mutants will differ considerably between lung tropism and gut tropism finally there may be a difference in incubation time the -gut tropism version of the virus would possibly cause less fever 14  this hypothesis is consistent with some propagation patterns eg the first case in macau which was not detected at the border implying that that the affected person did not have fever we should note that this makes the disease considerably more dangerous in terms of propagation because carriers are at least for some time invisible and display a risky behavior 15 16  all rights

from hospitals which leads to conclude that the disease is at this time less dangerous than sars we propose several scenarios compatible with past scenarios of coronavirus propagation in parallel with our propagation model besides providing an estimation of the impact of the epidemic this work also suggests some countermeasures to slow down propagation compared with sars the death burden could become much higher on a par with what is observed with flu because of lack of proper containment the mathematical model of epidemic propagation is the following see figure 1   we use a compartmental model 17 18 to describe the evolution of an individual through several possible conditions such as susceptible compartment label -s latent ie infected but not yet infective label -l infective in the lung tropism and highly symptomatic label -i low symptomatic infective in the gut tropism -a the -i infected then go to -detected d stage while the -a infected go to -removed recovered stage label -r this is an adaptation of existing models and especially the sliar model 19 20 21 22 23   we add to the model the possibility for an environmental local propagation route that accounts for soiled water etc this option is represented by the -e label with some probability the contact between infected environmental elements and a susceptible individual gives rise to new infections here n is the total population the parameters   ei   es    l  i   a   e and p of the model are chosen in order to be compatible with past works and present insights 24  however since the public and health authorities

model is no exception in addition the quality of the results given by the model depends directly on the quality of the data input and it seems likely that some of the reported figures are subject to large error bars in particular all simulations of this model were done before february 12 th when the accounting procedure for of number of cases was changed in china therefore one should take the exact figures obtained with our simulations with a grain of salt yet the simulation resulting from the model does show some important qualitative features that are now discussed specifically the hypothesis that there exists a secondary route of transmission is meaningful and that two major types of virus effects are present is supported by the simulation data this has the interesting consequence that it appears that for the city of wuhan the quarantine seems to be effective-of course notwithstanding the need for further quarantine efforts to ensure that it remains under control- however since a reservoir is probably present and the oro-fecal route may be an important propagation factor the prevention of this transmission element is vital to avoid any resurgence the first recommendation seems to be the enforcement of strict post-epidemic measures at the possible reservoir sites in singapore and partially in shenzhen as well even if the current data indicates that the number of cases is likely to increase is does not indicate that a secondary propagation route is already effective however efforts are to be made to ensure that this remains true in the future and the control of the secondary route which makes the difference between a large scale epidemic and a controlled outbreak remains an important target for public health measures elaborating on the behavior of previous coronavirus outbreaks we worked out the hypothesis that an alternative infection tropism the gut tropism linked to a secondary propagation route through environment is affecting the development of the present 2019-ncov epidemic our epidemic propagation model when fit to existing data indicated that among all regions analysed wuhan city in the huabei region in mainland china singapore shenzhen region the propagation of the disease in the city of wuhan underwent an original course it appeared to be substantially facilitated by a secondary propagation route thus substantiating the beneficial effect of an effective quarantine the main message of our exploration is that relevant prevention measures that take into account both propagation routes should be implemented to contain the extension of the epidemic to further sites especially when novel sites are uncovered  the economic costs of containing a pandemic asahi noguchi  the coronavirus disease has caused one of the most serious social and economic losses to countries around the world since the spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 during world war i it has resulted in enormous economic as well as social costs such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in a region this is because public regulations imposed by national and local governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate suppression of the level of economic activity given this trade-off between economic activity and epidemic prevention governments should execute public interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic a major problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts certain strata of the society this raises an important question on how such economic losses should be shared equally across the society at the same time there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt which is likely to increase economic burden in the future however as paul samuelson once argued much of the burden whether due to public debt or otherwise can only be borne by the present generation and not by future generations  the coronavirus disease  which has spread to many countries around the world since the beginning of 2020 has inevitably caused great economic loss at a global scale unlike any pandemic that has occurred since world war ii it is not simply due to the infectious nature of the disease the weight of social losses created by the deaths of countless people due to the spread of the infection is enormous in modern society with the exception of some dictatorships that still exist on the basis of such modern value judgments many countries are willing to implement measures such as lockdowns which clearly involve heavy economic losses-in order to save as many lives as possible the spanish influenza pandemic which began in 1918 during world war i resulted in cumulative deaths in the tens of millions throughout the world in spite of considerable variation even the smallest of the estimates was large enough to cause a temporary decline in the global population which had previously been growing by around 13 million people per year roser 2020  even at that time in some countries and regions measures similar to the current lockdowns had been implemented however the immensely high death toll suggests that such conscious measures to prevent the spread of the disease may have been extremely rare this might indicate not only the low level of medical knowledge but also the low value attached to human life during that time in the covid-19 pandemic cities across numerous countries faced a rapid spread of infection and almost without exception severe restrictions on economic activity were implemented this was because the only way to prevent further spread of infection was to reduce human contact as much as possible which implied that economic activity should be kept to a minimum these stark trade-offs between economic activity and epidemic prevention denote the general characteristics of policies for pandemic deterrence another characteristic of modern policies for pandemic deterrence is that they often involve some form of economic compensation by governments and local authorities this kind of public economic compensation basically has two policy objectives one of these is the provision of financial incentives for leave of absence if it were not for such financial incentives people without sufficient savings would have no choice but to leave home and go to work to earn an income the other is income compensation similar to insurance against the decline in corporate and household incomes that would inevitably result from policies to deter the spread of infection this enables the economic costs of pandemic deterrence to be re-distributed more equitably across society modern pandemic deterrence policies require huge public expenditures including public economic compensation the relative size of this public spending could swell to levels not seen since the two world wars of the 20th century in some cases as high as 30-40 of the gdp in the case of covid-19 most of the public spending associated with pandemic deterrence policies will probably also be financed by public debt this is because governments do not want their economies which have already contracted significantly due to pandemic deterrence policies to atrophy further by raising taxes on people nonetheless concerns about ballooning public debt are sure to grow there is a clear tendency among some national policy authorities to keep public economic compensation to a minimum under the pretext of preventing the expansion of the burden in the future there are 3 many people who outrightly oppose public economic compensation because of the concern that its further expansion would directly increase the burden on themselves however there is already a long history of debate and controversy in the economic science on the relationship between public debt and future burdens while it was abba lerner who sparked the idea lerner 1948  the more general insights were gleaned from his approach and later organized in a textbook by paul samuelson samuelson 1967  their argument conclusively demonstrates the economic truth that much of the economic burden irrespective of whether the spending is financed by higher taxes or public debt is ultimately borne by the current generation and not by the future generations this conclusion is essentially in harmony with respect to the public economic compensation that accompanies pandemic deterrence in other words even if the entire economic compensation is financed by public debt it does not directly lead to a future burden economic compensation in the form of public debt is not intended to pass the burden on to future generations but only to redistribute the burden among the current generation this paper proceeds as follows section 2 uses the concept of health capital to articulate the trade-offs between economic activity and epidemic prevention that societies should be aware of when trying to contain a pandemic it also identifies the optimal public intervention path in terms of minimizing the combined loss from pandemics as a weighted sum of social and economic losses for national and local governments section 3 derives the economic losses caused by a pandemic response based on the trade-off relationship between economic activity and epidemic prevention and subsequently identifies the need to equalize the unequal share of these economic losses across various strata of the society section 4 argues mainly relying on samuelsons argument that the economic burden of pandemic preparedness is essentially borne by the current generation and that even if the governments economic compensation was based on public debt it would not be possible to transfer that burden to the future section 5 concludes that the various considerations made in relation to pandemic preparedness are both necessary and unnecessary referring to the problems of balancing economic activity with epidemic prevention and sharing economic costs and the problems of increasing future burdens due to fiscal deterioration respectively 2 economic analysis of counter-pandemic measures 2-1 trade-off between economic activity and quarantine as noted in section 1 one distinct feature of pandemic preparedness is that it almost always has a trade-off relationship with economic activity in peacetime when any threat of epidemic or pandemic is undetected the policy idea of consciously suppressing economic activity to prevent the spread of infection does not exist it is conceivable that there is some degree of trade-4 off between economic activity and disease prevention even in peacetime although the society is not aware of it however once the epidemic or the pandemic becomes a reality the situation changes drastically the society is forced to realize that economic activity must be restricted more severely to strongly deter the spread of infection in the early stages of infection control wherein a growing number of infections are being gradually reported overseas but have not been confirmed inland governments tend to adopt bolder measures these are aimed at strengthening the monitoring the influx of people from abroad especially from countries and regions where the infection has been confirmed such measures would have a decidedly negative effect on domestic economic activity as it would imply restricting foreign tourists and other people entering the country for business purposes nevertheless the effect of bolder measures on domestic economic activity is likely to be very limited as long as they are successful this is because there should be no need to strongly regulate economic activity in the country as long as the infection has not yet spread in the country however as soon as it is confirmed that the infection has crossed the border into the country there is a radical progression in phase then the governments are forced to implement some kind of regulation typically the governments provided instructions to the general public to refrain from activities such as public gatherings and events shut down various educational institutions stores and restaurants where human contact is unavoidable and transition to staggered attendance in companies some countries and regions that were severely affected by the pandemic went beyond these directives or solely moral imperatives to implement certain legally enforceable public regulations in the form of a lockdown to deter the spread of the disease restrictions on mobility were imposed except for the minimum activities necessary for the maintenance of life inevitably all economic activities other than the production and sale of goods and services that were considered to be basic necessities were in principle suspended in modern society where the value of human life is highly respected it is considered unavoidable to suffer a possible economic loss in order to save as many lives as possible once faced with increasing human loss due to the spread of infection the relationship between economic activity and quarantine is illustrated in figure 1  the vertical axis of this figure shows income or production of goods and services and the horizontal axis shows health capital in general the income or output of goods and services at any given time is representative of the level of economic activity in order to deter the spread of infection it is necessary to ensure certain social environments such as group avoidance through the promotion of absence from work or remote work and ensuring sufficient social distance health capital comprises precisely these social environments 2 there is clearly a trade-off between the two since one must abandon some economic activity in order to secure them three points are shown on this curve peacetime moral imperative and lockdown the trade-off between income and health capital does not arise significantly in the vicinity of the peacetime point this implies that individuals can secure a certain amount of health capital without any significant income loss an ironic consequence of the covid-19 infection control policies is that the imposition of lockdowns in large cities in developed countries where economic activity had previously been very high has resulted in significant improvements in the living conditions in the form of reduced air pollution some experts point out that these environmental improvements may have some effect of improving peoples health conversely this means that the vigorous economic activity that had been the norm prior to this pandemic had been worsening peoples health through air pollution and other forms of environmental degradation and the consequent social costs had been universally accepted as the price of economic benefit such trade-offs between economic activity and health capital although always existent are rarely noticed by people in normal times most people do not feel any emergent need to 2 grossman 1972 was the first to use the concept of health capital in economic analysis in which health capital is grasped a kind of human capital embodied in the individual subsequently however there has been an emphasis on its public good nature in conjunction with the rise of the concept of sustainability in environmental and development economics which is exemplified by arrow dasgupta and mumford secure health capital at the expense of apparent economic loss however securing health capital becomes a top priority for the society once a pandemic strikes this is because the spread of infection in a pandemic would itself cause social losses such as a rapid increase in the number of deaths due to the pandemic governments must then implement policies to curb all external activities of people including economic activities by means of public requests or legal regulations in order to curb the spread of the infection in other words the trade-offs between economic activity and health capital become more acute with the external environment as the pandemic leads to a rapid expansion of socially needed health capital in some cases societies are forced to restrict all external activities other than the essential economic activities in order to ensure as much health capital as possible this corresponds to the lockdown point in figure 1  it means that society has made a public choice to indulge in the minimum income necessary to ensure the maximum health capital in contrast the moral imperative point is a situation in which the governments restrict business operations and individual mobility not through legal coercion but solely through some kind of social imperative the declaration of a state of emergency issued by the japanese government to major cities on april 7 2020 that was extended nationwide on april 16 is essentially such a measure there is no legal regulation of peoples behavior such that health capital secured at that point is lesser than that at the lockdown point there are also lesser constraints on economic activity and therefore fewer economic losses the japanese governments decision to avoid the lockdown was likely due to its concerns about the resultant economic losses as well as its constitutional restrictions similarly sweden decided to not implement lockdowns or mobility restrictions but instead to limit to lenient regulations such as requests for population bans in order to acquire population immunity in the trade-off between maintaining economic activity and securing health capital for the protection of human life there is always an implicit value judgment about how each society weights both the economic costs of deterring the spread of infection and the social costs of the spread while the value of human life is extremely high in modern society the economic cost of protecting that value cannot be neglected at all that is the reason why even the most humanitarian nation will not ban cars in spite of the fact that car accidents cause deaths around the world some progressive intellectuals often argue that once the risk to human life becomes apparent it should be addressed at any economic cost therefore as regards covid-19 disease control all governments that do not impose lockdowns would be subject to criticism for their disregard for human life however if even a small island nation with no confirmed cases of infection was forced to impose lockdown unless risk of infection is absolutely zero the islanders would be indignant at such interfering measure that is sure to disturb their daily living strong public regulation is needed in the first place because the spread of the infection would be left unaddressed and the death toll would increase without it even if a government does not take any action against a pandemic because it is wary of economic loss it is possible that the infection eventually subsides and the number of deaths decreases as the population gains immunity however the cumulative death toll would be enormous as it once was with the spanish influenza in contrast if the government responds in some manner to a pandemic it can certainly reduce the cumulative death toll albeit with economic losses however the effect of the public intervention ie the reduction in cumulative deaths depends not only on the intensity of the intervention such as whether it is requested or enforced but also on the phase of the infection in other words the nature and intensity of public interventions needed to deter the spread of infection clearly depends largely on the phase in which they are undertaken this is evident by recalling the countries and regions such as taiwan perhaps the same can be said of the diminishing phase of the infection after the peak of its spread has passed the governments that have implemented lockdowns will endure the economic losses from restricting economic activity while they are doing it however if the additional social losses that would result from relaxing the regulations ie the additional increase in cumulative deaths were small enough the governments would prefer to immediately relax the regulations and normalize economic activity when this situation will occur is determined by health system measures such as the establishment of effective countermeasures to prevent the spread of infection the emergence of effective new drugs and the acquisition of population immunity if as a result of such an improved epidemiological situation the strength or weakness of public regulation to deter the spread of infection becomes 8 almost indiscriminate against social losses it would mean that the economy was once again in a situation where it should return to the peacetime point in figure 1  therefore the social losses caused by the spread of an epidemic can be expressed as follows sl  p i  1 this equation implies that the social loss caused by the pandemic sl is the maximum social loss msl minus the social gain of the public intervention sg that is a function of two variables the phase of the infection at the time of the intervention p and the intensity of the public intervention i hereafter we will refer to this equation 1 as the social loss function of an epidemic or pandemic in general social loss from the spread of an epidemic refers to all disadvantages other than the economic loss suffered due to the infection the foremost of which is the loss of human life itself if the social losses from a pandemic are represented by the cumulative number of deaths then the value can be derived from the epidemic curve of the infection this is because the cumulative number of deaths from a pandemic is merely the integral value of the newly infected as illustrated in the epidemic curve multiplied by the mortality rate suppose that the epidemic curve of an infectious disease is mountain-shaped as in a normal distribution moreover suppose that there are four phases p1 to p4 ranging from the beginning of the spread of the infection to its convergence the intensity of public interventions to deter the spread of infection should also be represented by i0 no intervention i1 weak intervention and i2 strong intervention figure 2 shows the epidemic curve in the absence of any public intervention in all phases and the phase categories from 1 to 4 the integral of this epidemic curve ie the area of the mountain-shaped curve represents the cumulative number of deaths in the absence of any public intervention in all the phases that is the msl in equation 1 which denotes the maximum social loss the shape of the epidemic curve will inevitably change if the government intervenes however the degree of change also depends on the phase of the infection figure 3 shows that during the initial phase of the infection p1 the epidemic curve does not depend on the intensity of the public intervention that is if the intensity of the intervention in each phase is expressed as ip then the peak in i11 is the same as that in i12 thus even if taiwan and hong kong were to implement lockdown in the early stages the effect would not be much different from that of the border measures alone however the situation changes drastically at p2 ie during the expanding phase of the infection as figure 4 shows the shape of the epidemic curve is very different between a weak and a strong government intervention ie between i21 and i22 hence the government needs to put in place stronger behavioral regulations such as lockdowns to curb the cumulative death toll from the infection a similar dilemma could arise even during the phase where the spread of the infection has finally been deterred figure 5 depicts how the governments strong interventions in one stage led to a decline in new infections if however the government does not bear the weight of the economic losses and weakens its intervention prematurely i31 then the spread of the infection may occur again in such cases it is likely that governments will be able to safely loosen the restrictions on peoples behavior only after a phase such as p4 where the intensity of public intervention will no longer be a major determinant of the epidemic curve from the above consideration apart from the social loss sl calculated at a point of public intervention with a certain intensity in a certain phase the total social loss across all phases of infection tsl can be obtained as follows tsl   2 2-3 optimal public intervention path as described above governments generally choose the intensity of public interventions that is optimal for each phase based on the assumption that the type of public interventions they undertake to deter the spread of infection will affect social losses represented by the cumulative number of deaths here optimal does not necessarily mean minimizing social losses per se in order to reduce social losses more public intervention is needed to secure higher health capital which entails greater economic loss in the form of further income loss this is exactly the tradeoff between economic activity and quarantine what the government is trying to minimize is some combined measure of the economic and social loss it can be expressed as follows this combined pandemic loss cpl is the weighted sum of the economic loss el and social loss sl of this pandemic 3 the coefficient  is a parameter for converting the social loss specifically the loss of human life to economic loss the value represents each societys value judgment of human life from equation 1 it is clear that the combined pandemic loss cpl is minimized at the point that the government determine the intensity of its intervention i so as to make the increment of economic loss eli equal to incremental value of social gain sgi ie the value of the resulting reduction in the number of deaths at first glance it may seem unethical to replace human life with an economic measure however our society has been constantly making certain implicit value judgments about the economic value of human life the evidence of this is that economic activity is never halted even though many lives are lost each year to asthma which is due to the air pollution resulting from economic activity nevertheless the economic value of human life is extremely high in many modern democratic societies the degree to which this is the case is roughly proportional to the material wealth from economic growth this is illustrated by the fact that many developed countries have suppressed economic activity to a minimum albeit temporarily to contain the pandemic if there is a dictatorship that does not recognize any value in the lives of its citizens what choice will that government make in the event of a pandemic in that case the conversion rate  for replacing human life with economic loss would be zero and the total loss of the pandemic would be the economic loss itself the best option for such a government would be to do nothing to deter the spread of the infection that would curtail economic activity but to continue to let the infection continue as shown in figure 2  in ordinary democracies where the economic value of human life is high choices about the nature and strength of public intervention are made after considering the economic losses resulting from the intervention in comparison to the social losses however as noted above the choice depends on the phase on the epidemic curve where the public intervention takes place public interventions at an early stage on the epidemic curve such as those in taiwan and hong kong can minimize pandemic losses without strong public interventions the intervention path would be for example   it means that weak public interventions continue during the spread of the infection but zero public interventions are used after it starts to shrink the total combined loss resulting from the infection is the sum of the economic losses and the value of human losses borne at phase 1 and 2 only in contrast the optimal path when public intervention is used from the stage where the infection has already spread p2 would be for example   here the initial phase of the infection was left unattended which forced strong public intervention in the spread phase even then however the degree of public intervention can be progressively relaxed as the infection lessens this is because easing the behavioral restrictions did not increase the cumulative death toll much the value of the additional human lives that would have been saved by strong restrictions fell short of the additional economic loss that would have been caused by them thus when public intervention is applied at a stage when the infection has already spread the cumulative economic and human losses are large and consequently the total losses of a pandemic are very high even so this is certainly the optimal choice in the sense that it minimizes the total combined loss of the pandemic since the time of public intervention as discussed in the previous section governments minimize the combined value of the social and economic losses by determining the path of public interventions for each phase of the epidemic curve always taking into account the effect of their interventions on curbing the spread of infection and the extent to which they will result in economic losses in this case the social loss is the cumulative death toll from the pandemic the economic loss is the difference between the average income in peacetime before the pandemic occurred and the lower income brought about by economic regulation due to the public intervention figure 6 shows the magnitude of the economic costs incurred when the government locks down in the event of a pandemic in a lockdown any human activity that involves external contact is regulated leaving only the minimum economic activity necessary to maintain peoples livelihoods therefore the income that is being brought in at that time can be considered the minimum required income in that economy in other words the economic cost of lockdown is the difference between the average income in peacetime and the minimum required income in the economy 4 realistically if an economy growing at an average rate of 2 per year were to shift to zero growth due to the lockdown the lost income 2 would be considered the economic cost of the lockdown the path by which the decline in income and its growth rate come about will be dealt case-by-case if the government halts business operations or firms productive activities through legal regulation the economic impact would appear to be a reduction in the supply of goods and services due to government regulation in contrast if the government asks people to avoid eating out and people abstain from doing so in response there should be a decrease in supply through the decrease in demand for food service thus if the government merely calls for voluntary restraint most of the income decline will be the result of demand shocks however the stronger the government regulation the stronger will be the supply shock importantly all these consequences whether they are demand shocks or supply shocks unfold as a decline in peoples current income which constitutes the economic cost of pandemic preparedness shown in figure 6  in this sense the question of whether the onset of decline is a demand or a supply shock is not so essential the more pertinent question is about whose income it will reduce the governments counter-pandemic measures reduced the income of individuals and firms basically through reducing the supply of goods and services whether directly or indirectly in short those who reduced the supply of goods and services faced income losses in contrast the individuals and firms that did not reduce the supply of goods and services did not have to contend with reduced incomes this means that the economic costs of securing the health capital needed to prevent the spread of infection are being passed on in an extremely unequal manner among the members of society thus the governments counter-pandemic measures usually place a significant burden on some members of the society in the form of loss of income as the supply of goods and services shrinks the distribution of that burden is extremely uneven with respect to industrial and health capital income production of goods and services figure 6 economic cost of a lockdown peacetime point peacetime income lockdown point the minimum required income economic cost of a lockdown employment conditions because it depends on how government regulation affects firm and household incomes through demand and supply shocks hence many governments that have dealt with pandemics have simultaneously offered some form of financial assistance such as compensation for lost work or fixed benefits for companies and individuals who bear a particularly heavy burden while the policy objectives of such public support are not always clear the following benefits are generally expected the first is livelihood compensation for economically deprived households that have lost their income this is primarily a measure aimed at low-income people such as those with little to no savings the second is the provision of economic incentives for leaves or absence from work this becomes especially important when government measures remain a moral imperative rather than a legal regulation in the absence of absenteeism or fixed benefits there will always be people who are willing to go to work instead of staying home for financial reasons the trend is particularly strong among low-income people who have no savings in this sense the governments support measures are not just focused on livelihood compensation but also serve as an economic incentive to keep people at home instead of permitting them to go out to work another important role of the governments economic support is to enable the social sharing of the economic costs incurred due to the counter-pandemic measures as noted above the economic costs of preventing the spread of infection or securing the necessary health capital for epidemic prevention fall very unequally on certain members of the society it is transferred to those who have reduced the supply of goods and services as a result of demand and supply shocks they thereby lost the claims on goods and services from the present to the future however those who have not reduced the supply of goods and services have also suffered economic welfare losses this is because they have been forced to cut back on consumption due to the governments counter-pandemic measures even though their incomes may not have reduced since they were inhibited to consume goods and services to the optimum level their economic welfare has clearly declined since their incomes were not reduced however they necessarily increased their savings which would result in their future claims on goods and services in this regard the economic welfare losses they have suffered might be almost negligible in comparison to the losses of those who have reduced their incomes in view of the above the governments economic support should in principle be paid according to the share of the economic burden of fighting the pandemic ie how much ones income is reduced by it the government would be using its own funds to compensate for the damages based on an insurance-like principle as argued by hayashi 2020  a major problem with this compensation policy is that it takes a long time to calculate the value of damages if the government intervenes to combat the pandemic many people will face an immediate reduction in their income however the manner in which the burden is 15 ultimately passed on to the members of society can only be determined after the entire infection passes for this reason the government may be reluctant to provide financial support which would result in low-income individuals with little to no savings pushed to further financial trouble it is not that difficult to solve these problems hayashi 2020 suggests that the government should provide unsecured bridge loans to households until the final compensation amount is finalized by the government alternatively as many countries have already done the funds can be distributed uniformly for the time being and adjusted afterwards through taxation in that case the government would make a distinction between those whose incomes have been significantly reduced by the governments counter-pandemic measures and those whose incomes have not been reduced and subsequently give preferential tax treatment to the former 4 real and fictitious future burdens the financial size of the public compensation could pile up to an amount not seen since wartime spending in world war ii most of the public spending at least for the time being will be funded by public debt and not by tax increases this is because not many governments have the political capital to dare to raise taxes in the midst of the growing economic hardship therefore few mass media outlets and pundits have already begun to express concern over the future expansion of the budget deficit since the expansion of the budget deficit due to public support from the government is inevitable such concerns will probably become more prevalent among the general public this is because many people tend to assume that a larger government budget deficit means a larger future burden government policies that deter the spread of infection may reduce not just peoples current incomes but also their future incomes if the supply of capital goods is cut off due to the cessation of corporate production activities capital investment by corporations and governments would become impossible and capital formation in a country will stagnate moreover if the accumulation and renewal of the capital stock is thus stalled it will inevitably lead to stagnation of production and income in the future in addition the expansion of leave of absence and furloughs that was implemented to deter the spread of infection will if prolonged lead to a degradation of human capital embodied in peoples labor its probability becomes even stronger if dismissal of workers by companies increases furthermore corporate bankruptcy due to a contraction of economic activity would imply a loss of management capital altogether these shall result in a contraction of production and income in the future rather than in the present however these are all future costs that the society has no choice but to accept to deter 16 the spread of the infection they are never future burdens created by public support through government debt on the contrary if sufficient government support for businesses and households can effectively prevent the expansion of corporate bankruptcies and unemployment the future burden created by the deterrence of the spread of the infection will certainly be reduced at least to that extent the future burden of deficit financing more generally there are cases in which government support measures using deficit financing will lead to future burdens it is a situation where deficit financing tightens capital markets which in turn raises interest rates and crowds out private investment there to be sure deficit financing irrespective of how it is produced usually stagnates capital formation and shrinks production and income in the future however in a situation where such a crowding-out mechanism does not arise deficit financing by itself will not lead to a burden on future generations the economist who articulated this logic most clearly was paul samuelson one of the leading economists of the 20th century who discussed in detail the problem of future generations burden of government deficit financing 5 samuelson first presents the conclusion of this issue as follows the main ways that one generation can put a burden on a later generation is by using up currently the nations stock of capital goods or by failing to add the usual investment increment to the stock of capital samuelson 1967 p346 the meaning of this brief statement is explained in more detail in a summary at the end of the chapter the public debt does not burden the shoulders of a nation as if each citizen were made to carry rocks on his back to the degree that we now follow policies of reduced capital formation which will pass on to posterity less capital goods we can directly affect the production possibilities open to them to the degree that we borrow from abroad for some transitory consumption purpose and pledge posterity to pay back the interest and principal on such external debt we do place upon that posterity a net burden which will be a subtraction from what they can later produce to the degree that we bequeath to posterity an internal debt but no change in capital stock beyond what would anyway have been given them there may be various internal transfer effects as one group in the community receives a larger share of the goods then produced at the expense of another group samuelson 1967 p353 this explanation by samuelson can be generalized as the proposition that government debt is not a burden on future generations unless it reduces their future consumption possibilities conversely government debt is a future generational burden only if it reduces the future consumption possibilities of people this may be called the lerner-samuelson proposition on the future generational burden of government deficit financing since it was abba lerner who laid the foundation for this reasoning lerner pointed out that whether public debt will be a burden for future generations depends on whether the national debt issued to finance the budget deficit will be absorbed domestically or abroad 6 in the case of internal debt even if future generations are taxed in order to redeem government bonds they will still receive the payments and their consumption possibilities as a whole will not necessarily decline 7 in contrast in the case of external debt while the current generation does not have to cut spending the future generations will have to truncate theirs through government tax collection to repay the debt to other citizens and the consumption possibilities of future generations will necessarily be reduced by that amount 8 thus external public debt will necessarily be a burden for future generations while lerners argument implies that future generational burden will necessarily arise as long as the public debt is external it does not imply that it will not arise in principle in the case of internal debt as samuelson points out even if all of the public debt is internal the future possibilities of production and consumption will decrease if the renewal and accumulation of the capital stock is inhibited by the debt generally deficit-financing policies undertaken in a full employment economy are more likely to result in tighter capital markets higher interest rates and a crowding out of private investment therefore future generational 6 it should be noted that generation in the discussion of lerner and samuelson means all people living at a certain point in time which is different from the usual generational concept of all people born at a certain point in time 7 lerner says of this very few economists need to be reminded that if our children or grandchildren repay some of the national debt these payments will be made to our children or grandchildren and to nobody else taking them altogether they will no more be impoverished by making the repayments than they will be enriched by receiving them lerner 1948 p256 burdens will certainly arise even if the debts are internal the above consideration leads to a more precise version of the lerner-samuelson proposition that public debt will not be a burden on future generations if it is absorbed domestically and does not reduce the domestic capital stock subsequently implying that there is no reduction in future consumption possibilities this proposition holds strictly true in a ricardian economy wherein people behave as if they equate current tax increases with future tax increases due to bond issues in this case peoples saving and spending behavior will not change whether government spending is financed by higher taxes or by bond issues therefore more fiscal deficits mean neither higher interest rates nor greater external debts even in non-ricardian economies the lerner-samuelson proposition holds at least approximately in an underemployment economy where unemployment due to lack of demand exists as traditional keynesian models such as the is-lm model show if the government implements a deficit fiscal policy there will be some increase in interest rates and crowding out of private investment however the degree of crowding out will be contained because income and savings will increase due to the demand-led growth induced by fiscal spending in short public debt does not necessarily imply a future generational burden whether or not the burden arises depends entirely on the economic situation as samuelson points out the impact of the buildup of public debt as internal debt appears not so much as an expansion of the future burden itself but rather as an income transfer between different strata of society government bonds as public debt are nothing more than assets for bondholders and a right to acquire goods and services in the future thus as long as government-issued bonds continue to be absorbed in the country private sector assets will continue to grow the economic conditions in the country will decide the macroeconomic effect of the expansion of private assets in a ricardian economy this private sector asset signifies future tax increases therefore would be completely offset by public debt thus deficit financing would be macroeconomically neutral this means that as robert barro once argued government debt cannot be the net wealth of the private sector barro 1974  however in the non-ricardian economy on which traditional keynesian economics has been premised the economic expansionary effect of deficit-financing government spending is usually greater than tax-financing government spending the most obvious difference between the two arises in the domestic distribution of purchasing power the holders of government bonds in the private sector should have relatively greater access to goods and services than those without them this purchasing power effect does not depend on whether the economy is ricardian or non-ricardian but on the decision of each economic agent about whether to cut their spending and buy the government-issued bonds that created the debt it is merely the result of the intertemporal consumption choices of each economic agent-whether to cut current spending to obtain future goods and services or simply to desire current goods and services the important message in samuelsons argument on the future burden of deficit financing is the economic truth that most of the burden created by government spending whether it is financed by bond issues or tax increases will ultimately be borne by the current generation and not by the future generations samuelson uses the example of wartime costs to illustrate this it is worth considering why this is so by following the context of the supplementary argument in chapter 19 of economics that all debt came from world war ii samuelson 1967 p356 war usually requires artillery and ammunition and the government spending for it is funded by either higher taxes or public debt suppose that all the costs were covered by bonds rather than taxes even then the burden on future generations will not arise if all the public debt is absorbed domestically and does not result in the crowding out of private investment to confirm this consider an economy in which there is no capital stock at all and therefore no investment people devote all their income from time to time to consumption it is so to speak an economy that is based solely on hunting and gathering in this consumptiononly investment-free economy it is self-evident that no matter how much manpower is used in the production of artillery and ammunition it will not result in a burden for future generations while future generations could produce artillery and ammunition they cannot bring it to the present unless they possess a time machine thus in this case the burden of producing artillery and ammunition would eventually be borne entirely by the current generation in the form of a reduction in its consumption this is because there are always constraints on production resources such as labor as more human resources are allocated in the production of artillery and ammunition the production of consumer goods must be reduced in conclusion whether wartime costs are financed by higher taxes or public debt is merely a question of how that burden will be shared within the current generation if it is financed by a tax increase then the taxpayer who has reduced their disposable income will bear the cost through reduced consumption in contrast if it is financed by public bonds the cost is borne by those who voluntarily reduce consumption and purchase the bonds however this strong conclusion that all fiscal burdens are borne not by future generations but by the present generation is derived from the assumption that there is no foreign sector or capital stock thus it is by no means universally true there will always be future burdens when public bonds are absorbed overseas even if they are absorbed internally there will be future burdens if they reduce domestic investment and capital stock regardless of the burden on future generations if there are individuals who must reduce their consumption due to the governments policy it is clearly a burden for that generation of people in this sense the burden of the governments policy is considered to be borne by the current generation rather than future generations the same conclusion holds for the governments counter-pandemic measures as shown in the previous section imposing public regulations to prevent the spread of infection necessarily reduces the very level of economic activity through a reduction in demand or supply in a lockdown the difference between the income in peacetime and in lockdown is precisely that economic loss  figure 5  thus public regulations to prevent the spread of the infection affects the economy in the form of demand and supply shocks shrinking the overall production of goods and services however the extent of the impact will vary depending on the circumstances in which each firm and household is located while some areas will be devastated such as the entertainment industry or the food and beverage industry others will rather expand supply such as the mask-making industry the economic burden thus created will be entirely borne by the present generation whether or not it is financially supported by public debt exactly as it is in the case of the burden of war expenditures this is because it is the current generation of people who are reducing the production and consumption of goods and services through the imposed counter-pandemic measures the amount of public debt that piles up at that time will not deter private investment as unemployment expands due to falling demand and interest rates continue to fall thus future production and consumption possibilities are not depressed by the bond itself rather these possibilities would be better than they would be without it if the governments economic support measures successfully prevented the expansion of corporate bankruptcies and unemployment apparently these measures should be deficit-financed and not involve tax since they must be implemented without reducing peoples disposable income in a wartime economy people are sometimes forced to severely cut back on their consumption in japan during world war ii moral slogans such as luxury is the enemy and we dont want it not until we win were imposed on the people by the government it comes from the economic principle that there is no free lunch everything involves trade-offs therefore to obtain the artillery and ammunition needed to carry out the war the current generation has no choice but to reduce consumption and divert the productive resources that were used to produce consumer goods to the production of artillery and ammunition the resulting decline in consumption is a burden on the current generation meanwhile in an economy under pandemic preparedness such as lockdowns the greatest burden for the current generation will come in the form of a decline in income the present generation is subsequently involuntarily forced to produce non-income-generating leisure instead of producing artillery and ammunition people would prefer to earn income by engaging in economic activities and enjoy consumption of goods and services from that income rather than such excessive leisure it is the current generations income and consumption that is lost in this situation resulting in the economic burden of the counter-pandemic measures when a society is faced with a pandemic the preliminary decisions involve the measures to be used and the extent to which they will be imposed to deter the spread of the disease our goal is to minimize the losses that the society suffers while the goal in itself is quite simple the decision is far from simple this is because the stronger the policy to prevent the spread of the disease the greater the economic losses are likely to be this is the trade-off between economic activity and epidemic prevention it is precisely because of this trade-off that we continue to struggle with the decision to impose lockdowns once an infection has spread and the duration for which it should continue in fact if the lockdown does not result in any economic loss the society will happily continue to comply this trade-off between economic activity and epidemic prevention signifies that our decisions regarding pandemic deterrence are nothing less than judgments about our priorities the extent to which a given quarantine policy is effective in deterring infection is a purely empirical epidemiological question that has nothing to do with value judgments however no matter how epidemiologically effective the policy may be there is no immediate justification for its implementation if it involves an economic loss that results in income reduction in order to implement the policy a social consensus based on the exact value judgment is necessary the benefits of reducing the social losses are sure to exceed the economic losses caused by it another issue we must consider regarding the economic costs of pandemic deterrence is how it will ultimately be shared by the society we see that the economic burden of policies to prevent the spread of infection falls on each class of the society in a very unequal way it varies across industries and it depends on an individuals employment category some people have lost their jobs and income entirely because of the policies others have been able to maintain their existing income and enjoy their extra leisure time preventing the spread of infection is an obvious public good that benefits all members of the society and yet the cost is unequally shared therefore governments should provide some form of financial support such as absenteeism and fixed benefits along with its policies to deter the spread of infection the biggest obstacle to such public support measures is a very universal concern that they will lead to a deterioration of government finances the existence of such apprehensions may in some cases distort judgments about what and how far to go to deter the spread of the infection itself it is plausible that some nations may lift the lockdown to avoid the expansion of public assistance even though there remains a significant risk of the spread of the infection however as samuelson have argued since many of the governments policies can only be carried out using current rather than future labor resources much of the burden will eventually have to be borne by the current generation even if public bonds are issued to implement these measures it does not mean that the burden will be passed on to the future generations the extent of public debt merely changes the distribution of goods and services in the future according to the current saving and spending behavior of each economic agent this applies to the public assistance provided as part of the counter-pandemic measures the current generation is already bearing the heavy burden of shrinking incomes and consumption even if all public support was provided by issuing public bonds thereby expanding government debt the burden of the current generation could not be passed on to future generations therefore there is no basis for the notion that government economic support should be withheld as much as possible in order to avoid leaving a burden for future generations however the above considerations about the future burden of deficit financing do not at all deny that the accumulation of public debt has any effect on the economy as a whole generally if the economy were non-ricardian then an increase in public debt would act as a greater expansion of peoples spending because it would mean an increase in private assets as a future claim to goods and services therefore at some stage governments and central banks may have to carry out macroeconomic tightening using fiscal and monetary policies to contain price increases due to the expansion of private spending this suggests that the failure of governments and central banks to make such macroeconomic adjustments could lead to economic disruptions such as fiscal collapse and soaring inflation economists of the keynesian position have been consistently emphasizing that government fiscal deficits are not generally evil but rather that deficit financing during recessions is necessary for the stabilization of the macroeconomy however they did not deny the need for fiscal discipline in the sense of long-run fiscal equilibrium through the business cycle this is because it is difficult even for keynesians to deny in principle the possibility of macroeconomic turmoil that would occur if there were no fiscal discipline 9 nevertheless the claims made by some media outlets that the expansion of public support will lead to immediate fiscal collapse and hyperinflation can be considered a product of 9 however there is a position on the part of some keynesians that denies even the need for fiscal equilibrium in the long-run sense for example modern money theory mmt proposed in mid-1990s by warren mosler randall wray and others maintains that there is no inherent government fiscal constraint in an economy with a sovereign currency they termed the rigid fiscal equilibrium doctrine as deficit hawks the cyclical deficit doctrine on which the traditional keynesians have relied as deficit doves and their own position that government finances do not even need to be balanced through the business cycle as deficit owls mitchell wray and watts 2019 p333-4 23 mere sensationalism there is almost no chance that the excessive demand supported by deficit financing will make it difficult for governments and central banks to control inflation in a situation where many companies are facing a business downturn due to reduced consumer demand as a result of counter-pandemic measures rather as christopher sims has suggested as a policy implication of the fiscal theory of price level ftpl the evils of being too captive to fiscal discipline are far greater in a demand-deficient low interest rate economy than they would be otherwise sims 2016  there have been countless examples in history of countries falling into financial ruin due to excessive public debt reinhart and rogoff 2009  however fiscal collapse has only occurred in very exceptional circumstances in developed countries with adequate tax collection capacity conversely there are many examples that show noticeable debt tolerance in these countries the united kingdom had a public debt of 250 of gdp after the end of the world war ii with no signs of fiscal collapse japan had experienced a sustained deterioration in public finances caused by the prolonged economic stagnation since the 1990s which caused government bond rates to continue to fall rather than rise in short it is highly unlikely at least in the developed world that a transient increase in budget deficits due to an increase in public support will lead to immediate fiscal collapse or hyperinflation thus in terms of pandemic preparedness it is clearly not about what we should consider but about what we should not   novanto yudistira sutiman sumitro b alberth nahas nelly riama florida   coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 was first detected in hubei province of china by wuhan municipal health commission and early information about outbreak has been sent to world health organization who 1 2  disease capability to spread among communities are increased rapidly as the number of people that exposed to covid-19 is increasing this regards evidence of human-to-human transmission indicating that covid-19 is highly contagious moreover covid-19 can also actively live

medrxiv preprint meteorology climatology and geophysical agency wwwbmkgorg respectively during 2020-01-22 to 2020-03-28 the uv index is derived from the measured solar radiation in the uv spectra that arrives on the surface it is calculated by considering the proportional contribution of both uv-a and uv-b two of the three wavelength-based types of uv radiation uv-a is characterized as the uv radiation of which the wavelength ranges from 280-315 nm while the wavelength of uv-b is between 315 nm and 400 nm the determination of uv index stems from the importance of its health impacts to humans therefore this index was developed to assess how the exposure of excessive uv radiation may be detrimental particularly to the exposed body both uv-a and uv-b have this damaging capability if the exposure is not being taken cautiously however there are some differences when it comes to the health effects by each type of uv radiation when determining the uv index the contribution of uv-a and uv-b is translated by implementing the weighting factors for individual uv types these factors were introduced by 16 to account for the amount of received uv radiation on surface and the attributed energy of each uv type this level of energy is indicative of how damaging the exposure might be experienced by a person in general uv radiation at longer wavelengths is received more abundantly than that at shorter wavelengths in other words more uv-a arrives on the surface than uv-b however the energy carried by uv-a is less than that by uv-b because of the inverse relationship between the energy amount and the radiation wavelength the weighting factors for determining the uv index accommodate both the amount of received uv radiation and carried energy a study by 16 has provided a list of weighting factors for each nm wavelength of uv-a and uv-b with decreasing values assigned from lower to 3 higher wavelengths ie the weighting factors for uv-b are higher than those of uv-a these factors are utilized to account for how much uv energy received on the surface that might affect the human health in the ideal situation the application of the weighting factors to uv-a and uv-b radiation is performed for each nm of wavelengths however data from uv radiation is usually reported as a total of integrated uv radiation from a range of wavelengths as a result applying the weighting factors cannot be done to specifically determine the contribution of uv radiation from every wavelength with this compromised situation an alternative approach has been undertaken to select a weighting factor for a particular wavelength that represents each uv-a and uv-b wavelength range since the chosen wavelength can be arbitrary some reasonable assumptions were provided to serve as justification of calculation for uv-a the weighting factor used was selected for the wavelength of 325 nm uv-a weighting factor  00029 although uv radiation from this wavelength penetrates to the surface less than that from longer wavelengths it has a higher weighting factor that might be considered as a surrogate for other wavelengths meanwhile for uv-b the selected weighting factor was for 305 nm uv-b weighting factor  022 this wavelength is located near the end of the uv-b spectrum indicating a lower energy amount than the other shorter uv-b wavelengths however much of the shorter wavelengths are already absorbed by gases in the atmosphere before arriving at the surface therefore it can be assumed that the prevalent uv-b radiation received on the surface is from the longer wavelengths in addition the weighting factor for 305 nm is located in the middle area of the uv-b longer wavelength spectrum which is appropriate to represent this range in calculation after applying the weighting factors to both uv-a and uv-b the combined energy is then used to determine the uv index the uv index is mathematically expressed by the following 4  cc-by-nd 40 international license it

version posted may 6 2020  where both uv-a and uv-b are expressed in w m 2  the denominator 0025 w m 2 is the standardized increment value that corresponds to how much uv radiation can potentially be damaging to life tissues in other words an increase of one uv index is equivalent to 25 mw m 2 of exposed uv radiation uv radiation is one of the solar radiation components pertinent in determining the atmospheric dynamics therefore this parameter has been an integral parameter to be measured on the surface however there is still a limited number of ground-based measurements of uv radiation in indonesia right now the indonesian agency for meteorology climatology and geophysics bmkg operates a uv radiometer to measure uv radiation in three climatological stations these three locations shown in fig2a  report the incidence uv radiation received on the surface per hour these values are useful to determine the daytime uv radiation profile in each location the limitation of ground-based data for uv radiation poses some challenges in determining uv index for a country like indonesia however this limitation can be addressed by utilizing model-based uv radiation information such information for example can be obtained from the european centre for medium-range weather forecast ecmwf uv radiation products ecmwf releases two near real-time global uv radiation products which are uv biologically effective dose uvbed and uv biologically effective dose for clear sky uvbed the horizontal resolution of these products is 04  by 04   which is roughly equivalent to 40 km by 40 km both 5

account atmospheric and surface conditions such as surface albedo clouds aerosol loads and surface ozone their values are analogue to the total weighted uv radiation described earlier as such these products can also be converted into a uv index by dividing the values by 0025 w m 2  the spatial variation of uv index calculated from the ecmwfs uvbed product for april 15 2020 is depicted in fig1  in this figure three selected hours ie 0 utc 5 utc and 9 utc where jakarta time is seven hours ahead of utc are shown to observe the changing of uv index from morning to afternoon at 0 utc or 7 am jakarta time the central and eastern parts of indonesia have observed uv index 1 to 3 while most of the western part was yet to be affected by uv radiation as the day progressed and the sun was overhead most of the indonesian region was under uv index 7 and above by 5 utc or noon jakarta time in the afternoon as the sun was observed at a slanted angle the uv index was either decreased or zero these changes of uv index are typical for daily observation there are some seasonal variations in terms of magnitude that is related to the geometry between the sun and the earth in addition surface conditions and atmospheric dynamics contribute to determining the uv index in this study the two ecmwf uv products were used as a comparison to the ground-based data collected from the three locations for the period of january to march 2020 after calculating the uv index from both observation and model data sets daytime hourly uv indices were analyzed to indicate whether there is an agreement between the two data sets the comparison from the three locations can be seen in figure 1b -1d maros south sulawesi province respectively it can be observed that in general the model is able to capture the hourly pattern of uv indices calculated from measured uv radiation there 6  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

on the estimated uv indices which might be attributed to the coarse horizontal resolution of the model that did not include the dynamics of atmospheric conditions on a finer scale nevertheless these results can be considered as a good agreement between the observation and the model a different result however is shown in fig1b  where west lombok in west nusa tenggara province observed the uv index difference between the model and the observation during its peak the model underestimates the observation by more than five units there are two factors that might be contributed to this difference firstly the model was not able to capture the local characteristics of uv radiation received on the surface in this location these local characteristics can be associated with the topographical features and the predominant weather conditions in this location secondly the selection of weighting factors to adjust uv-a and uv-b radiation is not suitable for this location it is possible that the uv radiation received on the surface is at different wavelengths from one place to another the absorption of uv radiation is governed by atmospheric compositions and weather conditions therefore the amount of energy brought by uv radiation is subject to at what wavelength the radiation is able to reach the surface this result highlights the importance of future studies that involve more precise measurements on uv radiation from different wavelengths these studies are required to determine the prevalent wavelength of uv radiation that is measured on the ground notwithstanding the disagreement between the model and the observation shown in fig1b these results suggest an encouraging finding that the model may be suitable for estimating the uv index in locations where there is no ground-based datathis is of particular importance because of the limitation of measurement availability in indonesia however this method and its interpretation have to be approached with cautions because of there is still a need to get more information on the prevalent uv wavelength discussed earlier now we look into the pattern of daily confirmed cases and uv index in several countries  cc-by-nd 40

coronavirus stanley perlman jincun zhao   the recent identification of a novel human coronavirus emc hcov-emc as the causative agent for severe human respiratory disease raised fears that a version of the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic would recur this fear prompted intense research efforts that resulted in publications describing the clinical characteristics of the human infection and complete sequence and genomic characterization of the virus 1 additional analyses showed that that the virus was related to two previously identified bat coronaviruses preliminary sequence analysis of virus isolated from a pipistrellus pipistrellus bat in the netherlands suggested an even closer relationship with 88 nucleotide identity to a fragment of the rna-dependent rna polymerase in a recent article in mbio mller et al provided important information about the host cell receptor used by the virus to infect cells 2 first the receptor is not human ace2 hace2 which is used by the sars coronavirus to infect humans second the virus is able to infect human bat and porcine cells the latter result is remarkable because coronaviruses in general show fairly strict host specificity in early studies of another betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus serial passage was required for adaptation to human cells 3 we know now that hace2 is not the hcov-emc receptor but clearly identification of the host cell receptor used by hcov-emc is a high priority the limited information that is available suggests several possibilities about the identity of the receptor first human transmission may occur but is not common this disparity between severe infection and poor transmissibility also occurs in patients infected with the influenza a virus h5n1 strain iav-h5n1 iav-h5n1 enters cells via glycans that contain a terminal 23-linked sialic acid unlike human strains of the virus which bind to terminal 26-linked sialic acid moieties terminal 23-linked sialic acid proteins are not common in the human airway and are largely restricted to the lower airway explaining the poor transmissibility exhibited by the virus use of a glycan for cell entry either as a primary or binding ligand might allow hcov-emc to infect cells from a variety of species and depending on the location in the lung of the specific glycan in question may explain the lack of transmissibility between humans there is precedent for sialic acid usage by coronaviruses both bovine coronavirus and hcov-oc43 enter cells via binding sialic acid consequently these viruses are able to infect most tissue culture cells and also to spread to infect a large variety of ruminants 4 second uncommon human transmissibility may also reflect usage of a protein that is present predominantly in the lower respiratory tracts of humans even though sars-cov caused a respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality it was not easily transmissible between humans in part because its receptor hace2 is most abundant in the lungs and less so in the upper airway 5 consequently most sars-cov-infected patients were not contagious until after they developed pneumonia with spread occurring via large droplets this resulted in a high proportion of secondary cases being close contacts either family members or health care workers and also enabled the effectiveness of quarantining in controlling the infection parenthetically a few individuals were able to spread sars-cov very efficiently superspreading events 6 and these events had a disproportionate effect on the widespread nature of the infection virus burdens were presumed to be higher in patients associated with superspreading events with enhanced spread via fine droplets whether these events reflected differences in localization of hace2 throughout the airway in innate cell t cell or antibody responses or in expression of another factor was not determined before the epidemic was controlled if the receptor for hcov-emc is a protein it is predicted to have a distribution similar to that of ace2 or an even more pronounced localization to the lower respiratory tract given its apparent lack of human-to-human spread it will also be interesting to determine whether the receptor is an ectopeptidase several alphacoronaviruses including hcov-229e and transmissible gastroenteritis virus a pathogenic porcine coronavirus use aminopeptidase n apn both apn and hace2 are ectopeptidases and cleave n-terminal amino acids from small peptides however in neither instance is the enzymatic activity of the protein required for receptor function suggesting that the structure of the ectodomain of each molecule is especially amenable to coronavirus binding in addition to serving as the receptor for sars-cov ace2 has lung-protective properties downregulation of ace2 as occurs during sars-cov infection is believed to contribute to pathological changes in the lung 7 it will be of interest to determine if the receptor for hcov-emc has similar properties identification of the receptor may also shed light on a potentially novel aspect of hcov-emc pathogenesis initial reports suggest that renal failure is part of the disease process 8 although at this point it is impossible to know whether this is a specific effect or a consequence of the multiorgan failure that often occurs in severely ill patients if kidney involvement is documented in most patients identification of the hcov-emc receptor may provide a basis for understanding why renal disease is common the sars-cov receptor ace2 is present at high levels in the human kidney and sars-cov was detected in the kidneys of some patients during the 2002-2003 epidemic but renal disease did not occur commonly during the infection 5 understanding the differential abilities of hcov-emc and sars-cov to cause renal disease will provide insight into a unique aspect of the hcov-emc infection of note coronavirus infection of the respiratory tract and renal system has been described in chickens infected with another coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv 9 ibv is best known as an important causative agent for upper respiratory tract disease in young chickens but strains that also infect the kidney have been identified the cellular receptor for ibv has not been identified so the relationship between receptor expression and disease for different ibv strains remains an area of active investigation finally mller et al demonstrated infection of bat-derived cultured cells raising the possibility that hcov-emc jumped species directly from bats to humans this also suggests that the host cell receptor if a protein is sufficiently similar between humans and bats to facilitate direct transmission bats are recognized as key reservoirs for viruses including several coronaviruses and henipaviruses such as nipah virus and hendra virus 5 in all cases bats do not appear to develop clinical disease but disease is severe when viruses cross over to infect human populations this is analogous to the situation in humans and sooty mangabeys infected with human immunodeficiency virus hiv and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus siv respectively sooty mangabeys infected with siv do not develop significant disease whereas hiv is fatal in humans 10 a critical question is why bats are tolerant of infections such as hcov-emc or sars-cov how do they clear the virus without developing immunopathological disease if coronavirus-infected bats are similar to siv-infected sooty mangabeys infection may not activate the host immune response to the same extent as it does in humans understanding how bats respond to the infection may provide insight into how specific aspects of the human immune response result in clinical disease this in turn may result in novel therapeutic interventions to diminish immunopathological disease while identification of the receptor will be an important advance the overarching question at present is whether hcov-emc is or will become an important human pathogen at this point fewer than 10 cases have been identified and the mortality rate has been greater than 50 with so few cases infection and analysis of laboratory animals will be required to fulfill kochs postulates and prove a causative role for hcov-emc in respiratory disease if hcov-emc is associated with respiratory disease in animals as seems likely epidemiological studies to provide a denominator for the total number of cases will be essential is hcov-emc a common infection in the middle east with most patients remaining asymptomatic or developing mild disease or is the infection rare but when infection occurs disease is severe development of tools to detect past and present infections is critical and will be facilitated by recent publications of the virus sequence and genomic analysis equally important will be the collection and analysis of samples from representative populations in the middle east most patients infected with sars-cov developed clinical disease with only a few infections remaining asymptomatic if hcov-emc is a new pathogen will it further adapt to human populations as the sars-cov did during the 2002-2003 epidemic 4 6 if virus is detected only rarely in human populations and never spreads significantly from human to human it may not be a major health issue but the interesting question of how these unlucky individuals were infected remains to be addressed   gaurav goswami jayanti prasad mansi dhuria   in the absence of any available vaccines or drugs prevention of the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is being achieved by putting many mitigation measures in place it is indispensable to have robust and reliable ways of evaluating the effectiveness of these measures in this work we assume that at a very coarse-grained level of description the overall effect of all the mitigation measures is that we can still describe the spread of the pandemic using the most basic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir model but with an effective contact rate  which is time-dependent we then use the time series data of the number of infected individuals in the population to extract the instantaneous effective contact rate which is the result of various social interventions put in place this approach has the potential to be significantly useful while evaluating the impact of mitigation measures on the spread of covid-19 in near future within a few months of its first outbreak coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 has infected millions of individuals worldwide and hence has been recognised as a pandemic by the world health organisation 1  we are just beginning to discover various relevant details about this pandemic and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus strain that causes it 2 3 4  as of now no candidate vaccine or drug has successfully completed any clinical trials given this various preventive and mitigative measures are being practised worldwide 5 6  it is extremely important to evaluate the impact and efficacy of these mitigation measures the most obvious way to answer these questions is to build elaborate mathematical models simulating the spread of the pandemic 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  the speed with which an epidemic spreads is dependent on a large number of factors eg an infectious disease has certain intrinsic parameters such as mean serial interval mean incubation period mean infectious period etc in addition the spread of the disease also depends on the ease with which newer susceptible individuals can get infected this plays a pivotal role in determining parameters such as the basic reproduction number of the epidemic in a population the mitigation measures essentially try to ensure that the number of contacts between infectious and susceptible individuals as well as the probability of infection on contact are as small as possible modelling the spread of an epidemic while the various mitigation measures are being practised is thus a complex task given this one might ask if there is a resurgence of the pandemic could we use the information we gain during the first wave to build better models which deal  gauravgoswamiahdunieduin  prasadjayantigmailcom  currently working as an independent researcher and data scientist  mansidhuriaiitramacin with the spread of the pandemic while the myriad mitigation measures are taking place the present work deals with an approach which could prove to be useful when we wish to have a coarse grained description which still takes into account all the different effects such as migrations contact tracing quarantines lockdowns heterogeneous mixing of population testing of some fraction of asymptomatic cases etc which go on almost simultaneously when an epidemic spreads we surmise that as these myriad complex processes take place at a very broad coarse grained level of description the dynamics of a pandemic such as covid-19 which is known to have some latency period is still going to be described by the well known susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir model 18 19 with an effective contact rate  which will be time-dependent we shall present a step-by-step procedure by which this time dependent effective contact rate t can be reliably reconstructed from the time series data of infectious fraction of the population we must emphasise that this effective instantaneous contact rate t is found while all the complicated mitigation measures and social distancing measures are being practised and put in place thus for a given population such as a given city we shall know the mitigation measures taken and we can use the procedure described in this work to determine the effective instantaneous contact rate or one of its smoothed incarnations since the knowledge of instantaneous effective contact rate lets us reliably calculate the evolution of an epidemic once this procedure is followed for a large number of localities with known mitigation measures one becomes better equipped in handling the impact of various mitigation measures this can prove to be very useful in planning for future outbreaks this paper is organised as follows in the next section we review some fundamentals of seir class of epidemiological models and describe how we can connect theory to observations in iii we provide a step-by-step procedure for reconstructing a raw effective contact rate and analyse the robustness of this procedure in addition in this section we present ways of smoothening the raw contact rate obtained and mention some applications in particular to the time series data of confirmed cases of many countries finally we conclude with discussions about the possible significance of our approach a seir models a quick reminder there exists a very large class of models which try to mathematically describe the spread of an epidemic in a population 18 19  the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir class of models are some of the simplest and most studied ones as an epidemic spreads at any time t let it be the number of infected individuals and st be the number of susceptible individuals in the population furthermore let rt be the number of individuals removed from the epidemic dynamics ie the number of those who have either died till time t or who have recovered till this time we assume that those individuals who have recovered from the disease can not become susceptible again since the functions it st and rt give the number of individuals their codomain must be the set of non-negative integers and hence strictly speaking these functions can not be continuous moreover the true dynamics of the number of individuals during the spread of an epidemic is stochastic in nature we shall mostly deal with the fractions s  sn  i  in  r  rn  where n is total population which we assume changes only negligibly during the course of the spread of the epidemic these quantities also change by discrete amounts but if the minimal possible change is sufficiently small we can think of st it and rt as differentiable functions in seir model 18 19 of the dynamics of epidemics these quantities evolve in accordance with the following differential equations here the parameter  is known as recovery rate since 1 is the average duration of recovery or average infectious period while the parameter  is known as incubation rate since 1 is the mean incubation period the values of these parameters for covid-19 have been experimentally estimated see eg 21 and 22  the parameter  can be physically understood in the following manner in a homogeneously mixed population in which everyone interacts with everyone else if a randomly chosen susceptible individual experiences  contacts per unit time with other individuals and if c is the probability of disease transmission when this individual comes in contact with an infectious individual then the quantity  is defined by the relation    ln1  c 18  for sufficiently small c thus  is the product of contact rate and disease transmission probability and it itself is often simply called the contact rate note that by its very definition this quantity can not be negative various mitigation measures will ensure that both  the rate of contact and c the probability of disease transmission will change it is this time dependence of the quantity  which we wish to extract from the data finally for seir models ignoring the changes in population due to births and deaths the quantity called basic reproduction number r 0  which is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection however see also eg 20  is given by this can be used to define an effective time dependent reproduction number rt by the same expression given the effective time dependence of  rt defined in this manner can be easily determined let us now connect the theoretical description of the spread of the pandemic to observations let j be an index characterising the day number then the observational data about quantities such as c j the number of confirmed cases of the pandemic till the day characterised by the index j d j the number of people who have died till the day characterised by the index j and r j the number of people who have recovered till the day characterised by the index j is available note how c j differs from a discretised version of it since c j represents the number of individuals infected till day j it is a cumulative quantity on the other hand it is the number of infected individuals at time t given the definitions of these quantities one expects that this can be used to find the number of people infected on day j ie i j from the observed data in the next subsection we will see how this can be used to reconstruct an effective time dependent  parameter in the very beginning when the very first cases of a pandemic are observed the cumulative number of dead and the cumulative number of recovered are both zero and at that stage i j and c j are identical as the cumulative number of dead and recovered increases the difference between i and c also increases but as long as the cumulative number of dead and the cumulative number of recovered are small compared to the number of confirmed cases i j remains close to c j  at a much later stage of the evolution of the pandemic i j begins to decrease while c j  being a cumulative quantity never decreases finally let us note that in the discrete form the seir evolution equations become for time dependent  a reconstructing the effective contact rate given the time series data of number of infected individuals each day i we follow the following simple steps to reconstruct not only e n  r n and s n  but also the effective time dependent contact rate  n  the method described here can be applied to any population which is sufficiently large but to illustrate the method we shall apply it to countries here are the steps of the procedure 1 for any country of interest we obtain the time series data of c j  d j  r j from 23 and obtain i j by following the procedure described in the last section we focus attention to the data for only those countries for which the number of tests per million at the time of writing is sufficiently large at least a few thousand see table i we shall also see what happens when we do work with the data for a country for which the number of tests per million is very low 2 we only begin to use the data from the time when the cumulative number of confirmed cases is greater than 25 this corresponds to the day which we shall characterise by the index n  1 let t i be the day before this similarly let us assume that the time series data is available till time t f  which also corresponds to n  n max  3 for each country we note down the date on which lockdowns began time t l  as well as its population n  we can now obtain the values of i n by dividing the number of infected by the population 4 we use the values of the recovery rate  and the incubation rate  available in the literature 21  22  5  at this stage we use eq 10 to find out e n for all n except n  n max since we will not know i nmax1  6 now we use eq 11 to find out r n for all n in order to do so we shall need r 1  to find this we assume that for the day which corresponds to n  1 the number of removed individuals is equal to the sum of number of recovered individuals and the number of dead individuals we shall eventually see what happens when we relax this assumption 7 knowing i n and having found e n  r n  we could find s n  1  i n  e n  r n  since we do not know e n for n  n max  we would only know s n for n  n max  8 now use eq 9 to find  n  n  e n1  e n  e n s n i n  since e n is only known till n max  1 the maximum value of n for which we can find e n1 in the rhs of the above equation must be n max  1 thus we can find  n for 1  n  n max  2 before proceeding we note that from eq 9 eq 10 and eq 12 it is easy to show that 13 moreover from eq 6 it is clear that this procedure will also give us a time dependent effective reproduction number r which is defined by eq 6 but for a time dependent  as a test of self-consistency of this procedure one could check whether eq 8 gets satisfied we confirm that this is indeed the case the above steps let us reconstruct the effective time dependent  using the seir evolution equations this kind of information about the effective  caused by various mitigation measures is of utmost importance if we wish to be able to simulate the mitigation measures this can in fact predict the long term spread of the epidemic in the rest of this subsection we shall understand various issues associated with this reconstruction let us look at the results of this procedure for a specific example case we first show these results for italy for which at the time of writing there have been 18481 tests per million ie 185 of the population so that one can be quite confident in trusting the data for italy the population as of 2019 is 604 million and on feb 22 2020 the number of infected became greater than 25 ie the day before this date corresponds to the time value t i and feb 22 2020 itself corresponds to n  1 similarly for italy lockdown time t l corresponds to the date march 09 2020 ie n l  17 finally if we analyse the italy data till april 15 2020 we would have n max  54 in fig 1  we show the result of step 8 above on the time series data for italy it is easy to see that the behaviour  looking at fig 1  it is clear that this reconstruction procedure can occasionally give negative values of  n for certain values of n this is obviously unphysical from eq 12  it is clear that this happens whenever e n1  1  e n  1 in the early stage of growth of the epidemic we do not expect that e n1 shall be less than e n  thus the occasional negative values can only arise due to fluctuations before proceeding we must note that at a much later stage we do expect that e n1 will be typically less than e n  but this also does not correspond to negative  it just means that in the rhs of eq 2 the second term is dominant since the description in terms of smooth functions is a coarse grained description of true stochastic dynamics the actual evolution of i n is not determined by deterministic differential equations or even difference equations it is a stochastic quantity whose evolution is only roughly captured by these equations thus when we use eq 8 -11 to determine  n from the data which in reality is determined not by these equations but by some stochastic dynamics we expected that due to the fluctuations inferred  n will occasionally be negative thus it is expected that only a smoothed out form of  obtained by reconstruction can be a sensible quantity 1 a similar condition for the existence of negative values of n in terms of in can also be found from eq 13 in step 6 of the reconstruction procedure we had chosen value of r 1  one expects that since the variable r n does not impact the dynamics of any other variable this choice should have no impact on the other hand the value of r n does determine the value of s n which gets used in finding  it is thus important to ask ourselves whether this has any impact on the reconstructed  we repeated the analysis for different chosen values of r 1 and found no change in the reconstructed  till now we have looked at the reconstructed  for a fixed set of values of the recovery rate  and incubation rate  one might wonder to what extent this reconstruction depends on these values in fig 2  we show how the reconstructed  changes for various choices of  and for various choices of  it is clear that the experimental uncertainties in the values of recovery rate and incubation rate lead to uncertainties in our reconstructed  in particular decreasing the central value of  leads to a slight decrease in reconstructed raw  while decreasing the central value of  leads to a substantial increase in reconstructed  this is of course easy to understand from eq 13 in units of day 1   and  are small compared to 1 so in the approximation in which we completely ignore them  n  1 this explains the strong inverse proportionality of  to  in order to find the dependence on  we can no longer ignore  as compared to 1 so there will be a weak dependence on  as the experimental limits on the recovery rate and the incubation rate improve our knowledge of t will also improve we also note in passing that the instantaneous effective reproduction number r will scale inversely as we change  we saw in iii a 2 that spurious fluctuations and occasional unphysical negative values turn up in reconstructed  because of random statistical fluctuations in the input time series data of infected fraction of the population we expect the actual  to be a positive function of time and we would like to use a more smooth functional form of  so that it can be described by a few numbers ie the reconstruction procedure described above gives us a raw contact rate  n and we need to find a smoothed version of  which one can easily work with to check that smoothing gets rid of occasional negative entries we found the moving average of reconstructed raw  for a window function of duration three days and five days  the uncertainties in reconstruction of  due to experimental uncertainties in the known values of the recovery rate  and the incubation rate  it is worth noting that decreasing  leads to a slight decrease in reconstructed raw  while decreasing  leads to a fairly substantial increase in reconstructed  values of  but also spurious fluctuations in the left plot of fig 3  one should also note that as expected the data for three-days moving average starts one day after n  1 and ends one day before n  n max  similarly the data for five-days moving average starts two days after n  1 and ends two days before n  n max  in addition to describe  by a smooth function so that it can be specified by only a few numbers we fitted a a low degree polynomial to the reconstructed raw  and b a step-down function of the form to the reconstructed raw  the parameters of this fitting function turn out to be a  052 b  070 t off  1890 t w  1035 while a cubic polynomial fit to the  turns out to be  poly t  108  002 t  272  10 3 t 2 both of these functions are shown in the right plot of fig  3  the parameters of the step down function are especially noteworthy t off  189 in comparison t l the lockdown day in this case is 17 also since t w  1035 this needs to be compared with the infectious period which was set to be 7 days for this run as we shall argue in the next section all of these smoothed out forms of  are as good as the raw  in modelling the effects of various mitigation measures any of the post-processed ie smoothed  found here can then be used to model the actual spread of a pandemic such as covid-19 one way to ensure that the procedure described in the last section is self-consistent is to evolve seir equations ie eqs 1-4  for the time dependent  obtained in the last section in order to do so we need to set the values of various parameters and initial conditions in eqs 1 2 3 4  needless to say for  and  we need to choose the same values for which we performed the reconstruction for initial condition for it we use the observed value of it i  obtained using eq 7  on the other hand for the fraction of population which is removed we set rt i   r 1  while for the fraction of population exposed we use the value of et i  obtained by our reconstruction procedure next we need to use the reconstructed  in seir evolution equations in order to do so we can either work with raw  or we can work with one of the smoothed forms of  found in the last section in fig 4  we show it found out after using the step-down form of t defined in eq 14 as well as the it obtained from observations from the fact that the two curves are so close we learn that instead of working with raw  we could also work with the step-down form of  in order to find the long term evolution of the infected population similarly in modelling the effects of various mitigation measures other smoothed out forms of  such as the moving average or the polynomial fit are almost as good as raw  itself at this stage it is easy to see that one could use eqs 1 2 3 4  to find the location of the peak the extent of flattening of the curve due to mitigation measures and other long term effects if the same mitigation measures continue furthermore if in the near future the mitigation measures are relaxed and we wish to reintroduce them 3  some of the ways of post-processing the raw contact rate to obtain a smoothed contact rate the grey points in both the plots correspond to the raw  left the blue points correspond to a moving average of three days duration while the green points correspond to the moving average of five days duration right the dashed blue curve in this figure is a smooth third order polynomial fit to raw  given by eq 15 and the solid red curve is a fit to the step-down function defined by eq 14 14 the data points correspond to it obtained from observations despite replacing the raw reconstructed  by the smooth step-down  the agreement between the two is noteworthy in a few weeks time the effective instantaneous contact rate found by the procedure described in the last section can be used to predict how the epidemic will spread in the next wave in the last section since replacing raw  n by a smoothed t did not have significant impact on the evolution of the fraction of infected population see fig 4  one could simply work with one of the smoothed forms of t since a smoothed form of t can be described by only a handful of numbers such as a b t off and t w for the step down function or the coefficients of various powers of t in the low degree polynomial function we can say that these few numbers carry information about the entire history of mitigation measures for italy during the period of spread of the pandemic thus depending on the population of interest such as a chosen country or a chosen city and depending on the chosen parameterisation of t we can find the few numbers which specify the mitigation history for the spread of covid-19 pandemic the social interventions taken up by various countries are very well known and well-recorded in the form of public policies media reports etc thus we can relate the mitigation measures taken up to the few numbers we use to parameterise t finally it is interesting to ask how the effective instantaneous contact rates of various countries compare with each other for each country one could either work with the raw data for  n or with one of the smoothed descriptions described in the last section we provide the raw  n for six additional countries in fig 5 and some useful basic information about these countries is given in table i the parameters  and  are both set to be 1 7 day 1  note that the date on which lockdowns begin are different for different countries thus the duration between the date of lockdown and the date till which data is used in this work is different for different countries note also that the extent of lockdowns is different for these different countries in fig 5  the impact of lockdowns can be seem from the behaviour of raw  n for all countries except india this is because the number of tests per million for india is very low see table i since many of the plots in fig 5 positive post-processed t in the absence of vaccines and treatment for a pandemic several mitigation measures are taken to slow down its spread and to ensure that the healthcare system does not get overwhelmed these measures include personal preventive measures such as the use of face masks self quarantine etc social distancing measures such as closing down of schools and cancellation of social gatherings etc travel restrictions curfews and so on when these drastic measures are practised on a large scale they often lead to severe socioeconomic disruptions given this it is extremely important that we should be able to compare the economic costs of disruptions to the extent to which the spread of a pandemic can be arrested by these measures this is a task which can potentially be handled by sufficiently well predictive mathematical models of the spread of pandemics needless to say any reliable forecasting for a system as complex as a city or a country is a colossally difficult task often one has to build a virtual copy of the entire population of interest in ones simulation taking into account such diverse effects as migrations number of contacts per day the effect of testing contact tracing etc despite this the predictions of the model depend on the values of a large number of parameters whose values can only be roughly estimated at best moreover all of this modelling needs to be done while unprecedented mitigation measures are taking place this just leads to the fact that typically models which try to take into account a very detailed description of the spread of the pandemic still prove to be inadequate while detailed modelling which takes into account these various effects can be done in this paper we assumed that at a very coarse grained level of description all of this amounts to causing the effective  in seir models to become time dependent if that is so it is interesting to see how this effective  changes in time because of various social interventions for various populations keeping this motivation in mind we presented a procedure which can be used to reconstruct this time dependent ie instantaneous  from the time series data of the number of confirmed cases we began in section ii a by reminding the reader some fundamentals of seir models particularly the physical significance of the quantity  in section ii b we described how the variables turning up in the theoretical formulation are related to the observed quantities and illustrate it with an example then in section iii we began by elaborating on the procedure for obtaining a raw form of  by reconstructing from the time series data by making use of seir evolution equations it turns out that this raw form of  can occasionally take unphysical negative values we have explained what causes this to happen furthermore the reconstruction procedure depends on the values of other parameters such as recovery rate denote by  and incubation rate denoted by  whose experimentally known values have experimental uncertainties since this will lead to uncertainties in the determination of raw  we found out how much this uncertainty in raw  is next in section iii b we presented methods by which one can obtain smoothed form of  free from spurious fluctuations and unphysical negative values a smoothed  can be described by a very few numbers these few numbers carry information about the entire history of mitigation measures during the spread of the pandemic since for every country with known mitigation measures these handful of numbers can be determined we can find which mitigation measures lead to which behaviour of  we then illustrated how smoothed  could be used to evolve seir equations this can be used to find the evolution of the number of infected individuals if the mitigation measures are known beforehand finally we provided the raw  for six countries to demonstrate the method since many of the entries in raw  n turn out to be negative one needs to apply smoothening procedures to obtain a physically acceptable t from raw  n  in summary we have presented a method which can be used to extract a raw instantaneous effective contact rate for every population which undertakes mitigation measures we described procedures for post-processing this raw contact rate to obtain a more physically acceptable instantaneous effective contact rate this processed contact rate can be described by a few parameters in future one could find this instantaneous processed contact table i for details the vertical dashed line corresponds to t l  the time at which lockdown is implemented the dramatic change in the behaviour of effective  after lockdown is quite apparent for all countries except india for which the number of tests per million is lowest among the countries considered here see table i rate for various populations and relate it to the mitigation measures being put in place eventually this can help us better understand to what extent a given mitigation measure affects the spread of the epidemic  an analysis of international health regulations emergency committees and public health emergency of international concern designations lucia mullen christina potter lawrence gostin o anita cicero jennifer nuzzo b   in the aftermath of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak the who fundamentally revised the international health regulations ihr which entered into force in 2007 the 196 states parties to the ihr recognised that certain public health events pose a significant risk to the global community and should be designated as a public health emergency of international concern pheic under article i of the ihr a pheic is defined by three criteria an extraordinary event which constitutes a public health risk to other states through international spread of disease andpotentially requires a coordinated international response the ihr annex 2 provides a decision instrument that guides states parties as to which health events have the potential to become pheics thus requiring reporting to who annex 2 of the ihr provides a decision instrument for states parties to assess which events detected by national surveillance systems would require notification to the who this includes a single case of smallpox poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus human influenza caused by a new subtype and sars other health events that have the potential to cause international public health concerns or serious impact trigger an algorithm to determine if notification to who is required criteria for this algorithm include determining if the event is serious unusual or unexpected has a significant risk of international spread or poses a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions if two of the criteria are true then notification to who is required under the ihr the ihr also empowers the who director-general dg to convene an emergency committee ec which consists of international experts brought together on an ad-hoc basis the ec provides their advice on whether the current situation should be considered a pheic and what temporary recommendations should be given to member states to bolster the response and control the outbreak ultimately however the who dg has sole authority to declare a pheic and make temporary recommendations for member states to follow1 the whos decision-making under the ihr has come under intense scrutiny especially its decision whether to declare a pheic global commissions for example strongly criticised the organisation for waiting 4 months after international spread of ebola virus disease evd in west africa 20142016 before declaring an emergency2 during the ongoing evd outbreak in the democratic republic of congo drc the ec met a total of six times but did not declare a pheic until the fourth convocation more than 11 months after the outbreak began3 4 most recently the whos judgement in response to coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 has been questioned the who dg first convened the ec on january 22 but announced it had insufficient data from china to arrive at a decision the following day the ec was almost equally divided but ultimately said it was too early to declare a pheic seven days later on 30 january 2020 during the second ec meeting the dg declared a pheic the who dg openly stated that the ihr should be reformed to allow intermediate levels for declaring an emergency suggesting that an all or nothing standard hindered ec decision-making3 5 experts have urged who to clarify how decisions should be reached68 as well as proposing greater transparency in the ec decision-making process to better understand why the committee recommended or did not recommend a pheic declaration9 overall the ihr ec decision-making process is open to considerable interpretation10 in addition the who dg has raised concerns about the negative impacts that pheic declarations may trigger especially travel and trade restrictions3 5 to date there has yet to be a comprehensive analysis of ec recommendations and who dg decision-making regarding pheic declarations to describe how the ec and the who dg relied on and interpreted these criteria in previous decisions to declare or not to declare pheics we examined the ecs decision-making in all instances where it has met from when the revised ihr entered into force in 2007 we summarised and categorised the justifications offered by the ec identified the criteria used in each situation and compared these to criteria for pheics outlined by the ihr based on this analysis we offer important recommendations for increasing transparency and consistency in ec recommendations and pheic decision-making adoption of these regulations would strengthen ihr decision-making and who legitimacy in responding to major outbreaks patients and the public were not involved in this study approximately 1 month after initial cases were detected the first ec was convened and a pheic declared the ec indicated that all three conditions for a pheic had been met the event was considered extraordinary there was a public health risk to other states via international spread and an international response was required to control the outbreak the ec met a total of nine times throughout the pandemic but did not recommend the pheic be declared over until 10 august 2010 as it no longer represented an extraordinary event the world was no longer experiencing an influenza pandemic and the response did not require immediate emergency actions on an international scale3 while regular notifications of mers-cov cases were reported to who for 20122013 approximately 10 months following the initial notification on 22 september 2012 the who dg convened the ec to independently offer an expert review of the situation regarding this novel virus at the first meeting on 9 july 2013 the ec determined that more information was needed and further time was warranted for deliberation therefore it was agreed that the committee would meet in 8 days to provide a decision the ec met a total of 10 times between 9 july 2013 and 2 september 2015 and a pheic was not declared at any point3 numerous countries reported mers-cov cases thus indicating there was a public health risk to other countries through international spread11 12 in 2015 south korea reported 186 laboratory-confirmed cases and 38 deaths the largest outbreak outside of the middle east13 that same year on 2 september 2015 the ec noted that progress is not yet sufficient to control this threat and until this is achieved individual countries and the global community will remain at significant risk for further outbreaks despite being a novel virus the ec did not consider the mers-cov outbreaks to be an extraordinary event while the ec did not explicitly state that a coordinated international response was required in their final meeting they noted that sectors must collaborate among themselves and internationally implying a coordinated international response was necessary3 the first ec meeting on 2829 april 2014 was convened to discuss the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 and its threat to the global polio eradication initiative the difference between the low transmission rates for poliovirus in 2012 and early 2013 compared to a rapid increase in transmission rates in late 2013 and into 2014 brought concern that eradication efforts were at risk the committee reported all conditions for a pheic were met since 28 april 2014 the ec convened an additional 21 times and deemed the pheic declaration should continue as the risk of international spread and need for a coordinated international response remained the committee also argued that the extraordinary context of being close to polio eradication and the concern of complacency threatening the eradication efforts support the argument to continue the pheic declaration3 the who published the official notification of the outbreak on 23 march 201414 the first ec was convened over 4 months later on 67 august 2014 after cases had been reported from guinea liberia nigeria and sierra leone the committee determined the outbreak constituted an extraordinary event posed a public health risk to other states through international spread and required a coordinated international response to control the virus therefore concluding the conditions for a pheic have been met3 two months after the pan american health organization and who published an epidemiological alert regarding an increase in neurological disorders in areas where zika was reported15 on 1 february 2016 the ec was convened to deliberate on whether a pheic was constituted3 while 25 countries in the americas had reported cases of zika16 17 there was no mention of the public health risk to other states through international spread in the initial meeting where a pheic was declared the committee also did not note whether a coordinated international response was required there was no mention in this meeting that the event was considered extraordinary however language from a later ec meeting on 18 november 2016 indicated that the unknown apparent association between zika and neurological disorders was considered an extraordinary event the ec did not determine that zika itself was a pheic but rather the report of zika cases with the additional concern of neurological disorders constituted a pheic the ec met a total of five times from february 2016 to 18 november 2016 and noted the gaps in knowledge of the virus and its consequences3 four months after notification of yellow fever cases in angola18 the who dg convened an ec on 19 may 2016 there was international spread of yellow fever to drc china and kenya and the committee noted the international risk posed by the outbreak it also called for international support for the response yet the ec determined the event did not constitute a pheic the committee met a second time on 31 august 2016 and reported similar findings during both meetings the committee made no note on whether the outbreak was considered an extraordinary event3 the ninth evd outbreak of drc was declared by its ministry of health on 8 may 2018 in the equateur province19 and 10 days later the who dg convened the ec the committee reported that the conditions for a pheic had not been met while the committee noted that the public health risk of international spread was high they considered that the robust coordinated response by the drc government who and partners and the interventions underway provided strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control the committee also noted that there was no actual international spread which appeared to impact their decision not to declare a pheic as they noted if the outbreak expands significantly or if there is international spread the emergency committee will be reconvened the committee made no mention on whether the event was considered extraordinary due to the brevity of the outbreak only one ec meeting was convened3 on 17 october 2018 the who dg convened the first ec for drcs 10th evd outbreak centred in the north kivu and ituri provinces a pheic was not declared until the fourth ec meeting on 17 july 2019 the committee expressed in multiple meetings that a pheic declaration may be detrimental to the ongoing response for example in the second ec meeting the committee noted there is no added benefit to declaring a pheic at this stage and in the third ec meeting the committee extensively debated the impact of a pheic declaration on the response possible unintended consequences and how these might be managed during the first two meetings while the ec reported that while there was a high risk of spread at the national and regional levels it did not think that transnational spread beyond bordering countries was likely the committee gave no indication as to whether the noted risk of regional spread met the ihr criterion of a public health risk to other states through international spread however during the third ec meeting on 14 june 2019 the committee acknowledged that recent cases in uganda constitute international spread of disease and considered the outbreak had a risk of international spread the committee called for the drc government who and partners to intensify the response to ensure the situation did not deteriorate during earlier meetings but it did not specifically state a coordinated international response was needed until the fourth meeting during the third ec the committee explicitly reported the event as extraordinary acknowledged the risk of the disease spreading to neighbouring countriesas cases had been reported in ugandaand called for the international community to step up funding and support for the response however the ec still stated that the outbreak did not meet all the three criteria for a pheic at the time1 it was not until the following meeting when the committee stated it was the view of the committee that a coordinated international response under the international health regulations 2005 is required thus the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern pheic under the ihr 2005 have been met3 the ec has met an additional two times and advised for a continuation of a pheic declaration as the committee was concerned that withdrawing the pheic now might have adverse consequences for the response efforts through diminishing focus3 4 china notified who of a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown aetiology on 31 december 201920 and the who dg convened the ec approximately 3 weeks later on 2223 january 2020 at the time 557 cases were reported and four countries confirmed exported travel-related cases from china similar to previous ec meetings for mers polio and west africa ebola the first ec meeting for novel coronavirus did not reach a decision on the first day of meeting but continued its deliberations on the next day due to the need for additional information and deliberation in the ec statement the committee noted that it is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country implying an ongoing public health risk to other states via international spread while it was reported that members of the emergency committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a pheic or not ultimately a pheic was not declared at the end of 23 january as seen with mers-cov the who dg suggested the ec reconvene in a matter of days to reassess the evolving situation and provide an updated determination on whether the event constitutes a pheic the ec met again on 30 january 2020 when there were 7711 confirmed cases in china and an additional 83 reported cases in 18 other countries at which time the ec agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a public health emergency of international concern the ec reiterated its language from the prior meeting regarding risk of importation indicating an ongoing public health risk to other states via international spread additionally the ec stated in the second meeting that they felt that a global coordinated effort is needed neither the first nor second ec meeting noted whether or not the event was considered extraordinary3 at the time of writing covid-19 was reported in countries on six continents spreading rapidly including through community transmission21 figure 13 4 outlines which criteria and thematic factors were explicitly stated or implied as contributing to the ec recommendation to the who dg we find considerable inconsistency in statements issued by the ec regarding their determination of whether the ihr criteria for a pheic have been met the ecs did not always require each of the three conditions to be met in order to recommend that a pheic should be declared during the first zika ec meeting when a pheic was recommended there was no explicit mention of a risk of international spread nor did the ec state that a coordinated international response was required in contrast the ec determined the yellow fever outbreaks in 2016 did not constitute a pheic even though they stated the outbreaks posed a public health risk to other states through international spread and indicated that enhanced international support was needed3 when the ecs did reference specific pheic criteria they were often inconsistent in their interpretation of whether the criteria were met for example for some events h1n1 polio and the west africa evd outbreak ecs interpreted the criterion of requiring a coordinated international response to mean that the event required such coordination but did necessitate that on-going coordination be enhanced or improved in order for the criterion to be met in contrast for the ninth drc evd outbreak the ec argued that while the response should be supported by the entire international community implying the need for a coordinated international response a pheic was not necessary because the existing response was rapid and comprehensive and there was reason to believe the outbreak could be brought under control similarly for the 10th drc evd outbreak in earlier meetings the committee noted the government of the democratic republic of congo who and partners must intensify the current response indicating a coordinated international response was underway however the ec did not acknowledge that the criterion of a coordinated international response was met until the forth ec meeting on 17 july 20193 the criterion for determining if an event is considered extraordinary was also interpreted inconsistently for both h1n1 and zika insufficient knowledge about the virus was cited as a factor in these situations being deemed extraordinary events in contrast the ec s never stated that mers-cov and covid-19 both outbreaks resulting from novel viruses for which there were significant gaps in knowledge of disease aetiology constituted an extraordinary event3 ecs varied in their interpretation of and the supporting evidence used to assess the criterion of there being a risk of international spread the ec was inconsistent in whether it required that international spread to have already occurred vs there simply being risk that spread could occur in order for this criterion to be met in some cases h1n1 polio west africa evd yellow fever ninth drc evd outbreak 10th drc evd outbreak the ec noted the threat of international spread when a disease involved sustained human-to-human or community transmission however despite the absence of sustained human-to-human transmission the ec considered mers-cov outbreak to have a risk of international spread stating the possibility of international spread remains of concern on 4 february 2015 for polio an impending mass gathering the hajj was used as rationale to continue a pheic declaration due to the risk it posed for international spread however for mers-cov the ec did not note that they considered the hajj a factor that contributed to the risk of international spread the upcoming olympics were also acknowledged during zika ec meetings and it was recognised that mass gatherings can pose additional risks to international spread it was ultimately deemed that with proper public health control measures the risk of the olympics contributing to international spread was negligible and therefore not factored into this criterion3 by design this study only reviewed the official statements of ec meetings to identify and analyse the rationale provided and determine if pheic criteria were present or absent most but not all ec meetings were followed by a press conference where the dg and the chair of the ec provided a verbal report of the meeting and answer questions posed by journalists while these press conferences often allowed for further clarification of the ec decision whether or not additional clarifying information was relayed at press conferences was often contingent on the types of questions that happened to be asked by member of the press as a result these conferences cannot be viewed as a replacement for ec reports as a vehicle for explaining the rationale used by the ec in deciding whether an event met each of ihr criteria for a pheic declaration to ensure there is complete understanding of the analysis and decision-making of the ec the official reports of the ec should contain all of the necessary information regarding which ihr criteria were determined to have been transparency in this ihr process must be prioritised and therefore the official ec statements must provide a clear indication of how each of the three ihr criteria were deemed to have been met and include all the relevant information necessary to justify the decision to recommend declaration or not of a pheic lack of consistency and clarity regarding the ec and the who dgs decision-making contributes to ongoing concerns about a lack of transparency in the pheic process and other public disagreements with pheic declarations9 though ecs may have discussed each outbreak with greater clarity and consistency than what was publicly reported it is important that the public representation of the ecs rationale be fully articulated so that member states and outside observers have a full record of the ecs decision-making process lack of transparency surrounding the ec process has been a continuous point of contention for public health experts who noted the original reticence of who to disclose the identity of ec members following the h1n1 ec deliberations22 similarly it is important that the ecs recommendations are seen as consistent with the expectations of the ihr we recommend that in future convenings the ec standardise their reviews of events to specifically address whether the event met each of the three criteria and to list corresponding evidence to support the presenceabsence of each criterion in addition the ec should offer detailed explanation of how they interpreted the criteria in order to standardise the ec review process and ensure explanations are provided to clearly justify decisions on pheic declarations and non-declarations ec members should undergo further training regarding the authorities and decision-making criteria established by the ihr a sentiment that is shared by other public health and international law experts22 notably global health law experts have not been part of the composition of ecs3 4 adding legal expertise to future ec deliberations will help to resolve confusion about the ihr criteria and promote consistency with previous decisions going forward the who should in consultation with member states and legal experts develop clear guidelines to aid ecs in interpreting pheic criteria in particular there seems to be confusion among ec members as to whether the risk of international spread criterion has to involve documented international spread the ihrs do not specify that international spread must have already occurred and it would likely be against the spirit of the ihrs which aim to reduce international spread of infectious diseases for the ecs to need to wait until international spread has occurred in order to declare a pheic1 the makeup of the ec is ill-equipped to address political and social considerations while these considerations are important and relevant factors to take into account when responding to an outbreak the ihr does not provide the ecs with the authority to consider the political and social implications the ecs should disavow including these concerns in their deliberations and ensure that they only consider the available technical evidence on whether the three core criteria have or have not been met when determining if the event constitutes a pheic other avenues should be used to account for the political and social considerations as they are a necessary component of ensuring a robust and successful response to a health emergency box 1 provides a summary of the recommendations outlined in this paper with more consistency and transparency in ec justifications there could be a better understanding on how the ec and the who dg reach their decision on whether an event should be considered a pheic similarly as previous pheic determinations are often reviewed to compare the decision-making processes between public health events a more structured approach should be provided that explicitly states what criteria were met and how the ec determined that each criterion was satisfied this approach will remove some ambiguity and enable the international community to gain further insight into the ecs thought process and their recommendations on whether to declare a pheic it is essential for pheic declarations to be made based on science not politics in recent convenings ecs have seemed reluctant to recommend a pheic declaration noting the potential for countries to respond with trade and travel measures that could harm response to the health event3 23 though concerns that countries may pursue harmful measures to stop the importation of disease are legitimate24 the decision-making process established by the ihr does not accommodate these political considerations1 the ecs should review the potential public health impact of the event and limit their decision-making to a technical assessment of each event the who should address separately outside of the pheic declaration process the problem of member states taking actions that are inconsistent with who recommendations and place unnecessary travel and trade restrictions on affected countries which would be detrimental to both the country and the response efforts pheic declarations are not the entire focus of the ihr the regulations also require countries to develop capacities to detect and report potential pheics1 if there is a lack of understanding of the rationale that ec uses to recommend pheic declarations or if pheic declarations are seen to be political it could undermine confidence in the ihr though the ihr are instruments of law their impact depends on countries willingness to comply it is essential for future compliance with the ihr that the who ecs and member states interpret the framework as written if the regulations are thought to be inadequate in supporting assessment and response to international public health emergencies then a revision of the ihr may be necessary following the ecs recommendation to declare the on-going covid-19 epidemic a pheic the who dg expressed frustration with the binary decision-making set up by the ihrs and suggested that a tiered decision-making tool with an intermediary measure may be more useful to gauge the level of emergency posed by health events3 such a suggestion would likely require a revision of the ihr as the decision instrument contained in annex 2 does not accommodate a multi-phase declaration this first comprehensive review of ec statements found considerable inconsistency in the justifications dictating which criteria were considered to be met and how the criteria were considered to be satisfied recently debates about the value and timing of pheic declarations have also called into question the benefit and impact of pheic declarations25 26 some of these concerns may stem from lack of understanding of ecs rationale and ecs lack of agreement andor understanding of pheic criteria set forth by the ihr striving for more consistency and transparency in the ec justifications around pheic declarations would benefit future deliberations and help to build more understanding and support for the process  statistical analysis of the impact of environmental temperature on the exponential growth rate of cases infected by covid-19 george livadiotis oscar millet   the daily number of new cases infected by covid-19 is currently exponentially growing for most countries affected by the virus however this exponential growth rate varies significantly for different regions over the globe it is urgent and timely to understand the reasons behind this regional variation of the exponential growth rates little information is known about this matter while there are indications that the environmental temperature may be a factor for instance northern and colder us and italian regions experienced much more incidents than others typically the evolution curve of the spread of the coronavirus initiates with a pre-exponential phase which is characterized by a mild logarithmic growth followed by the outbreak that is the phase of the exponential growth social-distancing measures against the spread may affect the evolution curve in a way that the exponential growth slows down decelerated phase and starts to decline decline or decay phase 1 depending though on the effectiveness and applicability of these measures however after the decline of the spread at some place new infected cases may outbreak in other places marked with insignificant number of cases until that moment then a newly growth phase may appear for example fig 1 left shows the evolution curve of the spread for the infected cases in mainland china clearly we observe the whole growthdecay cycle as well as a new re-growth phase super-strict measures such as complete shut down and quarantines can successfully lead to the deceleration of the exponential growth of infected cases 2 unfortunately they cannot be successfully applied and followed within vast regions and especially for a long and indefinite period of time inevitably measures may be loosened during the decay phase  if not earlier leading to the birth of an equally disastrous re-growth phase the exponential growth is the most effective phase for the evolution curve of infected cases and the most important question regarding this evolution is still open 3 what can influence the exponential growth rate and thus flatten the curve measures strict or not may affect the evolution of new infected cases by shifting the spread curve from the exponential to the decelerated growth it should be noted though that measures do not affect the exponential growth rate itself but only the period of time that this exponential phase applies then what factors do affect the exponential growth rate the age distribution in the place where the outbreak occurs is unlikely to be a factor indeed the number of new cases is known to be positively correlated with age however the exponential growth rate china 0169 us 0121 italy 0090 decreasing rate appears to be negatively correlated to the age median of these countries china 374 us 381 italy 455 increasing age hence the age is likely irrelevant to the rate variations in addition culture in social activities may be a factor for example this might be contributing in the observed differences among the exponential rates in the cases of china italy and us fig 1 however what is causing the major variation of exponential rates among different regions of the same culture it is apparent that culture does not constitute the main factor influencing the exponential rate fig 2 shows the regional variation of infected cases left during the exponential growth phase and the average winter temperature right in italy the possible negative correlation observed between regional number of infected cases and winter temperature in italy is an indication of the influence of temperature on the exponential growth but it certainly does not constitute a necessary condition the reason is that the map plots the total number of the infected cases nt which is not dependent only on the exponential growth rate  but also on the initial number of cases n0 it is generally accepted that the initial infected cases in italy were travelled directly from china since some destinations are more favorable than others then the initial number of cases n0 as well as the current number of cases nt which is proportional to n0 should be subject of regional variation therefore there is a non-negligible possibility the observed regional variation of the number of infected cases nt to be caused by the regional distribution of the initial cases n0 in such a case main airport cities would have incredibly high number of infected cases outplaying a possible negative correlation of daily infected cases with regional average temperature t the latter may be one of the reasons of the high numbers of cases observed in new york city and rome on the other hand in their letter to the white house members of a national academy of sciences committee said that there is some evidence to suggest that coronavirus may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity however given the lack of host immunity globally this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread without the concomitant adoption of major public health interventions 4 nevertheless it has to be stressed out that there were no statistical analyses focused on the exponential growth rates of the infected cases in regions with different temperatures for instance several authors eg 5 6 found insignificant correlations between temperatures and confirmed cases however their analysis was performed on the number of the infected cases nt which is subject to the randomness of the initial cases n0 as explained above and not on the exponential growth rate  which is clearly dependent on physical characteristics of the coronavirus binding protein and environment analysis of regional cases can show whether the speculated negative correlation between temperature and number of infected cases is true meaning a negative correlation between temperature and exponential growth rate if the environmental temperature plays indeed a substantial role on the virus spread then this can provide promising results such as the estimation of the critical temperature that may eliminate the number of daily new cases in heavily infected regions the purpose of this paper is to improve our understanding of the effect of environmental temperature on the spread of covid-19 and its exponential growth rate in particular we calculate the exponential growth rates of infected cases for us and italian regions derive the relationship of these rates with the environmental temperature evaluate its statistical confidence and determine the critical temperature that eliminates this rate a standard model for describing the evolution of the infected cases by viruses can be constructed as follows

ntn0exp1lnr0t3b we note that the number of the infected cases does not vary for times t taken in-between the integer multiples of  but this is not expected in mixtures of populations with random characteristics indeed in a mixture of m evolving infected populations with different initial number of cases n0m and starting times t0m m  1 2  m the total number of infected cases n at a continuous time t is given by

withn0m1mn0mexp1lnr0t0i3d
which coincides with 3b but with time t varying on a daily basis independently of the larger value of   5 days 15 therefore we set the readout of the total number of infected cases n on a daily basis such as ntntd then eq 3d matches eq 2b
ntn0exp1lnr0tn0expt4
where the exponential rate is given by
lnr05 the main factors that can affect the exponential rate  are a culture in social activities and b environmental temperature andor other thermodynamic parameters intense cultural and social activities have reasonably a positive correlation with r0 as previously mentioned measures against the virus spread do not effectively influence the exponential growth rate eg they do not change the culture in social activities which are characteristics of the particular population but they just cease these social activities for some period of time in terms of modeling measures appear only in the negative feedback factor i and not in the e factor of model in eq 1 while the culture together with the environmental temperature are the two main parameters affecting r0 directly potentially the environmental temperature t can affect all the parameters influencing exponential rate we approach this dependence by i a linear approximation of the phenomenological relationship between exponential rate and temperature and ii the connection of reproduction number with arrhenius behavior with negative activation energy i the temperature can affect the physical properties of coronavirus such as the incubation time  as well as the reproduction number r0 that depends on these physical properties 13 a linear approximation absorbs the weak temperature dependence of any parameters involved in the exponential rate then eq 5 is linearly expanded as
t1lnr0ntptntptntptot26
where we set the intercept to be given in normal conditions of atmospheric temperature and pressure ntp that is t  20 c0 p  1atm then we rewrite the exponential rate as

where 0 and p2 are the intercept and slope of the linear relation 7a ii coronavirus uses their major surface spike protein to bind on a receptoranother protein that acts like a doorway into a human cell 19 the whole process is a slow chemical reaction where the mechanism behind can lead to rates negatively correlated with temperature ie increasing rate with decreasing temperature this is consistent to reaction rate expressed by the arrhenius exponential with negative activation energy expeakbt 20 then the effective reproduction number r0t is expressed as a product combining the reproduction number in the absence of temperature effect r0 and the arrhenius exponential rate namely
r0tr0expeakbtwithr0r0ntpexpeakbtntp8 then eq 5 gives
t1eakbtntplnr0ntp1eakbt19 we rewrite this expression as

where 0 and p2 are the intercept and slope of the linear relation 10a respectively reactions of negative activation energy are barrier-less relying on the capture of the molecules in a potential well increasing decreasing the temperature leads to a reduced gained probability of the colliding molecules capturing one another due to the negative activation energy decreasing the environmental temperature reduces the probability of virus-protein reaction thus the virus may stay inactive on air or surfaces and eventually die exponential growth is related to community spread through outdoors activities while the decelerated growth caused by effective measures is related to indoors activities exponential growth exists once the disease is still effective and the measures are loosened allowing people to outdoor social activities however exponential growth decelerates followed by the decay phase once effective measures hold people in small groups indoors therefore exponential growth rate must be related to outdoors rather than indoors activities and thus to the environmental temperature as long as the exponential growth takes place the environmental temperature has an effective role on the chemical reaction between virus and spike protein it should be noted that both the models 7b and 10b consider that the exponential rate  or the reproduction number r0 are subject to a component influenced by the culture in social activities intercept 0 and a component mostly influenced by the temperature linear term with slope p2 in this way the slope may indicate some universal quantity involved such as the negative activation energy next we employ the above two expressions of exponential rate  and temperature t eqs 7a and 10a in order to set the two types of statistical models for fitting   measurements for us and italian regions we use publicly available datasets of 1 average environmental temperature of us and italian regions eg see wwwncdcnoaagovdata-accessland-based-station-dataland-based-datasetsclimate-normals itclimate-dataorg wwwweather-atlascom 2 time series of the number of daily infected cases of us and italian regions eg see wwwthelancetcom wwwprotezionecivilegovit we analyze the datasets of regional infected cases in us and italy derive the relationship of the exponential growth rate of the number of cases with temperature and evaluate its statistical confidence first we derive the exponential growth rates of the infected cases characterizing each examined region of us and italy then we plot these values against the environmental temperatures of each region and perform the corresponding statistical analysis we proceed according to the following steps the hypothesis to be tested is that the exponential growth rate  varies linearly with temperature x is set to be the temperature or its inverse this is tested by examining the chi-square corresponding to the fitting of the two-parameter linear statistical model xp1p2  p1p2x to the given n data points the number of data point n should not to be confused with the number of cases nt therefore we minimize the chi-square 2p1p2i1nip22ip1p2xi2 where the total variance that characterize each data point is now given by ip22  i2p22xi2 21 the global minimum of the chi-square function 2p1p2 gives the optimal parameter values p1p2 by solving the normal equations 2p1p2p1  0 and 2p1p2p2  0 the minimum chi-square value is min22p1p2 the statistical errors of these values are given by pstred2h1   12 where h is the hessian matrix of the chi-square at the global minimum and h1 is the -th diagonal element of its inverse matrix 2223 red21n2min2 is the reduced chi-square value for degrees of freedom dof equal to m  n-2 the propagation errors of the measurements xixiiii1n are given by pprpxi2x2ipi22i   12 where the derivatives are numerically derived we will use two linear statistical models a t  01tc1t and b t1  01tct1 as given by eqs 7a and 10a both can be written with the linear expression

ixtp10p20tc1andiixt1p10p20tc11b the statistical confidence of the dependence of the exponential growth rate on the environmental average temperature may be sufficiently high leading to the acceptance of any of the two statistical models the goodness of the fitting of each model is evaluated using two types of statistical tests the reduced chi-square the p-value of the extremes and their combination eg 2426 while students t-test is also used for evaluating the statistical confidence of the derived slopes the linear fitting of log nt or log nt with respect to time t within the region of exponential growth phase resulted to the respective rates which are given by the fitted slopes their weighted averages are shown in table 1 for us and in table 2 for italian regions while plotted against the average regional temperature in figs 5 and 6 respectively the method of weighted fitting for double uncertainties xixi ii as described by 21 is used for estimating the fitting parameters 0 tc together with their statistical propagation and total errors the fits of the linear statistical model with temperature xi  ti left panels in figs 5 and 6 as well as of the alternative statistical model with inverse temperature xi  ti-1 xi  titi-2 right panels in figs 5 and 6 are both characterized with high statistical confidence attaining high p-values 005 and reduced chi-squares red2 values close to 1 also both fits provide similar estimations of tc the fitting results are shown in table 3 we also examine whether the sample points titi ii are subject to statistically significant concentrations or rarefactions namely whether possible heterogeneities within the distribution of sample points plays significant role in the fitted relationship for this we derive the temperature-rate relationship and its statistical confidence by fitting the homogenized set of sample points instead of the raw sample points then we examine whether the fitting parameters differ from those derived from fitting the raw sample points we homogenize the sample points by grouping them in temperature bins of t  1 c0 eg see 29 we estimate the weighted mean and error of the rates included in each bin in the case of us regions we also performed a homogenization of rates by grouping the temperature-binned means in rate bins of   001 d-1 in the case of sample points with inverse temperatures ti-1ti-1 ii the procedure is exactly the same homogenized datasets result in a smooth relationship between the values of binned temperature and rate as it can be observed in the plots of rate against temperature or inverse temperature left or right lower panels respectively and for both us and italy regions figs 5 and 6 respectively the results are highly supportive of the negative correlation between rate and temperature the results are shown in table 4 we observe that the linear relationships of the growth rate with temperature or inverse temperature are characterized by high statistical confidence for the homogenized datasets p-values much higher than the significant limit of 005 red2 far from the significant limits of 01 and 10 therefore the arrangement of sample points do not affect significantly the fitting results in addition as shown in tables 3 and 4 the linear fits of sample points titi ii and ti-1ti-1 ii do not pass the students t-test for the null hypothesis that their slopes equals zero ie the corresponding pt-values are smaller than the acceptable confidence limit of 005 therefore the negative correlation of environmental temperature with the exponential rate is statistically significant accepted with confidence 95 in order to improve the statistics of the estimated critical temperature we combine the sample points titi ii of us and italian regions first we perform the students t-test to compare the slopes from these regions we find high pt-values 005 for both fits of x  t and x  t-1 thus the two populations are likely characterized by the same slope the respective intercept 0 does not pass the same test ie the intercepts corresponding to us and italian regions are likely different that is expected given of the different culture a universality may characterize the slopes of two countries either for the fits with x  t or x  t-1 ie p2  tntp or p2  eakb respectively next we perform the linear fits of the sample points titi ii and ti-1ti-1 ii for the mixed set of us and italian data once the rates of the italian regions are shifted by  this is allowed since it has just be shown that a universality is likely characterized the slopes the optimal fitting is obtained for that shift  for which the reduced chi-square is 1 the p-value of the extremes is 05 and the combined measure 0 see previous section fig 7 shows how the combined datasets of temperature-rates from us and italian regions lead to the optimal fitting note that the optimization is not performed for the binned datasets since they are characterized by smaller p-valuessee figs 5 and 6 the results are shown in table 5 we observe that the optimization is reached for two values of the shift  we estimate the weighted average of the results corresponding to the two shifts the weighted mean is performed separately for the fitting cases of x  t and x  t-1 however the weighted mean of the critical temperature is performed for all four results table 5 includes the weighted means of slopes for the fits x  t or x  t-1 with slopes p2  tntp and p2  eakb respectively the latter can be used for deriving the activation energy where   5211 d 15 where we find ea  02120057 ev the value of the critical temperature is tc  303224 k 86143 f0 or 30124 c0 in addition using eqs 7b and 19b we derive the reproduction number r0 ie
1lnr0ntp0xtp2xttntpc01lnr0ntpp2xt1tntpk10xt1or12a
1lnr0ntp0xt1tntptc11lnr0ntp0xt1tctntp112b the two formulae in eq 12b provide the value of 1lnr0ntp as 0057200098 and 0053400146 respectively with weighted mean 0056000084 then we find r0ntp134010 that is the reproduction number for t  20 c0 the corresponding number at t  0 c0 is r00c0247045 while by substituting the estimated parameters in eq 8 we derive the general relationship for any temperature expressed in k also plotted in fig 8
r0tc01334010exp2450660t129315113 up-to-date there is no systematic statistical analysis of the effect of the environmental temperature t and possibly other weather parameters on the exponential growth rate of the cases infected by covid-19 while a statistically confident relationship between temperature and growth rate either with positive or negative correlation was unknown the presented analysis led to the first statistically confident relationship of negative correlation between the exponential growth rate and the average environmental temperature derived for us and italian regions in particular we analyzed datasets of regional infected cases in us and italy derived the exponential growth rates for each of these regions and plotted them against environmental temperatures averaged within the same regions derived the relationship of temperaturegrowth rate and evaluated its statistical confidence the performed statistical analysis involved fitting of linear statistical models with the datasets of environmental temperature or its inverse and exponential growth rate the two linear models developed and used for the statistical analysis are a t  01tc1t and b t1  01tct1 the statistical confidence of fitting was evaluated using the reduced chi-square values the p-value of extremes and a testing measure that combines both of these values also the students t-test was used to compare the derived slopes the sample points of temperature or inverse temperature and exponential growth rate were also tested for statistically significant concentrations or rarefactions that is for possible heterogeneities within the distribution of sample points that could have significant role in the results the statistical analysis of the homogenized temperature-rate data points concluded that the negative correlation between temperature and exponential rate is stable having no statistically significant variability due to concentrations or rarefactions and it is characterized by a high statistical confidence we also performed a students t-test and ensured that the difference between the sample means of us and italian regions is not statistically significant a universality is likely characterizing the slope of the temperature-rate relationship this verifies the modeling developed and used by this analysis where the exponential rate  or the reproduction number r0 are subject to a component influenced by the culture in social activities intercept 0 and a component influenced by the temperature slope p2 in this way the slope may indicate to a universal quantity involved such as the negative activation energy having shown that the derived slopes for us and italian regions are characterized by no statistically confident difference we improved the statistics of the estimated fitting parameters by combined the sample points of us and italian regions from the derived relationship among others we were able to estimate the values of the negative activation energy ea as well as the reproduction number r0 at normal conditions and how this depends on temperature therefore the results clearly showed that there is indeed statistically significant negative correlation of temperature on the exponential growth rate of the cases infected by covid-19 fig 9 shows the anti-correlation between the mapped exponential rates and average environmental temperature of the us regions examined by this analysis which they are characterized by a readable exponential growth phase in their evolution spread curve given the negative correlation of the environmental temperature with the exponential growth rate it was reasonable to ask for the critical temperature that eliminates the exponential rate and thus the number of daily new cases in infected regions this was found to be tc861  43 f0 for us regions it is straightforward to ask when the environmental temperature will climb above this critical value as an example fig 10 plots the daily average temperatures in san antonio texas shown that it will be clearly above the estimated tc threshold by the end of may the resulted high statistical confidence of the negative correlation of the environmental temperature on the exponential growth rate of the cases infected by covid-19 is certainly encouraging for loosening super-strict social-distancing measures at least during the summery high temperatures however we are by no-means recommending a return-to-work date based only on this study but we do think that this should be part of the decision as well as an inspiration for repeating the same analysis in other heavily infected regions the steps of these analyses may be followed as  accounting for uncertainty during a pandemic jon zelner julien riou ruth etzioni andrew gelman  we discuss several issues of statistical design data collection analysis communication and decision making that have arisen in recent and ongoing coronavirus studies focusing on tools for assessment and propagation of uncertainty this paper does not purport to be a comprehensive survey of the research literature rather we use examples to illustrate statistical points that we think are important  just as war makes every citizen into an amateur geographer and tactician a pandemic makes epidemiologists of us all instead of maps with colored pins we have charts of exposure and death counts people on the street argue about infection fatality rates and herd immunity the way that in the past they might have debated strategies and alliances the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic has brought statistics and uncertainty assessment to public discourse to an extent rarely seen except in election season and the occasional billion-dollar lottery jackpot statistical claims become political claims and vice-versa as statisticians and epidemiologists we can try to contribute to the discourse by laying out some of the challenges that arise in assessing uncertainty and propagating it through statistical analysis and decision making we consider several examples and conclude with some general recommendations statistics is key throughout the life cycle of a scientific project from design through data collection and analysis and ultimately through communication of results for decision recommendations in the case of a pandemic like sars-cov-2 surveillance data are critical for assessment of current status and for future projection and clinical measurements are vital for evaluating diagnostic tests and intervention efficacy design includes sample-size calculations determination of comparison groups and time horizons and randomizationand is critical in research to identify effective treatments and vaccines analysis includes evaluation and estimation based on clinical studies as well as disease modeling studies for forecasting and decision support communication includes the challenge of drawing inferences and making decisions based on a variety of models and data sources uncertainty is present at each step it is becoming painfully apparent that the numbers defining the global burden of sars-cov-2 are at best uncertain and at worst frequently wrong the bread and butter of disease surveillance-cases and deaths-are both suspect for reasons that are only beginning to be fully understood studies that rely on these as inputs for example for estimating transmission dynamics or case fatality rates have commonly made the mistake of considering these numbers as given and reliable and do not account for uncertainty or bias in reporting there has been some compelling reporting on how the number of deaths reported in the first few months of the pandemic far exceeds what would have been expected at this time of the year particularly in states like new york there has also been good reporting how the differences across states in reporting of covid-related deaths may be complicating things harmon 2020  some states have changed how they classify a death as due to the virus leading to potential increases in death counts in some cases eg michigan and reductions in death counts eg colorado one big question is getting at how the changes in test availability and distribution both between regions and groups and over time for example as a result of inadequate infrastructure and reagent shortages impacts our assessment of incidence prevalence and mortality conditional on age and other demographic variables larremore et al 2020 deals with some of the questions about measuring seroprevalence but doesnt engage with any of the pesky issues surrounding social bias in testing one way to address data quality is to triangulate in a clinical study a hospital can perform antibody tests and rt-pcr rna tests on patients in a study tracking symptoms data can be collected from multiple sources as in the carnegie mellon project that tracks facebook and google surveys hospital records web searches and flu tests rosenfeld et al 2020  when measurements cannot be easily calibrated inferences can be sensitive to assumptions for example the controversial stanford antibody study bendavid et al 2020 gelman and carpenter 2020 was sensitive to the assumed sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test these issues are no less pronounced when contemplating population-level transmission dynamics the basic reproduction number  and its cousin the effective reproduction number r 0  which measures the actual number of infections generated by an average case are often r cited as measures of epidemic control however it is easy to forget that and are not r 0 r empirical quantities they are estimated on the basis of surveillance data which as noted above is not as reliable as we might wish to believe in addition is a function of a the r per-contact infectiousness of each individual and b the rate at which those contacts occur reduce either or both of these and you are likely to reduce the rate of spread both are subject to between-individual variation due for example to variable compliance with social distancing efforts variation in the extent of viral shedding age specific differences in contact and infectiousness this variation is widely understood in infectious disease epidemiology and there are theoretical and statistical modeling frameworks that allow us to account for inter-individual variability in susceptibility and infectiousness drivers of variation in infectiousness and susceptibility at an individual or population level can be studied using a hierarchical approach in this area there are at least three key dimensions of uncertainty that we need to consider 1 what range of values of the average infectiousness is consistent with the observed data 2 how much between-individual variation is there in infectiousnesssusceptibility and how much does it matter to address it specifically 3 if we implement an intervention to reduce the value of  how can we estimate how well it worked r 0 the imperial college group has fit some reasonable models for example unwin et al 2020 trying to untangle effects of different policies on the spread of coronavirus making use of variation in space and time of the growth rates of the infection part of designing a study is accounting for uncertainty in effect sizes unfortunately there is a tradition in clinical trials of making optimistic assumptions in order to claim high power here is an example that came up in march 2020 a doctor was designing a trial for an existing drug that he thought could be effective for high-risk coronavirus patients he contacted one of us to check his sample size calculation under the assumption that the drug increased survival rate by 25 percentage points a sample size of n  126 would assure 80 power when we asked 1 him how confident he was in his guessed effect size the doctor replied that he thought the effect on these patients would be higher and that 25 percentage points was a conservative estimate at the same time he recognized that the drug might not work we asked the doctor if he would be interested in increasing his sample size so he could detect a 10 percentage point increase in survival for example but he said that this would not be necessary it might seem reasonable to suppose that a drug might not be effective but would have a large individual effect in case of success but this vision of uncertainty has problems suppose for example that the survival rate was 30 among the patients who do not receive this new drug and 55 among the treatment group then in a population of 1000 people it could be that the drug has no effect on the 300 of people who would live either way no effect on the 450 who would die either way and it would save the lives of the remaining 250 patients there are other possibilities consistent with a 25 percentage point benefit--for example the drug could save 350 people while killing 100--but we will stick with the simple scenario for now in any case the point is that the posited benefit of the drug is not a 25 percentage point benefit for each patient rather its a benefit on 25 of the patients and from that perspective of course the drug could work but only on 10 of the patients once weve accepted the idea that the drug works on some people and not others--or in some comorbidity scenarios and not others--we realize that the treatment effect in any given study will depend entirely on the patient mix there is no underlying number representing the effect of the drug ideally one would like to know what sorts of patients the treatment would help but in a clinical trial it is enough to show that there is some clear average effect our point is that if we consider the treatment effect in the context of variation between patients this can be the first step in a more grounded understanding of effect size when considering design for a clinical trials more generally we recommend assigning cost and benefits and balancing the following -benefit or cost of possible reduced or increased mortality and morbidity from covid-19 in the trial itself -cost of toxicity or side effects in the trial itself -public health benefits of learning that the therapy works as soon as possible -economic  public confidence benefits of learning that the therapy works as soon as possible -benefits of learning that the therapy doesnt work as soon as possible if it really doesnt work -scientific insights gained from intermediate measurements or secondary data analysis -financial cost of the study itself as well as opportunity cost if it reduces your effort to test something else this may look like a mess-but if youre not addressing these issues explicitly youre addressing them implicitly whatever therapies are being tried should be monitored doctors should have some freedom to experiment and they should be recording what happens to put it another way theyre trying different therapies anyway so lets try to get something useful out of all that its also not just about what works or does a particular drug work but how to go about understanding what works when and for whom you want to get something like optimal dosing which could depend on individuals but you wont get good discrimination on this from a standard clinical trial or set of clinical trials so we have to go beyond the learning-from-clinical-trial paradigm designing large studies that mix experiment and observation to get insight into dosing subgroup effects and other practical questions also lots of the relevant decisions will be made at the system level not the individual level these issues of decision making are crucial and they go beyond the standard clinical-trial paradigm other issues arise when designing clinical trials for vaccines lumley 2020 writes there are over 100 potential vaccines being developed and several are already in preliminary testing in humans there are three steps to testing a vaccine showing that it doesnt have any common nasty side effects showing that it raises antibodies showing that vaccinated people dont get covid-19 the last step is the big one especially if you want it fast    we dont expect perfection and if a vaccine truly reduces the infection rate by 50 it would be a serious mistake to discard it as useless but if the control-group infection rate over a couple of months is a high-but-maybe-plausible 02 that means 600000 people in the trial-one of the largest clinical trials in history how can that be reduced if the trial was done somewhere with out-of-control disease transmission the rate of infection in controls might be 5 and a moderately large trial would be sufficient but doing a randomised trial in a setting like that is hard-and ethically dubious if its a developing-world population that wont be getting a successful vaccine any time soon if the trial took a couple of years rather than a couple of months the infection rate could be 3-4 times lower-but we cant afford to wait a couple of years the other possibility is deliberate infection if you deliberately exposed trial participants to the coronavirus you could run a trial with only hundreds of participants and no more covid deaths in total than a larger trial but signing people up for deliberate exposure to a potentially deadly infection when half of them are getting placebo is something you dont want to do without very careful consideration and widespread consultation    one major barrier is manufacturing the doses especially since we decided to off-shore a lot of our biomedical capacity in the name of efficiency at the cost of robustness    we want an effective vaccine and it may be the case that candidates vary in their effectiveness there are successful vaccines that do not grant 100 immunity the original polio vaccines were only 60-70 effective versus one of the strains but that still led to a vast decrease in the number of infections in the united states once vaccination became standard so clearly we want trials    now we get to the point about medical ethics a phase iii trial takes a long time to conduct and there is some political pressure for a fast solution    if the virus is mostly under control you need a lot of people and a long time to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine people are rarely exposed so it takes a long time for differences in cases between the arms to show up    another option is the challenge trial likely only taking a few hundred participants it would have no more deaths than a regular trial but it would involve infecting people treated with a placebo with a potentially fatal infectious disease there are greater good arguments here but the longer i think about them the more dubious they get to me informed consent for things that are so dangerous really does suggest coercion    it seems hard to imagine that clinical trials for treatments could be organized efficiently across research groups given the current competitive nature of biomedical research but maybe it could be possible to organize clinical trials for vaccines one advantage would be that it should not be necessary to include a placebo arm with each trial infectious disease transmission models have been held to unprecedented and deserved scrutiny during the covid-19 crisis the field of infectious disease modelling finds its roots in the work of ross 1910 on malaria using mathematical tools to describe the complex relations between parasites vectors and hosts ross defined the concept of dependent happenings whereby the frequency of an event such as an infection in an individual depends on the number of individuals already affected halloran 1991  kermack and mckendrick 1927 formalized this approach leading to the development of the sir susceptible-infectious-recovered differential equation system that is still the basis of many of the models used for sars-cov-2 today in the sir model the processes of contagion and immunity are modeled following the mass action principle the incidence of new infections is dependent on the proportion of infectious and susceptible individuals in the population assuming homogeneous mixing in the following decades the field of infectious disease modeling has seen tremendous development but has long been kept separated from statistical modeling and inference the focus was on putting theory into equations and exploring different scenarios leading to important developments in the development and understanding of interventions aimed at controlling epidemics such as vaccines or vector control until recently comparatively less attention has been given to statistical concepts such as inference measurement and uncertainty several types of approaches have been used to model the transmission of sars-cov-2 depending on the stage of the epidemic and the objectives of the work whether the objective of a model is inference or forecasting the handling of uncertainty should remain a constant concern we can distinguish three sources of uncertainty stochastic uncertainty arises from chance events during the course of transmission whether a contact between an infectious and a susceptible person will result in transmission or data generation sampling variation in infected individuals that are reported as cases parameter uncertainty represents the imperfect level of knowledge of a particular quantity such as the average duration of the incubation period which is a fixed input parameter to most transmission models model or structural uncertainty refers to the set of assumptions underlying any modeling attempt and their adequacy to reality draper 1995  to avoid overconfidence especially when results are expected to impact policy one should acknowledge and discuss the potential impact of each of these sources of uncertainty and as often as possible directly propagate the uncertainty into the results in the very early stages of the emergence of sars-cov-2 in wuhan china the focus has been put on estimating the basic reproduction number from surveillance data on cases of r 0 sars-cov-2 infection is defined as the average number of secondary cases that are r 0 generated by an infectious individual in a fully susceptible population in the first few weeks after its emergence it was reasonable to assume that the population was fully susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection allowing the use of simple models based on branching processes or exponential growth estimating from counts of reported cases constitutes a typical inference r 0 problem and must account for important considerations regarding stochastic parameter and model uncertainty in the context of emerging pathogens stochastic uncertainty can be very impactful as very few people are affected any outlier behaviour may have a strong impact on the course of the disease one key component here is the assumed distribution in the number of secondary cases in a totally-susceptible population its average is by definition  but this can vary from r 0 individual to individual with the extreme being a superspreading event defined as an usually large number of secondary cases generated by a single infectious person superspreading events can have a considerable impact in the early stages of disease emergence by accelerating the spatial spread of the pathogen as was seen for instance during the emergence of middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus kucharski and althaus 2015  individual heterogeneity and the potential for superspreading events can be accounted for using a negative binomial distribution for modelling the number of secondary cases lloyd-smith et al 2005  estimating using data from the early incidence of sars-cov-2 infection in wuhan also r 0 carries the problems of parameter and model uncertainty examining the mechanisms leading to the generation of count data gives insight about the basic assumptions that will explicitly or implicitly be part of any modeling attempt 1 an initial zoonotic event led to the infection of a number of humans on a given date 2 each of these cases generated secondary cases  r 0 cases on average with a distribution as discussed above 3 each of these secondary cases generated cases with a delay that corresponds to the generation time the gap between two successive generations of cases which also is a random variable not a constant 4 infected cases will have an incubation period some of the cases will have symptoms some of the symptomatic cases will seek care some of the patients will be tested and diagnosed some of the diagnosed will be reported to the authorities and counted as a case from these observations we understand that is not possible to estimate at the same time the date and r 0 size of the initial zoonotic event the incubation period and the generation time from information about the incidence of sars-cov-2 as several combinations of these parameters may lead to the same data to estimate  it is therefore necessary to bring external information about the r 0 other parameters here enters parameter uncertainty as overconfidence about the initial conditions or the generation time would result in overconfidence about the value of  r 0 thinking about the mechanisms of data generation brings further considerations about model uncertainty to this day very few details are known about the situation surrounding the emergence of sars-cov-2 in wuhan at the end of 2019 putting aside any political aspect the early phase of emergence of an unknown pathogen is always a chaotic matter explicitly or implicitly modeling the transmission of sars-cov-2 in this context will require strong assumptions about how this data was generated for instance some authors took the number of reported cases in wuhan in the first few weeks at face value and directly inferred the rate of exponential growth and thus  implicitly assuming that the proportion of ascertainment the r 0 proportion of cases that end up in the data was constant over the period considered majumder and mandi 2020 li et al 2020  other authors made explicit assumptions about the shape of variation of ascertainment with time zhao et al 2020  rather than making assumptions about ascertainment in wuhan other authors prefered to use data on national and international cases of sars-cov-2 identified in areas still unaffected by the turmoil together with traffic data read 2020  riou and althaus 2020  imai et al 2020  however this approach carries other assumptions about the representativity of people who traveled from wuhan to other places differences across estimates based on different assumptions may be referred to as model uncertainty and is in itself a good reason to consider multiple approaches to study the same issue beyond the first few weeks following emergence it becomes more and more difficult to continue to assume that transmission continues to take place unhindered whether the objective is prediction on inference it becomes crucial to account for immunity social distancing or control measures in addition to just contagion two broad categories of transmission models are adapted to this task agent-based models are used to simulate the individual behaviour of agents and can get as intricate as imaginable going as far as to simulate every vehicle moving in a country abhari marini and chokan 2020  these models can provide insight but can be difficult or impossible to fit to data in contrast compartmental models divide the population into different states eg susceptible infectious and removed for the classical sir model without considering any difference among individuals within a state compartmental models may be considered within a stochastic or a deterministic framework the stochastic framework considers the probability of occurrence of each event at each time step and as hinted by its name is better suited to handle stochastic uncertainty the deterministic framework relies upon solving systems of ordinary differential equations ode and leads to the same average results when the number of infected is sufficiently large the reduction in computational cost associated with solving odes instead of simulating a large number of events is important when the objective is inference for example when using bayesian software such as stan stan development team 2020  in addition to these two approaches a third approach that is more empirically based was developed and publicized by the institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme the ihme model assumed a gaussian curve for the shape of the epidemics mortality trajectory empirically estimated how restrictions including social distancing enacted in china impacted the time to and height of the peak and then extrapolated to other settings on the basis of their accumulating mortality data the symmetry assumption coupled with the rapid rise in cases and deaths in almost every region meant that the ihme model predicted a much more rapid decline than other models as the virus spread across the us it became clear that the model was not correct and the ihme recently revised the model replacing it with a hybrid empirical-compartmental approach as model complexity increases the proper handling of uncertainty becomes even more essential model predictions should incorporate stochastic uncertainty by including prediction intervals parameter uncertainty should directly be propagated in the results the quantification of uncertainty in the model outcomes is an integral part of the results and should not be relegated to the side as sensitivity analyses in this regard the bayesian framework with its focus on parameter probability distributions is attractive model uncertainty can be handled by carefully considering whether the model structure and all relevant assumptions even implicit are adapted to the question as well as using technical tools such as stacking liu et al 2018  conducting sensitivity analyses with alternative models is always sensible but there is only so much than a team can do about its own model it is advisable to rely on other researchers and experts to provide critical assessment of the model by releasing code and data on an appropriate platform model uncertainty is best assessed by the community and this requires transparency code sharing will also bring to academia much-needed good practices for programming and in the long run build more confidence in the field of infectious disease modeling additionally it is important to acknowledge the biases associated with some approaches as for instance fitting to cumulative incidence curves is known to lead to bias and overconfidence king et al 2015  so far we have discussed accounting for uncertainty in design data and modeling of epidemics in addition data analysis can account for uncertainty and variation using multilevel modeling all the way and decision making can be based on costs and benefits not statistical significance we have relatively little to say about statistical analysis because this is one area in which there are readily-available tools to handle uncertainty and variation we are aware of several coronavirus analyses that make use of multilevel models and bayesian inference unwin et al 2020 is an analysis by the imperial college group that partially pools across us states and they have done similar analyses for europe flaxman et al 2020  vollmer et al 2020  gelman and carpenter 2020 reanalyze the santa clara antibody study using a hierarchical bayesian model to account for variation of test specificities and sensitivities a partial list of coronavirus projects using the bayesian inference engine stan appears at stan forums 2020  bayesian analysis can also be performed in the data collection stage allowing more efficient designs harrell 2020  a challenging issue with statistical models fit during an ongoing epidemic is unobservedpartially observed data this isnt that much of an issue with deterministic population-level models but it wreaks havoc on stochastic differential equation models and individual-level approaches as a result deterministic models have had wide influence despite their weaknesses and often in situations where demographic stochasticity of the transmission process should be accounted for along with the impact of individual-level variation on outcomes early statistical inferences for epidemic models were actually rooted in a stochastic approach known as the tsir time-series sir model which was originally used to account for time-varying birthrates and demographic stochasticity in models of measles transmission see wakefield et al 2018  but this has been surpassed by far more complex far less understandable approaches an appealing aspect of the tsir is that it is just a transformation of a regression model and so is accessible to researchers and policymakers with statistical training to effectively communicate the results of analyses conducted during the pandemic what they are meant to accomplish needs to be clear in the context of the covid-19 pandemic this raises the problem of effective scientific communication to the central place it has always belonged this includes communication of key dimensions of uncertainty in risk one of the key challenges here is familiar how does one impart a gestalt understanding of an interval statistic such as a confidence or credible interval to as broad of an audience as possible van der bles et al 2020  another challenge relates to communication of the different ways in which uncertainty arises and the difficulty of picking one apart from another for example what do we do when we cant figure out if were seeing the results of process noise observation noise observation bias or some combination thereof much of the controversy surrounding the multiple transmission models used for prediction and planning could be mitigated by a more pragmatic reframing of what these-and all mathematical and statistical models-are all about namely they distill assumptions and data into inferences for outcomes of interest understood this way they are primarily tools for dimension reduction and exploration rather than divining rods nonetheless there are political and emotional reasons people may glom on to one model or another that make a more measured appreciation of the ability of models to dispel uncomfortable or politically inconvenient uncertainty unlikely to be broadly achieved any time soon nonetheless individual scientists have to balance the career and emotional imperatives to deliver impactful influential results with a more realistic-and less scientistic-take on what it is that we are doing we have also seen some high-priority junk science such as extreme results reported from small uncontrolled trials an observational study that may have been based on fake data and a leaching of trust from formerly respected institutions such as the center for disease control the world health organization and leading universities and medical journals it is good news that bad research can be rapidly debunked on social media but it is not clear what the new equilibrium will be going beyond problems with individual studies we recommend more emphasis on accurately communicating uncertainty in model inferences and predictions as discussed for example by hullman et al 2019  in etzioni 2020 we explain our discomfort with communication of model-based projections from the ihme the issue is not just with the model but also with how any changes in projections based on updating the inputs or the model itself were reported in the case of the ihme the model is an empirical model so its projections kept changing as the model adapted to accumulating data on the epidemic in the united states ultimately it became clear that key model assumptions rendered it incorrect for making such projections and the model itself was completely revised changing the projected cumulative deaths considerably in and of itself this demonstrated the uncertainty inherent in the model but the new projections were not attributed to the uncertainty or the model they were attributed to states beginning to relax social distancing this interpretation not only lends itself to politicization it completely understates the uncertainty in the model suggesting not only that the updated projection is correct but that the previous projection was as well one thing we keep hearing in conversations with state government officials is a concern that people just dont understand when they are at risk maps and other visuals can give a realistic and visceral sense of what that risk looks like many questions of science communication arise here that relate specifically to the translation of theory into models and models into spoken and written language meanwhile pundits and public intellectuals muddy the waters by naively interpreting the psychology literature on risk perception and not taking into account the unpredictability of contagion see epstein 2020 and sunstein 2020 for examples of such punditry and douglass 2020 and cirillo and taleb 2020 for criticisms of shallow individualistic risk analysis another problem relates to the communication of uncertainty in the structure of the models themselves weve seen an appetite both from the public and from modelers themselves to find the one true model with that box quote which like the term social distancing we hope never to hear again after this year tacked on to papers and talks as a kind of fig leaf the modeling literature in epidemiology for the large part focuses on validating models through the fit of the curve to the data and demonstrating some accuracy in short-term temporal prediction but researchers have traditionally been far less interested in dealing with the distribution of infection in the population hierarchical models for examining both individual level and ecological outcomes are important as would an in-depth discussion of how to align model validation with public health goals should our model maximize short term prediction at the population level or give a better long-term sense of who will be at risk in terms of demographic and geographic characteristics at the time of this writing there is vigorous debate in the news media social media and governments regarding possible future paths of the epidemic and how best to mitigate it in the united states these disputes have taken on a political dimension major politicians in both parties have oscillated between complacency and hysteria and a persistent partisan divide has emerged around both the perception of risk and the use of protective equipment such as masks there has also been a shift from an initial phase of transmission in more densely-populated urban and suburban areas to growth in more rural areas with different issues relating to healthcare access patterns of contact and underlying vulnerabilities to infection and severe disease relating to age and comorbidities globally too the pandemic has begun to drift southward with recent surges in transmission in latin america and south asia here though we focus on the statistical question of combining multiple sources of uncertain information on the risk side is the news of uncontrolled spread of the virus in early 2020 in wuhan and then northern italy followed by the scary charts showing a doubling every few days during the period when most of the world was conducting business as usual on the dont panic side are the many countries around the world and many states within the us which still have seen very few coronavirus cases and whose hospitals have not been overwhelmed one thing that troubled us in the earliest phases of the pandemic response was the emphasis on rapid analysis of complex incomplete datasets followed by rapid publication and extensive media coverage rapid response is not inherently problematic but the conjuring of theoretical frameworks and analytic tools on the fly is unlikely to benefit many more people than the authors of the study instead this makes more sense when you have an existing framework and set of tools that you can apply with minor modifications to incoming data as was the case with a number of groups enlisted in the earliest days of the pandemic including ihme as well as imperial and other groups this leads us to wonder whether some kind of disaster model pre-registration is in order for future events so that the generic behavior of the set of potential tools is well understood before being pressed into services this could be looser than a clinical trial registration but at least gives the key data inputs and outputs and some characterization of expected behavior under different scenarios critically some type of standardization would give the ability to engineer connections between different types of analyses so that information on for example variable pcr testing across geographic areas and demographic groups can be easily used to inform estimates of disease incidence and prevalence this takes us back to the motivating question behind this essay how can we adequately account for uncertainty in a pandemic the question is probably better reframed as how can we be better prepared to address the uncertainty inherent in the response to the next pandemic or another catastrophic unforeseen-but foreseeable-event an answer to this question may lie in a reimagining of the tools of epidemiological modeling from something that looks a bit more like the engineering perspective and a bit less like the pure science perspective this entails a move away from analyses as one-off exercises that uncover some permanent-or at least durable-truth towards a more software-like continuous-improvement conception of the products of statistical analysis  pandemics and the consequences of covid19 stephen davies   pandemics are a regular feature of human history from ancient times onwards mcneill 1976 as major eruptions of the harsh realities of nature into the settled life of civilisations for it is civilisations that suffer from them for various reasons they loom large in historical accounts and the memoirs of those who lived through them historically pandemics have brought about sweeping social political and cultural change  or at least they seem to have done so for the reality is that they give a massive push to movements and trends that were already under way in the extreme cases pandemics have figured largely in the collapse of empires and civilisations as for example in the havoc the bubonic plague wrought on both the eastern roman and sasanian empires in the sixth century little 2006 in the modern world since around 1750 their impact has been less dramatic but it is still considerable there have been almost 20 pandemics in the modern era and they have played a central part in the development and growth of the modern state there is also an inescapable economic aspect to pandemics in terms of both their dynamics the way they spread and the reasons why they appear when and where they do and their consequences among which economic impacts loom large it is important to understand what a pandemic is and how it is distinct from an ordinary and localised epidemic outbreak the latter is a constant feature of human life an infectious disease will break out in a particular location and initially spread rapidly among the local population which may be large after a while the rate of growth slows down and eventually stops with the number of cases peaking there is then an almost equally rapid decline so the path of an epidemic resembles an inverted v sometimes however the epidemic spreads widely beyond its original point of origin and becomes extensively dispersed geographically such an epidemic is commonly called a pandemic although strictly speaking that term should be used only for the ultimate case of an epidemic that has diffused so widely that outbreaks are found at roughly the same time all over the populated planet a pandemic has a different pattern from that of a local epidemic the disease which is typically novel and caused by a new or mutated pathogen appears at one point on the planet it then spreads along trade routes and travel routes to other parts of the world tatem rogers  hay 2006 travellers tourists today but also pilgrims and business travellers merchants and soldiers are historically the major carriers mcneill 1976 the transmission at this point is not geographically continuous instead the disease spreads along trade routes from one trade hub to another leaping over intervening territory this leads to widespread and scattered nearsimultaneous outbreaks across the world which can then in turn lead to further transmission this is the first phase of the pandemic eventually these localised outbreaks subside in the same way as a truly local epidemic does however in a pandemic that is not the end of the story the epidemic now enters a second phase usually called the smouldering phase viboud grais lafont miller  simonsen 2005 in this phase the disease spreads out from the original foci and becomes much more widely and uniformly dispersed this phase is marked by scattered outbreaks on a small scale so the overall number of cases does not rise or does so slowly gradually however the local outbreaks start to coalesce and after some time which depending on the pathogen can be anything from a few months to several years the third phase is entered this is a second wave of accelerating infection but much more widely dispersed and uniform than the first one although some of the areas most hard hit in the first phase get off lightly because of higher levels of acquired immunity cockburn delon  fereira 1969 kindrachuk  nickol 2019 this third phase or second wave is typically much larger than the first wave in terms of both the number of cases and the geographical spread and often does far more damage with viral pathogens the second wave is often more virulent than the first this happened for example in the spanish flu pandemic of 191819 but it can be milder kilbourne 2006 potter 2001 spinney 2018 after the third phase the epidemic becomes quiescent again but it often returns in a third and even a fourth wave these however are almost always milder than the earlier waves in terms of their medical effects how then does the covid19 pandemic of 2020 fit into that kind of story clearly it is not on the same scale as the truly massive ones of the past such as the antonine plague of the second century probably smallpox or the plague of justinian in the sixth century and the black death in the fourteenth both of these being bubonic plague these all killed upwards of 25 per cent of the affected populations a truly devastating mortality rate benedictow 2018 horrox 1994 little 2006 mcneill 1976 by contrast covid19 appears so far to have an infection fatality rate of around 0607 per cent so much milder than those cases but also several times worse than regular seasonal influenza the medical effect is so far much less than that of the spanish flu pandemic of 191819 although it may end up being slightly worse than in the asian flu and hong kong flu pandemics 195758 and 196869 respectively the covid19 virus is seemingly less infectious than influenza but has a longer incubation period and a very high proportion of asymptomatic cases which means it still spreads widely the major differences from the past are the greater medical capacity available in terms of both knowledge and actual resources and the greater administrative capacity of modern states in 191819 local controls often sweeping were imposed but there were nothing like the national responses seen in 2020 spinney 2018 policies of lockdown initially and testing tracing and isolating tti subsequently may smother the smouldering phase and prevent a second wave or third phase this time holding the line until a vaccine is developed countries that were able to put a programme of tti in place early on such as south korea have avoided the need for a strict lockdown at the time of writing may 2020

 we still do not know whether we will escape a third phase one problem is that the development and spread of the virus is at every stage a complex system in the technical sense of that term that is we cannot simply extrapolate existing trends or predict from initial conditions and parameters how things will work out subsequently in addition too much is still not known most notably the proportions of populations that have already been infected and are consequently now immune what evidence we have suggests an infection rate in most places of between 2 per cent and 20 per cent ahlander  pollard 2020 urra 2020 the problem is that this means populations are a long way from socalled herd immunity where the number of susceptible people in a given population is at a level where one case will give rise to fewer than one new case because of the physical difficulty of finding a vulnerable person this level is at least 60 per cent for a virus with the known features of covid19 all this means that policymakers are operating in a situation analogous to the fog of war with incomplete or absent information and constantly and unpredictably changing circumstances they face an acute knowledge problem in other words given this it will be a major achievement if controls and other measures do succeed in dousing the smouldering stage of the pandemic the experience of the past and the way pandemics have happened tell us a number of things because the initial spread beyond a locality is a function of transmission along channels such as trade and travel routes including pilgrimage ones very widespread epidemics are almost by definition cases where an epidemic has reached every part of an ecumene that is a part of the planet that is economically integrated through trade and exchange today that means the entire planet in the past for the entire planet to be reached the pathogen would take several steps geographically going through the cycle described above in each step we can see this in the black death for example today because of air travel and things such as austrian ski holidays the coronavirus was able to spread from wuhan in china to the whole planet in a matter of just weeks in 191819 the time it took spanish flu to travel from one part of the world to another was measured in months all this leads to the conclusion that several features of the world we live in such as high levels of economic integration and trade widespread mass travel and rapid modes of transport make it much more vulnerable to a true pandemic to that list we should add such things as the nature of modern livestock farming and acute pressure on wildlife habitats both of which contribute significantly to the appearance of novel pathogens and transmission from animals to humans these and other features of the modern world also mean that the economic impact of an extensive epidemic is going to be much greater than was the case in for example 196869 international travel is now a much more significant and valuable activity so its curtailment will have much bigger effects much manufacturing and other economic activity now depends on long and complex supply chains that again will be disrupted by both the epidemic itself and the measures taken to contain it changes in consumption patterns also make contemporary economies more vulnerable for example in the last three decades americans have taken to eating out more and more to the point where just over half of the food consumed is eaten in bars and restaurants these have been closed down but even before then their trade had collapsed this has had a much bigger effect than would have been the case in 1968 not least because the entire food supply system is now geared up to sending half its output to restaurants rather than grocery stores and it is extremely difficult to adjust quickly to restaurant closure bedford 2020 there are similar examples in other areas such as clothing purchasing another change is the much greater significance of credit with far more businesses highly leveraged and operating on very tight margins this means that a prolonged interruption to normal business conditions will have its effect amplified by finance in a way that was not true 50 years ago one social change that also has this effect is the movement of women with children into the labour force in large numbers  this magnifies the economic impact of school closures keoghbrown wrenlewis edmunds beutels  smith 2009 all this means that a pandemic such as the hong kong flu is going to have bigger effects if it were to happen today than the original did back in 196869 the covid19 virus is on the evidence more medically severe so we should expect it to have if anything a still larger impact at first sight it would seem obvious that the measures taken by governments to try to suppress the spread of the virus and head off a second wave by stamping out the smouldering phase have in turn increased that impact even further massively so certainly the impact has been dramatic with a record rise in us unemployment claims and a dramatic rise in claims for universal credit in the uk most businesses are presently shut down in the uk and elsewhere and only measures such as the furlough scheme introduced into the uk have prevented a rise in unemployment not seen since the dark days of 1931 given a collapse in gdp that some commentators estimate to be the worst since the 1690s or 1700s bruce 2020 faulconbridge  bruce 2020 however initial forecasts indicate that the additional impact of lockdowns is far less than most imagine there is no clear correlation between the severity of lockdown and the size of the hit to gdp with countries such as sweden that have avoided lockdowns and gone instead for social distancing predicted to see a decline in gdp similar to the ones expected in countries that did impose one milne 2020 moreover the early signs are that lockdowns may not have had such a dramatic effect on rates of infection and rapidity of spread during the first phase of this pandemic it seems that it is measures such as effective tti policy closing of borders and successfully protecting vulnerable groups such as the elderly that have had the biggest effect the tentative but increasingly strong conclusion is that it was the spontaneous responses and reactions of the public that brought about both the medical effect of slower spread and the bulk of the economic impact this also highlights the fragility of much of the contemporary economy what kinds of administrative and political effects have pandemics had historically and how might that play out this time one important point is that pandemics seldom lead to something truly novel they typically provide a big boost to processes that were already under way they do not bring down institutions and systems that are in good shape but they do precipitate the collapse and end of ones that were already in a poor state so most of the firms or sectors that go under will be ones that were already having serious difficulty or were already vulnerable such as retail we will see the same pattern in politics the pandemic will lead to a resurgence of nationalism and the nation state while undermining a rulesbased international order and supranational forms of governance unfortunately it will boost the trend towards protectionism and economic nationalism that is already under way it will also lead to a decline in international integration as supply chains are shortened and production reshored in response to revealed vulnerabilities again this is already under way it will almost certainly trigger a financial crisis centred on the unsustainable accumulation of private debt this again being a case of it providing the push that brings down something that is already on the verge of falling over historically pandemics have played a central part in the emergence of the modern administrative state through the creation of modern systems of public health in response to major epidemics it was the six great cholera pandemics of the nineteenth century that were particularly important for this leading as they did to governments acquiring extensive powers to inspect regulate and register their populations and to the state taking on responsibility for sanitation and providing potable water wilford 2008 they also led to a profound change in the way large towns and cities were administered and subsequently to the development of an extensive and often coercive set of public health programmes such as compulsory vaccination as well as health visitors and district nurses to support but also chivvy and push the general public it seems likely that the coronavirus pandemic will therefore lead to a reassessment of the extent power and functions of government in some areas this will result in a growth or extension of powers but in others there will likely be a pulling back or withdrawal as public administration is found to be lacking or selfdefeating a lot of regulations particularly ones to do with medicines and drugs but also things such as occupational licensure in the united states in particular are likely to be cut back or abolished in contrast surveillance powers are probably going to become more extensive one likely change is in the area of health services in most countries east asian ones and germany are the big exceptions these have come to be dominated by hospitals and therapeutic medicine at the expense of health maintenance and public health hawe yuen  baillie 2011 this has been revealed as brittle and highly vulnerable to shocks such as a major epidemic in 2020 it was panic about the pressure on hospital systems that led to the decision to impose a lockdown in most cases one area where there will be much debate is over the relative performance and effectiveness of decentralised and localised systems as compared to centralised or national ones this is actually an area where the evidence can support both sides with the correct answer differing according to local circumstances the pandemic will also have other less predictable effects but some of these can already be discerned and others can be guessed at from historical experience one rather grim result will be a heightening of international tensions particularly between china and both the us and europe there may be significant consequences for education and higher education in particular despite what some hope or fear there are unlikely to be lasting consequences for pedagogy but the financial and organisational structure of the higher education industry is likely to face dramatic disruption and reorganisation on a worldwide basis another area that will probably see a major impact in some countries is welfare policy where the idea of a universal basic income already gaining support of late is going to move to the centre of debate on the historical evidence there will also be unpredictable but extensive cultural effects cantor 2001 usually there is a simultaneous movement towards both greater seriousness and impatience with intellectual frivolity on the one hand and a desire to live for the moment and take pleasure where it may be found on the other other things are simply a matter of guesswork or too often projection of hopes and fears perhaps there will be a revulsion against the way everyday work is organised and away from a system where almost all adults are employed perhaps working from home will become a new normal or alternatively people will be desperate for the company of a workplace there may well be an uptick in the birth rate as one person observed to me if lockdown does not get the uk birth rate back above replacement level nothing will  what can we learn from the time evolution of covid-19 epidemic in slovenia ioan bldea  a recent work doi 101101doi 10 2020 indicated that temporarily splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the spread of sars-cov-2 virus the fact that soon afterwards on may 15 2020 the two million people slovenia was the first european country proclaiming the end of covid-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective motivated by this evolution in this paper we investigate the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in slovenia with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of covid-19 infections noteworthily the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption it is solely based on raw epidemiological data out of the results presented here the most important one is perhaps the finding that while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate  by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state they only improve the -value by  15 as compared to the much bearable state of social and economical life wherein justifiable wearing face masks

covid-19 pandemic outbreak 1 mathematical modeling developed by epidemiologists over many decades 2-7 may make an important contribution in helping politics to adopt adequate regulations to efficiently fight against the spread of sars-cov-2 virus while mitigating negative economical and social consequences the latter aspect is of paramount importance 8 also because if not adequately considered by governments currently challenged to deciding possibly under dramatic circumstances and formidable tight schedule it can jeopardize the healthcare system itself as an effort in this direction we drew recently attention 9 to the general fact that the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus in smaller groups can be substantially slowed down as compared to the case of larger populations in this vein the time evolution of covid-19 disease in the two million people slovenia certainly deserves special consideration as on 15 may 2020 concluding that this country has the best epidemic

difficulty like that described in the first paragraph of section 23 as shown below our approach obviates the aforementioned difficulty we will adopt a logistic growth model in a form which is different from that often employed in the past 15 16 17 18 19 see sections 23 and 3 for technical details this model is considerably simpler than sir flavors and already turned out to be an appealing framework in dealing with current covid-19 pandemic issues 913 logistic functions see equation 2 below were utilized for studying various problems 20 21 22 23 24 25 studies on population dynamics of epidemic populations 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 were also frequently based on the logistic function nevertheless as anticipated there is an important difference between the present approach section 23 and all the other approaches of which we are aware the latter merely justify the logistic model by the fact that recorded disease numbers followed a sigmoidal curve shortcomings of this standpoint are delineated in the beginning of section 23 the strength of the approach presented in section 23 is that we do not use data fitting rather we use raw epidemiological data to validate the logistic growth and straightforwardly extract the time dependent infection rate which is the relevant model parameter for the specific case considered and makes it possible to compare how efficient different restrictive measures act to mitigate the covid-19 pandemic and even to get insight significant for behavioral and social science 3  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is

morocco via italy 34 on 10 march the government banned all incoming flights from italy south korea iran and china the land border with italy was closed for all but freight transport indoor public with

total covid-19 infections in slovenia underlying data are collected in table 1  has an appealing similarity to the logistic s-shaped curve depicted in figure 1  one would be therefore tempting to follow numerous previous authors 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 who claimed that the logistic model applies merely because of the apparently good data fitting still to claim that a description based on a model like that of equation 2 is valid checking that the model parameters do not depend on the fitting range t 1  t 2  is mandatory for the specific case considered here this means that fitting numbers of infected individuals in time range t 1  t  t 2 should yield within inherent statistical errors values of n and  independent of t 1 and t 2  and like in other known cases 3536 this is just the stumbling block for the logistic function approach delineated in section 21 in particular the infection rate  should not depend on how broad the is the range t 1  t 2  however we checked by straightforward numerical calculations that it does given the real epidemic timeline delineated in section 22 the infection rate must indeed 6  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available

fortunately rather than merely inquiring how good the fitting curve based on equation 2 is we are able to directly check and demonstrate see below the validity of a time-dependent logistic model merely based on the real epidemiological reports to this aim we recast the differential equation 1 which is the basic definition of the logistic growth not to be confused with the logistic function of equation 2 as follow when put in this way one can straightforwardly get insight in how to proceed one should plot the ratio of the daily new cases to the cumulative number of cases numerator and denominator in equation 4 respectively as a function of the cumulative number of cases and inspect whether the curve is linear or departs from linearity is the decrease linear like anticipated in the ideal simulation presented in figure 1b  we have the demonstration that the logistic growth model applies the curve constructed as described above using the covid-19 epidemic reports for slovenia

possible to estimate the carrying capacity n from point where the extrapolated straight line intersects the x-axis while the intercept or slope can be used to deduce the infection rate  noteworthily

everyone at home italian approach but rather to impede virus transmission german approach eg by wearing masks adequate hygiene and social distancing infection transmission does not strongly increase upon easing as long as face masks and social distancing prevent sars-cov-2 virus spreading one should add at this point -an important fact that appears to be currently inadequately understandthat along with a less pleasant effect of a short-term slight increase of the daily new cases a moderate increase in the infection rate also has a positive impact it reduces epidemic duration compare the right tail the green and orange curves in figure 3b  ii the fact that the carrying capacity n does not change upon lockdown easing is equally important this is the maximum number of individuals that can be infected in a given environment rephrasing the maximum number of infected individuals does not increase when the lockdown is released the total carrying capacity of a given environment does not change from a methodological perspective one should emphasize the important technical strength of the approach proposed above which made it possible to arrive at the aforementioned conclusions it is

mediasocial media landscape i can think of what appear to be several major media andor social events in recent timesnoting full-well that by the time this article is published they may not even be recognizableincluding the khashoggi killing the covington school student debacle the parkland shooting the kavanaugh nomination the thai cave recue the british royal wedding the manifestations in haiti the never-ending quest to build a wallbarrierfence between the usa and mexico and the politicalhumanitarian crisis in venezuela among many others i apologize for the usa-centric focus here as a canadian i am fully cognizant of the depth and reach of usa tentacles thinking control power and influence in and on my own work as well as on many others even though i collaborate widely with colleagues in diverse jurisdictions and contexts notably in latin america the usa and its interests bleed over to every region of the world and although united statesians the concept of american is hotly contested and does not cover all of the peoples of the americas may not be talking collectively in a central way about the world or may not be collectively immersed in ingratiating the usa into the infinite number of political and economic issues concerns and cultural representations of the other countries and peoples the world is watching listening and being consumed by the behemoth of usa empire the covid-19 pandemic also squarely places the usa within the core of the action with daily pronouncements about blaming china cutting off funding to the world health organization downplaying the spread of the virus boasting about how the virus has been beaten back and spreading the political and economic reach of this country far and wide in military diplomatic commercial and potentially humanitarian ways it seems as though the reality of this being a global pandemic a far-reaching health crisis is only partially the story and the present manifestations in the usa of people demanding that isolation be stopped while so many are being infected and even dying is almost incomprehensible and social media concurrently exposes denounces disseminates and provides an echo chamber for what is taking place so i question what becomes news indeed viral and how does it become more than click-bait algorithmic entertainment the bouncing around in limited like-minded networks tepid sharing and a platform for trolls is it about numbers the quantity of clicks views shares and reads or something more substantive at the same time what are the true dimensions of the issues who frames it how and why and to what end what is omitted downplayed obfuscated how and why in the list of issues in the previous paragraph we can think of many pitfalls foibles and problematic concerns as to what issues look like in democracy 20 all issues are not simply a usa problem but connections to elites hegemony power differentials and media framing are i believe worth establishing and interrogating what is clear is that power differentials are at play in how fake news is constructed disseminated understood and engaged with the more volatile social media can push up against normative media in further determining how fake news can be projected masked embellished and consumed concerning the jamal khashoggi killing in october 2018 in istanbul bbc news 2019 we can follow the usual process of focusing on hegemonic interests and avoiding contextual factors and backdrops several significant and pivotal factors were down- or under-played in reporting on this tragedy for example the relationship to the saudi kingdom human rights billions upon billions of dollars in armaments sold to the saudis the unimaginable assault by saudi arabia against yemen and the impending famine and genocide in yemen as a result womens rights journalistic freedom and an unending series of beheadings by the quasi-untouchable saudi regime undoubtedly information discussion debate reports and mobilization on all of these fronts can be located and advanced through social media in spite of the mainstream hegemonic vision the point here is that central controlled and manufactured debate at least within a condensed and constrained optic and timeframe shined a light on the actual killing of khashoggi in turkey who did it how and why yet significantly it was only weakly concerned with the other what couldshould be considered to be highly pertinent and central issues that arewere intertwined within this quagmire why such deference was paid to the saudi leadership in this case when this same deference is not paid in many other instances especially when the faulty regime is not an ally is quite pertinent the lack of historical political and economic context combined with the propensity to avoid latching onto research and a plurality of visions perspectives and experiences seem to be a predominant feature of how these stories crystallize the khashoggi example like others contains an evolving set of circumstances and frames as well as questions and we are cognizant of how some segments of social media can provide differing narratives that can consequently re-shape the official story yet the social media dimensions can also counter the formal hegemonic narrative and this is where alternative forms of democracy can start to take hold jenkins shresthova gamber-thompson kligler-velenchik and zimmerman 2016 why the more critical dimensions within the khashoggi case or the venezuela situation or others for that matter wereare not more broadly taken up by democracy 10 relates i believe to the hegemonic shapingframing of the issues it is also combined with a weakly focused mainstream media whose reach is now consumed within the fake news bubble and a still questionable place at least among many formal political leaders and their business sector supports of uncontrolled social movements and social media within formal political spheres however i do believe that this last factorsocial movements and social media being a mobilizing forceis and will continue to potentially be central to conceptualizing developing cultivating building and elaborating a more decent meaningful robust and critically engaged democracy in spite of the status quo aiming to maintain and sustain its hegemonic place social media movements can also lead to dictatorship genocide and an infringement of rights sapra 2020 for instance gayo-avello 2015 hypothesizes that social media may contribute but is not the central feature to democratization 
in short social media is not a democratizing catalyzer per se it is just one of many factors in addition to great tactical tools provided the conditions in the nondemocratic country are suitable moreover there are many variables which can negatively affect the outcome of any uprising even without the regime tampering with social media in other words social media does not make people free freedom requires people taking risks and organizing themselves gayo-avello 2015 6
 social media cannot magically lead to class consciousness anti-racism peace and social solidarity however it may be able to provide an outlet and legs to important stories events and realities for people who were only previously loosely connected this could have a dual effect of further questioning and delegitimizing normative democracy and also providing space and voice for marginalized interests perspectives and arguments social media is now indelibly a part of the citizen participation landscape what is the point of living in a democracy if you are one of those living in abject poverty are homeless and are working tirelessly to make ends meet but never achieve economic justice ely yamin 2020 of course the notion of having the freedom to pursue your dreams as in the american dream is sufficiently grounded within normative debates to ensure that questioning entrenched systemic institutional deeply grounded social inequalities will be quickly snuffed out within the usa context amadeo 2019 highlights the increasing social inequalities as follows 
structural inequality seems to be worsening between 1979 and 2007 after-tax income increased 275 for the wealthiest 1 of households it rose 65 for the top fifth the bottom fifth only increased by 18 thats true even adding all income from social security welfare and other government paymentsduring this time the wealthiest 1 increased their share of total income by 10 everyone else saw their share shrink by 12 as a result economic mobility worsenedthe 2008 financial crisis saw the rich get richer in 2012 the top 10 of earners took home 50 of all income amadeo 2019
 powers fischman and berliner 2016 have highlighted how research on poverty and social inequalities is poorly understood or operationalized which further underpins weak policy responses to entrenched and systemic problems similarly it is helpful to problematize how wealth has been accrued historically through genocide slavery imperialism war and conflict colonialism and a host of racialized sexist and other machinations in addition to pikettys 2017 well-documented treatise capital in the twenty-first century mclaren see pruyn and malott 2016 has highlighted marxs theory on surplus value and the limited mobility between the social classes and the crushing blow of capital against labor ultimately the value of what is produced encounters hyper-inflation in the hands of investors owners and speculators without real production which may seem locked into the days of children being exploited in coal mines over a century ago but there are still many parallels today giroux 2016 has coined casino capitalism to label the politico-economic system that enraptures the vast majority of formal and to varying degrees informal activity that underpin mass exploitation he further elucidates the danger of continuing on the one-way neoliberal path before us 
neoliberalism has put an enormous effort into creating a commanding cultural apparatus and public pedagogy in which individuals can only view themselves as consumers embrace freedom as the right to participate in the market and supplant issues of social responsibility for an unchecked embrace of individualism and the belief that all social relation be judged according to how they further ones individual needs and self-interests matters of mutual caring respect and compassion for the other have given way to the limiting orbits of privatization and unrestrained self-interest just as it is has become increasingly difficult to translate private troubles into larger social economic and political considerations one consequence is that it has become more difficult for people to debate and question neoliberal hegemony and the widespread misery it produces for young people the poor middle class workers and other segments of society now considered disposable under neoliberal regimes which are governed by a survival-of-the fittest ethos largely imposed by the ruling economic and political elite giroux 2016
 mclaren see pruyn and malott 2016 and giroux see giroux sandin and burdick 2018 have also made a compelling case to interpret todays reality as a politico-economic context that is launching us into hyper-sophisticated forms of fascism within this backdrop i believe that there is a great need as there always has been to be more fully engaged with and in education in political circles and in public debate in general in relation to the philosophy and operationalization of capitalism and in particular to the all-encompassing mercantilization of all public and private goods services and experiences enveloped within neoliberalism the covid-19 context has expedited and underscored the slippery slope toward authoritarianism stripping away rights while creating socio-economic cleavages that are even more serious than before giroux 2020 democracy 20 is tethered to democracy 10 conceptualizations of the world but the door is slightly open to develop a new world despite the titanic hegemonic vice-grip that maintains a stranglehold on education and public debate as alluded to in the previous section the collective we are free to surf the web consume create diffuse comment and cajole the other whether the other knows us sees us or cares about us or not we are not frontally impeded from opening our eyes and ears on the contrary many movements have been stimulated from doing soincluding the arab spring although the aftermath re-captured regressive hegemonic features of what preceded it the dilemma is that the corporatebusiness politico-economic hegemonic world has grown into this concurrently in-your-face and stealth quickly-evolving dynamic context seamlessly stamping its imprint in every way possible the interplay between democracy 10 and democracy 20 thus offers tremendous potential for citizen participation and engagement while simultaneously presenting the quicksand mirage that we may not be as free as we think we are or we may not be as engaged as we think that we are neoliberalism has many people around the world gasping for air now mired in a pandemic that vacillates from signs of encouragement that the curve is flattening to fears that community transmission is rapidly spreading through asymptomatic contact there is enormous stress about when there will be an effective vaccination how the health context will play out and increasingly when will the economy get back to normal at this point in timealthough we are aware of massive numbers the information is not hidden anyway of unnecessary deaths in developing countries related to hunger disease poverty and conflict we can see the extreme concern within local national and international governments and institutions to get the economy working while most of the world has emphasized social distancing as a key measure to diminish the dissemination and transmission of covid-19 an eerily bizarre phenomenon has taken hold in the usa wong vaughan quilty-harper and liverpool 2020 disparate semi-organized protests against self-isolation are taking place in diverse locations often replete with a range of arms and placards enunciating the right to among other things haircuts and to play golf is it pure insanity a case of hubris beyond all limits an anti-science ideology that needs to play out in every sectorincluding the environmentor complete indifference to human suffering while the usa situation deeply underscores the anxiety and agitation around the healtheconomy dichotomy i present below a brief illustration of the neoliberalization of the political and economic convergence through an example of the coronavirus in qubec canada qubec a predominantly french-speaking province of 85 million people in canada provides an interesting illustration of how a jurisdiction within a federal framework has worked to mobilize sensitize and activate a range of health economic political and education measures to confront covid-19 there are daily press briefings information sessions directives a vast media campaign testimonies and a host of consultations which all serve to educate the public and to engage the citizenry concurrently it would be disingenuous to simply criticize where there have been gaps and problems the reality is that many people have worked diligently and courageously to create a sense of the gravity of the problem and to diminish the extent of the propagation of the virus having a universal healthcare system has been i believe indispensable to understanding how to assess allocate distribute and organize resources this is not an individual problem but a vast insidious collective one it should be acknowledged as well that what we know is shifting and re-calibrating in real time and decisions made on march 1 were questioned and re-assessed by march 7 and so on moreover what we know now cannot always be fully understood until later and decisions that are taken in that light can lead to nefarious situations and the rampant spread of the virus hindsight is 2020 as the proverb goes so a fulsome diagnosis of what we are doing today will be more effectively critiqued once we are through to the other side of the pandemic the situation in qubec one that is surely not unknown elsewhere underscores the fragility of normative democracy this is i believe a question of normative democracy working the way that it does one heart-wrenching issue that we are observing at this time is that the vast majority of deaths in qubec like elsewhere is among those 70 years of age and older and particularly the 80  age-group moreover what many of us did not know or fully consider the vast majority of deaths up until now within qubec are among those who are in long-term care residences in french they are called cshlds roughly 70 which are essentially seniors residences for people with health issues the transmission within these residences is extensive and rapid with an increasing number of personnel nurses and doctors also being affected one residence for example experienced an overwhelming amount of infection herron discussed below and there are others that have also been deeply affected one might say that there are two public health crises at this time one for the general population and another for these particular residences with this specific group on the one hand the population is astonished sickened and in shock how could this happen especially to our elderly on the other hand this was a serious politico-economic cocktail being mixed for a couple of decades massaged through diverse political parties within the normative democracy that adjudicates such matters why was there such sustained neglect and under-funding why was this not flagged as a serious catastrophe in the making i would like to underscore that this is not a problem of one person one political party one decision one law or one particular model it is the consequence of systemic institutional failurenegligence as well as the thinnest wedges of normative democracy carrying the day over the broader public interest and good i briefly present some of the specific underlying conditions that lay the groundwork for what is playing out within this vulnerable population at this time a lack of monitoring under-paying workers and diminished policy importance and planning media accounts provide information on the tragedy unfolding before our eyes in one case at herron in western montral the chsld there which is privately owned experienced serious staffing shortages insufficient equipment poor oversight inadequate support from oversight bodies and unacceptable communications with health authorities mckenna 2020 provides a sense of the chaos and suffering there 
nurses were getting sick too six out of the seven registered nurses on staff were experiencing covid symptoms and of seven licensed practical nurses lpns only four were still healthy about a quarter of the orderlies prposs aux bnficiares or patient attendants had also stopped working  either because they were experiencing covid symptoms or because they felt it was no longer safe to work at chsld herron within weeks a quarter of those patient attendants would test positive for covid-19 bedridden residents were lying in sheets stained brown up to their necks in excrement so long had it been since their diapers had been changed some were dehydrated and unfed the head of professional services at the ciusss dr nadine larente is the doctor who went to help she told the french-language newspaper la presse the place was in chaos one lpn and two patient attendants were trying to care for 130 residents food trays had been placed on the floor dishes untouched because residents with mobility issues could not reach them mckenna 2020
 about double the number proportionately of seniors in qubec opt for long-term care residences compared with the rest of the country which could be a function of culture policy economics and options available and the rapidly aging qubcois population is a further aggravating factor preparing the context dougherty 2020 one expert see lowrie 2020 noted that the spatial configuration with long corridors and residents sharing rooms have a harder time isolating sick residents from uninfected ones compared to residences with house-style layouts where residents live in smaller wings is another factor that helps explain the extreme transmission of the virus in chslds with staff falling ill or refusing to come to work there has been a massive campaign to recruit retired nurses and also to bring doctors and specialists into the overburdened long-term care system the premier of the province has also asked for the military over a thousand troops to further provide support within these seniors residences social class and political power are fully intertwined in the quickly unraveling situation involving seniors residences in qubec raising the minimum wage in qubec for example was vigorously opposed by the present government and others along the way fearful that employers especially small businesses could not afford it while there is no maximum wage being regulated those struggling with the minimum wage are often obligated to work two or three jobs to seek assistance elsewhere and face other severe challenges including in relation to housing childcare education and the cost of living the chsld situation brought everything to a head with it being clearly obvious that those designated as essential services were often those being paid the least in society the premier took the almost unprecedented measure of apologizing for underpaying workers when it became difficult and problematic to staff these residences 
i know a lot of quebecers are asking themselves how we could have got ourselves in this situation a sombre legault said at his friday briefing addressing the catastrophe unfolding in covid-19-stricken long-term seniors residences chsldsi myself have spent several days and nights asking what i should have done differentlyif i was able to redo one thing i would have increased the wages of orderlies faster even without the accord of the unions i assume full responsibility we entered this crisis ill equipped and clearly the situation deteriorated for all kinds of reasons the virus got in authier 2020
 the premier also took a series of steps to increase pay for healthcare workers 
as part of its effort to improve working conditions in the health-care system quebec announced that nearly 300000 employees in both the public and private sector will be getting temporary pay increasesworkers who are in direct contact with the disease  such emergency-room professionals and nurses in coronavirus testing centres  will receive an 8  boost in their salariesthose working in long-term care homes known as chslds will also be among the 69000 workers to benefit from the 8  raiseanother 200000 people who work in the health-care system but arent as directly exposed to the disease such as the nurses who staff the 811 health line will get a salary increase of 4 and workers in private long-term care homes many of whom make little more than minimum wage will get an additional 4 per hour that measure appears designed to discourage these workers from quitting and staying home to take advantage of federal financial assistance thats worth 2000 a month shingler stevenson and montpetit 2020
 one question that arises here is how these workers could have been underpaid for so long and what the effect may have been for them the people receiving the care the healthcare institutions and system and society as a whole did it dissuade qualified workers from pursuing careers or staying in them what were the other priorities that negated remunerating fairly such indispensable and essential workers on the economic side of the ledger how efficient is it to underpay some employees and over-compensate others who have not actually done the work or who are ironically considered to be disproportionately fundamental is a 101 ratio for salaries at the top and the bottom reasonable or should it be 1001 or 10001 in canada in general the wage differentials are less extreme and odious than the usa but the issue of social inequality is also a significant concern there one study mishe and wolfe 2019 focused on usa compensation provides some backdrop to how public services and priorities can be disproportionately affected 
ceo compensation is very high relative to typical worker compensation by a ratio of 278-to-1 or 221-to-1 in contrast the ceo-to-typical-worker compensation ratio options realized was 20-to-1 in 1965 and 58-to-1 in 1989 ceos are even making a lot moreabout five times as muchas other earners in the top 01 from 1978 to 2018 ceo compensation grew by 10075 9403 under the options-realized measure far outstripping sp stock market growth 7067 and the wage growth of very high earners 3392 in contrast wages for the typical worker grew by just 119
 there is a lot of complexity to how covid-19 is analyzed and comparing diverse sitesjurisdictionssystems and how data are compiled and evaluated may not reveal the true breadth and scope of the reality similarly there are many moving parts and lots of people remunerated and volunteer involved and engaged and there are also all kinds of activities aimed at supporting a solidified vigorous response my intention in presenting this case study is not to admonish or diminish those serious and important efforts on the contrary it is my hope that this pandemic will reveal a silver lining somewhere in that extreme vulnerabilities and shortcomings need to be rectified in order to ensure as much as possible that economics will not suffocate political considerations in the future and i have not emphasized here the race gender and other pivotal underlying factors underpinning this pandemic but they are also a significant piece of the puzzle this text has underscored what democracy we are trying to achieve to cultivate and to ingratiate the focus and direction of my central arguments about the lack of bone fide democracy within a normative mainstream political framework that preaches that we live in a developed democracy has i believe become accelerated and accentuated as a result of covid-19 i have highlighted some of the fundamental issues and problems with normative representative hegemonic electoral democracy and also emphasized the pivotal contextual shifts and cornerstones embedded in democracy 10 as well as democracy 20 i have also made the case for more robust critically-engaged citizen participation which would require or at the very least benefit from new forms of education and mediapolitical literacy the social media equation was brought to light since it serves as an unruly uncontrolled and rapidly evolving microcosm of the world its diversity its problems its challenges and its potential i was careful to not make a definitive declaration related to achieving democracy through the potentially transformative technologies that now shape how we live and function and relate to the world despite everything we are still mired in conflicts in inequitable power relations and in democracies that are not very democratic we are still straddling democracy 10 in which formal political declarations are fabricated with partisan political interests at the fore the stock market is seemingly central to everything and business elites are catered to at every level similarly tax cutsregardless of political stripefigure into everything political parties shamelessly line up to receive donations does anyone believe that they come with no strings attached tax breaks for companies must be considered as much as lower tax rates for the rich does anyone believe that rich people will create more employment based on having more cash if so why are there so many off-shore accounts in tax-havens intended to not pay tax and military might is still right for many the further the coronavirus expands the more there is discussion about needing an economic balance to get back to normal and indicators such as the stock market are central to supposedly gaging what is happening karabell 2020 of course there have been lots of incremental changes and lots of new laws policies practices and shifts in cultural norms that have benefitted generally speaking women racialized minorities the poor and the vulnerable yet social inequalities despite massive technological and others changes not only persist but in many regards are increasing how could this be when there is so much wealth why do so many people leave their countries in complete desperation why is there still so much military conflictmost of which goes unreportedwhy do so many problems of poverty and discrimination persist in the most vulgarly palpable ways why is there such little global outrage over the state and fate of indigenous peoples the loss of land language culture and autonomy and why is the environment not the priority this very partial list of questions is noteworthy because neoliberalism is definitely an accelerator to many of the problems we are facing giroux 2020 to be clear here this is not a binary proposition and avoiding confronting real problems with real people will not address real suffering oppression and marginalization gray and gest 2018 we might ask why are there recurrent entrenched problems when there are so many people projects forces and movements fighting for a more decent robust and even alternative democracy 20 one that could place neoliberalism within a new different and alternative landscape how should hegemony be understood today when many people so freely believe that they have complete agency over their actions thoughts and experiences and when many people believe that voting is the only key i would stress here that the binary capitalist-socialist rich-poor binary is not the most productive lens through which to examine the complexity of such extreme power imbalances around the world the debate around democracy i believe needs to be more all-encompassing involving all of the tentacles and blockages of neoliberalism into the class race gender cultural and other pivotal sociological markers of identity and it also needs to carve out a place for how power works is distributed and re-created this debate needs to leave open the door for unknown questions and answers as well as creative and alternative processes and deliberations accepting that the normative elections in place are most likely not very beneficial for most people and most definitely the massive numbers of people who do not participate willingly or unwillingly van reybrouck 2017 it is important to connect the

but that and many other challenges requires weaving human rights praxishuman rights for social changeinto broader social movements as well as working across disciplinary silos the problems facing the rights movement are too complex for any one set of advocacy tools or any one fields expertise of course there is no single monolithic human rights community just as there is no unified health and human rights community those tropes are used from the inside to police the boundaries of orthodoxy and from the outside to caricaturize sets of actors and strategies yet there are dangers of circling the wagons defensively around our professional tribes the complexity of the challenges posed by rampant inequality the spread of authoritarianism and illiberalism distrust in multilateralism and climate cataclysm call for embracing justified critiques and opening up to new ideas and perspectivesand uniting with labor environmental and many other social justice movements ely yamin 2020
 inspired by paulo freires transformative work freire 1970 i would advocate for more openness and acceptance of political realities that shape our lived experiences as well as an extremely healthy dose of humility as means to being able to understand engage with and be with the other i explore more fully the interconnections and inspiration of freires work with my colleague gina thse carr and thse 2019 the hard-wired testosterone-induced keep-fundraising-at-all-times political systems that have been put in place all over the place need to be re-imagined before they suffocate themselves and everyone else people will slowly divest themselves from the voting game leaving it as an empty shell filled with a bunch of white guys in suites yes there are some openings for other identities in this equation but the game was made by and for these guys freire wrote of conscientization and i believe that to get there we need to focus on peace not war social and cultural development as opposed to economic development solidarity and emancipation rather than exclusively on individual rights and liberties and the recognition that we are all human beings as human beings we are not required to be racist no baby is racist but we learn to be so sexist a totally learned behavior classist exploiting ones neighbor is not an obligation kill one another who gets killed anyway the rich or the poor and who are they do we care or live with so much misery hatred and oppression ultimately we are in the same boat or world together one could see the glass half full with lots of progress all over the place and yet the empty side of the glass contains real people living through unimaginable for the full side of the glass realities the wage discrepancies and gaps in the qubec example exemplify this reality the quest for a meaningful democracy aimed at both sides of the glass would be a more conducive option and re-imagining democracy will require more fully and even disproportionately considering the empty side of the glass taking a stand against democracy 10 and normative representative hegemonic electoral democracy is a necessary condition to moving forward for this re-imagined democracy donkervoort 2020 underscores that the pandemic has been exploited by autocrats but that citizens can resist and coalesce around global initiatives to weaken and confront hegemonic forces this could mean enhanced civil society engagement across all boundaries with an eye to unmasking and dismantling the concentration of wealth and power covid-19 has exposed the need for a different universe not only in terms of public health but also importantly in relation to democracy and citizen engagement roy 2020 so while my foot to return to the title may be in taters im hopefulindeed it may be the only way out if thisthat my head will not be the ultimate causality as we strive to either sustain or re-imagine a democracy that can not only take us out of a pandemic but rather into social solidarity that will remove our bodies and minds and souls from imminent disaster   david warne j anthony ebert christopher drovandi antonietta mira kerrie mengersen  since the initial outbreak in wuhan hubei china in december 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019  has rapidly spread to cause one of the most pressing challenges facing our world today the covid-19 pandemic within four months of the first reported cases more than two and a half million cases were confirmed with over two hundred thousand deaths globally and many countries had taken extreme measures to stop the spread in this work we analyse the response to the covid-19 outbreak for 103 countries over the period 22 january to 13 april 2020 we utilise a novel stochastic epidemiological model that includes a regulatory mechanism that captures the level of tolerance to rising confirmed cases within the response behaviour using approximate bayesian computation we identify that the top ten outbreaks as of 31 march are characterised by a high tolerance to rising cases tallies whereas countries that avoided severe outbreak have a low tolerance countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher identification rate as of 13 april almost all countries show declines in transmission rates and basic reproductive numbers furthermore countries approaching recovery also increased their identification rate between 31 march and 13 april we also demonstrate that uncertainty in undocumented infections dramatically impacts uncertainty in predictions overall we recommend that broader testing is required to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections  the world is at war with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 9  which was officially declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on 11 march 2020 42  from the earliest cases reported in december 2019 hubei china severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 spread rapidly throughout the world 37 45  on 3 april 2020 the global tally of confirmed cases exceeded one million with over 50000 fatalities 11 17  the challenge faced by healthcare systems worldwide cannot be understated 19 21 29 36  travel restrictions increased hygiene education social distancing school and business closures and even complete lockdowns 9 36 are now all-too-familiar concepts these are examples of non-pharmaceutical intervention npi strategies that many countries have introduced to slow transmission rates and relieve pressure on healthcare systems in the absence of a vaccine or treatment for covid-19 14  modelling and simulation are at the forefront of determining the efficacy of these measures in reducing sars-cov-2 transmission and quantifying risk of future outbreaks along with their potential severity 2 8 16 31  understanding of these effects is crucial given the potential deleterious sociological and economic impacts of many npis 3 4 5 9  the global modelling community has responded rapidly to the covid-19 situation and has provided insight into the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 25 26 32  global risk of spread through transport networks 17 44  forecasting and prediction 20 28 33  and evaluation of interventions 16  a variety of modelling strategies have been applied techniques include empirical approaches such as phenomenological growth curves 33  data-driven statistical approaches using non-linear autoregressive models 1  and mechanistic models based on epidemiological theory 22 with various extensions 7 34  here we consider a stochastic epidemiological model in which the true infected population is unobservable and a regulatory mechanism on the virus transmission process is included to capture the community response to a covid-19 outbreak there is a large body of literature related to modelling specific intervention strategies 16  we take a unique approach that does not explicitly model specific interventions instead our model captures a general tendency for the transmission rate to decline as the number of confirmed cases increases through the inclusion of a utility function the model also allows for more general responses incorporating deaths and recoveries to reflect alternative imperatives for intervention with this model we can identify key features differentiating countries that have experienced a severe outbreak from those that have managed to contain the spread within a bayesian framework we characterise 103 countries using covid-19 timeseries data provided by johns hopkins university 11 17  over two time periods 22 jan-31 mar 2020 and 22 jan-13 apr 2020 our characterisation is a broad assessment of the global response to the covid-19 pandemic and reflects how countries in early phases of outbreak may have adjusted their strategies to reduce the time to recovery in particular we find that very severe outbreaks are characterised by a high tolerance to rising confirmed case numbers before significant reductions in transmission rates occur of the top ten severely affected countries in terms of cumulative cases the only countries that observed a decrease in active cases during the period of study china and south korea are characterised by high identification rates the result of highly effective identification and quarantine programs we also find that for many countries the trans-mission rates in the later period of the study are declining however large unobserved infected population counts are also estimated our analysis shows that increased testing contact tracing isolation and quarantine measures are effective in reducing the severity of covid-19 outbreaks world-wide we also demonstrate that the unknown magnitude of undocumented cases substantively impacts uncertainty in predictions and we conclude that wider testing is also essential to reduce this uncertainty our model is a stochastic epidemiological model see materials and methods that describes the evolution of six sub-populations over time susceptible s t  undocumented infected i t  confirmed active a t  confirmed recovered r t  confirmed deceased d t  and undocumented recovered r u t  the cumulative confirmed cases can be recovered from the model as c t  a t  r t  d t  importantly the true values of s t  i t  and r u t are not observable in reality and are latent variables in our model this explicit treatment of an undocumented infected population is essential for more realistic uncertainty quantification a novel feature of our model is the transmission rate of sars-cov-2 that depends on a utility function of the observable states a t  r t  and d t  for the presented results this rate is a monotonically decreasing function in the cumulative confirmed cases c t  representing the overall population response to rising confirmed case numbers this effectively approximates the combined effect of npi introduction community compliance with various interventions and a general change in social behaviour as media outlets report higher case and fatality statistics however it is important to note that our framework allows for other utility functions that lead to other functional forms for the transmission rate see materials and methods and supplementary material our model has eight parameters to be estimated two transmission rates  0 and  where  can be regulated but  0 cannot ie residual unavoidable transmission case recovery rate  case identification rate  case death rate  relative latent recovery rate  regulatory parameter n and the initial infected scale factor  while details are provided in the materials and methods section the parameters n and  deserve some interpretation here the regulation parameter n controls the rate at which the transmission rate  is scaled down as the cumulative cases increase in general n  1 represents a response with a low tolerance to increasing cases 0  n  1 is a response with a higher tolerance for larger case numbers and n  0 indicates no regulatory effect at all see material and methods for more details throughout we refer to n  1 as a low tolerance response and n  1 as a high tolerance response importantly n does not provide information on the timescale in which the community responds nor the overall efficacy of interventions and management rather n is an indicator of how tolerant a community has been to growing case numbers the parameter  estimates the number of undocumented infections relative to confirmed cases on the first day that exceeds 100 confirmed cases t  0 that is   i 0 c 0  higher values for  imply greater levels of undocumented spread ahead of the earliest reported cases and smaller values of  represents effective identification quarantine and early contact tracing using data obtained from the johns hopkins university see materials and methods bayesian parameter inference is applied to 103 countries over the period 22

adaptively sample the approximate posterior distributions for all eight model parameters and posterior predictive distributions for the number of active confirmed cases recoveries and deaths over time note that we analyse each country independently although a global model could also be considered see discussion for almost all countries the posterior predictive median lies close to the observed time series and is almost always contained within the 95 credible intervals fig 1 provides examples of the model performance for the united states  fig 1a  italy  fig 1b  australia  fig 1c  china  fig 1d  south korea  fig 1e  and taiwan  fig 1f   and 95 credible interval shaded region of the posterior predictive distributions is plotted for active cases blue recoveries yellow and deaths red this is compared against observations as recorded in data for active cases circles recoveries squares and deaths crosses all 103 countries in this study the model fits for china  fig 1d  and south korea  fig 1e  are the only exceptions the inaccuracy of the active trajectory for china is at least partly due to the changes in reporting methodology from china on 13 february 43  however this does not explain the overestimation of the early recovery period for both china and south korea we discuss potential model improvements to account for this in the discussion section notwithstanding this our model appears to be sufficiently accurate for a broad comparative analysis of global responses to covid-19 during this period the marginal posterior distributions for the parameters  0 residual transmission rate  regulated transmission rate  case recovery rate and  case fatality rate see figs s1 and s2 in supplementary material are similar across countries this is expected as these parameters mainly describe the sars-cov-2 infection itself rather than differing national responses for the period up to 31 march exceptions include a higher uncertainty in death rate for honduras higher uncertainty in recovery rate for nigeria and venezuela and increased uncertainty in the  0 parameter of afghanistan cameroon cuba honduras cambodia mauritius nigeria palestine and venezuela the data also appear to be uninformative for the relative recovery rate  since the posterior is very close to the prior fig s3  the posterior marginals for the identification rate  the regulatory parameter n and the initial infected scale parameter  relate to the nature of the initial outbreak and subsequent response as a result there is significant variation in these distributions across countries figs s3 and s4 to investigate global patterns we compute for each country the marginal posterior means for the parameters  n and  fig 2 shows the distribution of these point estimates across all countries and highlights countries having the highest cumulative confirmed cases to date 31 march 2020 without a decline in active cases the united states usa spain esp italy ita germany deu france fra united

in response across europe and the united states 9  however it is important to restate that a high tolerance response n  1 is not equivalent to a slow response in time in ascending order the five smallest values for 6 23  it is unexpected that the value of n for china is low since strong lockdown measures were taken in hubei 23  we expect this is due to the absence of clinically diagnosed cases reported before to 13 february 43  it is also important to note that small n does not mean that npis were not effective but rather that they became effective at higher tallies of confirmed cases france iran turkey and the united states also have comparable values for  but did not experience a decline in active cases in the time frame of the study these countries have a larger value for  indicating a large number of latent infections at an earlier stage of the outbreak therefore a delay in the effect is expected with   1586 95 ci 1567 1606 iran is a particularly extreme example of this as there was significant undetected spread of sars-cov-2 through the volumes of pilgrims passing through the city of qom 15  of the severely affected countries the united kingdom has the closest signature to taiwan and singapore albeit with a higher  and lower n the larger  likely implies early unobserved transmission prior to abandonment of herd immunity targets in favour of social distancing and closing of non-essential business and schools 16 27  australia has a very similar characterisation to the united kingdom with higher  but also higher n that likely reflects the introduction of travel bans and social gathering restrictions introduced in the second half of march overall our modelling approach identifies features of how communities globally respond to the covid-19 pandemic without explicit modelling of specific npis we obtain results that are consistent with the intervention strategies of the most severely affected countries globally we see a low tolerance regulatory response with many countries having high values of n unfortunately most countries also have large values of  indicating that delays in early detection have lead to a larger unobserved infectious population as a result the active case curve will take longer to turn around this downturn could be brought forward by increasing  through increased identification and quarantineisolation capacity these results are for the period 22 jan-31 march in the next section we consider an additional two weeks of data the period 1-13 apr provide refined parameter estimates and offer insights into the evolution of the pandemic the fast moving evolution of epidemics and pandemics such as covid-19 demand that model outputs and the corresponding effectiveness of mitigating measures are regularly re-assessed we re-evaluate our model estimates and inferences for 103 countries that satisfied our inclusion criteria see materials and methods over the period 22 january-13

highlighted as in fig 2  for the top eight countries still experiencing severe outbreaks on 31 march there is a significant shift in these parameter estimates using data for the period 22 january-13 april there is also a reduction in the uncertainty for some parameters overall see supplementary material fig s5-s8  these shifts demonstrated in fig 3 d-f have some broad trends in fig 3d and f all eight countries show a decrease in the parameter n with france iran turkey the united kingdom and the united states having the most substantial declines this indicates that in light of more recent data the community response to the outbreak had a higher tolerance to growing case numbers than earlier data indicated fig 3d and e indicate that most of these countries have a lower identification rate however it is promising to see a small increase in  for germany and switzerland and a large increase in  for italy and spain this is possibly a reflection of increased testing capabilities within these countries between 31 march to 13 april httpsourworldindataorgcoronavirus accessed 14 april overall there is also a decrease in  indicating that the number of early undocumented cases could be lower than previously thought one concerning exception is italy with an increase in the point estimate with   0956 95 ci 0924 0988 australia also shows a decrease in the value of n  0703 95 ci 0693 0713 but also a decrease in   0259 95 ci 0240 0278 this suggests the australian community was overall more tolerant of higher case numbers but the undocumented case 7 all rights reserved no reuse

this version posted may 5 2020  numbers were lower than previously expected australia shows an increase in   0456 95 ci04400472 which is consistent with a high identification rate of symptomatic cases 32  comparing fig 2a -c with fig 3a -c highlights the dynamical nature on the covid-19 pandemic in particular changes in the parameters n and  indicate that our understanding of the past trajectory of the outbreak is also evolving this is a particular strength of our modelling approach in that we can characterise how sensitive a community response is to growing case numbers our framework is also flexible enough to include community responses to other factors that may be prescribed through an arbitrary utility metric see materials and methods and supplementary material as stated above the regulatory parameter n does not provide insight into the full management of the outbreak it simply provides a measure of how the transmission rate declines as a function of confirmed case counts see materials and methods we compute several derived quantities that provide a more complete view of how countries are managing the pandemic specifically we consider the following quantities the case death rate relative to the case recovery rate  the case removal rate relative to identification rate    the relative strength of transmission rate regulation f c 0   f c t f c 0  where f  is the transmission rate regulatory function see materials and methods and respectively c 0  and c t  are the number of confirmed cases at the start of the outbreak first day exceeding 100 confirmed cases and at the end of the data period 13 april and the relative reduction in the basic reproduction number 10  r 0  r e r 0  where r 0 is the basic reproductive number at the start of the outbreak and r e is the basic reproduction number at the end of the data period see supplementary material point estimates of these ratios are computed through expectations with respect to the full joint parameter posterior distributions see materials and methods and supplementary material for each country fig 4a shows the distribution of point estimates related to management and treatment of confirmed cases the effective management of covid-19 cases within germany can be inferred by a low value for the relative case fatality rate   0083 95 ci 00700086 and high value for the case removal rate relative to identification rate     112 95 ci 076148 the united kingdom is an outlier with a very high   4132 95 ci264 8001 we expect this is due to a discrepancy in the data for recoveries in the united kingdom with only 626 recoveries recorded china is another outlier with     666 95 ci 0 1373 due to relatively poor model fit for china as discussed above fig 4b shows that globally there is a high level of regulation with f c 0   f c t f c 0   07 that is regulatory strength greater than 70 of maximum for nearly all countries despite this there are many countries with only moderate reductions in the basic reproductive number indicating that more testing is required or a higher level of residual transmission  0  in particular the second outbreak occurring within singapore in the later period of study is identified by a high level regulation but very little decrease in the basic reproductive number fortunately the basic reproduction number reduced by at least 50 for all of the most severely affected countries 8 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020   the primary purpose of our model is to analyse the historical trajectory and community response to the covid-19 pandemic however our approach also enables predictions that account for uncertainty in the undocumented infected population and in the community tolerance of rising cases there are many unknowns within the current pandemic that affect the accuracy of model prediction 20 28  in particular we have no estimates for the number of undocumented cases world wide furthermore inadequate uncertainty quantification can lead to unrealistic credible prediction intervals 28  we use our bayesian framework to handle both uncertainty in model parameters and uncertainty in undocumented infected population regarding prediction uncertainty we take a conservative approach that provides predictions accounting for uncertainty in the evolution up to the current time we perform this by sampling from the posterior predictive distribution and continue model evolution to the prediction horizon in this way we consider uncertainty in all possible histories parameter values and latent population evolution to quantify uncertainty in predictions conditional on the model formulation using posterior distributions of parameters computed using data up to 13 april we quantify prediction uncertainty over a 7 day prediction horizon example predictions for active cases recoveries and deaths median and 95 credible interval are shown in fig 5 for the united states fig 5a  italy fig 5b  spain fig 5c  germany fig 5d  taiwan fig 5e  and australia fig 5f  our approach produced wide credible intervals as a result of parameter uncertainty and uncertainty in undocumented infections there is a wide range of possible scenarios for undocumented infection populations sizes that are completely consistent with the data 26  by continuing simulations from the posterior predictive distribution we take an ensemble of these scenarios into 9 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020   our predictions for the united states show a continuing increase in the number of active cases fig 5a  an increase in active cases is predicted for italy fig 5b  although the decline in the lower bound of the credible interval indicates the possibility of a flattening of active case counts in future weeks predictions for spain and germany fig 5cd  also indicate a flattening out in the number of active cases over the prediction horizon for taiwan and australia fig 5e f the median predictions show a decline in active cases however the uncertainty is still substantial the key message from this analysis is to highlight the importance of conservative uncertainties in the future evolution of the pandemic it is encouraging to see predictions that indicate potential future declines in active cases counts however uncertainties in the number of undocumented cases and model parameters indicate caution in predicting the timing of consistent declines in active case numbers therefore it is essential that communities remain vigilant in fast-evolving situations such as this we have applied a novel stochastic epidemiological model to characterise the response to the covid-19 pandemic for 103 countries worldwide over the period 22 january-13 april 2020 we find that the worst affected countries in terms of confirmed case numbers including the united states italy spain and germany are characterised by a response with high tolerance to rising case numbers ie small n however increased testing and isolation protocols large  have demonstrably reduced the longer term impact as demonstrated by china and south korea many countries seem to be learning from these 10 all rights reserved no

preprint this version posted may 5 2020  collective experiences as many countries have a low tolerance for rising case numbers large n unfortunately we also identify that the number of undocumented cases likely exceeded the confirmed cases for many countries large  it is important to emphasise that we do not make any specific guidelines for particular countries in improving specific non-pharmaceutical intervention npi or testing strategies however through the lens of our model we advise that effective actions should begin at lower case numbers rather than having a high tolerance to rising cases our model like any model has fundamental assumptions that are necessarily introduced we treat each country as a single well-mixed population while our approach does include important features such as undocumented infections and a variable transmission rate more advanced analysis could be performed by considering disease spread through a network 8 13 24 38 of well-mixed populations such as provinces and states we also treat each country as a closed system whereas realistic sources and sinks through inclusion of an international travel network could enable us to track the impact of decisions of one country on connected countries other details of the model could also be extended we treat active confirmed cases as non-infectious due to quarantine and isolation in reality active confirmed cases can still spread the virus to medical staff we also apply the reasonable approximation that there is no re-detection or re-infection however new evidence is questioning the validity of this assumption 27  a finer granularity of classes of susceptible individuals ie at risk incubation periods and severity of symptoms would also enable more detailed analysis for an individual country 20 32  however our reduced set of classes is a trade-off between realism and broad applicability to worldwide data a bayesian hierarchical modelling approach could also be applied to better capture heterogeneity across countries our model framework is flexible through the inclusion of a utility function u a t  r t  d t  see materials and methods in the regulatory mechanism and may be extended to other scenarios we have only considered the case of a utility dependent on cumulative cases u a t  r t  d t   a t  r t  d t  c t  or deaths only u a t  r t  d t   d t see materials and methods and supplementary material however the utility function could include economical factors or be modified to be a function of state and time this would enable a wide range of behaviours to be explored such as specific timings of enforced npis and subsequent lifting of restrictions when active case go below a threshold it is hoped that our work might be used to inform future responses to outbreaks of covid-19 or other pandemics the message is clear we must not be complacent in response to an outbreak as the earliest confirmed cases arise while many countries have managed to reduce transmission and basic reproductive numbers a response with a lower tolerance to rising confirmed case numbers is recommended for the future we also highlight the importance of wider testing to effectively reduce

the residual transmission rate as f a t  r t  d t   0 we assume the form f a t  r t  d t   11  u a t  r t  d t  n  we find a utility function based on cumulative confirmed case numbers u a t  r t  d t

only considers deaths u a t  r t  d t   d t  but model fitting was inferior see supplementary material there is a wide variety of utility functions that could be considered to model specific country npis and behaviours therefore we simplify our notation and consider f c t   11  c n t  where the parameter n  0 controls the rate of decrease as shown in fig 6  given an initial number of confirmed cases c 0  we have  0  gc t    0  f c 0  note the shape of f c t  starts to decline rapidly before starting to level out increasing n shifts the initial decline to the left effectively altering the critical values of c t in which a population begins to maximise efforts to flatten the curve for example small n describes a population that does not significantly reduce the transmission rate until the confirmed case tally is large conversely larger n describes a population that acts decisively as a response to very early stages of the outbreak importantly our approach does not distinguish between different npis and voluntary population behaviour but rather models the net effect of rising confirmed cases on transmission rates the parameter  is used to initialise the unobserved infected

pathogen afforded ample opportunities middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ian mackay m katherine arden e   acute respiratory tract infections artis are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality and a common reason for both outpatient visits and hospitalisations among humans worldwide rna viruses the agents that cause arti most frequentlyusually a self-limiting upper respiratory tract syndrome coronaviruses covs are recombining enveloped viruses with long positive-sense rna genomes they are ancestrally zoonotic in origin having adapted to bind a diverse range of cellular receptors 1 four human coronaviruses hcovs have evolved initially from bats camelids and rodents to become distinct global endemic seasonal pathogens causing mild to moderate arti among humans 23 the hcovs occupy two of four genera in the subfamily coronavirinae 4 human coronavirus 229e and betacoronavirus-1 subspecies hcov-oc43 have been known for more than 50 years while human coronavirus nl63 and human coronavirus hku1 were first characterised in 2004 and 2005 respectively a severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov briefly emerged into the human population during 20022004 but was controlled and is not known to circulate today its brief but severe emergence sparked renewed study of covs in 2012 another novel severely pathogenic cov was identified in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa 80 of over 2000 human cases have been recorded over five years 5 both sars-cov and the new middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov belonging to the species middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus evolved from ancestral but different bat covs travel history and laboratory analysis would be required to differentiate mers from sars if it still occurred 6 to date most mers cases have been limited to countries in the arabian peninsula with rare travel-related spillovers one case precipitated a large healthcare multi-facility outbreak in the republic of korea in 2015 a confirmed case of mers occurs when a person irrespective of signs or symptoms has a laboratory-reported mers-cov infection a probable case requires a minimum of a clinically diagnosed acute febrile disease an epidemiologic link and a partial laboratory diagnostic profile 7 we briefly review recent literature and the current understanding of mers and mers-cov highlighting some knowledge gaps the viral receptor for mers-cov is a transmembrane glycoprotein called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 which has a wide tissue distribution in humans including on alveolar cells of the lower respiratory tract and in the small intestine 89 dpp-4 interacts with the mers-cov at its receptor-binding domain rbd within the spike fusion protein figure 1 dpp-4 expression is upregulated in the lower respiratory tract of those with poor lung function in the lower respiratory tract of those with untreated asthma and in soluble form in the plasma of obese patients 8101112 whether blood borne dpp-4 interferes with mers-cov or through reversible binding contributes to its systemic distribution of mers-cov during serious disease are questions worthy of further investigation studies of the upper respiratory tract have found little to no sign of dpp-4 expression levels or tissue distribution although one study identified dpp-4 enzymatic activity suggesting it is present 101314 it may be useful to expand the search for dpp-4 expression to tissues indicated by cases with different disease states co-infections especially with viruses known to inflame the lower respiratory tract and trigger asthma exacerbations such as rhinoviruses are also of interest mers-cov may also use sialic acids as a low-affinity but selective cellular receptor to aid attachment and entry into dpp-4 positive cells 15 mers is most well characterised as a respiratory disease of humans extensive inflammation and immune evasion are hallmarks of severe disease ascribed to covs 1617 among confirmed mers cases fever cough and dyspnoea are the most common clinical manifestations 1819 the mean incubation period for mers is between 2 and 13 days longer periods are associated with a reduced risk of death 202122 mers-cov infection also results in mild and subclinical outcomes the typical mers case is a saudi male aged between 21 and 60 years often presenting to a hospital with pneumonia or worse 182324 severe mers occurs most frequently among those with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus cirrhosis and others affecting respiratory renal and cardiac systems 232526 downregulation of innate immune response mediators associated with some of these disorders may be related to the severity of mers 27 it may be that the high frequency of severe mers reflects elevated prevalence of certain comorbidities in the middle east region 27 comorbidities did not feature among sars cases as they have among cases of mers mers-cov is a highly opportunistic pathogen in june 2015 an outbreak in the republic of korea found confirmed cases presented with fever cough and upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms progressing within a week to lower respiratory tract distress with lymphopenia and elevated liver enzymes 23242728 mers can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan system failure requiring intensive supportive care 232429 extra pulmonary infection does occur likely resulting from haematogenous transport of virus which is an area in need of further study 930 similarly little is known about sequelae following mers-cov infection in one study those who survived acute respiratory distress syndrome were well one year later 19 another study identified delayed neurological manifestations during treatment of mers cases but lacked long-term follow-up 31 death occurs among 3040 of mers cases approximately 40 of cases in the ksa and 20 of cases in the republic of korea where mortality ranged from 7 among younger age groups to 40 among those aged 60 years and above among studies of fatal cases death occurred between 515 days after symptom onset 18213233 because the extent of subclinical or mild infections in the community remains unquantified mortality figures may be overestimates 34 mers-cov variants exist as a single antigenic group in lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus 3536 when mers-cov infection is subclinical or less severe humoral immune responses may be weak delayed short-lived or undetectable 3738394041 humans can still be reinfected if they have pre-existing neutralising antibodies similarly to what is seen in camels 41 however survivors of symptomatic mers do develop antibodies including neutralising antibodies which decline but persist for 13 years 3742 whether these antibodies prevent future infection remains to be examined those with mild or subclinical mers still develop cd8 t-cell responses and survivors of more severe mers including those who do not mount an antibody response develop both cd8 and cd4 t-cell responses 43 robust laboratory-based real-time rt-pcr diagnostic tools were described immediately after mers-cov was discovered and remain reliable 44 several different research-based antibody detection protocols have also been reported for human and animal studies 45 molecular and serological kits are commercially available 46 while current molecular methods are rapid there are many steps that combine to delay publication of a final test result from the initial decision to request a mers-cov test to sample collection nucleic acid extraction pcr additional sampling repeat testing and reporting processes molecular rapid and sensitive point-of-care tests pocts are not available but would help support infection control in healthcare settings the world health organisation recommends testing of appropriate samples for mers-cov rna using real-time rt-pcr methods with subgenomic sequencing to confirm screening results as necessary 47 repeat testing is often required 1748 virus isolation by culture is not a recommended tool detecting antibodies against mers-cov may be useful to identify a seroconversion that can define a probable case when confirmation by rt-pcr has been unsuccessful or impossible 47 mild and subclinical mers cases are reported among younger people including healthcare workers and children 174950 it remains unclear what proportion of mers-cov infections are truly subclinical after one study found many were initially incorrectly classified 51 difficulty identifying a useful diagnostic antibody response in mild and subclinical disease means seroprevalence studies likely under-report the history of mers-cov 40 mers-cov specific cd8 testing may be helpful 43 the usefulness of serology needs clarification humans are incidental hosts of mers-cov the principal natural reservoir host of mers-cov is the dromedary camel 16 among camels mers-cov infection manifests in a manner similar to that in which the common cold manifests in humans the camel upper respiratory tract expresses high levels of the dpp-4 receptor 13 the study of mers-cov highlights the need for collaboration between politics and diverse basic and applied fields of research at the humananimal interfacea one health approach camel trade plays a central role in the movement of infected hosts around the arabian peninsula pakistan and north west and east africa all harbour mers-cov-infected camels 52535455 alpacas llamas and pigs are potential hosts according to experimental evidence 565758 in addition alpacas have been found to be naturally infected 59 the virus genetically detected or biologically cultured from humans is nearly identical to that isolated from camels and in some instances has been used to identify transmission routes signs of virus change have appeared with continued surveillance over time recombination has been identified and variation in the region of the tropism-defining spike protein in a divergent egyptian camel mers-cov variant 60 has been associated with reduced infectivity in vitro compared to human and less divergent camel mers-cov variants 61 nearly 300 human and animal mers-cov genome sequences have been produced from mers-cov infections since 2012 but few studies of the functional impact of identified mutations have been conducted among mers-related coronaviruses 62 there may now exist three conspecific viruses the camel mers-cov and the bat covs btvs-betacovsc2013 63 and predictpdf-2180 64 each with related but distinct genomes and divergent spike genes ongoing viral surveillance and characterisation is essential to ensure variants with increased efficiency in attachment fusion or replication do not emerge unnoticed surveillance of human respiratory illness in mers-cov-positive camel countries outside of the arabian peninsula is currently lacking 52 according to the ksa ministry of health 65 nearly half of all mers cases are classified as primary cases zoonoses originating from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels or from an unidentified source which had no link to any other known human case the precise mechanism by which mers-cov spreads from camels to humans is unknown but is not essential for enacting precautions to reduce exposure to infected animals secondary cases make up slightly more than half of all mers cases mostly resulting from exposure associated with a healthcare facility infectious mers-cov is presumed to be found in droplets 59 but modelling has also suggested the possibility of airborne spread 45 virus remains viable for at least 48 h on plastic and steel surfaces presumably underpinning the extensive contamination of air and surfaces in hospitals housing patients with mers 666768697071 the virus appears sensitive to standard heat and chemical inactivation measures 7273 antibodies to mers-cov have been found in camel sera as far back as 1983 in each animal antibodies to mers-cov are short-lived and do not prevent reinfection 527475 human contact with camels is often associated with the collection preparation and ingestion of camel milk or meat female camels especially those bred for milking have the highest rates of mers-cov seropositivity mers-cov rna has been detected in milk from one study and virus was found to be stable after being spiked into milk samples from another study 537677 camels in larger herds have higher rates of seropositivity compared with smaller herds 5253 female and young camels also have higher rates of mers-cov rna than older and male camels 53 while no evidence for human infection resulting from ingestion has been presented it has been found that experimentally inoculated human intestinal cells and organoids can host productive mers-cov infection and that mers-cov can remain infectious after transit through gastric acids 9 further intestinal respiratory and neurological infection follows intragastric inoculation of dpp-4 transgenic mice 9 whether camel milk and meat actually contain a suitable infectious dose to cause intestinal infection of humans is yet to be determined 78 it seems likely that the processes of milking and butchery may contaminate surfaces and generate infectious droplets that include sufficient inoculum from which a human infection could result via inhalation or self-inoculation it is not known whether the eyes act as a portal for mers-cov entry since the majority of human-to-human mers-cov infections are associated with healthcare improved infection control and prevention is considered key for preventing outbreaks among humans not at occupational risk of exposure to infected animals 79 in the outbreak in the republic of korea 5 of 186 cases were responsible for 83 of transmission events most new cases did not result in any identified onward transmission the reproduction r0 number was calculated as 39 and 1969 from selected ksa outbreaks 80 three of these five cases were coughing prolonged exposures crowding and large numbers of contacts were important factors for disproportionate virus transmission 818283 the role if any for mild or subclinical mers-cov infections in maintaining the virus in the human population has not been convincingly addressed a healthcare worker found to shed viral rna for more than five weeks in the absence of disease adds urgency to the need for such studies 84 none among 82 contacts of a mildly symptomatic mers-cov-infected healthcare worker seroconverted but there was no mention of whether the index case seroconverted 85 in a ksa hospital outbreak investigation contacts of subclinical mers-cov-infected healthcare workers became rt-pcr positive suggesting transmission was a possibility 17 some studies report very rare camel contact among human cases and no history of contact with other mers-cov-infected humans and this raises the question of how these primary cases acquire infection 18 community spread and subclinical transmission need more attention the hajj pilgrimage an annual mass gathering in the ksa provides many opportunities for mers-cov to transmit and then spread globally however it is rhinoviruses influenza viruses and other seasonal respiratory viruses that have to date driven the bulk of respiratory disease associated with the hajj this indirectly reinforces that mers-cov does not transmit efficiently among humans outdoors 86 in hospital environments healthcare workers and other patients and carers who experience prolonged exposure to infectious cases in the absence of suitable personal protective equipment ppe are those who usually become infected there have been examples of the 2080 rule whereby relatively few infected individuals are responsible for a disproportionate number of new cases 83 insufficient cleaning of room surfaces inadequate room ventilation and overcrowding have also been suggested to drive indoor mers-cov transmission no specific antiviral or licensed vaccine is available for a cov that infects humans but a range of candidates exist even if mers-cov infection is rare transmits poorly and does not evolve to become a pandemic threat it serves in a useful role to drive vaccine research of other covs both current and yet to emerge for cases in healthcare facilities improving hand hygiene the use of ppe gloves gown respiratory and eye protection 87 and surface cleaning can help disrupt transmission as can rapid triage of febrile patients with respiratory signs and symptoms to prevent mers-cov infection from dromedary camels precautions include avoiding contact with camel nasal secretions cooking camel meat and pasteurising camel milk until further studies better quantify the risk attached to each of these potential pathways vaccines to prevent cov disease require both humoral and cellular immunity 88 because airway immune responses may be key to preventing the establishment of human mers-cov infection localised deposition of an aerosolised vaccine could prove useful 88 a number of vaccine platforms and payloads have proceeded although progress has been challenged by the need for animal models that suitably reconstitute human lower respiratory tract disease to show evidence of any preventative effect 8990 some candidates have progressed to clinical trials 9192 the spike protein and rbd elicit neutralising antibody responses and have been employed as the payload for a number of platforms 889394 including dna vaccines 95 modified vaccinia virus ankara 9697 measles virus 979899100 and human- 26101 and chimpanzee-adenovirus-based vectors 99 there are also venezuelan equine encephalitis replicons expressing nucleocapsid 101 nanoparticles 102 and structural and non-structural deletion mutants of mers-cov 103 vaccination of camels is likely to be the most rapid least expensive and best intervention for preventing rare spillovers that then become amplified by humans in healthcare settings successes have been reported but the approach is challenged by the problem that camels are naturally reinfectable with mers-cov even in the presence of a high titre of neutralising antibodies 5274104 to date camel vaccines reduce viral load but do not prevent virus shedding 104105 human vaccines could target the occupational at-risk groups which include healthcare farm barn market and slaughterhouse workers 5688106 more widespread application of a mers vaccine at this time does not seem warranted the rarity of seropositive donors sometimes low antibody titres and a lack of clinical evidence have made the use of convalescent sera from recovering mers patients a possibility for treatment but one with significant limitations 39 instead human monoclonal antibodies targeting the rbd and polyclonal antibodies may provide treatment options for those at risk of severe outcomes 107108109110 clinical trials are awaited early control of viral replication is important and administration of interferon ifn 1b or a ribavirin and ifn 2b combination within hours initially showed promise their practical use in humans is challenging because if not infected while in a healthcare setting humans usually present for care with well advanced disease 111112 combined treatments which reduce viral replication and the host immune response to it are likely to be valuable developments 16 a wide range of repurposed or novel potential antivirals including polymerase nucleotide synthesis and protease inhibitors and fusion-inhibiting peptides 6691113114115116117 have been investigated 91115 corticosteroid use is not recommended for acute respiratory distress syndrome 113 comparative studies and randomised controlled trials are mostly lacking 91 though much is already known it remains important to clarify the routes of human infection including the role of the eyes in contracting infection among primary human cases the development of rapid molecular poct tests and alternatives to serology such as cd8 detection can help us understand mers-cov transmission which can lead to reductions in outbreaks the scale of mild and subclinical cases among non-hospitalised arabian peninsula communities is unknown as is their role in transmission most knowledge of mers comes from studies of hospital-based populations or linked community contacts future prospective long-term cohort studies of mild community respiratory illnesses using molecular methods would be useful children have so far been largely absent from the mers case tally but they may represent an important population for prospective study recent lessons from the zika and ebola viruses should also inform new studies seeking possible long-term sequelae and viral persistence and highlight the need to follow-up severe mers patients in september 2017 mers-cov passed its fifth year since discovery it remains a rare cause of disease in a geographically defined region of the world known for the concurrent presence of infected camel hosts much of what we know about mers relates to severe disease travel-related cases continue to challenge the rest of the worlds surveillance and response capabilities and we need more data to understand unexplained primary transmission signs of genetic change in mers-cov have been recorded but it remains unclear whether they change clinical disease how camels came to carry the virus they live with today remains unknown but it is academic for the control of mers to date human-to-human transmission has been inefficient but virus surveillance and characterisation will ensure any change to the status quo is identified mers-cov is not currently a pandemic threat it is spread with the aid of human habit and error nevertheless a much needed therapeutic toolbox is being developed and in this process we are learning more about how covs cause disease how they confound our immune responses where they come from and how to prevent and treat their respiratory infections 90 focused research is needed to minimise the impact of mers basing control strategies on evidence gleaned from specifically addressing relevant unknowns  framing covid-19 how we conceptualize and discuss the pandemic on twitter philipp wicke marianna bolognesi m  doctors and nurses in these weeks are busy in the trenches fighting against a new invisible enemy covid-19 cities are locked down and civilians are besieged in their own homes to prevent the spreading of the virus war-related terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and diseases arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of war-related metaphors toonot only in public discourse and the media but also in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication we hereby present an analysis of the discourse around covid-19 based on a corpus of 200k tweets posted on twitter during march and april 2020 using topic modelling we first analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified then we show that the war framing is used to talk about specific topics such as the virus treatment but not others such as the effects of social distancing on the population we then measure and compare the popularity of the war frame to three alternative figurative frames monster storm and tsunami and a literal frame used as control family the results show that while the family literal frame covers a wider portion of the corpus among the figurative framings war is the most frequently used and thus arguably the most conventional one however we conclude this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around many aspects involved in the current situation therefore we conclude in line with previous suggestions a plethora of framing options or a metaphor menu may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the covid-19-related discourse on the social media and thus support civilians in the expression of their feelings opinions and ideas during the current pandemic  on december 31 2019 chinese authorities alerted the world health organization of pneumonia cases in wuhan city within the hubei province in china the cause they initially said was unknown and the disease was first referred to as 2019-ncov and then named covid-19 the next day the huanan seafood market was closed because it was suspected to be the source of the unknown disease as some of the patients presenting with the pneumonia-like illness were dealers or vendors at that market since then the disease has spread quickly throughout china and from there to the rest of the world sars-cov-2 is the name of the virus responsible for this coronavirus pandemic that we are experiencing while the present article was in writing  the virus has so far spread throughout all the inhabited continents and affected millions people killing thousands of individuals schools have been shut down kids are at home many workers are now working from remote locked down in their houses and leaving only for reasons of primary necessity such as shopping for groceries and going to medical appointments with many countries implementing lock downs and promoting quarantines suggesting or forcing citizens to stay inside their homes in order to avoid spreading the virus millions of people are experiencing a global pandemic for the first time in their lives the social distancing enforced by various governments stimulated many internet users to use social media to communicate and express their own concerns opinions ideas and feelings in relation to this new situation on twitter for example around 16k tweets are posted by twitter users every hour containing a hashtag such as coronavirus covid-19 or covid a variety of issues are debated on a daily 3 preprint -draft version basis on twitter in relation to the pandemic these include but are not limited to the political and social consequences of various governmental decisions the situations in the hospitals getting increasingly more crowded every day the interpretation of the numbers associated with the spreading of the pandemic the problems that families face with homeschooling their children while working from home and so forth among these issues the discussion around the treatment and containment of the virus is surely a central topic the present article aims at describing how the discourse around covid-19 is framed on twitter in particular we want to understand what are on twitter the main topics related to the discourse around covid- 19 and to what extent the treatment of the disease is framed figuratively because previous research has shown that various social and political issues addressed in public discourse are framed in terms of wars 1  we assume that this tendency may emerge also on twitter in relation to the discourse around covid-19 unlike the articles on magazines and journals typically used for corpus analyses of this kind twitter does contain messages written by journalists and other experts in mass communication as most tweets are provided by non-expert communicators we hereby want to investigate to what extent twitter users and therefore non-expert communicators frame covid-19 in terms of a war and whether other figurative framings arise from automated analyses of our corpus of tweets containing virus-related hashtags in particular we address the following research questions 1 what type of topics are discussed on twitter in relation to covid-19 and how does their use compare to the use of the war frame each of the three questions is addressed in a specific study which we describe in the methods section 3 mining the information encoded by private internet users in the short texts posted on twitter the tweets is becoming an increasingly fruitful field of research in relation to health discourse tweets have been used by epidemiologists to access supplementary data about epidemics for example tweets about particular diseases have been compared to gold-standard incidence data showing that there are positive correlations between the number of tweets discussing flu-symptoms and official statistics about the virus spread such as those published by centers for disease control and prevention and the health protection agency 2  already a decade ago in brazil tweets have been used to track the spreading of the dengue fever a mosquito-transmitted virus 3  more recently pruss and colleagues 4 used a topic model applied to a large corpus of tweets to automatically identify and extract the key topics of discussion about the zika disease a virus that spread mainly in the americas in early 2015 the authors found also that rises in 5 preprint -draft version tweeting activity tended to follow major events related to the disease and zika-related discussions were moderately correlated with the virus incidence moreover it has been demonstrated that the combination of data collected from hospitals about specific diseases and data collected from social media can improve surveillance and forecasting about the disease more effectively 5 6  besides providing a valuable tool for tracking the spread of epidemics and thus helping experts to take more effective decisions social media have been used to investigate public awareness attitudes and reactions about specific diseases 7 8  as pruss and colleagues report in their review 4  the 2013 measles outbreak in the netherlands for example has been analysed in this perspective by mollema and colleagues 9  who compared the number of tweets and other messages posted on social media with the number of online news articles as well as with the number of reported measles cases and found a strong correlation between social media messages and news articles and a mild correlation between number of tweets and number of reported measles cases moreover through a topic analysis and a sentiment analysis of the tweets they found that the most common opinion expressed in the tweets was frustration regarding people who do not vaccinate because of religious reasons the measles outbreak in the netherlands began among orthodox protestants who often refuse vaccination for religious reasons the 2014 ebola outbreak in africa was also used as a case study to mine the attitudes concerns and opinions of the public expressed on twitter for example lazard and colleagues 10 analysed user-generated tweets to understand what were the main topics that concerned the american public when the panic widespread on us soil after one case of ebola was detected the authors found that the main topics of concern for the american public were the symptoms 6 preprint -draft version and lifespan of the virus the disease transfer and contraction whether it was safe to travel and how they could protect their body from the disease in relation to the same outbreak tran and lee 11 built ebola-related information propagation models to mine the ebola related tweets and the information encoded therein focusing on the distribution over six topics broadly defined as 1 ebola cases in the us 2 ebola outbreak in the world 3 fear and pray 4 ebola spread and warning 5 jokes swear and disapproval of jokes and 6 impact of ebola to daily life the authors found that the second topic had the lowest focus while the fifth and sixth had the highest more recently tweets have been mined to understand the discussion around the zika epidemics miller and colleagues 12 used a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to determine the distribution of topics in relation to four characteristics of zika symptoms transmission prevention and treatment the authors managed to outline the most persistent concerns or misconceptions regarding the zika virus and provided a complex map of topics emerged from the tweets posted within each of the four categories for example in relation to the issue of prevention they observed the emergence of the following topics need for control and prevent spread need for money ways to prevent spread bill to get funds and research vijaykumar and colleagues 13 analysed how content related to zika disease spreads on twitter thanks to tweets amplifiers and retweets the authors found that of the 12 themes taken into account zika transmission was the most frequently talked about on twitter finally pruss and colleagues 4 mined a corpus of tweets in three different languages spanish portuguese and english with a multilingual topic model and identified key topics of discussion across the languages the authors reported that the zika outbreak was discussed differently around the world and the topics identified were distributed in different ways across the three languages in cognitive linguistics and in particular in metaphor studies it has been shown that the discourse around diseases and epidemics is often framed by means of figurative constructions in particular metaphor is often used to talk about different aspects of diseases such as their treatment their outbreak and their symptoms the framing power of metaphor is particularly relevant in health-related discourse because it has been shown that it can impact patients general well-being for example in a seminal study sontag 14 criticized the popular use of war metaphors to talk about cancer a topic of research recently investigated also by semino and colleagues 15  as these authors explain the military metaphor that we tend to use to talk about the development spreading and cure of cancer inside the human body has been repeatedly rejected by cancer patients as well as by many relatives and doctors who indicate that such framing provokes anxiety and a sense of helplessness that can have negative implications for cancer patients in a series of experiments for example hendricks and colleagues 16 found that framing a persons cancer situation within the war metaphor and therefore as a battle has the consequence of making people believe that the patient may feel guilty in the case that the treatment does not succeed conversely framing the cancer situation as a journey encourages the inference that the patient will experience less anxiety about her health condition the military metaphor thanks to which we frame diseases such as cancer is a very common one to be found in public discourse 1  according to karlberg and buell 17 17 of all articles in the time magazine published between 1981 and 2000 contained at least one war metaphor the war metaphor is not used solely to frame the discourse around diseases but also the discussion 8 preprint -draft version around political campaigns crime drugs and poverty as explained in 1  war metaphors are pervasive in public discourse and span a wide range of topics because they provide a very effective structural framework for communicating and thinking about abstract and complex topics notably because of the emotional valence that these metaphors can convey in the special case of the diseases the war metaphor is typically used to frame the situation relatively to the treatment of the disease as indicated in metanet the berkeley-based structured repository of conceptual metaphors and frames 18  the metaphor can be formalized as disease the figurative frame of war used in discourses around diseases is certainly a conventional one frequently used often unconsciously as argued by 1  such a frame is handy and frequently used because it draws on basic knowledge that everyone has even though for most people this is not knowledge coming from first hand experience moreover this frame expressed in an exemplary way the urgency associated with a very negative situation and the necessity for actions to be taken in order to achieve a final outcome quickly the outcome can be either positive or negative in a rather categorical way the inner structure of the frame is also relatively simple with opposing forces clearly labelled as in-groups and out-groups or allied and enemies each force has a strategy to achieve a goal which involves risks and can potentially be lethal for these reasons this frame is arguably very well suited to appear in the discourse around despite the undebatable frequency by which public discourse around diseases uses war metaphors this frame is often not well received as mentioned above and war-related metaphors can be resisted as we will further elaborate in the discussion section in some cases the press opposes deliberately the war frame advancing alternative figurative frames tracking down alternative frames to the war one in a qualitative manner has been a recent endeavor initiated by scholars in cognitive linguistics and corpus analysis on twitter the hashtag reframecovid first proposed to the best of our knowledge by ins olza and paula sobrino has been recently used to harvest texts such as articles advertisements and notes showing how the virus has been opposed and framed in alternative ways by a few journalists and writers notably the discourse has been reframed using lexical units related to the domain of football of games of storms and so forth in study 3 hereby reported we explored the structure and functioning of alternative frames too in our corpus-based analysis of tweets about covid-19 and compared them to the war frame as well as a literal frame that is the frame of family and friends in study 1 we explored the range of topics addressed in the discourse on covid-19 on twitter to do so we used a topic modelling technique in study 2 we explored the actual usage of the war frame and in which topics related to covid-19 is the war frame more frequently used to do so we compiled a list of war-related lexical units and ran it against our corpus of covid-19 tweets observing and discussing which lexical units of each frame were used in the tweets in study 3 we explored alternative frames that could be used to frame the discourse around covid-19 on twitter to do so we compiled lists of lexical units for selected alternative frames three figurative frames and one literal one and compared the percentages by which they appear to be used in the corpus of tweets against the percentages by which the war frame is used in order to identify tweets that relate to the covid-19 epidemic we defined a set of relevant hashtags used to talk about the virus covid19 coronavirus ncov2019 2019ncov ncov ncov2019 2019ncov covid19 using twitters official api in combination with the tweepy python library tweepyorg for 12 days we have collected 25000 tweets per day that contain at least one of the hashtags we did not collect retweets or mentions without the hashtag the tweets were collected in accordance with the twitter terms of service two main restrictions of those terms and service motivated our decision to limit the extent of our corpus firstly the free streaming api only allows access up to one week of twitters history secondly there is a limit of 180 requests per 15-minutes the algorithm to obtain the tweets will automatically 11 preprint -draft version increase our corpus in the upcoming weeks such that new data will be freely available for future research as previously mentioned we do not store users id and release the data in compliance with ethical standards to balance our corpus we needed to consider how a single tweet or a single user weights on the overall corpus for example a scientific analysis of fake news spread during the 2016 us presidential election showed that about 1 of users accounted for 80 of fake news and report that other research suggests that 80 of all tweets can be linked to the top 10 of most tweeting users 19  therefore we decided to filter the corpus and retain only one tweet per user table 1 provides an overview of the dates collected and filtered tweets the filtered tweets are single tweets per user the total number of collected tweets is 25k per day as the streaming api starts collecting tweets from 2359 cet of each day and has been limited to english our corpus arguably encompasses mainly tweets produced by users residing in the  in order to extract and identify topics from the corpus we used a latent dirichlet allocation algorithm henceforth lda 21  lda is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that aims to describe samples of data in terms of heterogeneous categories it is mostly used to identify categories in documents of text and thus appropriate to identify topics within the covid-19 corpus of tweets the study reported by pruss and colleagues on the corpus of tweets related to the zika epidemics 4  for example used the same algorithm to identify topics within the corpus for the purpose of our study we used the gensim lda-multicore algorithm which allows us to parallelize the training of our data on multiple cpus as an unsupervised learner lda needs to be given the number of topics that it will try to divide the data into our exploratory approach includes the search space for several different amounts of topics thus varying in the level of granularity represented within each topic we hereby report the results obtained from the division of the data into a relatively small number of topics n4 and a relatively large number of topics n 16 to show and compare a less granular and a more granular division of the data we expect to find broader and more generic concepts listed in the first analysis n4 and more specific concepts in the fine-grained topic analysis n16 we have used 6 passes of the algorithm to go over the entire corpus higher numbers cost more training time but can improve the topic quality to train the lda model we preprocessed our corpus with the following operations  converting each tweet into a list of tokens using gensim s simplepreprocess function  removing tokens with less than 3 characters eg aa fo o  removing stopwords from the list of tokens stopwords from stone et al 22   removing covid-19 words from the list of tokens eg covid ncov coronavirus etc  turning the tokens into a bag-of-words ie a list of tuples with the token and its number of occurrences in the corpus 14  we excluded terms like coronavirus covid corona virus or ncov19 from the topic modeling because these do not add information about the topics themselves the preprocessing resulted in a list of 415329 tokens that is lexemes we did not lemmatize the corpus nor pos-tagged it for the purpose of our study therefore for example gerundive forms of verbs as well as plural forms of nouns are present in the corpus and the list of frame-related words is also composed by lexemes and not simple lemmas additionally we trained another lda model with a tf-idf term frequency-inverse document frequency version of the tokens the tf-idf assigns a statistical relevance to each token based on how many times the token occurs and the inverse document frequency a measure of whether the token is rare or common in the corpus of that token as its results did not add any further insight to our research we provide it in the online repository but do not discuss this model further to investigate to what extent users use the war frame to talk about covid-19 we needed to assess the amount of tweets that use war language in our corpus to explore the lexical units associated with the war frame we took a double approach using two tools the first tool was the web-service relatedwordsorg this web-service provides a list of words lexemes not lemmas related to a target word this list is ranked through competing scores by several algorithms one of which finds similar words in a word embedding 23 another one queries 24 to find words with meaningful relationships to the target word choi and lee 25 used the same web-service to expand the list of categories used to model conceptual representations for crisis-related tweets 25  the list of words retrieved on relatedwords was adapted to our purpose as a matter of fact the list featured words such as franco-prussian war or aggression the former is a specific type of war and it includes the term war itself we dropped any kind of specific war or terms that include a compound of war eg state of war the latter term aggression is too broad if yet closely related to the target word to be kept in the list additionally in case of doubt we checked the term in an online dictionary to verify its relation to the war framing were not yet included in the selection of lexical units based on relatedwords moreover we dropped compound units that included words that we had already included in the list eg combat zone because we featured already the word combat and two mis-spelled units seigeinstead of siege and beseige instead of besiege in order to understand where in relation to our predicted lda topics the war frame is located we have collected all tweets that mention at least one term of the war frame and asked the lda model to predict its topic this way we could identify the topics with the most or the least terms related to war in order to identify whether or not the war framing is particularly relevant we explored alternative framings used in discourses on viruses for this purpose we used the metaphor exploration web services by 26  called metaphormagnet httpbonnatucdiemetaphor-magnet-acl  using the keywords virus and epidemic we selected the following alternative frames which could be in principle used to frame the discourse around covid-19 storm monster and tsunami we did not include alternative frames that have been observed in the press and harvested with the reframecovid keyword because these featured words that arguably are used also in a very literal way on twitter in relation to 17  covid-19 notably these frames were game and the sub-frame soccer game used in the spanish press according to the community of spanish cognitive linguists however lexical units such as game football soccer game season and so on are likely to be used literally in the tweets to refer to the fact that all sport events and thus all games have been suspended due to the epidemic another frame that has been observed in the press and tagged as reframecovid is the flood frame however through a quick search on metaphor magnet we realized that this frame has too many shared lexical units with storm and tsunami and was therefore discarded in order to select the lexical units within each of the alternative frames we used the tool relatedwords  already used for the war frame for consistency however because these alternative frames are arguably less conventionalized none of them is included in the list of frames on metanet thus relatedwords was the only tool we used to harvest lexical units for the alternative frames we created three list of lexical units as for the war frame we ran these lists against our corpus and compared the frequency of occurrences within the corpus across the different framings in this list the number in brackets represents the frequency of occurrence also visualized in fig   1  in which greater size of the word indicates greater occurrence in the corpus in this word cloud the larger the word print the more frequent its occurrence in the corpus the most frequent word ispeople with about 19k occurrences followed by us with about 13k occurrences notably we cannot distinguish whether us means united states or the pronoun us topic i  0008 pandemic 0005 news 0004 data 0004 update 0004 world 0004 youtube 0003 information 0003 latest 0003 today 0003 april topic ii  0029 times 0028 friends 0027 family 0022 share 0021 italy 0021 trying 0014 support 0014 sign 0013 stand 0011 colleagues topic iii  0014 people 0013 cases 0011 trump 0009 realdonaldtrump 0008 like 0006 china 0006 world 0005 deaths 0005 pandemic 0004 going topic iv  0010 home 0008 help 0008 stay 0007 people 0007 time 0007 need 0007 pandemic 0006 health 0006 work 0005 safe  the results for 16 topics show a much greater diversity among the classes and we present the 16 topics in word clouds in fig 3 the results for the lda with tf-idf are also included in the supplementary files  the lda algorithm does not provide labels for the topics therefore we need to identify labels for the topics this is an interpretative task and aims to enrich the results with respect to our research questions the topics identified by lda analysed above and visualized in fig 2 can be labelled as follows topic i  communications and reporting  topic iii  politics  topic iv  reacting to the epidemic  the sixteen topic lda model provided a more fine-grained view of topics that could be related to the 4 general topics in the field of communication and reporting we observed finer distinctions in topics 4 11 and some in 15 where 11 is more focused on world trump and china we also find a topic in 4 closer to news lockdown press media etc in the domain of community and social compassion  topic 3 is very close to topic ii whereas topic 13 16 5 relate to topics around the quarantine self-isolation and in general reacting to the epidemic iv there are also some novel topics around treatment and medical needs 1 6 7 around testing 10 or workingstudying from home 2 9 and parts of 12 rather unrelated to the whole epidemic a conglomerate of words can be found in topic 8 and parts in 12 analysing all tweets from the database a total of 9502 tweets contained at least one term from the war framing which is 466 of all tweets of these 1029 tweets had more than one war-related term the 20 most common war terms found in our database are hereby reported with relative percentage to all war terms and number of overall occurrence words that were virtually absent or had very limited usage in the context of covid-19 on twitter were armies 2x battleground 2x combatant 2x combative 2x conquering 2x grenade 2x gunfight 2x hostility 2x invader 2x bombard 2x belligerent 1x disarmament 1x guerrilla 1x insurgency 1x raider 1x rebellion 1x treaty 1x minefield 1x vanquish 1x blitzkrieg 0x vanquishment 0x conquest 0x the lda model can predict the probability of a document to belong to a certain topic of the corpus we therefore used this prediction method to investigate what topics are relevant for those 26 preprint -draft version tweets that feature war terms for this we tokenize all tweets that contain at least one war term and use both of our lda models to suggest which of the four and sixteen topics those war related tweets most likely belong to for the four topic model we can see a distribution in for the sixteen topic model we can see a distribution in fig 5 this image shows that lexical units belonging to the war domain and therefore tweets that relate to the war frame are most likely to be found in tweets that belong to topics iv and i and partly iii in the macro distinction of topics and in tweets that belong to topics 2 7 and 10 in the fine-grained distinction  the results show that 466 of all tweets contain war-related terms and are therefore likely to frame the discourse around covid-19 metaphorically in terms of a literal war while it is hard to evaluate in absolute terms the impact that this frame has on the overall discourse around covid-19 we will see in study 3 how the war frame compares to the usage of 3 other figurative frames as well as to a literal frame and we will resume the discussion of this aspect in the general discussion section the specific words within the war frame that appear to be used in the tweets are fight fighting the very same word war combat threat and battle all these words carry a very negative valence of course and denote aspects of the war that relate to actions and events this is probably due to the stage of the pandemics that we are in that is the emergency situation and the related urgent need to take action and confront the negative situation we cannot exclude that this tendency may change once the pandemic moves into a different stage in particular it could be the case that when the emergency has passed and we will move toward the next phase in which we will leave the peak of the emergency the most frequent words used in relation to the war frame might relate to the identification of strategies to keep ourselves safe and to defend our community from potential new attacks in relation to the topic modelling of the war-related tweets we showed that tweets that feature war-related terms are most likely to belong to topics iv i and iii rather than to topic ii interestingly topic iv addresses aspects related to the reactions to the epidemics including the measures proposed by the governments and taken by the people such as self-isolating staying at home protecting our bodies and so forth our analysis therefore suggests that using war-related words is a communicative phenomenon that we use to express aspects of the covid-19 epidemic related to the measures needed to oppose fight the virus moreover tweets that feature war-related words are also often classified within the topics i and iii which include the aspects related to communications and reports about the virus and politics we interpret these results arguing that public communications and political messages are likely to frame the discourse in the war framing finally it might not come as a surprise the fact that topic ii which encompasses aspects of the discourse related to the familiar sphere the community and the social compassion does not relate well with the tweets containing war terms the fine-grained analysis into 16 topics shows some interesting trends as well in particular tweets containing war-related terms are particularly well represented in topics 2 7 and 10 topic 2 seems to relate to online learning and education topic 7 encompasses aspects related to the treatment of the virus with words such as workers health care help thank need support similarly topic 10 relates to the diagnostics and treatment of the virus with words such as positive death cases tested people confirmed therefore as the metanet war metaphor suggests and as we described in the theoretical background of this paper it is the discourse around the disease treatment and its diagnostics that are likely to be framed figuratively in terms of a war conversely topic 3 which is characterized by words like friends share trying family time and therefore addresses intimate social relations and personal affective aspects related to covid-19 is not related to the war frame tweets addressing these aspects do not employ military lexical units in general the terms of the alternative framing storm were found in 2394 tweets 117 of all tweets the alternative framing monster was found in 1077 tweets 053 of all tweets the alternative tsunami was found in 1905 tweets 093 of all tweets the literal frame used as control that is the family frame was found in 21452 tweets 1053 of all tweets we then looked at the distribution of the frequencies by which the terms within each framing 30 preprint -draft version were used and observed that they all tended to follow zipf distributions see fig 6 where the term fight from the war frame has more than 3000 occurrences in the tweets in other words within each frame there were few words used very frequently but many words were rarely used moreover although this is not visible on the plot in fig 6 in the online repository we stored the full list of lexical units within each frame among the top ranked ones for the family frame we found home family house children parents wife son and mom for the storm frame among the most frequently used lexical units we found force disaster wave storm cloud and waves for the monster frame among the most frequently used lexical units we find evil horror killer giant monster ghost zombie devil beast mutation and freak finally for the tsunami frame among the most frequently used lexical units we found wave waves tide tsunami and flooding through the implementation of three studies we answered these three research questions and discussed our specific findings in general we found that the topics around which most of the twitter discourse revolves in relation to covid-19 can be labelled as communications and reporting  community and social compassion  politics and reacting to the epidemic  a more fine-grained analysis brings to light topics related to the treatment of the disease mentioning people involved in this operation such as doctors and nurses and topics related to the diagnostics of the virus in our second study we found that these specific topics appear to be those in which the war framing is particularly relevant most lexical units within the war frame are found in tweets that get automatically classified within the specific topics of virus treatment and diagnostics moreover in study 2 we observed that there is a very little number of lexical units related to war that are very frequently used while the majority of war-related words are not used to frame the discourse around covid-19 the more frequently used words refer to actions and events such as fighting fight battle and combat as we anticipated in study 2 this might be a peculiarity of the stage of the pandemic we are currently living which is the peak of the emergency we do not exclude that with the development of the epidemics and the passage to the next phase ie leaving the peak also the most frequent words used within the war frame will change to exploit new aspects of this frame that are relevant to the new situation finally in study 3 we compared the frequency by which the war frame the family literal frame and three other figurative frames are used we found that while the family literal frame used as control covers a wider portion of the corpus among the alternative figurative frames analysed monster storm and tsunami the war frame is the most frequently used to talk about covid-19 and thus arguably the most conventional one as previous literature also suggests taken together our results confirm the pervasiveness of the war frame also in the discourse on covid-19 as previous literature would have predicted given the frequent use of this frame in discourses on diseases and viruses however we have also found that this frame is used specifically to talk about specific aspects of the current epidemic such as its treatment and diagnostics other aspects involved in the epidemic are not typically framed within a war this point is particularly important the war frame like any other frame is useful and apt to talk about some aspects of the pandemic such as the treatment of the virus and the operations performed by doctors and nurses in hospitals but not to talk about other aspects such as the need to feel our family close to us while respecting the social distancing measures or the collaborative efforts that we should undertake in order to flattenthecurve that is diluting the spreading of the virus over a longer period of time so that hospitals icu departments can work efficiently without getting saturated by incoming patients in this sense future studies could focus on the systematic identification of alternative figurative framings actually used in the covid-19 discourse to tackle different aspects of the epidemic but could also focus on the generation of additional frames which can help communities to understand and express aspects of this situation that cannot be expressed by the war frame a collection of different frames and metaphors that tackle different aspects of the current situation or a metaphor menu  httpwplancsacukmelcthe-metaphor-menu   as semino and colleagues proposed in relation to cancer discourse 15  is arguably the most desirable set of communicative tools that as language communication and computer scientists we shall aim to construct in these current times as a service to our communities  politicizing the pandemic a schemata analysis of covid-19 news in two selected newspapers ali abbas haif   the broadcast and print media have a very big influence on public opinion and they are major channels for communication between decision makers and the public the power of the media stems from its influence on the crystallization of our thoughts thoughts serve like an engine which drives and controls our actions and behaviour the media have the ability to work day and night for the purpose of forming perceptions manipulations and changing convictions regardless of whether it is a positive or negative change acceptable or rejected beneficial or harmful beloved or hated the media play a crucial role in revolutions especially arab spring uprisings the war on terror and international security the media depend on conveying or transmitting news and creating a dialogue between governments and people and between different parties in a certain country or society the media have also played a crucial role in political campaigns peace and conflict studies the media therefore are the medium by which people can raise their concerns problems and needs to their governments the media have become a tool of pressure they can easily agitate the public opinion by raising specific as well as sensitive issues they can also agitate people by resorting to manipulation persuasion distortion and deception nelson 17 states thatbias is the predisposition for or against a particular point of view whenever the positions or interests of a portion of the audience are overlooked distorted or censored the problem of bias is found bias may result from unintentional or deliberate decisions on the part of media gatekeepers but nevertheless subjects audiences to a skewed reality potentially detrimental to their best interests 2 hofstetter and buss 9 illustrate that polemics about the word bias in ordinary language is basically slanted in other words bias presents something such as a news story in a way that favors a particular group or opinion bias interprets or presents someone or something in an ideological way for special interests bias also reports certain issues problems actors politicians and any other political event not as they really are bias is not free from lying distortion of and diffusing certain facts disagreement over basic values beliefs or mores mullainathan and shleifer 15 stress the fact that information can be manipulated by different ways ignoring or omitting information that is opposite to or inconsistent with the message of the news story finding information sources that can reinforce or strengthen the story ignoring neglecting and undermining information sources that are incompatible with the message or using misleading and deceitful language and images that support the story undoubtedly media bias news bias and manipulation of information cannot be achieved without the language language serves as a powerful tool by which media owners depend on in conveying their ideologies and manipulations 22 kolsto 12 argues that the media are politically controlled this political control has great impact over its response to any kind of crisis or event politicizing pandemics is not a new bad and negative issue which we as humans need to get rid of history proved that pandemics were politicized and used for ideological and political interests dangerous diseases such as the 1918 h1n1 flu aids ebola were politicized 1 6 20 21 in fact history does not repeat itself but it teaches us lessons and inspires us to response and act differently to current crises to get positive and good results of our negative previous ones sadly we have not learned a lesson from our previous and disastrous crises instead we stubbornly politicize and invest the current deadly covid-19 pandemic for political and ideological purposes scott 21 emphasizes that disease and responses to disease are always politicized and have always political consequences ebola virus is politicized just like other previous viruses covid-19 is a virus like other previous viruses such as plague 1918 flu asian flu cholera aids sars ebola zika sars and mers it is a virus and this is the law of nature instead of cooperating together to defeat such a deadly disease governments especially those in power are busy exchanging accusations zhao lijian the spokesperson of chinas ministry of foreign affairs accused the united states of america of spreading the pandemic in wuhan the epicenter of covid-19 outbreak 10 16 president trump responded by labeling the virus as chinese virus then his secretary of state mike pompeo called the virus as wuhan virus 14 exchanging accusations between china and us continues the us even asked to open an investigation which links the virus to wuhan labs page 18 emphasizes that politicizing the pandemic is hazardous to national health stigmatizing a nation or country for its supposed responsibility in a calamity does not produce a vaccine or medicine for the virus but rather complicates it when racism stereotypes hate speech and propaganda are combined with intense fear and terror from a disease more problems will definitely emerge the media and means of social communication can make the situation even harder than expected distorted and false information manipulation ideology conspiracy theory undocumented claims and inaccurate conclusions can spread quicker than the virus itself politicizing pandemics and broadcasting fear and hate speech will lead to the discrimination and stigmatization of others in a wrong thoughtless and bad way 6 politicizing diseases shaped and can shape public attitudes about immigration the chinese exclusion act was the first immigration law passed in 1882 due to disease threat and after decades of stereotyping chinese immigrants and believing that chinese carry diseases such as cholera and smallpox the law prevented chinese from immigrating to the united states the scott act of 1888 was introduced to heavily restrict and prevent chinese to immigrate to the us such laws and views hurt an entire community and at the same time they did not stop the spread of diseases the pandemic flu which was first identified in china during the end of 1950s was known as asian flu the other flu pandemic that was appeared in hong kong during the end of 1960s was called hong kong flu the 20092010 h1n1 flu which was first identified in the us was called swine flu media coverage of this flu emphasized that this flu might have come from mexico which again caused fears from immigrants 13 politicizing pandemics encourages ethnic and racial discrimination among different people societies and countries it creates political social and even health problems it also pushes people to indulge in hate speech and aggression therefore we should avoid disinformation distortion racial rhetoric slur expressions ideology manipulation and propaganda in other words we should work together to control the disease and overcome it in the end viruses do not know borders and do not distinguish between colors religions and creeds bukhari and xiaoyang 3 elucidate that van dijk put up the analysis of structures at various levels of description ranging from phonological morphological grammatical and semantic levels to higher levels such as coherence themes and topics related to different news stories and other whole schematic and rhetorical dimensions of texts yarlott et al 28 state thatdiscourse structure is a key aspect of all forms of text providing valuable information about the contents of a given span of text this is most obvious in academic legal and technical texts which are often clearly delineated into sections containing for example introductory background or explanatory material among othersthese type of texts are designed to make it easy to find specific information within them quickly news articles have a similarly helpful though implicit design they often provide a brief up-front summary of the important events relevant background information comments from both experts and the reporters and detailed descriptions of the main events events are often not presented in chronological order but rather structured by importance 25 drid 7 illustrates van dijks framework for the analysis of the discourse of news depends on two systematic ranks of structures global structures and local structures the global structures consist of two discourse structures namely macrostructures and superstructures the local structures include the microstructures zhang et al 29 state thatvan dijks study of news discourse has his peculiar feature he believes that discourse is a kind of social control power which represents the willpower of authority and reflects special power structure the people who control and spread discourse are news journalists writers artists and scholars these people are called symbolic elites the powerful people are entitled to control all kinds of discourse while common people are only able to control daily conversation the aim of van dijks study is to observe in what ways the powerful people implement express describe or conceal their ambition through context and discourse in particular he pays much attention to the role of ideology he had made amounts of media discourse surveys such as news report tv program and advertisement his purpose is to illustrate how western authorities control the form and content of discourse and further control the belief and ideology of society 200201 van dijks 2326 study news as discourse all of these studies give authors useful frameworks news schemata for analyzing any news story or report from any channel or newspaper the three discourse structures namely macrostructures superstructures and microstructures are crucial for the analysis of the selected news reports the macrostructure of discourse is thematic in other words macrostructure is the main subject or topic that is being discussed or described and on which the whole story is based on thematic analysis is concerned with the main theme or topic of a certain text topics and themes illustrate and uncover different social as well as psychological proportions of any text or news story 19 26 in news reports or stories the macrostructure is often expressed in the headline and the lead paragraph the superstructure is schematic it shows the main parts of a news story and the way it is arranged or organized the superstructures of a news story consist of three main parts they are introduction substance and conclusion the news story consists of an introduction represented by the first paragraph of the story a substance content the essence or the main story and a conclusion closing the last part the result or the outcome of a news story 2 26 the local structure of discourse is concerned with semantic syntactic stylistic and rhetorical aspects of a given text 2 it focuses on the selected lexical items words and sentences that are used to form a news story according to van dijk 26 a news story is not free from the following different aspects of meaning presuppositions implications inferences concealments euphemisms disclaiming denials blaming the victim negativization and in general the combined strategy of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation many of these semantic features involve various forms of implicitness or indirectness 177 all of such aspects of meaning within their hidden ideologies cannot be discovered without the help of the microstructure of discourse fig 1 van dijks 26 lists important questions that should be answered during the analysis of any text especially if the analysed text is a news storyhow is the topical information organized in the textwhat tends to be given prominence what information is presented first and what information lastwhich news schema categories are emphasized and why coronaviruses are a family of viruses that are found in animals and humans certain types cause illnesses in people some coronaviruses cause the common cold others cause diseases which are much more severe such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars both of which often lead to pneumonia on 30th january 2020 who declared the outbreak of covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern pheic 4 on 31 december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in wuhan hubei province china on 9 january 2020 chinas cdc reported a novel coronavirus as the main cause of this outbreak which is phylogenetically in the sars-cov clade the disease associated to it is now known as novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 8 most of the patients that are suffering from covid-19 are adults and old the main symptoms of the pandemic are fever dry cough and difficulties shortness in breathing 80 of covid-19 patients suffered from mild illness 14 experienced severe disease and 6 suffered from critical illness illness severity is associated with age over 60 s and other comorbid conditions 8 27 illustration of the ultrastructure of the covid-19 virus-cdcscience photo library 11 according to johns hopkins university and medicine 5 the pandemic has sickened more than six million and at least 369000 victims have died unfortunately numbers of infection and death are increasing in order to achieve the aim of the study it is important to give a clear description of the data that are used for the analysis the data are 4 news reports about coronavirus taken from two newspapers namely the new york times from the united sates and global times from china two news reports are analysed for each newspaper the study aims to show and prove how the virus has been used politically in the media the news reports are taken from the main websites of the selected news channels and newspapers the approach that is followed for the analysis is van dijks news schemata framework which is presented in detail in section two above the news reports are analysed according to the three main discourse structures namely the macrostructures superstructures and microstructures in terms of macrostructure the first report of the new york times has the following headline china clamps down on coronavirus coverage as cases surge undoubtedly headlines are crucial in showing the main themes or topics of a news story through the help of headlines one can understand what the stories are talking about starting with the first headline the phrasal verb clamps down means to stop or limit the activity of coronavirus outbreak the word surge means to move very quickly and suddenly in a particular direction one proposition that might emerge from this headline is that china is unable to stop the spread of the outbreak although china clamps down on coronavirus but it is moving and spreading faster another proposition which can be extracted is that chinas efforts to limit or stop the outbreak might not be real or effective in terms of superstructure the introduction of the first report presents the failure of the communist government to control the pandemic according to new york times the government cannot control the pandemic therefore it puts its efforts on the media to strengthen its propaganda of controlling the disease but the government control of the virus is just a narrative and a lie as the number of coronavirus infections in china continues to surge the communist government has clamped down on the news media and the internet signaling an effort to control the narrative about a crisis that has become a once-in-a-generation challenge for leaders in beijing the substance develops the first paragraph and gives more stories about the failure of the communist government in controlling the spread of the outbreak stories with more contextual details talk about the hundreds victims of the virus thousands of confirmed infections public frustration running across the country due to the governments weaknesses in controlling the pandemic and official media propaganda talks about virus relief efforts the government is presented negatively doing negative and irresponsible acts such as removing a range of articles talking about the shortcomings of the governments slow and weak response to the outbreak and reprimanding people who give factual cases of the illness the report emphasizes the lack of medical supplies and face mask production which are described as running short and in overdrive and shortage of testing kits the report also describes the government as weak relying on media to broadcast propaganda and positive stories on its efforts to contain the virus the conclusion ends with the scientists in china and their efforts to find a drug to stop the outbreak the microstructure deals with all the semantic syntactic lexical and rhetorical aspects of discourse and in this case a news report in terms of semantics more contextual details are devoted to the communist government and its inability to control the virus the report is full of propaganda fake positive stories regarding the government strength and potential in controlling the virus the number of the dead victims and confirmed cases the government propaganda its restrictions on media social media and freedom of speech are reported in details all of the stories that are related to the restrictions of internet platforms implicate and presuppose a totalitarian system of government in which a single authoritarian party controls state-owned means of production blaming the victim and division and contrast strategies are used clearly through the report the negative others representation is reported clearly through blaming the chinese government of shortcomings and restrictions in terms of syntax the structure of sentences illustrates the stories of the report clearly and coherently without any vagueness especially when the stories are related to the governments shortcomings in controlling the virus the number of the victims who lost their lives due to the pandemic and the confirmed new cases the new york times uses active voice and simple tenses in order to make events clear and deductive the news stories especially those that are related to the governments weaknesses and shortcomings in controlling the virus are written with complex sentences full of cohesive ties and conjunctions to describe the difficult and complex situation in china as supplies run short face mask production runs in overdrive the rapidly rising number of infections and deaths from the new virus has put renewed pressure on the senior leadership in china hospitals near the center of the epidemic have been overwhelmed and people with flulike symptoms have been turned away many cases have not been diagnosed because of a shortage of testing kits in terms of lexis all the report is negative and its language is critical criticizing the communist government and its inability to fight the virus negative words that carry strong connotations are used in the report words and phrases such as frustrations rigorously communism crisis fear shortcomings propaganda short shortage overdrive turned away forbidden blocked and gloom are clearly used in the report all of these words are used to negatively refer to the chinese government the prominent image of the chinese government is that of a communist-authoritarian one that uses its own ideologies and propaganda another image is that of deficient government incapable of controlling a virus and providing medical supplies and services to its people the prominent image of the chinese people is associated with frustration a deep chronic sense or state of insecurity and dissatisfaction arising from unsolved problems or unfulfilled needs in terms of rhetoric the phrase communist government has negative connotations it is associated with harshness and totalitarianism all the citizens should be totally subject to an absolute state authority in the report the communist government in china and its propaganda is highly emphasized propaganda is a symbol of manipulation control distortion half-truths or lies it is used to refer to the communist government in china repetition is used through the reports all the negative stories that are related to the shortcomings of the chinese government in controlling the pandemic and in providing medical services and peoples fears and frustrations due to the governments weaknesses are always repeated in the report in the second headline which is entitled coronavirus weakens chinas powerful propaganda machine the phrase chinas powerful propaganda machine is used to invite the reader to believe in the idea proposition that china is not really powerful and its power is just propaganda in the sense that it is unable to contain as well as overcome an unseen virus a very tiny and unseen virus manages to weaken its power another proposition can be emerged from this headline is that chinas power is just an illusion this illusion is made real by the official chinese media the superstructure of a news report looks on how the parts of the report namely the introduction the substance and the conclusion are arranged and which events are emphasized and given prominence the new york times gives more emphasis and prominence to the governments propaganda and totalitarianism the introduction comes under the title beijing is pushing tales of perseverance but many young people are openly questioning the communist partys message according to the new york times the perseverance of beijing is just a tale or fiction not an actual fact people in china do not believe or are frustrated with these fake tales of stability steadfastness and perseverance the substance again and again supports the introduction with different negative stories of failure rigidity and shortcomings the governments failure in controlling the virus is presented clearly in the reports beijing is tapping its old propaganda playbook as it battles the relentless coronavirus outbreak the problem for chinas leaders this time it isnt working so well in the new york times chinese government is always associated with rigidity hardness and severity it is a rigid system towards its people and medical staff it is also powerless unable to provide medical equipment and supplies the government was slow to disclose the threat of the coronavirus and worked to suppress the voices of those who tried to warn the country exhausted medical workers with faces lined from hours of wearing goggles and surgical masks women with shaved heads a gesture of devotion retirees who donate their life savings anonymously in government offices the conclusion ends with ms xia story whose weibo account has been suspended for 30 days for her epidemic-related posts and that she was determined to keep on speaking whatever censorship is the new york times finishes the report with a quotation for ms xia speak up as much as your courage allows she said in the end its better than saying nothing the microstructure uses semantic syntactic lexical and rhetorical tools to uncover hidden ideologies in news stories in terms of semantics the new york times again gives more contextual details to the governments propaganda that is used through its official media according to the new york times the government has gained nothing against the virus their achievements against the pandemic are just lies the report is full of stories related to the governments powerful propaganda as well as opposite stories related to the shortcomings and harsh-totalitarian treatment of medical staff consider this quotation beijing is tapping its old propaganda playbook as it battles the relentless coronavirus outbreak the biggest challenge to its legitimacy in decades state media is filling smartphones and airwaves with images and tales of unity and sacrifice aimed at uniting the people behind beijings rule it even briefly offered up cartoon mascots named jiangshan jiao and hongqi man characters meant to stir patriotic feelings among the young during the crisis blaming the victim and theme of negative other representation are clearly used in the report even the unity that state media call for is not meant to fight the pandemic but it is meant to unite the people behind beijing rule consider these quotations exhausted medical workers with faces lined from hours of wearing goggles and surgical masks women with shaved heads a gesture of devotion retirees who donate their life savings anonymously in government offices people are also angry about state media accounts of female medical workers who shave their heads although the idea of women shaving their heads has been repeated but the new york times does not mention the reason the purpose behind women shaving their heads remains vague division and contrast strategy also repeated in the report a contrast or comparison between the governments propaganda with its positive tales of unity and strength and the negative role of the government which is represented by its shortcomings and harsh treatment and censorship of people are mentioned repeatedly in the report in terms of syntax the structures of sentences are simple and clear anyone can understand the stories of the report especially those related to chinese propaganda negative and bad treatment of medical staff and women shortcomings of the government in controlling the outbreak and providing enough medical supplies all the basic elements of a good narrative are found in the report the report has orientation characterization and complication if we cant become a whistle-blower like li wenliang then lets be a person who can hear the whistle blowing yan lianke a novelist said in a lecture at hong kong university of science and technology in february the hot news sense of the perfect used in the new york times is remarkable the new york times uses perfect tense when it talks about sorrowful stories chinas propaganda spinners have some tough competition chinese people have seen images of a young woman crying mom mom as her mothers body was driven away theyve seen a woman banging a homemade gong from her balcony while begging for a hospital bed theyve seen an exhausted nurse breaking down and howling and they have all seen the face of li wenliang the doctor who tried to warn china about the very virus that killed him agency is used clearly in the report the new york times uses agency to highlight responsibility the government was slow to disclose the threat of the coronavirus and worked to suppress the voices of those who tried to warn the country beijing has intensified internet censorship in the past few weeks in terms of lexis the negative discourse or the image of negative other representation is clearly used in the report negative stories of the governments shortcomings in controlling the virus and in providing medical supplies and bad treatment of medical staff monitoring people suspending and deleting social accounts and posts that talk and provide information about the spread of the outbreak are clearly used in all the report the whole report is negative the new york times uses many negative words and phrases such as exhausted devotion problem criticizing harshly condemned lack scorn pressured funeral propaganda biggest challenges suppress young woman crying breaking down howling authoritarian government silencing faade of omnipotent government blatantly unbelievable angry confused people did not cheer intensified deleted suspended and tighter limits the prominent image of the chinese government is that of a totalitarian government with its people and medical staff another image of the chinese government is that it is always associated with shortage failure and deficiency the image of the people and medical workers are associated with confusion exhaustion fatigue and anger the image of women medical workers with shaved hair is associated with devotion and defeminization in terms of rhetoric the report is not free from metaphor that powerful tool that can be invested for ideological purposes chinas power is compared to a machine of propaganda this machine has been weakened by a very tiny virus the image of women with shaved hair is a symbol of devotion obedience and defeminization the new york times even questions whether shaving womens hair comes from complete satisfaction or under extreme pressure war metaphor is used in the sentence beijing is tapping its old propaganda playbook as it battles the relentless coronavirus outbreak beijing is compared to a force battling a relentless coronavirus outbreak this force is not fully equipped and arranged to fight such a heartless ruthless and dangerous enemy beijing is only equipped with false and exaggerated statements and ideas this cannot beat a dangerous enemy like corona and win the battle in terms of repetition governments propaganda has been repeated to emphasize that beijings power is just propaganda unable to fight a dangerous enemy like corona governments shortcomings in controlling the virus as well as providing medical supplies are also repeated many times in the report women with shaved hair are also repeated and it serves as a sign of devotion and obedience to the government the story of dr li wenliang and other people the first doctor who warned the people from the new novel coronavirus is repeated many times in the report as a sign to refer to the totalitarian system in china the crisis has exposed many people especially the young to troubling aspects of life under an authoritarian government in the silencing of people like dr li they see the danger in clamping down on free expression the repetition of cartoon mascots named jiangshan jiao lovely land the name of the girl comes from a line in a poem entitled snow by mao zedong how lovely is this land with her handsome male and hongqi man free spirited red flag his name also comes from a line in the poem according to the new york times the idea behind this carton is to broadcast tales of unity and sacrifice behind beijings rule in terms of macrostructure the first headline entitled us covid-19 numbers tip of iceberg is used to refer to the number of cases of coronavirus in the us the numbers are described as tip of iceberg according to global times the few numbers of covid-19 cases in the us are just tip of iceberg and that the huge mass of the iceberg will appear with the next coming days or weeks the headline implies the following proposition there is a much bigger iceberg beyond this small tip the superstructure of any discourse looks on how the events are arranged in terms of introduction substance and conclusion on one hand and what events are given more emphasis and prominent on the other the introduction illustrates that the us government and officials have harshly criticized chinas response to the coronavirus epidemic but then they have been caught under heavy fire for their response to the coronavirus outbreak in the country people are described as frustrated due to the rising numbers of new cases and the governments insufficient efforts to control the virus according to global times some americans have even dubbed the us governments response a national scandal that puts the fundamental interests of americans in jeopardy the substance obviously supports the introduction through giving many stories related to the governments slow response to the outbreak as well as the shortcomings in the healthcare system trumps administration is described as retarded and incompetence which has put many states in a state of emergency the us cdcs slow response is described as is politically driven totally ignoring the public interest testing in the us states is described as flawed the report also emphasized the fundamental contrast between chinas government responses to the outbreak with that of trumps administration china quickly responded adjusted measures to control the spread while the us response has now become shift-blame-tactics between the white house and us cdc some people in the us are described as worried about this new disease and its high contagiousness particularly as politicians are focused on campaigning for elections in november the conclusion ends with the importance of the chinese and us cooperation and the need for this cooperation as the two global powers can work together to overcome the outbreak the conclusion also emphasizes that the uss cdc should share information on developments in covid-19 and that it should provide regular reports to the world health organization in terms of microstructure the first microstructure strategy is semantics in terms of semantics more contextual details are given to trumps administration uss cdc weaknesses frustrated people and their worries due to the virus spread and insufficient american healthcare system the phrase tip of iceberg which is used to refer to the number of cases of covid-19 in the us implies that the numbers will increase with the next days the tip of iceberg presupposes that there will be an iceberg formed by people with covid-19 the sentence citizens are demanding full transparency from officials implies that the us officials are not giving the people accurate information regarding the number of people with covid-19 and the spread of the outbreak the sentence the uss cdc has stopped reporting the number of people tested for the novel coronavirus implies a sense of suspicion a feeling that something bad is likely or true the word some is mentioned 10 times in the report some is associated with vagueness sentences such as some have even dubbed the us governments response a national scandal that puts the fundamental interests of americans in jeopardy some projections came up with real numbers far higher than those reported are associated with an indefinite amount and unspecified number blaming the victim and contrast and division strategies are also used in the report the report is full of blaming blaming of the us insufficient responses and bungled efforts to control the virus the retarded response and incompetence of the trump administration the newspaper blames the us cdcs slow response describing it as politically driven and ignoring public interest division and contrast strategy is also used in the report global times compares between the sufficient response of the chinese government and the insufficient response of trumps administration to the outbreak in terms of syntax most of the stories of the report are written in the past simple tense the best tense for narrating stories the sentences are written clearly in active form passive voice is not used in the report global times also used the present perfect tense-the preferable tense for hot news events or stories trump administration has placed several states in a state of emergency cdc has stopped reporting the number of people tested for the novel coronavirus pneumonia most of the stories are supported by clear agency or characterization complication and orientation giving places and times consider this story robert murphy an infectious diseases professor in the us and executive director of the institute for global health at the northwestern university feinberg school of medicine told the global times in an email on wednesday that he agrees with those who say the cdc has been making the same mistakes as wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak which included narrow testing criteria slow testing speed and lack of testing capacity resulting in the delayed response in terms of lexis the prominent image of the us is associated with deficiency and insufficiency in providing testing kits and firm-decisive efforts to stop the pandemic spread the prominent image of people is associated with frustration wonder and worry about the disease citizens are also presented as powerful actors criticizing the countrys insufficient efforts to contain the virus politicians are busy with their election campaigns and do not want the disease to influence their polls the discourse of self and other is clearly used in the report the self discourse is always good and positive while the other discourse is always bad and negative china is represented as a positive country which is able to control the pandemic in contrast to the us the central government quickly stepped in and adjusted responding measures in contrast it has now become shift-blame-tactics between the white house and us cdc china is also described as a positive country ready to cooperate work together share responsibility and give advice consider this story wang guangfa a leading chinese respiratory expert at peking university first hospital in beijing urged the us cdc to share information on developments in the covid-19 outbreak in the us and take concrete steps to contain the spread of the virus with health departments of other major countries plagued by the virus and also provide regular reports to the world health organization in terms of rhetoric the phrase tip of iceberg is a metaphor meaning that there is a lot more of covid-19 cases than meets the eye in the sentence the us government and officials are caught under heavy fire for their response to the coronavirus outbreak in the country the heavy fire is a metaphor for fear rage and anger anger of the citizens due to the uss insufficient efforts repetition as an ideological rhetorical strategy is used to negatively represent the us the us government and trumps administration are repeated for their shortages in controlling the virus the uss cdc is repeated 18 times for its slowness and weaknesses in dealing with the pandemic people are repeated criticizing the governments slow response to the outbreak the image of fear and worry in people is also repeated in the report china is repeated positively giving advice and offering cooperation the second headline entitled us scrambles to tackle virus means that the us is unable to deal with a very tiny virus the headline is written in the present simple tense to make it more factual the verb scramble means to struggle with difficulty the us is struggling with a virus and this virus is not easy to deal with in terms of superstructure the introduction illustrates the factors that are hindering the white houses readiness for the virus the main two impediments are political factors and testing delay the introduction also puts more emphasis on western and american media which have harshly criticized chinas government response to the outbreak but it happened that the virus have crept to western countries due to their insufficient awareness and few control measures in place to check its spread the substance supports the introduction and gives many different stories on the causes that will jeopardize the virus-control work and undermine the fundamental interests of the american public such causes are finger-pointing partisan politics and presidential election in the report trump is described as having little understanding about the pandemic ill-preparation shortages of medical supplies flaws in the us healthcare system lack of consistent commitment and coordination unprofessional response lack of information transparency related to the disease and expensive american healthcare system are other causes which help increase the spread and the risk of the virus the report ends with a conditional conclusion that if the us fails to contain the viral spread it would be a heavy blow not only to the us itself but also to the worlds economic recovery the first microstructure strategy is semantics more stories supported by contextual details are given to the negative causes that allow the virus to spread in the us stories related to ill-preparation weaknesses in the political and administrative system and deficiencies in the uss cdc and healthcare system are the most prominent and emphasized stories in the whole report such negative stories are preferable and prominent the indefinite quantifier some is mentioned 6 times in the report although some is used to refer to indefinite number and amount it used in global times reports phrases such as some observers some raised questions some critics and some analysts are used in the report to give supports to the negative stories related to the shortcomings of the us government in dealing with the pandemic the quotation us president donald trump mistakenly described the patient who was a man in his 50 s as a wonderful women illustrates that global times always emphasizes confusion bewilderment and chaos in the us blaming the victim is clearly used in the report global times puts the blame on the us government under trumps administration and uss cdc for their shortages and ill-preparation regarding the spread of the outbreak in terms of syntax the report is clear and cohesive the sentence structure is presented clearly without vagueness active voice and agency are presented obviously in the report for no other purpose than to highlight the responsibility of the us government trump and uss cdc the newspaper does not use passive it seems that global times does not want to mitigate or hide the responsibility behind the spread of the virus in the us and the shortcomings and lack of medical supplies all such negative stories are highlighted and given more prominence in the report the report contains all the basic elements of a good narrative the report includes agency complications or different cohesive ties and conjunctions consider this quotation however us president donald trump mistakenly described the patient who was a man in his 50 s as a wonderful woman during a press conference while the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc later took the blame by claiming it mistakenly identified the patient as female in a briefing to trump and us vice president mike pence who is now overseeing the us federal governments response to the outbreak in terms of lexis the language of the report is negative full of negative stories and words powerful words and phrases with complex modifications and adjectives are widely used such as failure insufficient awareness few control measure finger-pointing partisan politics death ill-prepared cdcs faulty mass screenings highly possible shortages criticism flaws lack wrong loopholes lack of consistent commitment hasty and unprofessional response to the outbreak shortcomings failed raising fears overwhelmed problem slow response anxious the prominent image of the us and trump is associated with finger-pointing confusion lack of correct decisions loopholes shortcomings ill-preparation unprofessional and slow response to the outbreak the prominent image of people is associated with anxiety they are anxious as the facts are still unknown urging the us government to cope with the matter in a more responsible way in terms of rhetoric repetition is the most rhetorical device that is used in this report most of the negative stories are repeated in the report the uss government shortcomings in controlling the virus are repeated the uss cdc slow and unprofessional response to the disease is repeated the expensive american healthcare system is repeated peoples concerns about and criticism to the slow and weakness response of the government are also repeated undoubtedly data analysis proves that the pandemic which is known as covid-19 has been politicized and used ideologically in other words the two selected newspapers namely the new york times from the united states of america and global times from china politicized the pandemic to serve the interests and ideologies of the countries they represent both newspapers invested the three discourse structure namely macrostructure superstructure and microstructure ideologically in their reports the newspapers gave more emphasis and prominence to the negative stories related to the covid-19 new york times put more emphasis on the propaganda of the communist party in china its inability to control the spread of the outbreak its weaknesses in controlling the virus its shortcomings in providing medical supplies and its totalitarian treatment to the people and medical workers people are dissatisfied with the governments decisions and shortcomings global times also emphasized the negative stories related to covid-19 in the us the us government under trumps administration is weak and slow in its response to the virus the uss cdc is described as slow and unprofessional in its response to the outbreak negative stories related to the lack of testing kits and medical supplies are repeated and emphasized in the reports people are angry and anxious due to the governments slow response american expensive healthcare system and weaknesses are also repeated and given more prominence the article recommends that the whole world should work together for peace safety and security pandemics and epidemics do not know borders or china or united states such deadly diseases do not distinguish between a christian a jew a muslim or an atheist they also do not distinguish between an american asian or european therefore we should work together to save ourselves and the next coming generations     the sars-cov-2 coronavirus henceforth the coronavirus outbreak has led to governments imposing strict restrictions on individual liberty in order to prevent the spread of this highly contagious and virulent pathogen such measures have included the closure of businesses travel restrictions isolation of confirmed cases and the quarantine of individuals who have been exposed to the virus whilst no-one should doubt the urgency of the situation prompted by the coronavirus pandemic the extension of emergency powers naturally raises concerns about whether their use will be compatible with human rights law individuals who wish to raise a legal objection to the use of restrictive measures that are sufficiently severe to constitute a deprivation of liberty may be able to do so by appealing to human rights law in europe for example they may appeal to one of the various statutes that incorporate the european convention of human rights ehcr into domestic law however even human rights law does not afford complete precedence to the individuals right to liberty in the context of public health although  proceedings 13 the act will expire 2 years after it is enacted unless certain conditions are met as outlined in section 90 14 and its provisions will be subject to parliamentary review at 6-month intervals 15 schedule 21 of the ca extends the existing pha powers to control infectious disease in the specific context of the coronavirus in doing so it expands upon the governments initial extension of these powers issued in the health protection the powers with which i shall be concerned here all share in the fact that they are subject to three conditions first the powers are only authorised in a declared transmission control period such a period may be declared when the transmission of coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health in england and the powers outlined in the schedule will be an effective way of delaying or preventing significant further transmission 17 the uk declared the beginning of a transmission control period on 10 th february 2020 in accordance with the extant health protection coronavirus regulations at that time 18 this condition should go some way to mitigating the eges concern that the states extended power to restrict liberty in emergency coronavirus legislation will come to constitute a new normal however i shall return to this point in the conclusion second the individual exercising the power in question over a person must have -reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is or potentially infectious ibid 243  19 ibid schedule 21 s61 s71 s81b s131b s141b s155a finally the powers must only be exercised if it is considered to be both necessary and proportionate to do so either in the best interests of the person for the protection of other people or for the maintenance of public health 20 notice that this echoes key criteria of the european court of human rights interpretation of the scope of the public health exception which i shall explore further in the next section the ca extends the power to control infectious diseases in relation to the coronavirus beyond local jops as per the pha thereby centralising an important set of powers in the current pandemic under the ca public health officers now have the power to impose restrictive measures i shall discuss the definition of such officers below having first outlined their powers the restrictions that public health officers may impose under the ca include among other things the removal of a person to a place suitable for screening and assessment 21 once a person has been taken to a suitable place for screening and assessment they may also require that the person remain at that place for a period not exceeding 48 hours 22 and that they be screened and assessed 23 if screening either confirms that i the individual is infected or contaminated with the coronavirus or ii if the screening was inconclusive or iii if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person remains infectious then public health officers may exercise further powers 24 amongst others they may under paragraph 14 3 detain a person in a specified place for a specified period and keep them in isolation from others during that period 25 in exercising these particular powers the public health officer must have regard to the persons wellbeing and personal circumstances 26 and the period of detention cannot exceed 14 days 27 however under paragraph 15 5 if a public health officer suspects that the person will be potentially infectious at the end of that 14-day period then they may extend the period for which that person will be detained for a further specified period 28 any form of detention beyond the initial 14-day period must be reviewed at least once daily by a public health officer and revoked if the individual is no longer found to be infectious 29 furthermore this further specified period may not exceed 14 days if the restriction in question is simply detaining someone in a specified place crucially though the act explicitly states that this supplementary 14-day limit to the extension of a restriction does not apply to a requirement that a person remain in a specified place in isolation from others 30 in addition to extending the above powers to designated public health officers the ca also extends considerable powers to police constables and immigration officers in the course of exercising any of their functions although they must consult a public health officer prior to exercising these powers to the extent that it is practicable to do so 31 a police constable or immigration officer may direct or remove a potentially infectious person to a place that is suitable for assessment and screening 32 they may also detain a person at that place until a public health officer can exercise the functions outlined above 33 a police constable may detain a person for 24 hours extendable by a further 24 hours if it is not reasonably practicable for a public health officer to exercise their function within the initial period and if authorised by a senior officer whilst an immigration officer may detain a person for 3 hours extendable by a further 9 hours if comparable conditions are met 34 there are two particularly noteworthy aspects of the cas extension of powers first it extends the power to detain individuals to authorities who may lack professionally recognised public health expertise this is most obviously true of police constables and immigration officers who may impose time-limited detentions however it is also striking to consider the definition of public health officers under the ca in this context a public health officer can be 28 ibid schedule 21 s155 29 ibid schedule 21 s157-8 30 ibid schedule 21 s156 this states except in the case of a requirement referred to in paragraph 143e requirement to remain in isolation the further period specified under subparagraph 5 may not exceed 14 days 31 ibid schedule 21 s75 s13 8 32 ibid schedule 21 s7 33 ibid schedule 21 132 34 ibid schedule 21 s131-5  article 51 the human rights act 1998 requires that legislation passed in the uk must be compatible with the echr 43 there is considerable scope for tension between the human rights act and the ca powers outlined above however whether these powers fall afoul of the human rights act with respect to article 5 rights will depend on at least two things first it will depend on whether the restrictions imposed are sufficiently severe to constitute a deprivation of liberty of the sort that engages article 5 rights  the question of whether deprivations of liberty authorised by the ca would be in accordance with requirements of domestic law might appear moot as long as the procedures for such deprivations outlined by the ca are followed then the use of such measures would thus be in accordance with domestic law 53 however elements of the ca might be challenged on the grounds that they may run the risk of failing the principle of legal certainty championed in the enhorn judgments exploration of the applicants argument regarding compliance of his detention with domestic law the reason for this is that the ca does not specify a limit to the period for which a potentially infectious person may be detained in isolation albeit subject to daily review after 14 days of course we should not fetishize time limitsthe foreseeability of the application of a power should be assessed in the broad context of the legislation as a whole including its procedural safeguards so even if martin was correct to raise this objection with respect to the lack of time limits in the version of public health act that was operative in 2006 the ca outlines extensive procedural safeguards regarding the imposition of any restriction that might plausibly constitute a deprivation of liberty including daily review a simple appeals process that can occur in a magistrate court rather than requiring judicial review and indeed specified time-limits for many such restrictions 54 furthermore there may also be good reasons for refraining from specifying a specific time period for such deprivations in the case of an emerging pandemic there is a great deal that we do not know about the sars-cov-2 coronavirus including how long an individual may remain infectious after recovery 55 nonetheless the fact that the ca and the regulations before it neglect to include a specified limit on isolation is particularly striking for two reasons first 53 there has however already been a case in which a conviction has been overturned because of the inappropriate application of schedule 21 powers 54 hm government the coronavirus act schedule 21 s17  as detailed above the ca makes explicit reference to the need for restrictions of liberty to be both necessary and proportionate it is therefore important to first acknowledge that the ca includes provisions for weaker measures that might be implemented prior to the imposition of compulsory quarantine or isolation for instance paragraph 143 of the ca authorizes inter alia the imposition of requirements to provide information andor contact details to a public health officer accordingly martins concern that the 1984 public health act restrictions might fail the european courts necessity condition because it afforded few opportunities for less restrictive measures than quarantine and isolation is at least partly mitigated in the ca not to mention the revised pha 56 nonetheless despite its commitment to proportionality and necessity features of the ca raise doubts about whether deprivations of liberty imposed in its name will always satisfy these conditions to see why it is important to acknowledge that a number of things must be the case if a deprivation of liberty is to be both necessary and proportionate assessments of proportionality in this context aim to establish whether there is a fair balance between the cost of depriving an individual of their right to liberty both in terms of the subjects article 51 rights and potentially others and the need to ensure the outcome that has been achieved by doing so 57 in enhorn the european 56 martin the exercise of public health powers in cases of infectious disease 139 court further claimed that in assessing the lawfulness of detaining a person to prevent the spread of infectious disease a deprivation will only be proportionate if that infectious disease is dangerous to public health or safety 58 the view that is implicit here is that it is only in such circumstances that will there be a public health benefit of sufficient magnitude to outweigh the moral cost of depriving an individual of their in order to assess whether a deprivation of liberty is necessary in this way we must be able to assess whether the imposition of weaker restrictions would fail to sufficiently safeguard public health as such we must be able to assess whether the putative subject of a deprivation of liberty will likely pose a transmission risk that could lead to significant harm in the absence of that deprivation accordingly the greater vigilance that the ca affords by extending the power to impose significant restrictions of liberty beyond the public health consultants authorized by the previous regulations arguably evinces a tension with its commitment to ensure such deprivations are both necessary and proportionate extraordinary times can call for emergency legislation with extraordinary measures hover it is crucial that the measures we invoke to battle the coronavirus pandemic are compatible with human rights does not wholly obviate the concern articulated in the eges statement on the ethical implementation of restrictive measures in the present pandemic as quoted in the introduction to this paper more specifically we must be vigilant to ensure that the precedent set by the extension of powers necessitated by the present pandemic in the ca does not automatically translate to a new normal of eroded rights and liberties in the aftermath of the current crisis in future legislative change 65 the extended powers that are now in place are far less likely to be justifiable in the absence of the imminent threat posed by the coronavirus finally we may observe that the various legal instruments discussed here do not engage with what may prove to be a human rights question that public health responses to the coronavirus pandemic may soon provoke a great deal of research is currently being performed to search for a vaccine that will afford protection against the devastating effects of covid-19 indeed the development of an effective vaccine is a possible contender for an exit-strategy from the widespread public health restrictions that are currently enforced across the world in that context is important to note that neither the regulations nor the ca authorize the imposition of compulsory treatment including vaccination in response to the coronavirus moreover the pha does not authorize a jop to authorize such treatment and explicitly prohibits future regulations from including such provisions the question of compulsory vaccination raises salient human rights questions that i cannot address here potentially engaging the right to freedom of religion art 9 freedom of expression art 10 right to private life art 8 and possibly the right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment art 3 however if a vaccine proves to be the most viable exit strategy from our current predicament the pandemic may yet require us to confront the question of whether compulsory vaccination could be a necessary and proportionate response to this public health threat and how far we might be willing to revise existing limits to regulations that the secretary of state may make in response to a pandemic threat   the uk covid-19 response a behavioural irony anne-lise sibony  the diversity of responses to the covid-19 outbreak across countries both internationally and within the european union eu is considerable and the lack of a coordinated response at the eu level is being criticised 1 within this natural experiment involving different national policies possibly the most strikingly distinct path is the one initially chosen by the uk and in which the netherlands is persevering instead of trying to avoid contamination as much as possible though drastic measures such as early lockdown the strategy is to encourage herd immunity 2 in the uk this initial policy choice was presented as being based on both epidemiology and behavioural sciences 3 behavioural fatigue a little-known phrase not found in the most comprehensive textbook 4 suddenly rose to probably shortlived fame 5 the suggestion was that

httpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfree2020mar16social-distancing-coronavirusstay-home-government lockdown would be ineffective in the netherlands the prime minister announced similarly relaxed rules about social distancing and though he did not explicitly refer to any behavioural input it is nonetheless highly likely that there was one 6 the initial moves of both of these governments met with scepticism and appeared shocking to many the association between behavioural input in the policy decision and the decision to let the virus spread by refraining from ordering lockdown is unfortunate but it is there how could a government rely merely on nudges in the face of grave danger observers legitimately asked 7 while no government relies merely on nudges even the netherlands has ordered schools and bars to close this particular episode in the unfolding worldwide coronavirus saga gives behaviourally minded analysts pause it is worth considering the proper place of behavioural insights in the difficult policy choices at hand trying to eradicate the virus through comprehensive lockdown suppression has the advantage that it appears to work as far as one can tell it seems to have worked in china 8 it has the drawback that is it hugely costly for the economy and that the number of cases will still be large enough to overwhelm even well-resourced health systems 9 this means not only that many people will die including overworked and exposed health professionals but also that morally unpleasant choices will have to be made in addition it may be necessary to prolong lockdown for months or repeat it many times over if a new wave of infection occurs as soon as measures are relaxed which is entirely likely in the absence of herd immunity 10 mitigation on the other hand aims to create precisely such herd immunity it consists in limiting isolation to groups most at risk of developing severe symptoms and letting the virus infect large sections of the remaining population the social and economic disruption is more limited with this strategy but it has the drawback that people most at risk might be misidentified thus causing deaths that could have been avoided with more drastic 6 this is not only a presumption based on the fact that the dutch government is among the most behaviourally aware in the eu but more specifically because the dutch national institute for public health and the environment whose role it is to advise the government enjoys in-house expertise on behavioural change among both senior and junior staff 7 the term nudge has been popularised by rh thaler and cr sunstein nudge improving decisions about health wealth and happiness new haven ct yale university press 2008 who define it as any aspect of the choice architecture that alters peoples behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives for helpful clarifications and a more precise definition see pg hansen the measures importantly it is also irreversible after the virus has spread widely isolation will not be as effective as it would have been in the early stages as the economist sums up the bitter truth is that mitigation costs too many lives and suppression may be economically unsustainable 11 indeed it has been estimated when then choice was made to go for herd immunity that 80 of the uk population would be infected plausibly resulting in half a million deaths 12 on the other hand the french national statistical institute has calculated that production dropped by 35 because of the lockdown 13 which means that each month of this policy costs three points of annual gdp 14 choosing the right policy in these circumstances is challenging for many reasons starting with a multifaceted knowledge problem we have only partial knowledge of the virus of exactly how it spreads and how immunity builds up or what existing drugs could help there is neither enough data 15 nor enough time to conduct serious cost-benefit analyses leaving aside ethical concerns about the utilitarian morality underpinning such analyses and the reluctance to put a price tag on lives 16 even risk analysis seems to have been neglected in addition to all that we do not know there are logistical constraints pertaining to the production of protective equipment sanitising gel or ventilators there are conflicting values and some trade-offs are becoming increasingly salient such as balancing health and privacy 17 finally the epidemic does not shut down politics just recall how france held the first round of municipal elections during the first week of lockdown after the president gave in to the opposition of the president of the senate 18 or how prime minister orbn is using the virus to advance his political agenda of an ever-tighter grip over hungarian institutions 19 in addition to scientific uncertainties painful trade-offs and economic and logistical constraints policy-makers also have to reckon with behavioural factors quite obviously citizens behaviour affects how the virus spreads getting people to behave in certain ways can literally save lives in other words the stakes have never been so high when it comes to incorporating behavioural insights into policy design yet getting things right is a tall order as the behaviour changes needed are farreaching but also because governments are under intense pressure to make decisions fast under several veils of uncertainty and in a context characterised by both rational fear of experts and irrational optimism of citizens many of whom feel they are not personally at risk all of these circumstances offer fertile ground for biases and errors in the absence of treatment or a vaccine the only way to slow down the progression of the virus is changing behaviour such change needs to occur in connection with deliberate behaviour such as going out or washing ones hands with conscious but habitual behaviour such as greeting people or standing close to them and with mostly unconscious behaviour such as touching ones face 20 initiating rapid behavioural change on a massive scale is not the usual business of governments nor is the regulation of micro-social interaction in principle the purpose of law yet in the absence of a vaccine and amid controversies on the efficacy of available drugs non-pharmaceutical interventions are initially the single most important tools to try and protect populations health leaving aside the indirect health risks generated by loss of income over time 21 things are rapidly evolving some governments have allowed use of existing antiviral drugs in hospitals a french court has recently ordered health authorities to stock up on such drugs 22 and a vaccine may be within reach 23 yet it remains that behavioural factors are crucial and there is little doubt that this dimension has a place in policy design broadly speaking the context is favourable to such an approach as governments in many parts of the world have been increasingly turning to behavioural expertise over the past decade 24 the 2019 nobel prize in economic sciences has been given to researchers who have demonstrated the potency of seemingly modest interventions to 20 such unconscious behaviours are hardest to tackle httpswwwbiteamblogshow-to-stop-touching-our-facesin-the-wake-of-the-coronavirus 21 improve health and well-being using randomised controlled trials the same experimental methodology as is recommended to test and adapt behavioural interventions 25 in addition and despite controversies among academics about libertarian paternalism preliminary empirical evidence suggests that europeans like nudges when they approve of the underlying policy aim and if governments adhere to the basic rules of good governance of nudging 26 data are as yet lacking as to whether these findings also apply to uk politicians 27 against this backdrop why did the initial announcement of behaviourally inspired interventions run up against strong criticism in the present context 28 to clarify the objection was not directed against adopting behaviourally inspired measures per se it was about not adopting at the time strict social distancing measures the critique was also not directed at the specific behavioural recommendations that were issued such as advice on how to stop touching ones face 29 or how best to nudges people to wash their hands effectively 30 such recommendations cost very little and can go some way in the right direction certainly no one objects to them the objection was that behavioural arguments that were presented as supporting the decision to wait rather than adopt drastic measures were ill-founded the fear that behavioural fatigueas the uk government called itmight kick in and undermine the effectiveness of a lockdown as people would start violating the recommendation to stay home may be intuitively plausible but behavioural scientists said is not a documented behavioural phenomenon 31 life-saving lockdown based on the mere intuition that people may get tired of it simply is not good enough it is not evidence-based behavioural policy-making importantly it is not clear why behavioural fatigue was singled out given that other better-documented behavioural phenomena mightwith equally unknown probability and distributionbe at work and either fuel or counteract it 32 besides behavioural fatigue non-compliance with social distancing measures could be the result of the optimism bias which can lead people to believe they are less likely to acquire a disease 33 another potential cause of non-compliance with stay-at-home exhortations is reactance that is an appetite for doing the opposite of what we are told when we feel our freedom of choice is being limited clearly the baseline level of reactance in a population is a cultural trait anecdotal evidence suggests for example that it is lower in belgium than in france where parisians flocked en masse to their vacation homes the day before lockdown elbowing their way through crowded train stations to packed tgvs increases or decreases in reactance from the baseline level are plausibly influenced by how politicians and other public figures behave 34 in that regard it is striking how boris johnson donald trump or emmanuel macron undermined the official message of social distancing by publicly shaking hands attending meetings or visiting factories while angela merkel and sophie wilms the belgian prime minister led by example from the beginning reactance can be mitigated by targeting different subgroups 35 such as young people which some governments have done through social media campaigns highlighting that caring for elders is cool reactance can also be mitigated by involving citizens in policy development 36 while this might prima facie seem difficult in an emergency situation it is also true that disastrous communication causes deaths and taking a little bit of time to help officials grasp the moods in the population might in fact be time well spent on the other hand behavioural fatigue might be offset by fear of the disease fear is known to be a powerful motivator though here again we lack data that are directly relevant to the current context 37 importantly sound behavioural arguments in favour of enforcing lockdown and social distancing through law rather than mere recommendations seem to have received too little consideration first we all hold conflicting voices in our minds the voice of quick intuitive emotional decisions wants us to go and see friends and the voice of reasoned decision that weighs pros and cons rationally and argumentatively will suggest that this is not reasonable and we know which one usually wins this is known as dual process theory 38 this is why it is a good idea to take decisions as to whether or not to see friends off peoples shoulders 39 once stay at home is the law rather than a recommendation voluntary compliance could be the result of citizens recognising the expressive function of the law 40 this may be a more reliable mechanism than reliance on social norms where the social norm is not well established 41 in other words there are behavioural phenomena that go in different directions and we simply do not know enough about these behavioural trade-offs 42 quite possibly individual differences are large and the net effect of these phenomena depends at least in part on demographics by way of illustration a belgian survey suggests that 25 of the population and as much as 44 of 18-21-year-olds do not observe the social distancing measures 43 in truth the behavioural and social sciences help formulate many hypotheses of what psychological and social levers might drive risky behaviour but no hard evidence that is directly policy-relevant making behavioural fatigue uniquely salient to justify a minimalist policy simply seems random why then did behavioural fatigue have the honour of featuring as policy justification could the focus on an obscure and undocumented behavioural phenomenon which may well exist nonetheless be an instance of group reinforcement in the decisional process the 2018 behavioural insights team bit report behavioural government the uk nudge units manual for de-biasing governments explains that this form of groupthink happens when people self-censor and conform to the group majority view 44 did herd immunity emerge as the best candidate for consensus among medical experts might it have received a subtle cultural push brits keep calm and carry on was the time pressure so strong that whatever would appear to bring the voice of behavioural insights in line with other disciplines represented in the expert group got picked out the fact that there was no response to the open letter from nonplussed behavioural scientists does suggest that this was not the best that the behavioural approach can offer to policy-making in general or to covid-19 response in particular the uk nudge unit may have deserved a taste of its own medicine but it should be recognised that evidenced-based policy-making is exceptionally difficult to deliver when there are precious few data and no time to gather evidence another explanation for the initial choice of herd immunity over early lockdown is the framing effect in a famous experiment that uniquely resonates with the current context kahneman and tversky showed that decisions about risks are influenced by how the choice is framed 45 in this experiment subjects were told that a community faced an unusual asian disease that was expected to kill 600 people to combat the disease the first group could choose between two options option a consisted in a treatment that would ensure 200 people would be saved and option b in a treatment that had a 33 chance of saving all 600 but a 67 chance of saving none option a was the clear winner chosen by 72 of subjects a second group was presented with the same choice but framed differently this group had to choose between option c which would result in only 400 people dying and option d characterised by a 33 chance that nobody would perish and a 67 chance that all 600 would die this time 72 favoured option d this is puzzling because option d is equivalent to option b in other words when the same choice between a certain option and a probabilistic one with identical expected utility was framed differently peoples risk preferences were reversed in the positive framing number of lives saved in options a and b subjects preferred certainty but in the negative framing number of deaths in options c and d they were willing to take risks it has been shown that politicians are not immune to framing effects they too are willing to take more risks to avoid deaths than to save lives even though numbers make the options equivalent 46 in the current context we constantly hear and read about the death toll of the virus the framing is clearly negative prospect theory predicts that this will lead to more risk-taking alas the initial decisions to delay strict social distancingwhether dressed up or not in behavioural argumentsmay illustrate this prediction we are living through a natural experiment nation-states worldwide and throughout europe have developed different policy responses to the covid-19 pandemic ranging from locked-up french and spaniards to free-range swedes within the coming months evidence will show which strategies were most effective cost-efficient and socially accepted but this is also an example of how governments can misuse behavioural arguments and tarnish a reputation for sound evidence-based policy-making those in europe who have applied behavioural insights most effectively

 after reading this text individuals responded to four dependent measures measured on a seven-point scale ranging from strongly disagree 1 to strongly agree 7 the first is a behavioral intention question  i will wear a mask every time i leave my home the next two are attitudinal questions  it is best for society if everyone wears a mask when they leave their home and i dont think wearing a mask will impact the spread of the coronavirus a final question asking participants whether they would like to get more information about purchasing face masks was asked as a yes or no question to better get at behavior rather than behavioral intention these analyses follow a pre-analysis plan registered with open science framework osf at httpsosfiogbpnq recall that both hypotheses are conditional on ideology  promotion messages should work better with liberals and prevention messages better with conservatives three sets of analyses were pre-registered in this plan since rft predictions about ideology focus primarily on direction of ideology rather than strength choma busseri and sadava 2009 i first separate ideology between liberals and conservatives ideology was asked on the standard american national election study anes seven-point scale allowing respondents to select responses ranging from very conservative to very liberal with an option for respondents to select that they havent thought much about this those who report their ideology as moderatemiddle of the road or respond that they havent thought much about this are excluded from analysis respondents who answer very conservative conservative or somewhat conservative are coded as conservative while those who answer very liberal liberal or somewhat liberal will be coded as liberal this creates a dichotomous measure of ideology with individuals coded as either liberal 1 or conservative 0 this measure is then interacted with each of the treatments with the control group serving as reference of course rft provides relatively unclear predictions about how strength of ideology might impact the power of these types of messages on attitudes and behaviors as an additional set of analyses i interact the full ideological measure ranging from very conservative to very liberal with the treatments rather than the dichotomous measure this allows for the inclusion of ideological moderates in these analyses but still requires excluding those who do not place themselves on the ideological scale as a last set of analyses i examine these relationships conditional on a match between a participants stated partisanship and the partisanship of their governor given that recent work finds that individuals are less likely to comply with measures when they do not share partisanship with their governor cornelson and miloucheva 2020 while there is little theory available to suggest that types of messages might interact with this it is an important exploratory analysis given the findings of cornelson and miloucheva 2020 which are directly related to covid-19 this will create a three-way interaction between the treatments respondent ideology and respondent co-partisanship with their states governor individual partisanship is based off of the standard two-pronged anes partisanship question including partisan leaners this is matched with an individuals self-reported state of residence and the partisanship of the current governor of that state given that this research design relies upon an observed moderator of ideology i include controls for observed covariates kam and trussler 2017  age gender race education and whether a respondent has a co-partisan governor or not since research shows this affects compliance with covid-19 related regulations cornelson and miloucheva 2020 the results of the first set of analyses based on a binary ideological indicator are presented graphically in figure 1

 the results for a moderation by the seven-point ideological measure are available in figure 2 while the results for moderation by both ideology and gubernatorial co-partisanship are presented in figure 3 all regression models are available in the appendix supplementary material 

 

 

 as shown in figure 1 interesting though primarily null results emerge there are no differences between treatments for anyone on the intention to buy mask measure  individuals were equally likely across treatment groups and ideologies to request information on where to purchase a mask the behavioral intention variable however shows that the promotion message has an effect on desire to wear a mask however contrary to expectations this does not increase the willingness of liberals but decreases the willingness of conservatives to wear a mask relative to both the control and prevention message similar patterns emerge for the attitudinal measures  liberals are not affected significantly by the treatments but conservatives are less likely to see the benefit of masks and more likely to believe they will not impact the spread when exposed to the promotion message compared to the control and the prevention message these results are substantively similar though a bit more difficult to digest and less statistically precise the gap between treatments still tends to dampen for liberals and is larger for conservatives but does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance it appears however that the effect of messages is more conditional upon direction of ideology rather than strength as no major differences in treatment effects emerge for strong and slight conservatives these results show little difference based on shared partisanship with ones governor for conservatives  regardless of partisanship of a conservative respondents governor they respond to the messages in similar fashion and the promotion message still seems to dampen their compliance with and favorability of the mask wearing measure for liberals however a different pattern emerges in line with expectations from rft when liberals are exposed to the promotion message their attitudes toward mask wearing change compared to the other messages dependent upon their governors partisanship liberals are more likely to believe that wearing masks is best for society and is less likely to believe that it will not impact the spread of coronavirus when exposed to the promotion message but only when their governor shares their partisanship these differences disappear when their governor does not share their partisanship these analyses find little support for how rft can inform our messaging about mask wearing during the covid-19 crisis while messages related to prevention seem to have no impact on behaviors and attitudes toward wearing facial masks regardless of individual ideology promotion related messages do have some impact though in unpredicted ways rft argues that liberals should be more receptive to promotion messages and i find some very limited support of this prediction respond positively to promotion messages under a specific condition  that they share partisanship with their states governor however the most consistent effects occur with conservatives showing less support for mask wearing when exposed to the promotion message  a finding not in line with predictions which predict that conservatives should not be affected differently by this message than the control message why are prevention messages no more or less effective than a purely information message while this study is unable to examine the exact mechanism perhaps prevention messages simply do not work in this context official and unofficial messaging about the covid-19 crisis has heavily focused on prevention  flattening the curve is about stopping and slowing infections an inherently prevention focused message perhaps the focus on prevention messages in general has rendered additional information about prevention moot or perhaps individuals think of the mask wearing recommendation as prevention message by default in general this provides little support for targeting prevention and promotion messages based on ideology as rft would suggest related to mask wearing in response to the covid-19 crisis it seems that generally control messaging without a promotion or prevention cue and prevention messaging work equally well at promoting pro-mask attitudes and behaviors while a difference emerges related to promotion messaging it is unexpected and not in line with rft predictions serving to dampen support from conservatives further work should examine this unexpected finding to determine whether it is specifically related to the covid-19 crisis or if it broadly extends to how conservatives receive promotion focused messages this leaves policy recommendations a bit muddled  to the extent there is an impact it is that promotion messages make conservatives less complaint this suggests that a purely informational message without an additional prod may be the most effective strategy  since the evidence here provides little support for rft theories of ideological differences in response to messaging about mask wearing during the covid-19 crisis it is likely easiest to provide a straightforward message  practical strategies for a safe and effective delivery of aerosolized medications to patients with covid-19 arzu ari   the covid-19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly across the globe it has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected persons cough or sneeze 1 exhaled droplets from infected patients with covid-19 can deposit in the noses mouths and eyes of people nearby they can also be inhaled into the lungs and leads to respiratory illness such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome although aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure used to treat pulmonary diseases at home and healthcare settings it has a potential for fugitive emissions during therapy due to the generation of aerosols and droplets as a source of respiratory pathogens fugitive emission is defined as aerosols that have been released from the aerosol device during patient expiration it is also medical aerosols that are not inhaled by the patient but passes into the atmosphere according to previous studies the particle size of fugitive emissions ranges from 0860 to 1437 m and up to 50 of the generated aerosol during therapy was fugitive aerosol remain airborne in the indoor environment for several hours 2 3 4 5 6 the device interface patient type and flow rate affect the quantity and characteristics of the fugitive emissions while the dimensions and layout of the room air turbulence airflow rates and temperature impact dispersion and decay 478 in a recent in vitro study a home attending healthcare worker was simulated with a manikin using a facemask that was placed at three different distances the findings of this study showed that total aerosol concentration ranged from 0002 to 010 mgm3 depending on the distance of the manikin relative to the aerosol source 9 although previous studies showed an increase in the quantity of aerosol concentration in the ambient air it is important to note that they are in vitro studies that cannot differentiate medical aerosol from bioaerosol while bioaerosols are generated by patients medical aerosols are produced by aerosol devices it is clear that covid-19 is spread by droplets generated as bioaerosols also it has been reported that aerosol transmission of sars-cov-2 is plausible because the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours 1011 for instance most of the contamination seems to be from surfaces where the droplets settle and persist for up to a week that is why dispersion distance of aerosols is such an important point if a patient coughs without a mask the dispersion is much wider than wearing a simple mask and it is safer for the healthcare workers to be within 3 feet the studies conducted by hui et al identified dispersion distances depending on the aerosol generating procedures and the intervention like mask over cannula 12 13 14 15 16 therefore the radius of risk associated procedures can offer some guidance for healthcare professionals at the bedside delivering aerosolized medications to patients with covid-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus this has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild- sub-intensive and intensive-patients with covid-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy 
aerosol therapy in mild-patients with covid-19 while aerosol therapy is a critical and integral part of the clinical management of patients with pulmonary diseases it increases the droplet generation and risk of disease transmission therefore it is crucial to avoid unnecessary aerosol drug delivery to patients with covid-19 according to previous research patients with asthma have a risk for other coronaviruses such as middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection and have a potential risk for covid-19 17 however in spontaneously breathing patients with copd or asthma the routine use of aerosolized medications is essential to keep the disease symptoms under control while some reports have suggested avoiding the use of corticosteroids during the covid-19 pandemic it is important to note that the reports were made based on data obtained in hospitalized patients with covid-19 who had a poor response to systemic corticosteroids after the onset of the disease therefore the global initiative for asthma gina recommends using prescribed inhaled corticosteroids to prevent the worsening of asthma and the serious consequences of asthma attacks 18 also there is a lack of information on the risk of patients taking oral or inhaled corticosteroids for asthma control or risk of poor outcomes from coronavirus in mild-patients with covid-19 who are awake and can perform specific breathing techniques with inhalers clinicians should consider using pressurized metered-dose inhalers pmdis and dry powder inhalers dpis for aerosol drug delivery instead of nebulizers it is essential to use a valved-holding chamber with pmdis during treatment also priming before first use pmdi actuation at the beginning of inspiration hand breath coordination inhalation with low inspiratory flows and breath-hold is vital for the efficiency of pmdi since dpis are breath-actuated inhalers clinicians should emphasize the specific inspiratory flow needed to draw medication from the device and disperse the particles thus patients can operate the dpi correctly and receive therapeutic benefit from the drug however patients with acute respiratory failure may not generate the adequate inspiratory flow needed for the specific dpi used for treatment in addition if the inhaler increases cough other alternatives should be pursued using nebulizers with a mouthpiece or high flow nasal cannula should be considered in such cases unlike inhalers nebulizers can deliver a variety of drug formulations that may be needed for patients with covid-19 although conventional jet nebulizers are commonly used to deliver aerosolized medications they may also spew 23 of the emitted aerosol into the ambient environment 19 20 21 in this case healthcare providers are exposed not only the inhaled medications but also to the droplets from the patients airways and lungs in addition the driving gas up to 10 lmin can increase the dispersion of both medical and bioaerosols if aerosols generated with nebulizers carry the virus during exhalation and transmit it to the hospital environment health care providers and other patients are under the risk of infection recently some companies manufacturing jet nebulizers provided filters to use with their device in the treatment of patients with covid-19 while the placement of a filter to the nebulizer was 93 effective in capturing exhaled aerosol droplets 22 and will reduce second hand exposure of aerosol medication to health care professionals 2324 the efficiency of these filters in preventing the transmission and the magnitude of the risk acquiring coronavirus through filtered nebulizers are not fully known also current publications on fugitive emissions are based on in vitro studies that may not be a true representative of a real exhalation in coronavirus infected patients using the high-efficiency particulate air hepa filters with nebulizers might be a good option during aerosol drug delivery to patients with covid-19 due to a greater surface of filtration they are more effective in collecting droplets compared to other bacterial filters available on the market however their bulky designs and requirement to use various adapters to attach them to nebulizers make it difficult to use them compared to low volume bacteria filters interface selection is as important as device selection in aerosol therapy using a facemask is not recommended for aerosol therapy in the treatment of coronavirus infected patients when a jet nebulizer is combined with a facemask the airflow of jet nebulizer will force aerosol out of the device during expiration and breath-hold mcgrath et al showed that the face mask had the highest-time averaged fugitively emitted aerosol concentration when a jet nebulizer was combined with a facemask they also reported that placing a filter on the exhalation port of the mouthpiece lead to the lowest concentration 6 therefore the jet nebulizers need to be used with the mouthpiece and clinicians should attach filters or one-way valves to the large bore tubing of the nebulizer to prevent fugitive emissions during aerosol therapy another option would be to use a mesh nebulizer combined with the mouthpiece in patients with covid-19 in this case clinicians should add a filter to the other end of the mouthpiece to eliminate the release of aerosols to the environment many suspected patients with covid-19 are recommended to stay at home telehealth would be a good option to evaluate them at home and minimize the utilization of healthcare facilities by them smart phones can be used to provide telehealth services to patients with covid-19 as they are equivalent of a hand-held computer although healthcare providers and patients do not need to be in the same physical location there are some challenges with the use of telehealth in this pandemic for instance the healthcare provider cannot measure the temperature if the patient does not have a thermometer at home lighting at the patients home can make assessing cyanosis difficult evaluation of throat nose or ears is also difficult if patient has upper respiratory symptoms using telehealth in this pandemic is a strategic initiative and achieving a careful balance of treatment effectiveness and patient safety require policy makers and stakeholders shape telehealth moving forward through

aerosol therapy in sub-intensive-patients with covid-19 high flow nasal cannula hfnc is commonly used in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure 25 26 27 due to a limited number of ventilators available at hospitals using hfnc may be a good option to use before patients with asthma and copd develop severe hypoxemic respiratory failure however secondary inhalation of emissions released from the patients with covid-19 using hfnc is a real concern it leads to the risk of dispersion of aerosolized virus because hfnc does not have a closed circuit unlike ventilators although previous studies showed a low risk of airborne transmission with hfnc when good interface fitting is achieved 141628 the safety of using hfnc in patients with coronavirus as well as the riskbenefit ratio for aerosol drug delivery through hfnc has not been investigated previous research reported that increasing the flow decreased the fugitive emissions and particle size of aerosols during therapy 6 if aerosolized medications need to be delivered through hfnc clinicians should place surgical masks on infected patients faces during hfnc 132930 and administer aerosol therapy in negative pressure rooms respiratory therapists should also wear personal protective equipment including an n95 respirator gogglesface shield double gloves gown or apron if the gown is not fluid resistant table 2

aerosol therapy in intensive-patients with covid-19 recently published studies showed that two thirds of patients with covid-19 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome 31 it takes 910 days for patients with covid-19 deteriorate and require intensive care for respiratory support 32 nebulizers may be needed in critically ill patients with covid-19 receiving ventilatory support in this case it is vital to keep the circuit intact and prevent the transmission of the virus therefore delivering aerosolized medications via jet nebulizer or pmdis will not be appropriate due to the breakage of the circuits for the placement of the device on the ventilator circuit before aerosol therapy a recently published chinese guideline suggests using the mesh nebulizer in critically ill patients with covid-19 receiving ventilator support 30 mesh nebulizers can stay in-line for up to 28 days and reservoir design allows adding medication without requiring the ventilator circuit to be broken for aerosol drug delivery unlike jet nebulizer the medication reservoir of mesh nebulizers is isolated from the breathing circuit that eliminates the nebulization of contaminated fluids also placing the mesh or jet nebulizer prior to the humidifier can improve the efficiency of the treatment and further reduce retrograde contamination from the patient 33 34 35 36 37 38 also it is important to remember that exhaled particles from intubated patients are less than 2 m that do not deposit via sedimentation or inertial impaction they remain suspended in the air and can pose a serious risk to healthcare professionals as low concentration exposure is sufficient for the transmission of coronavirus in our previous research we quantified the amount of aerosol collected at the exhaust outlet of a ventilator operated with and without filters in the expiratory limb of the circuit 23 we found that drug deposited at the exhaust port without expiratory filters was 160 fold higher that with expiratory filters and placing a filter in the expiratory limb significantly reduces secondhand aerosol exposure 23 since aerosol drug delivery to ventilator-dependent patients can readily be transmitted to the ambient environment it is critical to use the hepa filters to prevent the transmission of infectious droplet nuclei through the ventilators sometimes aerosol therapy is combined with pulmonary clearance techniques such as chest physical therapy and suctioning since coughing generates droplet nuclei capable of transmitting the coronavirus it is not recommended to administer aerosolized medications along with chest physical therapy in the acute phase of the disease if the patient with covid-19 is intubated and needs endotracheal suctioning during mechanical ventilation in-line or closed system suction catheters should be used as they can be utilized up to 7 days without having to break the ventilator circuit although there are multiple designs of closed suction catheters no significant difference was found on aerosol drug delivery to simulated ventilator dependent adults using different designs of closed suction catheters 39 table 3

infection control during aerosol therapy the risk of exposure to exhaled aerosols among health care professionals has been a real concern in the covid-19 pandemic aerosols entering the ambient environment increase the risk of exposure to the virus and may expose respiratory therapists and other healthcare professionals to the pathogen during patient treatment monitoring equipment cleaning and maintenance in the hospital setting previous research showed that exposure to the virus and poor compliance with infection control procedures are associated with occupationally acquired infection in healthcare settings 40 41 42 43 44 delivering to aerosolized medications to patients with covid-19 who have spontaneous breathing or receive noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula are of particularly high risk 45 if aerosolized medications need to be used in patients with covid-19 clinicians should isolate patients in an airborne infection isolation room aiir or negative pressure rooms with a minimum of 12 air changes per hour or at least 160 litersspatient in facilities with natural ventilation in addition respiratory therapists and health care professionals providing aerosol therapy should be trained on infection prevention and control recommendations for covid-19 they must adhere to airborne precautions and use personal protective equipment properly hand hygiene and double gloving should be a standard practice in all healthcare facilities in addition healthcare professionals should use surgical respirators such as n95 or ffp2 standard or equivalent gogglesface shield gloves gowns and aprons if gowns are not resistant to fluid during aerosol therapy 46 cleaning hands before and after treatment with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is extremely important other infection control strategies include minimizing the number of times that healthcare workers enter the rooms of covid-19 patients by bundling the activitiestreatments and restricting others who are not involved in direct patient care from entering the patients room currently a shortage of surgical n95 respirators is expected in this case healthcare professionals should consider using the same mask in the treatment of multiple patients with covid-19 however previous studies reported that the use of the same respirator for more than 4 h might lead to discomfort 4748 this pandemic has taught us the importance of infection prevention and control measures as well as teamwork in health care settings it is important for respiratory therapists to team up with other healthcare professionals in isolating coronavirus infected patients in aiir and assigning designated staff who can provide effective and safe delivery of aerosolized medications to this patient population although respiratory therapists and other healthcare providers face a major and unique challenge in this pandemic they are on the front stage and build a strong platform to ensure the health safety and well-being of patients with coronavirus the upside of this pandemic is that we can teach respiratory therapists and other healthcare professionals the importance of personal protection and safe practices that might carry over for a safer workplace in the future the treatment of patients with covid-19 is different from the disease management of patients with pulmonary diseases who need aerosol therapy however it is imperative during the pandemic to assume that all patients may be infected so good personal protection and aerosol administration practices should be applied clinical studies on covid-19 are limited and there is a lack of information and guidance on how to administer aerosolized medications to this patient population also the effective delivery of aerosolized medications to patients with covid-19 may require modifications in the dose frequency and delivery technique that need to be used for aerosol drug delivery in coronavirus infected patients while our deepest fear is that we are inadequate in terms of resources and knowledge about coronavirus the choice does not belong to pessimism and scare it belongs to us as marie curie said nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less we are strong when we know our fears and limitations therefore it is time to start thinking about what is necessary and doing what is possible using a proactive and comprehensive approach to aerosol drug delivery to patients with covid-19 respiratory therapists have enormous experience on aerosol therapy and the foundation of delivering aerosolized medications to coronavirus infected patients should be grounded in their experience and current guidelines on covid-19 i received research grants from arc medical bayer pharmaceuticals sunovion pharmaceuticals and aerogen ltd however i have not received any input or funding from these companies in the preparation of this manuscript   jason zhang shuo brian keegan c qin lv chenhao tan  the covid-19 pandemic has deeply impacted peoples lives around the globe during the extended lockdowns caused by the pandemic online communities are crucial for people to access information and share experiences in particular two new communities have emerged on reddit rchinaflu and rcoronavirus by studying activities and users in these two communities we provide a characterization of peoples responses to covid-19 on reddit first we find that user activity peaks around march 17 when the world health organization who announced covid-19 as a pandemic shortly after that the activity levels of both communities have been declining week by week we further illustrate the central role of these two communities in the emergence of covid-related communities second we study the differences between these two communities rcoronavirus is recommended as the official community for covid-19 on reddit while rchinaflu adopts a loose moderation practice as a result we observe that these two communities are gradually growing apart and more extremism is being found in rchinaflu finally we examine the spillover effect of the covid-19 pandemic on user activity across the entire reddit platform our results show significant changes in user activities outside covid-related communities in subreddits related to finance food and countriescities user activity is recovering to the pre-pandemic level in late april and may as countries reopen but subreddits related to travel and sports remain highly impacted and show lower activity levels than the pre-pandemic period our work highlights the strength of reddit as a source for understanding public reactions to covid-19 and the importance of content moderation on the internet during a pandemic  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus strain sars-cov-2 emerged in the city of wuhan china the disease quickly spread all over the world and led the world health organization who to declare a pandemic 63  by the end of may 2020 188 countriesregions reported over 62 million positive cases and 372037 deaths 14  the pandemic is not only exhausting public health resources but also causing social and economic disruption at an unprecedented speed and scale governments around the globe have implemented a series of protective measures such as lockdowns social distancing travel bans and mask-wearing to contain the spread of the disease while medical experts are rushing to treat covid-19 patients and develop vaccines social media has been critical for people in accessing information and sharing experiences during the pandemic take reddit as an example user-created subreddits dedicated to discussing the coronavirus have popped up and attracted millions of subscribers since the beginning of the outbreak top posts on these subreddits include ama ask me anything with bill gates medical experts and politicians by the end of may 2020 there are over four hundred coronavirus subreddits on the platform including two major general discussion communities rchinaflu and rcoronavirus others may focus on a specific region such as rcanadacoronavirus rcoronavirusca and rcoronavirusnewyork or a specific topic such as rcoronavirusrecession rcoronavirusmemes and rcovid19support the platform has become one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date sources of information for this constantly developing crisis besides information sharing social media also provides regular people a sense of normalcy during these challenging times it can serve as an antidote to physical isolation by allowing people to seek possible job opportunities keep up with education and entertain when outside forces such as covid-19 largely break in-person contact online communication provides an urgently-needed remedy for connecting the world however the impact of social media during this pandemic is not always positive the ubiquity of social media has made it easy to create and spread covid-19 falsehoods the worlds largest social media companies are reportedly under immense pressure to crack down on coronavirus misinformation that has been spread across their platforms 54  on rcoronavirus reddits official covid-19 community a team of more than 60 content moderators including researchers of infectious diseases virologists computer scientists doctors and nurses are spending hours daily removing misinformation trolls and discussions 53  however despite the joint effort on content moderation from mainstream social media platforms 54  nearly two-thirds of americans reported that they had seen news and information about the disease that is wholly made up 4  many of these misinformation narratives originally surfaced from unregulated platforms including gab and 4chan 74 and under-moderated spaces such as rwuhanflu and rcoronavirusconspiracy 18  in this work to characterize public responses to covid-19 on social media we construct a largescale dataset of two reddit communities that are dedicated to covid-19 discussions rchinaflu and rcoronavirus the dataset contains 312k posts 70m comments and 573k users we choose reddit as our testbed because 1 massive numbers of people turn to reddit for the latest updates about covid-19 take the official community rcoronavirus as an example it has become the fastest-growing subreddit on the entire platform with over 21 million subscribers after four months of its creation 2 health professionals 68  essential workers 72  and recovered patients 39 are reportedly using reddit as a primary source to share stories and information and 3 reddit is driven by communities and each community has its own moderation rules in comparison the content regulation policies on twitter and facebook are relatively vague organization and highlights we first describe the background research questions and hypotheses then we provide an overview of covid-related subreddits and introduce the dataset that we collected for this study we also demonstrate how user activity is connected with the important dates of this pandemic after that we investigate three research questions in the rest of the paper first we provide an exploratory analysis to understand how coronavirus-related subreddits have emerged during this pandemic by investigating the founders of the two earliest covid-19 communities rchinaflu and rcoronavirus we find that users who have paid attention to the disease from the beginning are news readers conspiracy theorists and survivalists we have also built a genealogy graph of covid-related communities and have found rchinaflu and rcoronavirus to be parents of many other subreddits related to second we compare the differences between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus and how these differences relate to moderation practices implemented in these two communities our results show that the language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus decreased in early february and then started to increase over time after the moderation practices diverged rchinaflu users pay much more attention to topics related to china and the chinese government while rcoronavirus users spend more time discussing the urgency and seriousness of the pandemic furthermore rchinaflu has more racist behavior and has a higher overlap with extreme communities compared with rcoronavirus intriguingly many of these differences observed in our study are not apparent until different moderation practices have been implemented by the platform third we turn our focus to the entire reddit platform and examine how people adjust their activity in response to the pandemic as a proxy of peoples lives during the pandemic we show that users who are active in coronavirus-related subreddits also have had a surge of activity in non-coronavirus subreddits during this pandemic in addition we explore the change of user activity in different categories of online communities we find significant changes in most of the categories in communities related to finance food and countriescities user activity has recovered to the pre-pandemic level in late april and may as countries reopen but communities related to travel and sports remain highly impacted and show lower activity levels than before the pandemic finally we offer concluding discussions our work develops a framework for characterizing disaster responses in online discussion forums the results in our work highlight the strength of reddit as a source for understanding public reactions to covid-19 and examining the spillover effect on user activity across different categories additionally our work provides clear evidence that social media may not be neutral in the middle of an international crisis proactive content moderation is associated with preventing the dissemination of racism and conspiracy theories given the dynamic nature of the covid-19 pandemic real-time tracking of public response is critical posts and comments in covid-related subreddits provide a valuable resource for characterizing the public response this section reviews three areas that are most relevant to our work community genealogy and highly related communities the effect of moderation practice and crisis informaticssociology of disaster when social media platforms give users the freedom to form interest groups a series of highly related communities can emerge for example during the 2016 election a battery of trump-related communities emerged on reddit such as rthedonald raskthedonald and rasktrumpsupporters the creation development and lifecycle of highly related communities have drawn considerable interest in the research community the first line of work compares the characteristics of highly related communities hessel et al 21 investigate the interactions between highly related reddit communities and identify patterns of affixes being used in their names the work by zhang et al 77 focuses on online nba fan communities and analyzes how fans of different teams react to team performance the second line of research studies the impact of membership overlap between highly related communities haiyi zhu robert kraut and collaborators investigate shared membership in online communities on a variety of platforms and propose strategies for long-term community survival 30 79 80 81  the final line provides a global overview of how users move through the space of communities and how new communities emerge from the old ones for example tan and lee 61 use several temporal features across communities to predict users activity levels and departure from reddit to visualize the process of how new communities develop from old ones tan 59 proposes a computational approach for building genealogy graphs between communities as the covid-19 pandemic evolves over four hundred coronavirus-related subreddits have popped up besides rchinaflu and rcoronavirus there are region-specific subreddits such as rcoronavirusuk rcoronavirusca and rcoronavirusnewyork there are also subreddits focusing on a certain aspect of the pandemic such as rcoronavirusmemes rcoronavirusrecession and rcovid19positive following the rise of these subreddits we formulate our first research question as follows rq1 how do coronavirus-related communities emerge during the covid-19 pandemic the effect of moderation practice on online platforms that invite users to post comments a moderation mechanism involves the monitor of various content including written opinions reviews videos and pictures according to a pre-determined set of rules and regulations it may also be under external requirements like removing content that violates local national and international laws 71  content moderation is critical in the development of a healthy environment as it protects users from being harmed and ensures the quality of content 23-25 30 55  lack of such regulation can expose users to unpleasant information and exhaust their limited attention in a recent example rworldpolitics is overwhelmed with nsfw not safe for work posts featuring porn pictures as moderators allow for all sorts of inappropriate content to be submitted 13  there has been an impressive body of research to understand the effect of moderation for example jhaver et al 23 25 employ survey-and platform-based approaches and find that users who receive explanations for content removal are more likely to post again in the future they further examine the role that automoderators play in content moderation and identify a list of advantages and challenges 24  juneja et al 28 reveal the lack of transparency in moderation practices on reddit which impede moderators ability to be fair the study by phadke and mitra 47 portray cross-platform efforts by online hate groups for recruitment and growing influence due to the lack of censorship and moderation from the technical perspective various approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of moderation such as tagging 75  summarization 76  distributed moderation 32  and crowdsourcing 33 37  in our work rchinaflu and rcoronavirus provide a natural experiment for examining how moderation practice shapes online communities both of these two communities are covid-19 centric which indicates similar discussion topics broadly however rchinaflu allows more relaxed discussions while rcoronavirus implements strict moderation rules  figure 1  this observation motivates us to study the difference between these two subreddits rq2 how do rchinaflu and rcoronavirus differ during the covid-19 pandemic earlier studies find that lack of effective moderation may produce a large amount of low-quality content in the online space such as conspiracy theories racist content and misinformation 23 24 30 73  for example npr cnn reuters and other news sites eliminate their online comment section due to inappropriate content 34  the well-known unregulated website 4chanorg is responsible for some of the largest hoaxes conspiracy theories cyberbullying incidents and internet pranks of the past few years 42  therefore we formulate our first hypothesis as follows h1 due to the loose moderation practice rchinaflu will have more conspiratorial discussions and racist behavior than rcoronavirus online communities are in constant flux 11  new members who join a community need to adapt to existing community norms and old members who do not like the trajectory of the development will depart given the lack of restriction in rchinaflu extreme users may be more likely to join rchinaflu and remain active there meanwhile members who are looking for serious discussions about the pandemic may leave accordingly we expect rchinaflu to attract more users from extreme communities than rcoronavirus h2 rchinaflu has a higher overlap with extreme communities than rcoronavirus according to a 2018 united nations review the frequency of disasters is on the rise globally 15  disaster events and their economic impacts are trending topics in computational social sciences in the early days of crisis informatics research qualitative methods such as descriptive surveys and interviews were the main source of data collection 44 45 57  recently following the advancement of the internet and mobile technology social media has played a critical role in the flow of public information a growing percentage of citizens frequently turn to these platforms for emergency updates 31 50  to effectively analyze information on mass media computational approaches have been widely adopted in crisis informatics for example vieweg et al 67 analyze public responses to two disaster events the red river floods and the oklahoma grassfires using twitter communications hagen et al 17 propose a network analysis approach to identify a number of distinct communities and influential actors using zika-related tweets stewart and wilson 56 characterize how citizens utilize social media to redistribute emergency updates and connect with family and friends during hurricane sandy the covid-19 pandemic has caused catastrophic social and economic disruption around the globe as reported by the international monetary fund the world is going through the worst global recession since the great depression in the 1930s 16  the pandemic has led to cancellation or postponement of school religious political and sporting events and supply shortages exacerbated by panic purchasing 5 22 43  during the pandemic social media platforms such as twitter and reddit have not only become primary sources of information but also serve as destinations for companionship and entertainment purposes as a result users activity on reddit may reflect how their normal life is being affected additionally when countries began phased reopenings in late april and may would users activity on reddit return to the pre-pandemic norm rq3 how do people change their activity during the pandemic over time and how does it relate to their membership in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus as the stay-at-home order begins people have more time to tune into social media to connect with friends family and like-minded individuals for socialization and emotional support several major social media platforms have observed traffic escalation 29 58 62  we expect the increment happens not only to coronavirus-related subreddits but also to non-coronavirus subreddits we propose the third hypothesis as follows h3 people who are active in coronavirus-related subreddits also have a surge of activity in non-coronavirus subreddits during the covid-19 pandemic more importantly the user activity on different categories of online communities can be a direct reflection of the socio-economic effects of covid-19 on daily life for example as the unemployment rate keeps soaring people who lost jobs may check economy-related communities more often some sports fans may stop checking sports-related communities as most sporting events are suspended in a recent survey review nicola et al 43 summarize the effect of covid-19 on individual aspects of the world economy in tertiary sectors which are divided into eight categories education finance healthcare travel housing sports technology and food with this list we find subreddits that are highly relevant to each category based on the wiki page of rlistofsubreddits 1  this page provides a summary of various kinds of popular subreddits we do not find a popular subreddit related to housing or healthcare on this page thus these two categories are removed we also add three additional categories that are specific to the reddit culture humor tvmovie and countriescities all these three categories attract a vast audience on the reddit platform for example rfunny is one of the largest subreddits with more than 30 million subscribers 2 rtv and rmovies each has more than 15 million subscribers additionally almost all major countriescities can find their corresponding subreddits 3 social distancing quarantine travel restrictions and stay-at-home order have led to a reduced out-home activity across many categories in an attempt to control the spread of the disease most governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions 65  more than 90 of the people worldwide live in countries with travel restrictions 10  many influential sports leagues have postponed or canceled sporting events 70  food and restaurants have been forced to close or only take carry-out orders 7  therefore we hypothesize subreddits related to out-home activities to draw less attention during the pandemic h4a for categories in which events are mostly out-home and mobile users will show less interest in corresponding subreddits such categories include education travel sports and food while much out-home activity is disrupted people are finding creative ways to study work connect and entertain at home online technology platforms become our best chance of staying together and enduring difficult times events that can be conducted on the internet may have a unique advantage during the covid-19 outbreak h4b for categories in which events are mostly online or related to stay-at-home and work-fromhome their subreddits will have a surge of activity such categories include finance technology countriescities tvmovie and humor our main dataset is drawn from reddit 4 a community-driven forum for discussion news consumption and content rating it was founded in 2005 and has become the 21st most popular websites in the world in may 2020 1  there are tens of thousands of communities known as subreddits on reddit dedicated to a wide variety of topics users can submit comment on upvote and downvote content in each subreddit since the outburst of covid-19 in late january 2020 a series of covid-related communities have emerged and drawn substantial public attention in this study we focus on two communities posts comments users table 1  dataset statistics here users refers to the number of unique users who postedcommented in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus respectively a reddit makes rcoronavirus the official community for covid-related updates b reddit allows more relaxed discussions in rchinaflu rchinaflu 5 and rcoronavirus 6 which are dedicated to covid-related information from the very beginning of this global pandemic rchinaflu was founded on january 20th 2020 when news about the first breakout of covid-19 emerged in wuhan china rcoronavirus was founded on may 3rd 2013 but remained inactive most of the time the first post in rcoronavirus since 2017 is about covid-19 on january 20th 2020 we collect all the posts and comments submitted to these two subreddits from january 20th to may 24th in 2020 from pushshiftio 8  table 1 gives a summary of the statistics about these two subreddits on february 17th the reddit platform has decided to make rcoronavirus the official community for covid-related updates on the website users who search for covid-related keywords have been recommended to check out rcoronavirus figure 1a  since then the subreddit is described as the place for high-quality discussions all the posts and comments submitted are strictly moderated meanwhile the platform allows more relaxed discussions in rchinaflu figure 1b  this policy shift is reflected by user activity in these two subreddits as illustrated in figure 2  the weekly number of posts and comments in these two communities are at a similar level before the february 5 on the front page of rchinaflu httpswwwredditcomrchinaflu it explains that the name rchinaflu was created at a time when sars-cov-2 had not been named and was only affecting china subreddit names cannot be changed after they are created  6 httpswwwredditcomtcoronavirus figure 2a and figure 2b shows the number of posts and comments per week respectively in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus before the february 17th announcement user activity is at a similar level between these two subreddits after the announcement rcoronavirus becomes much more popular than rchinaflu the overall user activity starts declining in both subreddits around march 9th it may be due to peoples fatigue of covid-related topics 17th announcement after that rcoronavirus has become much more popular than rchinaflu over time on march 11th the world health organization declared covid-19 as a global pandemic 63  user activity in rcoronavirus peaks at that week interestingly after that week user activity keeps dropping it may be due to peoples fatigue of covid-related topics according to a study released by the pew research center at the end of april 71 of americans say they need to take breaks from news about the coronavirus and 43 say they feel worse emotionally as a result of following the news 4  in comparison the posting activity in rchinaflu shows a similar trend and the comment activity starts to go down even earlier from the week of february 24th to understand how covid-related subreddits emerge from rchinaflu and rcoronavirus we also collect posts and comments from a set of coronavirus-related subreddits we use two ways to search for popular coronavirus-related subreddits the first set of subreddits are identified at the sidebar of rcoronavirus we also find all subreddits whose names start with covid or coronavirus after combining these two sets of coronavirus-related subreddits we rank them based on their total number of comments and select the top-7 regional-specific subreddits and top-7 general related subreddits these 16 subreddits will be used for visualizing the genealogy graph between in figure 5  for each of these subreddits we collect its entire posting and commenting history from the creation date to may 24th 2020 we will share all our processed data and code upon publication we start with an exploratory analysis to understand how coronavirus-related communities emerge during this pandemic we first examine the weekly overlap and common news articles between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus to understand the composition of these two communities second we look at the founders of these two subreddits and check which communities they came from before joining rchinaflu and rcoronavirus respectively finally we characterize the genealogy figure 3a shows the weekly overlap between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus the overlap is measure by the proportion of users who are active in both communities figure 3b shows the weekly proportion of common urls that are posted in both rchinaflu and rcoronavirus graph of covid-related subreddits to get a sense of how other coronavirus-related subreddits emerge from rchinaflu and rcoronavirus our results show that users who pay attention to the disease from the beginning are news readers conspiracy theorists and survivalists rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are indeed parents of many covid-related subreddits but the separation of membership between these two communities is increasing over time the weekly overlap between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus figure 3a shows the weekly overlap between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus the overlap is measured by the proportion of users in one community that are also active in the other community in the same week around the week of march 2nd more than 40 of rchinaflu users are also active in rcoronavirus after that week the overlap keeps going down over time this trend indicates that the separation between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus widens as the pandemic develops we also examine the weekly proportion of news articles shared in both communities we define a news article to be shared by both communities by finding a pair of posts one from rchinaflu one from rcoronavirus which have the exact same url linking to the same news article figure 3b illustrates that an increasing proportion of news articles posted in rchinaflu are also submitted to rcoronavirus in contrast rcoronavirus covers more diverse covid-19 stories as around 90 of its news articles are not shared in rchinaflu to understand where the founders of rchinaflu and rcoronavirus came from figure 4 shows the top-10 parents of these two communities these top-10 parents are selected based on each communitys first 50 members activity on reddit one week before joining rchinaflu or rcoronavirus interestingly the founders of rchinaflu and rcoronavirus were both active in rcollapse a subreddit that attracts survivalists to discuss the potential collapse of global civilization it suggests that people who pay attention to this virus at the very beginning tend to worry about the break down of our society in general 12  unsurprisingly early members of rchinaflu and rcoronavirus figure 4a shows the top-10 subreddits that the first 50 users of rchinaflu had been active in one week before joining rchinaflu figure 4b shows the top-10 subreddits that the first 50 users of rcoronavirus had been active in one week before joining rcoronavirus are also active members of news-related subreddits rworldnews and rnews this explains why they were aware of this new disease the earliest moreover eight founders of rchinaflu were also active in rconspiracy indicating that covid-19 topics attract conspiracy theorists 35 41  particularly in rchinaflu in comparison rchina is among the top-10 parents of rcoronavirus suggesting that individuals who are invested in china started to avoid rchinaflu from the very beginning since rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are the two earliest communities that concentrate on covidrelated discussions it would be useful to explore how other covid-related subreddits emerge from them on the platform following tan 59  figure 5 presents a broader view of a genealogy graph the graph is based on the first 50 members of each covid-related subreddit a directed edge indicates that there exist early members of the child subreddit who were members of the parent subreddit the thickness of an edge represents the fraction of such members the node size indicates the community size measured by the number of active members to improve the readability of the graph we remove edges with less than 002 weights which is less than or equal to one member from the parent subreddit in general we can see that this genealogy graph is very dense rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are indeed parents of many communities related to covid-19 it also shows that both communities attract users from all over the world some exceptions are interesting rcoronavirus is not a parent of rcoronavirusmemes and the edge between rchinaflu and rcoronavirusmemes is thin founders of rcoronavirusmemes are not from coronavirus-related subreddits moreover the edge from rchinaflu to rcoronavirusrecession is thinner than the one from rcoronavirus to rcoronavirusrecession we see similar trends when plotting the genealogy graph using the post activity  figure 11 in the appendix even though both rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are covid-19 centric we have seen in rq1 that the overlap between these two communities decreases over time in this section we investigate a directed edge indicates that there exist early members of the child subreddit who were members of the parent subreddit the thickness of an edge represents the fraction of such members pink nodes represent regional subreddits and blue nodes represent general ones the node size indicates community size as measured by the number of active members to improve the readability of the graph we remove edges with less than 002 weights which is less than or equal to one member from the parent subreddit hypotheses about their differences driven by moderation practices we expect them to develop different norms formulate different language styles and stimulate further changes to the membership and social dynamics over time we first compare the language usage difference between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus and examine how it evolves then we conduct a qualitative analysis of over-used keywords the most downvoted comments and replies to moderators in each community after that we compare the weekly overlap between these two communities and some more extreme communities on reddit overall we observe an increasing difference when comparing these two subreddits rchinaflu cares more about topics related to china or the chinese government generates more racist comments and has higher overlap with other extreme communities many of these differences are not apparent until different moderation practices are implemented by the platform because posting comments is a major activity for users on reddit we first characterize two communities behavior differences through the lens of language usage language distance first we measure the language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus intuitively since both communities are covid-19 centric we would expect their word usage to follow similar distributions it would be surprising if one word frequently appears in rchinaflu but not in rcoronavirus and vice versa the existence of such words indicates a larger language distance similar to prior work 3 6 60  we adopt the jensen-shannon divergence 38 to measure the weekly unigram usage difference in comments between these two subreddits for all textrelated computations in this paper we remove punctuation marks and stopwords and stem the words during preprocessing the preprocessing is implemented using gensim 49  we also remove comments from moderators or bots to focus on natural users responses during this pandemic figure 6 summarizes the weekly language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus as measured by the jensen-shannon divergence interestingly the language distance decreases slightly before the week of february 24th this suggests that the word usage between these two communities are similar at that time after that the language distance keeps going up indicating an increasing difference between these two subreddits intriguingly the peak similarity appears in 6  the weekly language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus the language distance is getting closer before the week of february 24th after that the distance between these two subreddits is steadily increasing  the week of february 24th one week after the february 17th official announcement figure 1  the strict moderating rules implemented in rcoronavirus and allowing more relaxed discussions in rchinaflu may play a role for this shift the final decline in may is likely driven by the reduction of activities in both communities classification models another way to estimate the language distance between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus is to measure the separation of comments in each community we formulate a binary classification task given the aggregation of comments under one post can we determine which community this post comes from for each week we randomly sample 2000 posts from rchinaflu and rcoronavirus respectively each post is represented by the aggregation of all the comments it receives posts without any comments are removed before the sample to make sure that the number of comments in each post does not play an important factor in our classification model we randomly sample 20 comments of each post this task is thus a balanced classification task where the majority baseline accuracy is 50 the feature set for this task is bag-of-words bow from aggregated comments to assess each weeks classification performance we measure accuracy in five-fold cross-validation using a standard  2 -regularized logistic regression classifier figure 7a presents the weekly accuracy of determining which community a post came from given its aggregated comments we observe a similar trend compared with using jensen-shannon divergence before the week of february 24th the accuracy is decreasing indicating that the language difference between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus is hard to classify after the week of february 24th the accuracy goes up indicating an increment of distinction different from the jensen-shannon distance we observe that the classification performance between these two communities converges at around 65 since march with each weeks classification model trained we also evaluate the cross-week performance as illustrated in the heatmap figure 7b  we use the classification model trained on week1 to classify the aggregated comments in week2 the accuracy is low close to chance in the top right corner these results suggest dramatic change in these two communities before and after the february figure 7a shows the weekly accuracy of determining which community rchinaflu or rcoronavirus a posts aggregated comments come from using bow before the week of february 24th the accuracy is decreasing indicating that the language difference between these two communities is hard to classify after the week of february 24th the accuracy goes up showing an increment of distinction we run this classification model until the week of april 6th as there are not enough posts in rchinaflu after that week to perform this task figure 7b shows the cross-week accuracy of differentiating comments posted to rchinaflu or rcoronavirus using bow in this heatmap figure every cell indicates the accuracy of using the classification model trained on week1 to classify the comments in week2 the weeks before february 17th have relatively good performance when classifying each other and a similar pattern applies to the weeks after february 24th however when we use a classification model before february 17th to classify the comments after february 24th and vice versa the performance is poor 17th announcement the model trained before the announcement can hardly be useful for weeks after the announcement qualitative validation of over-represented keywords to get a better sense of how rchinaflu and rcoronavirus members talk differently we supplement with qualitative analyses to identify a list of keywords that are over-used by members in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus we implement the fightin words model 40 to compare one communitys word frequencies to the other community using the informative dirichlet prior model the fightin words model is effective in detecting word usage differences between two corpora by introducing a smoothing dirichlet prior on vocabulary items this method avoids over-emphasizing fluctuations of rare words a challenge faced by traditional methods such as pmi 38 and tf-idf 51  recently the fightin words model has been frequently used in analyzing language usage in online communities 20 36 78  table 2 presents the weekly over-used keywords in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus due to the space limit we show results every three weeks after the february 17th announcement members in rchinaflu pays much more attention to china-related topics many of the over-represented keywords are related to china or the chinese government this finding echoes prior research about the emergence of sinophobic behavior on twitter and 4chan during the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic 48 52  however we do not see such words in the first two weeks in the table in comparison in the week of february 17th many keywords in rcoronavirus are related to content moderation given that we already remove all the comments from moderators or bots during preprocessing these words can be members arguing foragainst strict rules and quality control after that week members in rcoronavirus spend more time discussing topics related to daily life eg school work home and grocery table 2  the weekly top-10 over-used words in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus respectively these words are selected and ranked by the z-scores calculated using the fightin words model 40  these words are stemmed before fitting into the model replies to moderators what kind of comments were removed in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus in both communities moderators usually explain the decision with a reply to the removed comment however the explanation is usually generic eg incivility isnt allowed on this sub and it is difficult to know the exact reason to answer this question an alternative approach is to look at peoples responses to moderators explanations we note that even if a comment is removed the responses to this comment will still be available on the platform in those responses users usually present a rebuttal of why their content does not violate the rules we identify 708 such responses in rchinaflu and 2275 such responses in rcoronavirus we again run the fightin words model to find a list of distinguishing keywords that are over-used by each community our results are shown in table 3  in rchinaflu over-represented keywords in responses to moderators are highly related to china or the chinese government they also connect with some popular conspiracy theories about covid-19 such as the virus comes from a wuhan lab the virus comes from people eating bats or the virus is a foreign bioweapon 35  additionally when we read through these responses many users are arguing that their comments are not meant to be racist comparatively most of the over-used keywords in rcoronavirus are about arguing the quality of the content or whether it is political there are also users complaining that their comments are not conspiracy theories or not uncivil a random sample of responses to moderators in each community are attached in appendix table 5  most downvoted comments in each community by design reddit communities allow users to vote up or down for the comments they read the difference between the number of upvotes and downvotes a comment receives is referred to as score  the ranking system will display comments with the highest scores at the top of the page and hide the ones with the lowest scores the most table 3  the top-20 over-used words in replies to moderations in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus these words are selected and ranked by the z-scores calculated using the fightin-words algorithm 40  over-used keywords in replies to moderations in rchinaflu lab china viru flu wuhan relat topic bat

video gui remov sorri edit provid translat info state uncivil pure downvoted comments can help us understand what opinions that the community members dislike intensely the most downvoted comments in rchinaflu and rcoronavirus are listed in table 4  interestingly all five comments in rchinaflu are related to saying positive things about china or the chinese government in contrast downvoted comments in rcoronavirus are mostly about downplaying the seriousness of the virus these results provide further evidence that members in rchinaflu pay much closer attention to chinese-related news and have a negative opinion against china it also explains the higher percentage of sinophobic behavior observed in rchinaflu we also check the most upvoted comments in each community which is attached in appendix  table 6  the topics that are heavily endorsed in both communities are more diverse given that members in rchinaflu seem to have more radical behavior such as promoting conspiracy theories and posting racist content we explore its membership overlap with other extreme communities on the platform the extreme communities that we consider include  rwuhanflu 7  rwuhanflu is also a covid-19 centric community founders of rwuhanflu claim this community a place for uncensored discussion the subreddit was quarantined by reddit four days after its creation due to misinformation and hoax content  rconspiracy 8  rconspiracy is a community devoted to a wide range of conspiratorial discussions dramatic events frequently talked about there include jfk ufos and 911  rcollapse 9  rcollapse focuses on discussing the potential collapse of global civilization the community defines collapse as a significant decrease in human population andor politicaleconomicsocial complexity over a considerable area for an extended time some topics frequently discussed in rcollapse are similar to that of rconspiracy figure 8 illustrates rchinaflus and rcoronavirus weekly user overlap with these three extreme subreddits rchinaflu has a much higher overlap with rwuhanflu than rcoronavirus figure 8a  even after rwuhanflu was quarantined by reddit in the week of february 3rd due to the spread of misinformation and hoax content rchinaflu also has a much higher overlap with rconspiracy than rcoronavirus after the february 17th announcement figure 8b  moreover the proportion of overlap users is increasing steadily after that week we see a similar trend between the overlap of rchinaflu and rcollapse figure 8c  except that the increase starts in the week of march 2nd interestingly rcoronavirus user overlap with rconspiracy and rcollapse is also trending up after march 2nd this finding echoes previous studies that the spread of conspiracy theories is a widespread problem in coronavirus-related discussions 46 52  however this problem is more salient in rchinaflu than in rcoronavirus suggesting that these discussions on conspiracy theories tend to occur in relatively smaller communities with loose moderation practice finally we examine how covid-19 affects peoples life beyond discussions related to coronavirus the covid-19 pandemic has caused many cities worldwide to implement strict lockdown to control the spread of this disease with more time spent indoor people likely have adjusted their behavior to measure users activity change before and during the pandemic we collect all rchinaflu members commenting history on reddit since november 1st 2019 we filter users who posted no comments in the entire month of november 2019 to focus on users who were already active on reddit before the pandemic after this removal there are 42748 rchinaflu members left among them 16594 members have not posted any comment in rcoronavirus the remaining 26154 members have commented in both communities we also randomly sample 16594 members in rcoronavirus who have no comments in rchinaflu and have been active since november 2019 in our analysis we compare the weekly activity change of the following three groups of users figure 8a shows that rchinaflu has a much higher overlap with rwuhanflu than rcoronavirus rwuhanflu is a community quarantined four days after its creation due to misinformation and hoax purple line figure 8b shows that rchinaflu has a much higher overlap with rconspiracy than rcoronavirus after the february 17th announcement the proportion of overlapping users exhibits an increasing trend figure 8c shows that rchinaflu has a much higher overlap with rcollapse than rcoronavirus since the very beginning of this pandemic the proportion of overlapping users exhibits an increasing trend since the week of march 2nd for each comparison we quantify the change of activity using increase rate which is measured by the percentage increase of the weekly average number of comments before and during the pandemic increase rate  av j weeks during the pandemic n j av i weeks before the pandemic n i  av i weeks before the pandemic n i   where n i represents the average number of comments in week i in our definition all the weeks before january 27th when the outbreak starts in wuhan china are before the pandemic and the remaining weeks are during the pandemic to understand how activity trends differ between members of rchinaflu and rcoronavirus we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient corr between the weekly average number of comments of rchinaflu-only users and rcoronavirus-only users figure 9a shows users weekly number of comments in all subreddits since november 2019 we observe a notable increase in overall activity on reddit during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic 23 increase this trend is consistent for both rchinaflu-only users 11 increase and rcoronavirus-only users 11 increase the trend is similar to figure 2 as it peaks at the week of march 9th and then starts going down it suggests that as countries are reopening in april and may user activity on reddit is returning to the pre-pandemic norm figure 9b and figure 9c show that the surge of activity is more than following covid-related updates in non-coronavirus subreddits the weekly average number of comments also has a 9 boost during the pandemic interestingly the activity correlation between rchinaflu-only users and rcoronavirus-only users is much higher outside the covid-19 communities figure 10 summarizes users activity change in different categories of comments we observe varying shapes among these categories the increase rates for travel and sports are negative which supports our hypothesis h4a as extensive travel and sporting events are canceled users pay less attention to these subreddits accordingly in april and may even though many countries are reopening their economic activity travel and sports events do not recover subsequently user activity in these two categories remains at a low level among these three categories we observe similar trends between rchinaflu-only and rcoronavirus-only users as the pearson correlations are all above 060 in h4a we also hypothesize a decline in user activity in education and food subreddits however the results in figure 10c and figure 10d do not support this hypothesis we observe a 10 increase in the education subreddits and little change in the food subreddits 2 increase rate in figure  10c  there is an apparent surge of activity between two yellow lines as covid-19 starts to become a serious problem in europe and the us people may flock to the education subreddits to discuss issues about school closure and students going home after that the discussion in the education subreddits recovers to an average level similar to the pre-pandemic period when we compare user activity of rchinaflu-only and rcoronavirus-only users in the education subreddits rcoronavirus-only users maintain a high level of interest during the pandemic while many rchinaflu-only users shift their focus away after the week of march 9th in figure 10d  we see some drop of activity around the week of march 9th but it quickly recovers even though restaurants and cafes are forced to close there is a massive demand for food in grocery stores and supermarkets the shortage of food supply may also prompt discussions in online communities these factors may mitigate each other in the food subreddits the increase rates for finance countriescities and humor are positive which supports our hypothesis in h4b these results indicate that people pay more attention to economic opportunities and local news during this pandemic they are also pursuing funny stories perhaps for relieving mental and physical stress interestingly user activity in these three categories starts dropping in late april and may as countries are opening up people may be less worried about financial issues follow less local news and spend less time on memes jokes and funny stories among these three categories the patterns of rchinaflu-only and rcoronavirus-only users are similar as the pearson correlations are all above 050 in h4b we expect an increment in technology and tvmovie subreddits however the results in figure 10h and figure 10i refute our hypotheses there is no significant change in the technology subreddits before and during the pandemic -1 increase rate and an 18 drop in the tvmovies subreddits notably rchinaflu-only and rcoronavirus-only users exhibit opposite trends in the 10  the weekly average number of comments in different categories of subreddits for three groups of users increase rates shown in titles are measured among all users the correlation corr is measured between rchinaflu-only users and rcoronavirus-only users we also mark two important weeks in the figure the first week of january 27th the first week of the outbreak and the week of march 9th when who declared covid-19 a pandemic technology subreddits figure 10h  the increase rate is -12 for rchinaflu-only users and 11 for rcoronavirus-only users surprisingly user activity in the tvmovies subreddits is decreasing during the pandemic according to forbes streaming hits have jumped by at least 12 in march 9  this surge does not seem to translate to activity in the tvmovies subreddits one possible explanation is that people are more likely to discuss newly released tv series or movies on reddit for example in figure 10i  the peak around the week of december 16th is mainly due to the release of the classic movie star wars the rise of skywalker during the pandemic new film releases have been delayed to future dates or indefinitely 69  people may spend more time watching old tv series or movies but are not passionate about discussing them on the internet in this work we provide a large-scale characterization of reddit users responses to the covid-19 pandemic we focus on two new communities that emerged on the reddit platform rchinaflu and rcoronavirus by comparing users activity and language usage in these two communities from the beginning of the outbreak to late may we observe an increasing difference between them in many aspects for example the language distance between these two communities is going up week by week the users in rchinaflu care more about china-related topics generate more racist comments and are more likely to be active in other extreme communities intriguingly the february 17th announcement made by the reddit platform which makes rcoronavirus the official community for covid-19 and increases moderation effort in rcoronavirus might be associated with this difference moreover we illustrate how the disease is rippling through society by examining users activity change on the entire reddit platform we find significant activity changes outside covid-related communities in some categories such as finance and food user activity has recovered to the pre-pandemic level in late april and may as countries reopen but other categories remain highly impacted implications for moderation practice should social media be neutral this question has drawn increasing attention in our society amidst concerns over bad behavior on the internet such as spreading misinformation supporting conspiracy theories and promoting racism one popular argument for non-intervention on social media is to protect freedom of speech recently us president donald trump signed an executive order targeting social media censorship trump described the move as to defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in american history 2  however allowing totally free and uncensored discussions in online platforms may not work for example the well-known unregulated website 4chanorg is responsible for some of the largest hoaxes conspiracy theories cyberbullying incidents and internet pranks of the past five years 42 52 64  npr cnn reuters and other news sites have eliminated their online comment section due to the inability to limit inappropriate content 34  subreddit rworldpolitics is overwhelmed with nsfw posts featuring porn pictures due to a lack of moderation 13  the fight against coronavirus on social media notably demonstrates the importance of content moderation on the internet facebook twitter and other service providers have been increasingly active building ways of removing damaging coronavirus misinformation 19 26  the results in our work suggest that rchinaflu which has adopted a loose moderation practice has more racist behavior and a higher overlap with rconspiracy another coronavirus-related subreddit rwuhanflu which calls itself the best place for uncensored coronavirus discussion was quarantined only four days after its creation reddit explains that the quarantine decision was made to contain misinformation or hoax content in summary considering the potentially harmful impact that low-quality content can have on society during the crisis social media platforms should take responsibility and play a substantial role in content moderation and curation it remains an open question as to what kind of moderation is appropriate and effective implications for online extremism is the human crisis a golden opportunity for extreme online spaces to grow and recruit new members since the beginning of the outbreak wild conspiracy theories and misinformation began sprouting online 41  take rconspiracy as an example its user activity skyrocketed during the covid-19 pandemic figure 12  we find that rchinaflu a community dedicated to covid-related discussions is attracting users from extreme communities at the same time it may serve as a pathway for radical communities to surface and develop some users who are not interested in conspiracy stories or are not aware of such online spaces in the beginning may be exposed and become new fans during the pandemic future research towards painting a comprehensive picture of user radicalization on social media platforms during crises is necessary for answering this question implications for understanding online communities our work demonstrates that online communities do not only exist in the virtual world user activity in online communities can be heavily embedded in the offline context covid-related subreddits provide a unique opportunity for understanding the connections between the online and offline world because these communities only exist as a result of the covid-19 pandemic many activity changes identified in these communities are highly correlated with the timelines of how the pandemic has unfolded in the real world such observations emphasize the necessity of connecting online and offline data resources to explain the dynamics of online communities and their relationships with on-going offline events our results on user activity outside covid-related communities also point to possible directions in informing offline policies using online behavior further research is required to bridge the gap between the online and offline worlds the findings in our work are subject to several limitations first the causal relationship between moderation practices and differences between rchinaflu and rcoronavirus is not established due to the nature of our observational study we do not know what will happen to rchinaflu if reddit implements stricter rules an important confounding factor could be that all the differences are driven by the decision of making rcoronavirus the official coronavirus subreddit on the entire platform not by moderation however this factor alone cannot explain the high overlap between rchinaflu and extreme communities second most of the data has been collected during the covid-19 pandemic a unique period in human history the results reported in this study are highly connected to this context for example there is a steep rise in the expression of anti-asian bias and blatant harassment across the globe related to fear amidst the epidemic 27 66  false information has led to scapegoating and disrespect aimed at persons of asian descent particularly those of chinese origin 52  this background partially explains the sinophobic behavior observed in rchinaflu the generalization of insights from this work to other contexts requires further investigation   seird model for qatar covid-19 outbreak a case study ryad ghanam edward boone l abdel-salam abdel-salam g  the covid-19 outbreak of 2020 has required many governments to develop mathematical-statistical models of the outbreak for policy and planning purposes this work provides a tutorial on building a compartmental model using susceptibles exposed infected recovered and deaths status through time a bayesian framework is utilized to perform both parameter estimation and predictions this model uses interventions to quantify the impact of various government attempts to slow the spread of the virus predictions are also made to determine when the peak active infections will occur to be determined

percentage rate of covid-is expected to hit  who   the virus has spread from china to other countries and territories across the globe from wuhan hubei province the virus spread to mainland china thailand japan south korea vietnam singapore italy iran and other countries the state of qatar was one of the countries that were a fected by the covid-spreading and the rst infected case was reported on th of february and it could be considered the nd highest in the arab world with the number of con rmed cases  as of may   for e fectively specifying such security measures it is essential to have a real-time monitoring system of the infection recovery and death rates develop implement and deploy a data-driven forecasting model for use by stakeholders in the state of qatar to deal with the covid-pandemic the model will focus on infected deaths and recovered as those are the only data available at this time this document is organized in the following manner in section the seird that is employed is de ned next section introduces the data available and gives description then shows how interventions are incorporated into the model the let st be the number of people susceptible at time t et be the number of people exposed at time t i t be the number of infected at time t rt be the cumulative number of recovered at time t and dt be the cumulative number of deaths at time t this can be modeled with the following system of ordinary di ferential equations where  is the transmission rate from susceptibles to exposed  is the rate at which exposed become infected  is the rate at which infected become recovered and  is the mortality rate for those infected notice that this model formulation makes several key assumptions  immigration emigration natural mortality and births are negligible over the time frame and hence are not in the model  once a person is in the infected group they are quarantined and hence they do not mix with the susceptible population  the recovered and deaths compartments are for those who rst are infected there is no compartment for those exposed who do not become sick infected and recover on their own traditional analysis would include a steady state analysis however in this case the dynamics of the short term is of interest hence this work does not address any steady state or equilibrium concerns this work is concerned with tting the model given in   to the covid-data concerning the state of qatar during the outbreak and using the model for forecasting several possible scenarios the johns hopkins covid-github site includes for every country for each day the cumulative number of con rmed infections cumulative number of recovered and the cumulative number of deaths for each day starting january  the data for qatar was obtained notice that in model   the recovered and death states are cumulative as once one enters the compartment their is no exit however the infected compartment has transitions from exposed and to recovered and deaths hence the data provided for con rmed infections is cumulative and included both recovered and deaths and will need to be removed from this compartments data let ci t be the con rmed infections at time t and let infected i t be de ned as for clarity the term active infections will be used to denote this derived variable versus the cumulative infected provided in the data figure shows the plots of the active infections recovered and deaths data for qatar for the days since february  notice that the active infections are very low until around day when there is large jump due to increased testing the active infections then seems to plateau for until day  after which there is extreme growth in active infections there seems to be a similar pattern for the recovered with a delay showing the time of infection before recovery the plot for deaths shows no deaths until day and then a steady increase in deaths for the remaining days the state of qatar prepared an excellent exible plan for risk management grounded on national risk assessment taking account of the global risk assessment done by who focuses on reinforce capacities to reduce or eliminate the health risks from covid- embed complete emergency risk management strategy in the health sector furthermore enabling and promoting  closed all parks and public beaches to curb the spread of coronavirus on march  day  the ministry of commerce and industry decided to temporarily close all restaurants cafes food outlets and food trucks at the main public era also the ministry of commerce and industry decided to close all the unnecessary business on march  day  hamad medical corporation   and mph-qatar   these interventions taken by the government change the dynamics of the system and hence need to be incorporated into the model the next section details how we introduce interventions both from the government and interventions guided by the data in figure  one can see the jump at day and a plateau until day  the model needs to be able to handle interventions made by the government of the state of qatar the main parameter that policy can in uence is  the rate of transmission from exposed to susceptible one way to implement this the use of indicator functions w k t de ned as where t k is the time where the k th intervention is taken and index k     k  for each intervention there needs to be a change to the value of  denoted  k  that captures the impact of the intervention let the vector this formulation gives the following transitions rates between st and et which will require the following constraints due to the fact that t  for all t let be the set de ned by the constraints above in addition to changes in infection rates  impulse functions can be used to model dramatic one time shifts in transitions between states a dirac delta function de ned by  this can be integrated in the model to capture spikes in the number of cases in our case the state of qatar data shows exhibits this type of behavior at day where one can clearly see a large jump in the number of infections this is incorporated into the model presented by a dirac delta function t   in transition rate between exposed and infected which is coupled with a coe cient to  a to capture the impact of the jump due to the complexity of the model the bayesian inferential framework is chosen recall bayes formula is given by bayes and price   where d is the posterior probability distribution for the parameters  given the data d  is the prior distribution of  and ld is the likelihood of the data given  in order to specify the likelihood of the model in equation   the model modi ed to model the mean abundance in each compartment and is given by and dt respectively and the parameters have the same de nition as provided in the system given in equation   since there is no data for st and et these compartments will be latent variables and will not directly factor into the likelihood the likelihood for i t rt and dt are given by to specify the prior distributions for   a    and  one must incorporate the following constraints         and    hence the following prior distributions are set where c   is an indicator function takes the value if    this serves to truncate the normal distribution in order to keep  in the feasible range of values the likelihood and prior distributions speci cations lead to the following posterior distribution when a  and    the posterior distribution does not lend to any analytic solution hence markov chain monte carlo mcmc techniques will be used to sample from the posterior distribution gelman et al   speci cally metropolis-hastings sampler is used to obtain samples from the posterior distribution gilks richardson and spiegelhalter  and albert   to tune the sampler a series of short chains were generated and analyzed for convergence and adequate acceptance rates these initial short chains were discarded as burn-in samples the tuned sampler was used to generate  samples from   a    d and trace plots were visually examined for convergence and deemed to be acceptable all inferences will be made from these  samples the model and sampling algorithm is custom programmed in the r statistical programming language version    the computation takes approximately seconds using a amd a - ghz processor with gb of ram to obtain  samples from the posterior distribution for more on statistical inference see wackerly mendenhall and schea fer   casella and berger   and berger   to apply the model the following initial conditions are speci ed s      e    i     r   and d    here s  is the current population of the state of qatar i   r  and d  are obtained directly from the data the choice of e  was used as it a minimal value that would allow the disease to spread but not so large as to make the spread rapid several values of e  were explored and the value of was found to have the best t furthermore model interventions were placed at days t   t   t   t  and t  with an dirac delta impulse at time    table shows the means standard deviations and the     and   quantiles for the model parameters based on the  samples from the posterior distribution notice that      and       are very close in magnitude with di ferent signs indicating that the rst intervention drastically reduced the transmission rate similarly one can see that the second and third interventions      and       essentially are of the same magnitude with di ferent signs which when added resulting in a very low transmission rate however      is a small increase with a moderate decrease in       which still leaves a nal transmission rate of k k  k      of particular note is the mean mortality rate      which means that about in  people perish from the disease each day which is quite low also note that the mean infection con rmed rate is       which corresponds to about in  exposed people become con rmed each day the quantile intervals provide a  credible interval for the parameters and can be used to obtain a range of reasonable parameter values for example for the parameter  the interval is      meaning that the probability that  is between      is   this can be used to create an interval for the risk interpretations as between     and     exposed people are con rmed as infected each day this also gives insight into how many people who may be in the population who are exposed and may be infectious but do not yet exhibit symptoms recall that  a is associated with the dirac delta function for impulse to model the jump in transition rate from exposed to infected at day  notice that  a   means that there is a one time in ux of approximately   of the people exposed moved to the infected compartment hence the increased testing captured many of the exposed people by adding this to the natural exposed to infected rate of    one obtains the one time transmission rate of    a       corresponding to a total of approximately   of exposed being con rmed as infected leaving the remaining approximately   of exposed people still interacting with the susceptible population while many of the parameters do not lend well to the traditional h    hypothesis testing as they must be positive we can conduct simple hypothesis tests on the  parameters to look for signi cant changes due to interventions using contrasts speci cally the sequential contrasts of                and     these contrasts quantify the changes that in transmission rate from susceptible to exposed due to the interventions and are what policy makers want to see furthermore they want a statistical test on whether or not the intervention performed in a statistically signi cant manner this can be done by simply subtracting the mcmc samples to generate the contrast of interest using these subtracted samples one can look at the mean standard deviation quantiles and the proportion of samples above  p  table shows these quantities for the contrasts listed above notice that the intervention at day reduced the transmission rate by approximately     which is considerable and the proportion of samples above was  indicating a statistically signi cant change due to the intervention the intervention taken at day      actually increased the transmission rate where the intervention taken at day      then reduced the transmission rate similarly the other two interventions increased and then decreased the transmission rates respectively furthermore all interventions be deemed statistically signi cant since p  is either  or  indicating signi cance  the model formulation also allows for the individual transmission rates to be computed by simply summing up the  k through to the desired time point table gives the mean standard deviation and q   q   q   for the transmission rate of exposed to infected across each time interval this is done by simply add the corresponding mcmc samples this is another perspective on how the transmission rate changes across the time frame notice that all of the transmission rates are positive which is required by the model speci cation also notice that the mean transmission rates vary in orders of magnitude from    to     one interesting point that should be made is the highest transmission rate is at the beginning and the lowest transmission rate is at the end this is evidence that the interventions that the qatari government has ultimately reduced the transmission rate  to assess the t of the model the posterior predictive distribution was used and is given by using the samples  samples from the posterior distribution  samples were generated from the posterior predictive distribution at each time t the median  and  quantiles were obtained to form a posterior predictive interval figure shows the model ts for active infections recovered and deaths with posterior predictive bands notice that the model does quite well at tting the dynamics of the active infections including the jump at day and captures the plateau and the exponential growth after the plateau as well the recovered model does ts well as does the deaths data to assess the explained variance a pseudo-r was formed using the median from the posterior predictive distribution at each time as the point estimates this resulted in a pseudo-r of  which indicates the tted model explains approximately   of the variance in the data based on this the model is deemed to t well it should be noted that standard data splitting procedures for model validation are di cult in this scenario as removing values from the system may cause unstable behavior  to assess the model performance predictive performance is utilized with days from may and may used as a test set using the samples from the posterior distribution the posterior predictive distribution was computed for each day of the test set and  posterior predictive intervals were created using the   and   quantiles the test data is then compared to the posterior predictive intervals for each of the endpoints another view of predictive performance is to examine pseudo-predictive-r which compares the predicted values with the actual values for the test set this calculation leads to a pseudo-predictive-r   which is slightly lower than the pseudo-r associated with the t of the model to the data in the training set but is still very high of course several other measures of predictive performance exist however this is the easiest to understand as it measures the amount of variation explained by the predictions across the test set this work has demonstrated how to build a seird model for the covid-outbreak in the state of qatar include interventions estimate model parameters and generate posterior predictive intervals using a bayesian framework furthermore the model is able to treat the susceptible and exposed compartment as latent variables as no data is observed about them other than approximate initial values the model ts the data quite well with a pseudo-r   and predicts reasonably well with pseudo-predictive-r    one can also note that in the model de nition no immigration emigration natural births and natural mortality were not included and based on the high psuedo-r would have a negligible e fect on t furthermore the model did not contain compartments for those who recovered without being con rmed infections as this was not observed one can only speculate on the impact that additional data would have on the model t however it would be very small the modeling paradigm is quite exible for modeling the covid-data as it easily incorporates interventions into the system and can quantify the impact of the intervention furthermore using simple di ferences the model can be used to predict new infections as well figure shows the plots of the new infections with predictive bands based on   and   based on  samples from the posterior prediction distribution at each time point notice that the model does well at capturing the jump at day and the bands capture most of the data the drop beginning at the intervention at day provides for the drop in daily infection rates another use of the model may be for long term predictions while this is extrapolation it does provide policy makers a tool for planning provided nothing changes ie no interventions are taken it also allows policy makers to see the possible long term e fects of their decisions figure shows the long-term predictions of the model if no other interventions are made past may  notice that the predictions do eventually decrease across the future time frame notice the width of the predictive bands for times farther in the future this re ects the uncertainty associated with extrapolating into the future however one item that we can calculate from this is a  predictive interval for the peak infection time by simply recording the maximum value for each of the predictive distribution trajectories from the mcmc samples one can obtain a distribution of the time for the maximum in this case this gives the  predictive interval for the maximum to be    this means that the peak infection time will be between day  june  and day  august  of the outbreak given that no other interventions or process changes occur fig also shows this interval given by the dark dashed vertical lines the width of the interval quanti es the uncertainty about where the maximum active infections will occur since the width of the interval is days this indicates that there is a large amount of uncertainty on when the number of active infections will begin to decline future work could be to add an overdispersion parameter into the model to allow for the more accurate capture of uncertainty furthermore one can perform simulation studies to better understand how the model may perform under various scenarios feature selection methods could be employed to select where the interventions should be placed as well as other forms of interventions could be included in the model another possibility to address any deviations from the standard model a semi-parametric technique could be studied as well quantiles from  samples from the posterior predictive distribution dark dashed vertical lines give the  predictive interval for the maximum active infections  multilevel integrated model with a novel systems approach mimansa for simulating the spread of covid-19 arpita welling abhilasha patel padmaj kulkarni vinay vaidya g  covid-19 has affected peoples lives all over the world it has created a perplexing situation about what actions one should and should not take mathematical modeling of biological systems is challenging and gives a different perspective especially in decision making under multiple complex scenarios public health officials grapple with multiple issues such as recommending a lockdown contact tracing promoting the mask usage social distancing and frequent handwashing as well as keeping the families of patients in isolation for the incubation period it is even more challenging to find the optimal combination of all of the above without the use of a suitable mathematical model there are many different approaches to modeling the spread of sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 some models are easy to use while others need extensive use of highend computers however models to assist public health officials decision making are hard to find in this paper we discuss a novel systems approach to building a model for simulating the spread of covid-19 the model mimansa divides an individuals in-person social interactions into three areas namely home workplace and public places while tracking the in-person interactions the model follows the virus spread internally the model labels healthy people who turn into silent carriers virus-infected patients or healthy carriers it tracks down to the smallest level of a single day interaction as and when a new silent carrier is created the model automatically expands and builds a network of virus spread all single-day blocks are integrated to get the final result mimansa is novel due to its ability to build a virus spread network as a multilevel integrated model and in the end enable one to make complex decisions with ease mimansa is trained and validated using the data from the wwwcovid-19indiaorg website it does not use any arbitrary constants all its parameters have a physical significance and are measurable once trained the parameter estimation is complete and the model is ready to run multiple scenarios mimansa has four control mechanisms that a user can use it helps one simulate the whatif scenarios the first one is to control the exposure level to the virus depending on the  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review number of hours spent with a silent carrier the second provides control over the infection rate or the probability of a healthy person getting infected in the presence of a silent carrier the third one allows the user to control lockdown effectiveness percentage and the fourth one gives control over quarantine percentage inside the model mimansa differentiates between virus-infected patients silent carriers and healthy carriers mimansa has the capability to consider variations in virus activity levels of every asymptomatic patient varying the exposure to the virus and varying the infection rate depending on the persons immunity mimansa can simulate scenarios to study the impact of many different conditions simultaneously mimansa assists public health officials in complex decision making enables scientists in projecting the sars-cov-2 virus spread and aids hospital administrators in management mimansa will play a significant role in finding the balance between the effect of strict lockdown on the economy vs the marginally high number of covid-19 patients with a bit relaxed lockdown  mathematical modeling of covid-19 coronavirus disease identified in 2019 is essential for many reasons it helps understand how covid-19 may grow what will be the scale of the number of cases in a given region and how to get ready for handling it another important aspect is that a good model will enable administrators to come up with the right public policies there are many questions that public policymakers have should one go for a lockdown of a city if so what is the correct duration before the lockdown is lifted what is the impact of identifying and isolating silent carriers how many hospital beds are required how many icu beds and how many ventilators are needed questions are related to the effect of an increase in the number of cases the impact of lockdown lifting of the lockdown mask usage social distancing contact tracing and isolation although there are many attempts by now to develop mathematical models of covid-19 it comes short of answering questions related to the impact of multiple measures and policies when they are implemented simultaneously in this paper we present a novel approach by considering the sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a conglomeration of multiple systems our model multilevel integrated model with a novel systems approach mimansa is built from epidemiological observations and data it is well known that studying the asymptomatic population is vital in the study of the spread of covid-19 the simulation of silent carriers is at the root of mimansa inside the model mimansa differentiates between virus-infected patients symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients it considers three groups of interaction and viral spread namely home workplace and public places it is built on globally acceptable observations related to the spread of sars-cov-2 it has provisions for simulating non-pharmaceutical interventions such the lockdown and quarantine it can also simulate scenarios to study the impact of following the recommended precautions such as mask usage social distancing and frequent hand washing once trained it can also highlight the deviations of lockdown compared to the nominal it has multiple features that enable studying several different scenarios mimansa can treat every sudden increase in the number of cases as a cluster and simulate it independently it goes down to the level of day-to-day interactions and continues to automatically expand the model depending on the presence of new silent carriers mimansa only requires knowing how many silent carriers are present at the start if it is not known it presumes that there is only one silent carrier its output continues to fuel the model to run until the last asymptomatic patient is cured the model not only considers the virus transmission from an asymptomatic patient but also takes in to account spread due to fomite contamination during the training phase mimansa estimates parameters to get the best fit to the actual data while running the simulations and what-if scenarios one can control some major parameters there is a lot of interest in the research community to help in the current covid-19 pandemic there are thousands of papers being published on covid-19 here we will review some of the papers related to modeling of the covid-19 there is a vast amount of literature available on the curve-based models these models include exponential gompertz bertalanffy and logistic all of them are prominent in different scenarios a good review of these four models is given by vaidya alexandro 30  all of these have been tried for covid-19 simulation the exponential model is one of the most widely used models for the growth of any organism although simple to use it has several drawbacks it presumes limitless growth although suitable for measuring early behavior it starts failing rapidly the growth in covid-19 patients does not follow the exponential curve it is more of a 3rd order polynomial than exponential growth gompertz equation is a classical model that puts limits on growth it is also known for replicating the initial growth period quite well however it lacks any physical significance to parameters 31  the most important in model development is to develop a model with parameters that have a physical significance this is the same philosophy we have used in the development of the model described in this paper von bertalanffy came up with a growth model that had some measurable physical parameters with significance in biology thus the usefulness of the model is more than other ad-hoc models von bertalanffy was the one who first proposed a systems approach to biology 3  jia et al 16 use gompertz bertalanffy and logistic equations for modeling the growth of covid-19 since all of these are good from a curve fitting perspective but they do not help in considering multiple scenarios that arise in the management of covid-19 the logistic equation is another popular model villalobos and mario use a generalized logistic equation and the gompertz equation for fitting covid-19 data from china 33  this model also suffers from the lack of having any significance to its parameters it does not have the capability to handle various issues such as lockdown quarantine etc time series analysis using the auto regressive moving average arma models is another popular approach this approach has been tried by deb et al 9 on covid-19 although it gives initial success in prediction the success does not last long when the growth rate of cases suddenly changes due to either a sudden outbreak or due to a group of people getting together in large numbers there is no provision for adding new silent carriers inherent in the arma model if there is a sudden increase in the numbers due to unknown external factors one has to recalculate the entire model fanelli and piazza 11 forecasted cases in china italy and france based on the classical sird model in this approach the susceptible s infected i recovered r and the dead d model every person who is going to be infected by the virus falls in one of the four categories then the equations are set up as first-order differential equations with one differential equation per stage wang et al 35 present their work on the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 they used the seird model for the wuhan data mandal et al 21 used an seir model and suggested that screening at the port of entry for india may result in some delay in getting the coronavirus in the country however screening at the port alone may not suffice in delaying the outbreak parodi and liu 24 also address the containment issue kucharski et al 1 studied the early dynamics of transmission they modeled sars-cov-2 using a geometric random walk process and monte carlo simulation grassly and fraser 22 have given a good review of mathematical models of infectious disease transmission klinkenberg et al 18 developed a model for contact tracing liang 17 uses differential equations and considers growth as proportional to the count of infected persons this formulation leads to the solution involving exponential terms thus the output becomes exponential however the spread of sars-cov-2 is like a binary tree and it leads to a curve that is in terms of the n raised to k as shown below it is not the type of equation as shown below n  n0 e -t cakir 4  models covid-19 based on edwards and penny 12  it is interesting to note that edwards and penny state in the book that the time-dependent change spreading rate of the h the number of individuals who have caught a contagious disease is proportional to the multiplication of the numbers of those who have caught the disease and those who have not 12  chen et al 6 developed a phase-based model this considers a bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission network for developing a model of sars-cov-2 transmission while doing research it is often difficult to get the right information and to get the right kind of data there are many good sites that help in this matter the cdc website 5 is one such site where you get answers to many questions for actual daily count we found the worldometers 39 to be a good site additionally website uptodate 36 and rothan et al 37 are good sources for epidemiological information the systems approach was first suggested by von bertalanffy 34  in this approach a system is broken down into small subsystems

studied the current understanding of the sars-cov-2 virus spread all the primary virus spread related observations useful for building the model are given below the virus spread occurs due to a virus carrier meeting a healthy person a healthy person may get infected if he touches a fomite observation 3 when allowed to operate without restrictions silent and healthy carriers are responsible for the spread of the virus for all reporting the unit of time is one day when covid-19 patients test positive they are counted in the total number of cases and this count goes into the total number of new cases identified on that day similarly every day new silent carriers are created observation 5 virus-infected persons do not come out as patients on day 1 there is a 2 to 14-day incubation period for sars-cov-2 it is observed that most patients start showing symptoms on 5th 6th or the 7th day after the infection 28 lauer et al 20 estimated the sars-cov-2 incubation period from wuhan data they concluded that in 975 of the cases which will eventually show symptoms will do so in 115 days the following assumptions are made for the development of the model 10  fig 1 shows the outcome of their

that have been contaminated by the virus and serve as a mode of transmission healthy carriers will test negative for sars-cov-2 we define three levels of exposure rates er the er 1 is the exposure level at the highest level the er 2 is the medium exposure level and the er 3 is the low exposure level the exposure rate is the probability of getting exposed while interacting with silent carriers

detailed list of the terminology and definitions used in this paper definitions with explanation cb the computational block inside which all calculations for a specific level and for a specific day

one of the outputs of the computational block all computational blocks are integrated at the end to get the final result the only interaction between the blocks is to transmit the virus through the silent carriers who meet yet another group of family colleagues and individuals in public places when one cycle of the day is over the sum of the silent carriers ssc and cumulative virus-infected patients cvp are reported by the public health administrators the computational blocks for that day are closed the next day the person p in our example meets the same people from group 1 and group 2 it is likely that p meets different people from public areas however for simplicity it is assumed that p meets the same people from the group 3 as well if one goes to the same grocery store catches the same bus or a train and meet the same people from each of these three groups some people get infected on day 1 itself but not all of them do the remaining healthy people from the previous day again interact the next day with the same silent carrier thus we need to treat these remaining healthy people differently in our simulation mimansa we transfer the remaining healthy people to another

the silent carriers coming from the top levels if we are at level 20 we add all the silent carriers from level 19 and going back to level 5 this covers 14 levels in the past the reason for going all the way up to 14 levels and no more is due to the incubation period of sars-cov-2 being 14 days there is no silent carrier that would continue to be a silent carrier beyond 14 days this is how the

quarantining the condition in the left decision block in fig 8 states that if a patient is found and if today the family quarantine policy is on then do not send any members to the next horizontal block as explained earlier computations in every horizontal block mean interactions among the same members as on the previous day the only difference is those who have been identified as virus-infected patients and those who have been quarantined will no longer be present to interact with others when family quarantine policy is enforced all members of the family that is the entire group 1 are isolated from the rest of the people thus the number of members passed to the next computational block in group 1 are zero under quarantine enforcement we have also considered one member of group1 who goes to the workplace and then mixes in public places as being group 2 and group 3 respectively since that one member is no longer interacting with people the input 2 to group 2 is zero and so is the input 3 however in the absence of the family quarantine policy input 1 is rhp1 the remaining family members who are not yet infected the input 2 is the same as rhp2 the remaining healthy

2020  in this study we have developed a model to study the number of cases of covid-19 the total system diagram involves multiple parameters we have derived some parameters based on actual data available on the covid19indiaorg website while values of other parameters are taken from literature in some cases we had to use the best judgment to ensure that the values are likely to occur in real life the following is a list of assumptions 1 it is assumed that infected people remain in the cycle for 14 days they are considered as either recovered or deceased the incubation period for covid-19 is considered to be 14 days as per the cdc guidelines 14 days should be the period of quarantine science daily website the peak activity is between 5 to 7 days this is as per the median of the study reported by the science daily similar numbers are reported in various references 2 the data used for training the model was from march 1 2020 up to may 3 2020 3 all workplaces except for essential services are closed during the lockdown in india people are allowed to go within walking distance to buy groceries and medicines this lockdown started from march 25 2020 however slowly people started abiding by it thus we have gradually changed the value of the lockdown percentage 4 the infection rate ir was calculated using the data from covid19india india data2020 extensive contact tracing was done in india all data related to the traced contact is also part of the dataset thus one can find out how many people were infected by one individual using del valles study 10  we know that on average a person meets 22 people by taking the ratio of people infected to the number of people met one gets ir the calculated value of ir is 012 we have adjusted it to 0105 during the data training stage 5 the value of ir reported in germany is 28 and in the us it is 34 26 6 the number of people in each of the 3 groups are selected as follows in general it is reasonable to assume that a family consists of 4 people at the workplace one meets a limited number of people compared to in public places as per del valle 10 one meets 22 people every day with that total in mind we select 8 people at the workplace and 10 people in public places although these numbers may vary in individual cases on average it appears to be a reasonable distribution 7 for selecting the exposure rate we calculated the actual exposure rate among italian doctors in a survey 8  italian doctors reported that 108 out of 272 had symptoms of covid-19 out of the 272 gps only 125 had direct contact with a confirmed covid-19 patient the ratio of those who had symptoms to those who were exposed is 0864 since er 1 indicates the highest level of exposure we can choose a number close to 078  cc-by-nc-nd 40

range 2 to 3 by tanu singhal 29  12 asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus yet they continue to show negative on the sars-cov-2 test 15 13 we conducted several simulations to get the best fit for the india data every parameter was adjusted carefully by keeping the values within the practical limits to ensure that the best-fit parameters are not merely a numerical play but represent reality as closely as possible 14 there are different opinions about the role of asymptomatic patients in the spread of sars-cov-2 the initial thought process was that asymptomatic patients do not spread the virus however now there is evidence that asymptomatic people can infect others bai et al 2  hu et al 13  since there is still no concurrence on the percentages we consider that the virus transmission from symptomatic patients is 20 we have also considered that asymptomatic patients are 50 of all the patients thus 20 of 50 gives 10 of the total this is the reduction factor rf  the probability distribution functions are used on virus patients as well as the silent carriers these distributions simulate the effect of the incubation period we have considered that the silent carriers take less time compared to the virus-infected patients for coming out of the incubation period this was selected during the training phase to give the best fit to the data  mortality in hospital admitted patients could be calculated as the ratio of the number of deaths and the number of people admitted as in equation 11  it is also known that the number of people admitted to the hospital is patients

with 22 people and the virus is spread during these interactions while one gets in contact with a silent carrier it does not necessarily mean that everyone will catch the virus the same day and get infected the possibility of infection depends on several factors such as the distance between the infected person during the interaction contacting the droplets infected with the virus touching fomites rubbing eyes nose and mouth with infected hands individuals immunity co-morbidity age and the hours of exposure all these facts are a part of mimansa mimansa uses multiple parameters as inputs it is based on the current understanding of the disease this understanding will certainly improve as time goes by once understanding improves the parameters will have to be changed the model can predict for any number of days as one wishes however with the possibility of a new vaccine herd immunity and antibody tests the parameters will need to be recalculated thus in all the simulations shown under the results section we have made predictions for additional 30 days the two main parameters that control the count of the number of cases are the exposure rate and the infection rate in section 3 equation1 also shows that the prominent terms that could increase the virus-infected patients vp are the exposure rate and the infection rate both these parameters are explained in detail below the exposure rate is a measure of how much a person gets exposed to a virus when in contact with a silent carrier it is a function of multiple factors the exposure depends on the duration of the meeting the number of contacts the virus activity level at the time of the contact mask usage social distancing hand washing etc exposure depends on what level of precautions individuals take people wearing a mask keeping the prescribed social distance and washing hands frequently will undoubtedly reduce the exposure level the individual exposure risk goes down when one follows the recommended practices the overall exposure levels go down for the community if the community follows the recommended practices it is certainly possible that most people will follow these basic rules thus even if one comes in contact with a carrier the exposure rate er 1 will be less for those who follow the rules compared to the people who do not follow the rules in general the infection rate depends on the immunity of the exposed person the virus count the air volume surrounding the two etc immunity certainly plays a major role in the infection rate there are two types of antibodies one is called the immunoglobulin m igm and the other is called the immunoglobulin g igg the igm is for short-term defense while the igg is for long-term protection the igg is retained for a long time and when the igg antibodies are found it builds immunity as of may 12 2020 scientists are busy developing antibody tests once approved and widely used we will get data on it the additional factors that would change the immunity would be the herd immunity and vaccine availability the availability of the covid-19 antibody tests will also ease out the current pressures of this pandemic  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

doctors and scientists conduct tests the new data will help us to account for immunity as an impact factor in mimansa mimansa is a self-driven model as a starting point mimansa needs to know the presence of silent carriers the simulator starts with the number of silent carriers as its input once started it will continue to build the virus spread network as more and more people come in contact with the initial silent carriers in this process it creates more and more silent carriers these newly created silent carriers have their contacts or network they mix with people in the other networks and it fuels the growth of the virus the only way to stop this cycle is to break the link in more than one way it would involve multiple methods from isolating potential silent carriers or reducing the exposure by social distancing or using a mask or washing hands frequently and touching eyes mouth and nose or self-imposed isolation from others one of the biggest strengths of mimansa is that it represents the observed reality the model is flexible and easy to modify when new observations are known and when discoveries take place it uses the exposure rate and the infection rate as the main driving factors the understanding will continue to improve in the real world and it can be quickly updated in mimansa mimansa is not a covid19 specific model it is a generic model that simulates the virus spread to adapt mimansa to another virus one has to change the exposure rates the applied pdfs the incubation period the infection rate and perhaps some assumptions to reflect the characteristics of a new virus mimansa helps one simulate scenarios to study the impact of many different conditions it assists public health officials in complex decision making enables scientists in projecting the sars-cov-2 virus spread and aids hospital administrators in the management of covid-19 patients better in this paper we have given a detailed description of how a multilevel integrated model for the spread of covid-19 is built using a systems approach we designed the system by keeping the real world view in perspective at all times daily in-person interactions were split into three layers namely family workplace and public places these interactions form the basis of person-to-person virus transmission every day was built as a computational block connected to other layers through the silent carriers coming out of the block each day comprises of many layers of computation blocks a complex network of the virus spread was built block-by-block and layer-by-layer the multiple layers were integrated to give a complete system view all parameters have physical significance in the real world  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

to propose strategies for effectively dealing with pandemics the covid-19 example helena herrmann a jean-marc schwartz  the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is overwhelming many health-care systems as a result epidemiological models are being used to inform policy on how to effectively deal with this pandemic we note that the majority of existing models do not take into account differences in the amount of interactions between individuals ie the underlying human interaction network using network science we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies although applicable to disease modelling in general our results emphasize how network science can improve the predictive power of current covid-19 epidemiological models we provide commented source code for all our analyses so that they can easily be integrated into current and future epidemiological models  the coronavirus disease 2019  first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 has spread globally sun et al 2020  overwhelming many national health care systems with an increasing number of serious and potentially life-threatening infections anderson et al 2020  as a result the majority of governments have imposed mitigation and suppression strategies such as social distancing and lock-down measures to better control the spread of the virus to ensure the effectiveness of these strategies various epidemiological models are used to predict the spread of covid-19 and to inform government policies hellewell et al 2020 sameni 2020 radulescu and cavanagh 2020 simha et al 2020 zhao and chen 2020  most commonly these models follow a general susceptible-infected-removed sir framework kermack and mckendrick 1927 bailey 1975 sameni 2020  infected individuals can only transmit the virus to susceptible individuals once infected individuals have recovered or have passed away they can no longer infect others and cannot be reinfected with regards to covid-19 the sir model is often expanded to an seir model which considers an additional exposed e stage during which individuals have been infected but are not yet contagious radulescu and cavanagh 2020 wu et al 2020  many additional parameters including clustering luo et al 2020  age-heterogeneity chang et al 2020 radulescu and cavanagh 2020  changes in policy and control measures sameni 2020 zhao and chen 2020  and even meteorology jia et al 2020 have been incorporated into the sir and seir framework in an attempt to increase the predictive power of these models furthermore there are models that consider an inherent randomness or stochasticity in the events that influence the model outcomes hellewell et al 2020 kucharski et al 2020 simha et al 2020  however none of the above models currently predicting the covid-19 pandemic take into consideration the structure underlying the human interaction network networks can be used to represent connections between individuals a network of 10000 nodes for example can be used to describe 10000 individuals the nodes in the network are connected by edges which represent the interaction between those nodes two nodes sharing the same edge are considered to directly interact with one another and are referred to as neighbouring nodes the number of edges of a node is referred to as the degree of that node eg a node with two edges has a degree of 2 nodes with many edges and thus many neighbours are referred to as hubs it is critical to note that from a network analysis perspective hubs do not necessarily refer to social gatherings hubs refer to individuals with many connections to other individuals these connections do not necessarily occur at the same time for example a doctor who individually meets with 30 patients per day is considered a hub of 30 ie a node of degree 30 current covid-19 models are based on differential equations or random diffusions which assume that human interaction behaviours are generally homogeneous ie alike it is however welldocumented that many biological interactions including human face-to-face communications are not homogeneous and not random barabasi 2009 cattuto et al 2010 zhao and bianconi 2011 zhang and li 2012  in fact the degree distribution of nodes which captures differences in the number of connections between nodes in a biological network can often be described by a powerlaw barabasi and albert 1999  a power-law describes a relationship whereby one quantity varies as the power of another eg the area of a square quadruples when the size of its sides is doubled in networks this property arises when there are few nodes with many edges and many nodes with few edges networks with this kind of property are known as scale-free the rate of infection of covid-19 has previously been shown to follow a power-law ziff and ziff 2020 li et al 2020  yet so far scale-free networks have not been considered to model the disease when a disease spreads through a network the infected nodes i can spread the disease only to their susceptible neighbours s who can then spread the disease to their susceptible neighbours and so on using network science dezso and barabasi 2002 have previously identified that the best possible way to stop a virus from spreading in a scale-free network is to bias policies towards hubs ie heavily connected nodes in the network they showed this using a susceptible-infected-susceptible sis model -a model that is arguably more suitable for the spread of computer viruses than infectious diseases here we re-assess the predictions of dezso and barabasi 2002 using an sir model with the model parameters tailored specifically towards covid-19 our results demonstrate how mitigation strategies that directly target hubs in the network are far more effective than strategies that randomly decrease the number of connections between individuals for example reducing the total number of interactions that each individual in the network can have is potentially more effective than mitigating the number of interactions that an individual can have at the same time although we have chosen model parameters that are based on the current covid-19 pandemic the model results cannot be considered a reliable prediction of the spread of this pandemic instead they illustrate how network topology can improve the predictive power of such models we propose that network topology should be combined with dynamic approaches in order to strengthen the predictive power of future pandemic models piccardi and casagrandi 2009  we further demonstrate how network topology can be used to suggest mitigation and containment strategies in this sense the results are generally applicable to a wide range of contagious infectious diseases we set up a scale-free network using the barabasi and albert 1999 algorithm for a population of 10000 see method and materials for details the network is set up such that the majority of nodes in the network have less than n connections due to the scale-free structure of the network there are some nodes that are heavily connected and have far more than n connections these nodes are hereafter referred to as hubs the value of n is an arbitrary cut-off and is dependent on the network structure here we set n8 so that hubs represent the 5-10 most connected nodes fig s1  all nodes in the network were initially set to be in the susceptible s state randomly the state of one node was changed to the infected i state representing patient zero thereafter at each time point the infected nodes can infect any of their neighbouring nodes changing their state from s to i this transmission can occur from 2-14 days after a node was infected lauer et al 2020  the probability of transmission is highest from the 4 th to the 6 th day after being infected  after the 2-14 days of possible transmission infected nodes i change to the removed r state nodes in the r state cannot become reinfected and can no longer infect others we then ran one set of models using the original scale-free network we ran another set of models for which all hubs in the network had been contained we randomly selected and retained 8 edges of each hub and removed all others in this mitigated scenario all nodes have a degree of 8 or less we refer to this scenario as mitigation hub to compare mitigation strategies that specifically target hubs to general mitigation strategies we calculated the average number of edges that were removed in the mitigation strategy we generated a third set of networks where we removed the same number of edges randomly within the scale-free network we refer to this scenario as mitigation random we ran the sir model on all three network types scale-free mitigation hub and mitigation random figure 1 demonstrates how the number of susceptible infected and removed nodes changes over time there are two general outcomes in all three models i the infection dies out quickly and does not spread throughout the network or ii the number of removed nodes becomes high enough such that the spread of the infection is contained in outcome i the majority of the population remains susceptible in ii the majority of the population is infected and removed ie has recovered or passed away in outcome ii the population achieves a state known as herd immunity anderson and may 1986 kwok et al 2020  whereby a high enough percentage of the population is immune to stop the virus from spreading an illustrative example of the outcomes is provided from a network point of view in figure s2  the distributions of the final state of the nodes in all model outcomes are shown in figure 2a  the outcomes of the mitigated hub and mitigated random networks are similar in that they require a lower number of removed nodes to achieve herd immunity when compared to the outcomes of the scale-free network however the outcome of achieving herd immunity is also less likely when running the sir model on the two mitigated networks than on the original scale-free network   cc-by-nc-nd 40

removed from the scale-free network such that all nodes have no more than 8 connections mitigated random where the same number of edges were removed randomly b final states of the two model outcomes no herd immunity -where the infection dies out early before spreading and the majority of the population remains susceptible herd immunity -where the infection stops spreading because the majority of the population is immune 5000 model simulations were run for 170 days when running the sir model on the scale-free network over 80 of the population needs to become infected in order for herd immunity to be achieved fig 1a  in the mitigated scenarios herd immunity can be achieved with around 70-75 of the population becoming infected fig  1bc  this is because the number of connections between nodes is limited when specifically limiting the connections of hubs the rate at which the virus spreads through the network is slowed down fig 1b  fig 3  when removing hubs from the network the onset of more than 1 of the population being infected occurs later than with any of the other networks fig 3a  also in the mitigated hub scenario the rate of infection is slower such that at the peak of infection a significantly lower percentage of nodes is infected with the virus p  001 fig 3b  this means that when the sir model is run on the mitigated hub network the time for which more than 1 of the population is infected is longer and the peak of infection occurs later in time fig s3  thus the curve is flatter fig 1b  the onset of more than 1 of the population being infected occurs just after the first hub has been infected fig 3a  for the mitigated hub network which contains no hubs the time of onset at which more than 1 of the population becomes infected is more varied as indicated by the wider distribution shown in orange time at which more than 1 of the population is infected in the herd immunity outcome the sir model was run on the three networks scale-free the original network mitigated hub where edges were removed from the scale-free network such that all nodes have no more than 8 connections mitigated random where the same number of edges were removed randomly a

population of 10000 individuals thus representing a small community including more individuals into the networks would not change the proportionality of our results however previous network analyses have suggested that networks representing human interactions across wider geographical regions should consider transitivity serrano and boguna 2006 friemel 2011  transitivity is a measure of the density of connections in a network wasserman and faust 1994  the higher the transitivity of a network the more dense are its connections we calculated the transitivity for all our generated networks and found that when network transitivity is high the peak of infection rises and ceases sooner fig 4  networks with no hubs mitigation hub are the least densely connected network and thus the peak of infection is flatter fig 1  4  the effect of network transitivity on the spread of an infection transitivity of the generated networks scale-free in red -the original network mitigated hub in orange

infected in the herd immunity outcome and b against the total time for which more than 1 of the population is infected in the herd immunity outcome 300 model simulations were run for 170 days we have shown that incorporating a scale-free network structure of human interactions into an sir model of covid-19 can provide novel insights into the potential strategies and policies for mitigating and suppressing the spread of the virus our results demonstrate that targeting hubs in a network has the potential to slow down the rate of infection and to flatten the curve removing hubs from a scale-free network markedly reduces the number of infected individuals at a time and could therefore reduce the strain on health care systems if implemented early on we show that removing edges from hubs rather than from random locations in the network is a more successful strategy for slowing down the spread of the virus thus limiting the total number of interactions that each individual in a network can have could be an effective policy when trying to reduce the number of infections at a time we further demonstrate that the onset of the peak of infection occurs shortly after the first hub is infected if by chance no hub is infected early on then the infection dies out or the peak is noticeably delayed until a hub is infected these results align with data coming from italy which suggest that the covid-19 epidemic must have entered the region far earlier than when the first case was officially detected cereda et al 2020  according to their study the virus could have circulated for several weeks with the number of infected people remaining low until it started to rise sharply our results further align with those obtained by dezso and barabasi 2002 who modelled the spread of a virus using an sis model and suggested targeting hubs as a primary mitigation strategy their model however does not provide the option of a herd immunity outcome as it does not consider a removed state all of our sir models present two possible outcomes either the infection dies out quickly and the majority of the population remains susceptible or the majority of the population gets infected and herd immunity forces the virus to stop spreading if vaccines are available herd immunity can be achieved quicker vaccines would allow nodes in the network to move from a susceptible straight into a removed ie recovered state unfortunately no vaccine for covid-19 is available at the time of writing amanat and krammer 2020 pompetchara et al 2020  we did not opt for an seir model but instead set the probability of infection very low for the first few days after contracting the virus this matches the current available data on covid-19 and has a similar effect as an seir model would have furthermore we did not distinguish between recovered and passed away in the models from a modelling perspective whether a node recovers or dies has the same implication it cannot get reinfected nor can it spread the virus from a human health perspective the fact that the number of removed nodes is likely to include a number of deaths depending on the fatality of the virus paints a potentially sombre picture for the model outcomes in which herd immunity is achieved for covid-19 the current case fatality rates of germany and italy were calculated to be 02 and 77 respectively lazzerini and putoto 2020  evidently these figures are dependent on the number of cases tested as well as other factors anyway the potential magnitude of fatality rates implied by these numbers does suggest that mitigation strategies that lower the number of infected people required for herd immunity may be necessary to keep high-risk citizens safe from the infection in this case a combination of hub specific and equally applied mitigation ie random strategies should be considered hub specific mitigation strategies are more likely to lower the peak of infection whereas equally applied mitigation strategies are more likely to increase the number of individuals that never contract the disease evidently the results of our model come with a set of assumptions that are not necessarily valid under the current and evolving circumstances of the spread of covid-19 for example our network analysis considers the number of connections to be constant across time this however is unlikely given that even without government enforced policies individuals are likely to reduce their face-to-face interactions once they fall ill workers providing essential services like healthcare and delivery personnel on the other hand may increase their number of interactions with the spread of the virus this could result in hubs becoming even more connected over time furthermore both our discussed mitigation strategies are applied before the onset of the infection in order to illustrate a point a more pragmatic model should consider how network dynamics and policies enforced during the pandemic can alter the degree distribution of the network over time piccardi and casagrandi 2009 barrat et al 2013  we showed that the transitivity in a network ie the density of its connections correlates with the sharpness of the infection peak the onset of the peak occurs later and is slowed down in networks where hubs have been removed because these networks have a reduced transitivity however our results did not take into account modularity also known as community structure previous research has shown that a community structure in networks can reduce the risk of a pandemic eguiluz and klemm 2002 huang and li 2007 stegehuis et al 2016  we therefore recommend that when upscaling our approach to model the spread of an infection across a wider geographical network community structures are implemented in conclusion we here present a fundamental example for why the network structure that underlies human interactions should be taken into consideration when modelling the spread of a virus such covid-19 we emphasize that the model results should not be used as predictions of the spread of covid-19 but as a guide on how current epidemiological models could be improved incorporating network science with the current dynamic models of covid-19 is likely to improve their predictive power doing so will allow for better-informed suggestions for disease mitigation and suppression such as reducing the number of hubs in a network strategies that consider the underlying network structure of human interactions will allow the implementation of more tailored policies attempting to effectively deal with covid-19 and other pandemics barabasi and albert 1999 graphs of 10000 nodes were generated using the igraph version 080 package in python version 369 with a power of 1 and an edge per node connectivity of 2 these are scale-free networks and the node degree distribution follows a power law eg fig s1  we then generated a set of networks where we removed all hubs from the original scale-free versions if a node in the scale-free network contained more than 8 edges we randomly removed edges from that node such that it only had 8 edges left in total we refer to these networks as mitigated hub networks when generating 5000 mitigated hub networks we removed on average 4613 edges per network as a control we also generated a set of networks where we removed that same amount of edges randomly ie not targeting hubs we refer to these networks as mitigated random networks in total we generated 3 sets of networks scale-free mitigated hub and mitigated random we generated 5000 networks of each set network properties such as transitivity were also calculated using the igraph package the nodes of the networks can be either in a susceptible s an infected i or a removed r state initially all nodes were set to be in state s then at the first time point we randomly choose one of the nodes in the network to be in the infected state this node represents patient zero who first contracts the virus from a non-human source we then update the model such that at each iterating time point infected nodes can infect their susceptible neighbouring nodes with a given probability p infected nodes can remain infected for 2 to 14 days lauer et al 2020  the length of time that a node is infected is randomly chosen with equal probability once the node is no longer infectious it is set to be in the r state and cannot be infected again the probability with which each infected node can spread the virus to its susceptible neighbours peaks at around 5 days after contracting the infection to match the current available data for covid-19  we set p  00100101020303030250201501005001001 representing the probability of infection on each of the 14 days respectively all models are run to completion ie until the infection dies out once the infection dies out all nodes are either in the r or s state we ran the here described sir model on each of the generated networks see network generation we used the kruskal-wallis test as implemented in the scipy package version 141 to test for significant differences between distributions the code used to generate all of the data presented in this study is available on github

impact of covid-19 cases and deaths in us counties nivedita mukherji  this paper uncovers the socioeconomic and healthlifestyle factors that can explain the differential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on different parts of the united states using a dynamic panel model with daily reported number of cases for us counties over a 20-day period the paper develops a vulnerability index for each county from an epidemiological model of disease spread county-level economic demographic and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country these factors are also used in a zero-inflated negative binomial pooled model to examine the number of reported deaths the paper finds that counties with high per capita personal income have high incidence of both reported cases and deaths the unemployment rate is negative for deaths implying that places with low unemployment rates or higher economic activity have higher reported deaths counties with higher income inequality as measured by the gini coefficient experienced more deaths and reported more cases there is a remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports counties with high concentrations of non-hispanic blacks native americans and immigrant populations have higher incidence of both cases and deaths the distribution of health risk factors such as obesity diabetes smoking are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties counties with higher numbers of primary care physicians have lower deaths and so do places with lower hospital stays for preventable causes the stay-at-home orders are found to be associated with places of higher cases and deaths implying that they were perhaps imposed far too late to have contained the virus in the places with high-risk populations it is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review  the novel coronavirus also known as covid-19 has brought the global economy to a screeching halt it is sweeping through the united states and the country has now taken a lead in not only the total number of positive cases but in terms of the number of reported deaths as well new yorks total number of cases exceeds the total number reported for any country including china the virus is believed to have originated in wuhan china in late 2019 as the virus spread through wuhan and the rest of china it raised alarms across the scientific communities and governments around the world with every passing day the virus continued to spread exponentially the impact of the virus in the united states started to grab public attention from late february and many states started imposing stay-at-home orders in mid-march 2020 the dramatic increase in the number of infected patients in a nursing home in seattle washington stunned a nation and made evident the contagiousness of the virus and its lethality while the national attention was focused on seattle the virus was taking a deadly hold in new york city and its surroundings with every passing day one state after another started announcing their first reported cases no us state has been spared however the spread of the virus has been anything but uniform figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of reported cases across us counties in april 2020 this paper attempts to uncover the socioeconomic conditions that are dominant in the areas with the high number of cases and deaths the literature on the transmission of infectious diseases often finds that highest impact areas have low income poor sanitary conditions and poor health care conditions due to their focus on viruses that have significantly impacted developing countries campos et al 2018 for zika redding et al 2019 for ebola are recent examples moore et al 2017 used ebola to develop an infectious disease vulnerability index for countries in africa the literature on the socioeconomic determinants of the spread of infectious diseases in developed countries is not extensive - adda 2016 is an exception using data from france it offers an extensive analysis of the transmission of three viruses -2 influenza gastroenteritis and chickenpox the paper asks the important questions whether virus spread more rapidly during periods of economic growth and if their spread follows a gradient determined by economic factors using data from france adda 2016 finds that the viruses studied indeed propagated faster during times of economic boom due to increased economic activity and contact between people qiu 2020 have conducted a similar analysis for wuhan china both papers find a positive relationship between the spread of the virus and economic activity avery et al 2020 offers a list of resources both in terms of relevant research and data sources for researchers unlike some of the literature cited above that concentrate on the impact of mitigation andor containment strategies along with economic conditions such as gdp employment and weather-related factors such as temperatures and pollution wu 2020 this paper focuses on economic demographic and health conditions in explaining the number of cases and deaths in the us figure 1 clearly indicates that the spread of the virus has been in regions of high economic activity on the two coasts the virus has arrived on the us shores through international travel while the initial spread of the virus is expected to be triggered by international travel and economic activity it is important to understand whether its continued spread and concentration is restricted to such places as the lockdown continues and the medical profession is trying to understand the susceptibility of individuals in contracting the disease this paper attempts to understand the underlying socioeconomic conditions of the geographic regions around the us that make them susceptible to becoming hotspots this is related to the question about the factors that determine the gradient followed by the virus as it spreads through the country introducing heterogeneity that captures region-specific uniqueness in an epidemiological model of disease spread the paper develops a vulnerability index for the counties included in the study these indexes capture the underlying factors that impact the vulnerability of a region to the virus economic demographic and healthlifestyle factors are used to explain the observed differences in the vulnerability index these factors are also used to explain the differences in the number of deaths reported across the countries the results indicate 3  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review that the underlying demographic and healthlifestyle factors have a more significant impact in explaining deaths than disease spread this is not a surprising result since the spread of the virus does not depend on a persons ethnicity or education status once people contract the disease however the health outcome depends on a multitude of factors that go beyond an individuals control the paper uses available county level data to identify economic demographic and healthlifestyle risk factors for different parts of the us the paper finds that people in regions of high economic activity and economic inequality are particularly at elevated risk of both disease spread and mortality there is a remarkable parallel between the spread of the disease and distanceweighted distribution of passengers arriving at international airports the demographic distribution in terms of race shows higher vulnerability both in terms of disease contraction and death for non-hispanic blacks native americans and immigrants counties with higher numbers of personal care physicians per 1000 individuals have lower deaths and so do places with fewer preventable cases of hospital stays some of the high risk factors such as obesity diabetes are found to have a more mixed result this can be partly explained by the fact that many of these risk factors have a high degree of concentration in many of the southern states these states have not reported as many cases or deaths as the regions around new york detroit chicago and the western states of california and washington the paper includes the number of days since the onset of stay-at-home orders issued by governors at the state level across the country this variable is not found to be statistically significant in influencing the vulnerability index in the spread of the virus regions that have longer stay-at-home orders have experienced higher number of deaths these regions would have experienced much higher number of cases and deaths without those orders it is likely that they were imposed too late to have been successful in containing the virus this paper has identified socioeconomic and healthlifestyle factors that have played a critical role in helping the virus to develop a stronghold in certain parts of the country and cause high fatalities it is true that a single gathering of individuals can lead to a spike in the number of cases and large number of deaths in a region the members of the coronavirus task force 4 are monitoring where a sudden spike is occurring as data on cases and deaths are collected it is important to be able to better predict if the population of a certain area is particularly vulnerable to the disease this paper shows that it is possible to develop a vulnerability index both for disease spread and deaths based on the socioeconomic composition of the population and their healthlifestyle choices developing such a profile will be particularly important as the various parts of the country contemplate lifting stay-at-home orders before the invention of a therapeutic or a vaccine recent experience suggests that infectious diseases are a major threat to both the health and economic well being of people around the world in spite of the experience with hini sars and ebola countries such as the united states did not develop a coherent infrastructure or strategy to determine which parts of the country are at particularly higher risk of disease transmission this paper shows that it is possible to utilize the economic demographic and lifestyle profiles of regions to develop a risk factor for each geographical area so that when the next epidemic arises public officials are better prepared to anticipate where the hotspots are likely to arise and take the necessary containment steps the experience with covid-19 shows how rapidly an infectious disease can bring an economy down without advance preparation the next disease will be just as difficult to contain as this the large differences within state boundaries show the importance of developing more local strategies that take into consideration a multitude of factors the coronavirus pandemic has impacted all 50 states in the united states the experience of each state county and city has been anything but homogeneous to understand this differential effect across counties in the us we consider two sets of factors epidemiological models explain how an infectious disease evolves in a region based on population and the size of the pool of infected individuals we will use epidemiological models such as the sir model to determine the fundamental differences in cases based on population size and number of 5  cc-by 40

posted may 8 2020  infections these factors alone cannot explain the entire heterogeneous outcomes across the country we expect differences in types and amounts of economic activities living conditions demographic makeups and lifestyle choices to determine the vulnerabilities of communities in the spread of a highly contagious virus such as the coronavirus we will conduct this analysis in two steps in the first step an epidemiological model of disease spread will be used to generate estimates of a vulnerability index for each county once population and infections are accounted for in the second step we will use county level economic demographic and health data to explain differences in the vulnerability indexes across counties epidemiological models of the sir type such as in

parameter for the time variable and u it is the error for county i at time t the lagged value of the cases shows that the number reported in any day depends on the numbers reported the previous day estimation of the above regression will generate parameter values  for each county these values will reflect the county-specific fixed effects that influence the vulnerability of each county to the virus from these fixed effects we generate a vulnerability index for each county this approach is similar to the one used by mukherji and silberman 2013 in studying patent citations between metro areas in the us in the second step of the analysis we use county-level economic demographic and health care factors to explain how they influence the vulnerability index for each county the factors that may explain the county vulnerability index are classified into three groups the first group of factors relate to the economic conditions and include factors such as per capita personal income the unemployment rate the level of income inequality poverty access to housing and concentration of different types of industries such as manufacturing mining and others the second group of factors relate to a set of demographic factors including the size of the population and its density the racial profile of the counties the age distribution of the population and the percentage of the population that was born outside the united states the third group of factors considered include health or lifestyle related factors such as the number of primary care physicians per capita the percentage of the population with obesity and diabetes the percentage of the population that smokes and drinks the percentage of the population with inactive lifestyles in addition to the county level economic demographic and health data spatial factors are considered as well the contagious nature of the disease compels one to consider the spillover effects to neighboring counties we introduce inverse-distance weighted values of the number of international passengers served by the top 46 international airports in the contiguous us since the virus is presumed to have originated in china and then spread to other parts of the world including europe before taking a hold in the united states international passenger data is introduced to examine if proximity to international airports is related to the concentration 7  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 8 2020  of confirmed cases while international passengers often arrive at a particular airport and then use domestic airlines to travel to other parts of the country the locations of the international airports are closely tied to areas with concentrations of activities that are globally oriented consequently a large number of the international passengers served by these airports are expected to interact in the regions around these airports using a 300-mile radius around each county where the airports are located an inverse-distance matrix is used to assign the number of international passengers in the areas surrounding the airports the bottom part of figure   1 displays the weighted distribution of international passengers while this data is unrelated to the number of confirmed covid-19 cases the spatial distribution of the passenger data is similar to the spatial distribution of confirmed covid-19 cases the estimation of the impact of these regional factors in explaining differences in vulnerabilities to the disease will be based on equation 2 in the above equation v i represents the vulnerability index of county i e ki represents the set of k economic variables that makes a county susceptible to the spread of the disease due to the enhanced interactions between people and working in close proximity although the economic activity of a county changes with time the general distribution of such activities across the country remains relatively stable within short periods of time d m represents the demographic factors and h n represent the health-care factors discussed above this equation includes a spatially weighted number of international passengers in the region by multiplying an inverse distance-weighted matrix w with the number of international passengers i served by an international airport in the neighborhood of county i this paper uses county-level data for the united states the data on covid-19 cases and deaths is obtained from the covid tracking data provided by the new york times and johns hopkins university figure 1 displays the distribution of cases in the 2512 counties

posted may 8 2020  for local spillover effects of the virus in the form of increased susceptibility due to higher prevalence of cases an inverse distance weighted matrix was created with positive weights assigned upto a 300 mile radius around a county this radius is just large enough to ensure that each county in the study had at least one other county in the study as a neighbor the previous section explained that the foundation of the analysis of the socioeconomic factors that can contribute to the spread and concentration of the coronavirus in the various parts of the country lies in the epidemiological model of disease transmission the first step is to generate county-level vulnerability measures from an estimation of equation 1 cc-by 40 international license it is made available

proportion of the population that is susceptible at any time t the incubation period for this virus is estimated to be anywhere between 2 to 14 days people are infections a few days before they develop symptoms and after they develop symptoms we assume a 7 day lag for the results reported in the paper sensitivity analysis was conducted for different lag lengths equation 1 stephen 1981  a difference gmm estimation is found to be the best option for the data the allerano-bond estimation method arellano and bond 1991 that uses lagged values as instruments as implemented by roodman 2006 was used results are reported in table 2  the results show that although autocorrelation of the first order exists there is no second order autocorrelation the sargan and hansen tests of no overidentification of instruments are satisfied and the f statistic shows that the model fits the data well the table shows that the one period lagged number of cases has a significant impact on the number of cases reported on any day the interaction of the infected and susceptible population is also significant and positive one of the key objectives of this regression is to obtain a set of estimates for the county level fixed effects the method of dynamic panel estimation that utilizes first differencing removes the impact of time-invariant variables such as the time-invariant fixed effects these are however recoverable from the residuals it is to be noted that for a dynamic panel model of the form y it  y it1  a i  e it  the residual it  a i  e it    y it  the average i can be

physicians have reportedly fewer deaths the remaining results related to health indicators are as follows -places with more preventable hospital stays higher percentage of the population that has diabetes smokes and are physically inactive have higher reported deaths these are not surprising since people with underlying health risks are expected to experience more severe reactions to the infection counties with higher obesity and percentage of the population that engages in excessive drinking have fewer deaths the coefficients of the region codes 2-4 are less than 1 indicating that relative to the excluded region the northeast the other regions had smaller incidence of death the results show that the economic factors are important for explaining the differential impacts experienced by counties across the country both in terms of confirmed cases and deaths reported the demographic and health related factors are more pronounced in the estimation of deaths than reported cases this is not surprising since the virus does not discriminate 14  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

depends on underlying health and demographic factors this paper has examined the differential experience of infections and deaths across the united states due to the covid-19 pandemic daily reported cases of confirmed cases and deaths were examined over a 20 day period from march 30 through april 19 2020 although data is available for over 2700 counties this paper focused on 771 counties that reported an average of 30 cases over the 20 day period the counties that are not included in the study had far fewer cases and reported deaths the counties that remain in the sample includes a vastly diverse set of counties the excluded counties are largely similar in the small number of cases and reported deaths and added significant costs in terms of computational complexity without adding much in terms of added value the analysis of the number of cases is based on an epidemiological model in which we included a county fixed effect this is a novel way to introduce heterogeneity in such a model as noted by avery et al 2020  the epidemiological models do not include the heterogeneity that economic models require a dynamic panel regression of the number of cases included the potential number of interactions between susceptible and infected individuals as a proportion of the population along with county fixed effects the results of the model were used to construct a vulnerability index for each county economic demographic and healthlifestyle factors were used to explain the differences in the vulnerability index across the counties the results showed that counties with higher economic activity have higher vulnerability the results show that regions around international airports experienced higher numbers of cases than ones that are over 300 miles away this is consistent with the fact that the virus has arrived on the us shores through travelers coming to the us from abroad the results also show that places with higher vulnerability also have a higher proportion of the population that does not use public transportation to go to work counties with more non-hispanic 15  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

vulnerable the remaining demographic and health variables were largely insignificant due to many counties reporting zero deaths during many of the days used in the sample a zero-inflated negative binomial pooled regression was used to analyze how the economic demographic and health conditions impact the severity of the infection experienced by the counties the results show that the economic factors have a similar impact on deaths that is counties with higher income and cases also experienced higher deaths counties with higher income inequality and housing shortage also experienced more deaths in contrast to the results of the reported cases this regression showed that not only are counties with higher percentages of non-hispanic blacks native americans and immigrants more likely to die relative to counties with non-hispanic whites so are counties with a higher concentration of people with less than a college education counties with more personal care physicians per capita experienced lower deaths and so did counties with a lower percentage of the population with diabetes smokers and preventable hospital stays counties with higher obesity hiv and drinking are associated with lower deaths the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated how quickly a highly contagious respiratory illness can bring the global economy to a standstill there have been several such infections in the last ten years although none of them had the virulence or lethality of this virus most of them spread to a few countries and then disappeared the developed world remained largely unaffected by most of them and the experience of this pandemic has laid bare the lack of infrastructure to respond to such an incident the economics literature is not extensive in the area of pandemics and epidemics in developed countries the contribution of this study is to understand the various socioeconomic conditions that can make a county or region more vulnerable to both disease spread and severity of cases a national strategy to prepare the infrastructure for controlling the spread of infectious diseases should consider these factors and develop vulnerability indexes for each region

law and the biosciences the rise and regulation of thermal facial recognition technology during the covid-19 pandemic meredith van natta paul chen savannah herbek rishabh jain nicole kastelic evan katz micalyn struble vineel vanam niharika vattikonda  postdoctoral   the rise and regulation of thermal facial recognition technology during the covid-19 pandemic as the current covid-19 pandemic sweeps the globe and dramatically alters society governments and corporations are turning to novel uses of biometric technologies to limit contagion and maintain economic opportunities technologies that may have once seemed like the province of science fiction -such as thermal facial recognition remote fever detection or smartphone-based immunity certificates -are now not only possible but already in use this raises important questions about the potential privacy implications of the widespread collection and use of such personal data while multimodal biometric surveillance technologies such as these may prove useful in slowing the spread of sars-cov-2 we caution that the ability of governments and corporations to leverage these technologies will likely persist beyond the current public health emergency just as many of the privacy concessions made in the usa patriot act have become permanent since the emergency circumstances of september 11 2001 the privacy-limiting technologies unleashed during this pandemic may well persist unless policies are enacted now to regulate their use and ensure responsible oversight recognizing that these emergent technologies may become entrenched long after this public health crisis subsides we focus here on the case of fever checks and thermal facial recognition technology to illustrate the current state of the technology existing policies related to its use and suggestions for proactive policies to govern its deployment during and beyond the present pandemic while sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 is particularly pernicious due to its high rate of asymptomatic transmission identifying symptomatic individuals is nevertheless crucial to containing its spread 1 among a growing list of covid-19 symptoms fever defined as a body s c r i p t 3 temperature above 1004f38c is one of the tell-tale symptoms of infection 2 as the pandemic has gained momentum government agencies and corporations are increasingly turning to fever checks as a mechanism for gauging the potential presence of sars-cov-2 among citizens travelers and employees this includes using traditional thermometers as well as infrared cameras that assess internal temperature by measuring the energy emanating from the inner corner of the eye and running the data through a machine learning algorithmtechnologies that have been used with limited success in previous pandemics 3 such remote thermal detection would be particularly useful in situations where it is impractical to take individuals temperature such as in a crowd but existing studies cast doubt on the ability of these technologies to accurately and consistently measure core temperature 4 fever check technologies are known to misidentify individuals under certain conditions that may elevate core temperature such as through recent exercise or lower it such as having been in the cold for an extended time or having used medicine to mask a fever 5 additionally researchers considering the asymptomatic transmission of sars-cov-2 and its incubation period alongside data on the sensitivity of thermal scanning technology have estimated that 46 percent of infected travelers may escape detection 6 despite the potential inaccuracies and limitations of these technologies they have been widely adopted for the purpose of detecting covid-19 symptoms while the americans with disabilities act prohibits companies in the us from requiring workers to submit to medical exams the equal employment opportunity commission recently announced revised rules that permit employers to take workers temperatures regularly and withdraw employment offers if a newly hired worker received a covid-19 diagnosis 7  borders 18 liechtenstein has partnered with swiss researchers to institute a voluntary campaign in which users wearable bracelet technology will collect temperature as well as breathing and heart rate data to monitor and curb coronavirus transmission 19 emirates airlines is even conducting blood tests for sars-cov-2 antibodies along with temperature and heart and respiratory rate monitoring on prospective passengers prior to boarding 20 in china which experienced the earliest wave of infections state law enforcement agents have conducted temperature checks at highway checkpoints 21 and in some cases state officers have forcibly entered private residences to perform these checks 22 in south korea officials have begun conducting fever checks and limiting travel certificates to the us only for those who registered a body temperature below 995f 375c 23 thailand also recently employed feverdetecting cameras into its biometric border screening system to measure travelers temperatures and notify border officers of febrile individuals 24 clearly fever check technology -particularly remote fever detection -is becoming ubiquitous throughout the post-covid-19 world thermal facial recognition technology privacy amidst pandemic in such exceptional times one could argue that fever checks offer substantial population health benefits with limited long-term impacts on personal privacy  in singapore ramco innovation lab is promoting its integrated thermal imaging and facial recognition technology to launch an attendance tracking system that will ostensibly enable organizations to track employees and visitors with elevated temperatures 32 this multimodal technology includes contact tracing that sends notifications to event attendees if any person exhibits covid-19 symptoms and uses facial recognition to capture both an employees presence and their temperature a visitors feature also sends notifications to management when anyone with an elevated temperature enters the premises 33 the company touts that this contactless tracking system can be integrated with sliding doors kiosks and turnstiles to mitigate sars-cov-2 exposure by restricting access based on temperature range and recommending testing of flagged individuals and they will share contract-tracing data with health agencies if mandated by the government 34 beyond asia australia recently reached a deal with drone manufacturer draganfly to develop pandemic drones equipped with thermal recognition technology that they say can monitor temperatures heart rates and respiratory patterns as well as sneezing and coughing in coronavirus hotspots 35 in the uk silent sentinel is marketing a line of what they describe as highly-sensitive high-resolution fever-detection cameras that can be deployed as a standalone system or part of a network to conduct precise temperature detection and profiling 36 in italy the government recently purchased kits from beijing-based biotechnology company polysense with optional integrated thermal facial recognition technology to monitor populations at airports train stations schools shopping centers and on public transportation to aid covid-19 containment efforts 37 the polysense devices also purport to offer optional biometric features  including infrared technology the ability to store up to 65000 facial images and integrated gate and door access protocols 38 while studies suggest that multimodal biometric systems increase overall identification accuracy compared to individual component technologies their deployment has been limited historically by cost constraints 39 as the examples listed above indicate however the rapid progression of the current coronavirus pandemic has sufficiently alarmed governments corporations and other institutions to justify aggressive investment in such technologies within this emergency context it may seem reasonable to integrate thermal scanning with facial recognition technology as an effective and efficient means to identify and track infected individuals 40 we argue however that the emergence of this type of multimodal biometric system blurs the lines between over-the-skin and under-the-skin surveillance in ways that demand closer scrutiny and potential regulation while traditional biometrics such as fingerprinting have relied on external features thermal facial recognition offers a physically unobtrusive way to obtain both external and internal biometric information purely via external scan 41 thus despite the significant privacy risks it poses thermal facial recognition may be misconstrued as a minimally invasive technology as it is significantly more discreet and anatomically noninvasive than other methods of collecting under-the-skin biometric data eg a blood draw or buccal swab for dna analysis or tympanic or rectal temperature checks this development represents a new biometric frontier that should be approached critically now rather than on a post hoc basis once the technology is already ubiquitous in the short term the expansion of novel multimodal biometric surveillance may be partially excused as a necessary technological compromise to protect health and safety by bolstering our capacity to manage contagion and prevent future pandemics 42 however the concession of such sensitive data and the personal information it may reveal opens new avenues for misuse 38  and suggests the need for responsive responsible policymaking at this time we suggest taking a step back to ask what problem thermal facial recognition technology intends to solve whether it does so accurately and effectively and -if so -how it can best be deployed and regulated just as the use of smartphone geolocation services for pandemic tracing can reveal sensitive personal and health information about individuals the continual passive monitoring of individuals temperatures could reveal previously private health information based on body temperature variances over time eg menstrual cycle pregnancy menopause or substance use and link that to identifying documents in ways that are poorly understood as this technology begins to roll out worldwide 43 this is especially problematic given the nascent nature of fever-based biometric technologies we currently do not know the extent of information that can be deduced using data gathered by these technologies existing scholarship suggests that future developments in data analysis techniques may allow for these data to be used in a manner that increasingly violates privacy and such scholars recommend caution as they are deployed 44 unless clear protections are in place it is likely that data brokers advertisers employers and law enforcement agencies could use such data to extract information about underlying health conditions or stigmatized behaviors in ways that may undermine individuals privacy 45 even if temperature monitoring is limited to a one-time event such as attempting to enter a grocery store airport or train station in the form of an ostensible on-the-spot immunity certificate questions remain about the precision and accuracy of some thermal detection technologies and their integration with multimodal biometric surveillance devices while some firms claim an ability to discern between increases in body temperature caused by exercise versus spikes caused by viral infection there is no guarantee that such features are accurate or will be universally incorporated in system designs 46  in the united states six states have passed legislation that governs the collection and use of biometric information by commercial entities -laws that could serve as a model for regulating multimodal biometric technologies during and beyond the present pandemic however with the exception of illinois and california which have passed legislation that regulates the commercial use of thermal and facial information for fever checks the scope of most of these laws does not extend to the collection of thermal facial data for non-commercial purposes 50 among all such state-level laws the most comprehensive is illinois biometric information privacy act bipa which regulates the collection use and sharing of biometric information by commercial entities 51 bipa requires commercial entities to gain informed consent from individuals prior to scanning for biometric information and make publicly available a written policy of the process employed to destroy the biometric information the law also creates a right of action for individuals whose biometric information was collected or used in violation of the law regardless of whether the violation caused such individuals harm since the definition of biometric information in bipa includes any information regardless of capture method that relies on biometric identifiers such as facial scans or eye scans this law would regulate any technologies that use facial recognition technology to capture the temperature of a specific facial location that would ostensibly include the aforementioned thermal facial recognition systems deployed by governments using products from companies like sunell and rokid however this right of action is limited to illinois for example while patel v facebook 2010 established that facebook violated illinois bipa by failing to delete biometric information within a certain timeframe this precedent does not apply nationally 52 in contrast to the passage of an independent biometric information privacy law in illinois california regulated the collection of biometric information through an extension of the california consumer privacy act ccpa which establishes privacy protections on the use of personal information by commercial entities that have at least 25 million in annual revenue have personal data on at least 50000 individuals or make half of their annual revenue from the sale of personal data in 2019 the definition of personal information was appended to cover biometric information which includes any physiological characteristics that can be combined with other identifying data to establish individual identity such as health data and facial imagery 53 temperature measurements which are physiological characteristics would consequently fall within the scope of this law the law requires businesses to inform consumers of which categories of their personal information are subject to collection and the purposes of collection prior to the time of collection consumers also have the right to request disclosure of the method and source of collection access to any information collected from them and deletion of any such information lastly consumers have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information wherein the term sale includes any transfer of personal information from the business to a third party for valuable consideration 54 hence businesses may invoke this clause to share thermal information from fever checks which seems likely given the recent sales of smart thermometer data for targeted advertisements 55 and the generation of nationwide fever tracking maps 56 while the ccpa generates a private right of action for certain breaches of the law the scope of this right is substantially narrower than the right generated by bipa  right of action only if specified categories of their unencrypted personal information are subject to unauthorized access due to failure to use reasonable security precautions the specified categories of personal information do not include biometric information leaving individuals with no private recourse options upon the breach of their facial or thermal information instead it is the responsibility of the attorney general to bring about action for other types of violations therefore while the ccpa may apply to a wider range of information collected from fever checks due to its protection of all physiological data in addition to facial data it attributes substantially fewer enforcement rights to consumers than bipa beyond state-level legislation a number of federal policies have some capacity to regulate multimodal biometric surveillance in ways that may impact the use of thermal facial recognition technology during the covid-19 pandemic for example commercial entities that employ thermal recognition technologies are subject to federal standards of fairness and transparency through the federal trade commission act ftc section 5 of the act explicitly bans unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce where an unfair practice includes any practice that causes substantial injury to a consumer acting reasonably 57 and a deceptive practice includes any omission or practice which is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably 58 while there is no specific judicial precedent supporting ftc authority to govern the collection or use of thermal information there is substantial precedent to support ftc governance of personal information generally 59 the ftc has brought numerous actions against companies that misled consumers regarding the collection and use of their personal information or threatened the privacy of their personal information historically the ftc has primarily prosecuted deceptive privacy practices 60 such as the use of misleading disclosures 61 or illegitimate mechanisms for consumers to specify privacy protections 62 however within the last two decades 63 the ftc has also begun prosecuting unfair practices such as privacy practices that led to anticipatable cybersecurity attacks and consumer information breaches 64 therefore given the use of section 5 to regulate how businesses collect and use other types of personal information the ftc could foreseeably use this law to ensure that companies honestly represent their policies for the collection and use of thermal information to consumers and securely manage the thermal information collected from consumers additionally anti-discrimination statues may offer another avenue to regulate the use of fever checks or facial recognition technologies while the aforementioned changes in equal employment opportunity commission guidelines have allowed employers to test for covid-19 outbreaks in their workplaces the americans with disabilities act still bars them from firing employees based on this information 65 furthermore studies have shown that facial recognition algorithms demonstrate algorithmic bias 66 such bias against protected categories such as race sex nationality or religion may be illegal in applications such as employment and housing 67 the department of housing and urban development has sued facebook for allowing such discrimination 68 if fever detection systems are found to have bias against these protected categories similar arguments may apply to restrict their use scholars have also suggested that mass surveillance creates first amendment implications murphy and kaminski discuss ways in which the kind of mass surveillance that facial recognition technology enables may impede rights to freedom of expression and association and they discuss how taking these rights into account may bolster fourth amendment protections against such harms 74 additionally skinner-thompson proposes the notion of performative privacy -actions aimed at preserving ones privacy in public spaces -as a kind of public privacy behavior that is protected under the first amendment and doctrinally supported by existing jurisprudence 75 such considerations are particularly important for individuals and communities who may be disproportionately surveilled by emerging technologies including racial and sexual minorities 76 at the federal level access to recorded thermal detection information collected by commercial entities may also be subject to federal regulations under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa section 501 of fisa allows the federal bureau of investigation fbi to seek a court order to acquire records papers documents and other tangible objects for individual investigations into suspected acts of international terrorism or clandestine intelligence by a united states citizen fisa can be applied to seek court orders for access to medical and health records -which may include thermal data if it appears within such records 77 furthermore the current pandemic constitutes a public health emergency requiring rapid action by state governments to prevent calamitous harm as of march 27th all fifty states dozens of localities and the federal government have declared emergencies for covid-19 during this time of emergency strict adherence to ordinary legal standards can inadvertently limit or even prohibit necessary response efforts to combat this risk states have public health emergency laws that grant governors extraordinary power and flexibility to respond to emergency situations these powers range from halting business operations and restricting freedom of movement to limit civil liberties and commandeering property 78 in some states public health emergency laws grant governors the broad authority to remove all legal barriers to an effective response to a declared emergency governors have exercised this power to relax hospital license rules to create alternative treatment centers to expand healthcare providers scope of practice to allow paramedics to provide vaccinations and more 79 additionally most states public health emergency laws enable the governor to temporarily change statutes or regulations during a declared emergency in total 42 states explicitly permit the governor to change statutes or regulations during an emergency 80 in 35 states governors are explicitly permitted to suspend or amend both statutes and regulations that interfere with an effective response to an emergency 81 states like north carolina and new hampshire specifically permit governors to create new statutes and regulations during emergencies 82 83 the substantial executive leeway granted by public health emergency laws has been effective in the past for example during the influenza epidemic of 2018 new york governor andrew cuomo declared a public health emergency and suspended state statutes and regulations that normally prohibited pharmacists from vaccinating children 84 as a result authorized pharmacists were able to vaccinate children-a demographic particularly susceptible to influenza despite their benefits it is still worth noting that there are no clear thresholds for terminating emergency powers under state public health emergency laws for most states emergency powers end automatically 30-90 days after a public health emergency was declared 85 however the governor can renew the determination for additional time periods of 30-90 days depending on the state 86 in massachusetts and washington there is no time limit only the governor can terminate the emergency powers 87 as a result these laws create the possibility that critical legal protections might be suspended indefinitely in response to the pandemic at the supranational level the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd published recommendations in 2013 to guide its member countries in the collection and use of personal information such as biometric information through the oecd privacy framework 88 this framework advises member countries to develop comprehensive national privacy standards that set legal boundaries for the collection and use of personal information the oecd has proposed several guidelines as a template for minimum standards for national policies but advises member countries to supplement such standards with a more thorough national privacy standard the proposed guidelines encourage limitations on the collection and use of personal information policies for openly informing individuals maintenance of data quality implementation of privacy management programs and security safeguards and accountability despite membership in the oecd the us lacks a national privacy standard and therefore does not comply with these proposed guidelines as we consider whether when and how to use multimodal biometric technology like thermal facial recognition to stem pandemic disease there are a number of steps we can take to optimize its public health potential while limiting its impact on individuals privacy the first step is to ask whether a thermal detection is an accurate and effective way of containing viral spread and b if so whether it is necessary to combine facial recognition technology with 84 sunshine supra note 89 85  thermal detection devices depending on the answers it may then be necessary to define clearly the purpose of biometric data collection and the specific uses to which they will be put and demonstrate how the technology design honors these parameters by what standards will we measure the accuracy and effectiveness of such technologies to solve the problem at handthat is tracing contagion through a population in order to contain it will such data be used purely on a one-time basis to detect the presence of symptoms will the practice continue after the emergency has subsided and how will we know when that is if data will be stored how will they be stored by whom and for how long as we consider such questions during the present pandemic we can build upon existing recommendations to craft policies that will best marshal multimodal biometric technology for the context of contagion to begin designers of these emerging technologies should make clear to the public and to the agencies and companies deploying their technology how they have engineered devices to avoid harm to user privacy in the first place 89 additionally we can look to the fair information practice principles fipps underlying the 1914 fair trade commission act and 1974 privacy act -principles that overlap significantly with the oecd fair information principles and european unions general data protection regulation gdpr principles 90 these principles include making clear to individuals when and how facial recognition data is being collected stored and used developing data management practices that consider how individuals are enrolled and what the risks harms and benefits may be to that involuntary enrollment specifying use limitations and third-party data sharing safeguarding data and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of security measures maintaining the accuracy and integrity of any stored data and providing a process for accountability and problem resolution for individuals whose data is collected stored andor used 91 both approaches require greater transparency around technology design and use than currently exists and we should act quickly to institutionalize such expectations before these technologies become entrenched in the postpandemic world at present as multimodal biometric technologies proliferate in the unusual regulatory space of this pandemic it remains to be seen whether thermal detection is an accurate and effective way of containing viral spread and whether it is necessary to combine facial recognition 92 this report warns that failing to do so could exacerbate existing inequalities by creating additional barriers to public transit and essential service access by requiring a kind of public health theater predicated on the mistaken belief that mass temperature screenings in public places are an effective mechanism for containing viral spread 93 if independent scientific analysis establishes that one-time remote thermal detection is indeed sufficient to assess the presence of febrile individuals in public spaces and that doing so may prove effective in identifying and removing infected individuals from public spaces is it necessary to link such information to personal identifiers through facial recognition what is the added utility of tracking an individuals face if contact tracing is already in place if epidemiologists or public health officials determine that integrating facial recognition technology with thermal detection is essential to interrupting virus transmission scientific testing should first assess the accuracy and effectiveness of each of its component functions eg facial recognition fever detection infrared imaging before deploying it broadly designers of such technologies should also demonstrate the degree to which they have engineered privacy safeguards into the design of the technology itself -for example by limiting the types of data to be collected and stored and elaborating protections over data access further companies collecting biometric data should be transparent about the duration in which they intend to collect sensitive data eg during an officially recognized pandemic subsequent flu seasons et cetera they should also offer recourse procedures for suspected false positives just as article 16 of the gdpr provides a right to rectification subjects of multimodal biometric collection should be assured that inaccurate or incomplete personal data will be expeditiously rectified andor completed 94 we also recommend that commercial establishments notify consumers when thermal recognition technology is in use entrances should provide signage in plain language that notifies individuals that biometric data are being collected with specific indications of what will be stored and for how long the data will be retained if the thermal recognition technology used by the establishment employs facial recognition or saves personally identifiable information beyond the point of collection and processing to determine acceptable temperature levels the establishment should highlight that on public signage and provide two modes to enter passing through the facial recognition technology or undergoing a thermometer-based fever check choosing a thermometer-based fever check should not place an additional burden on the individual as that will adversely impact the exercise of informed consent additionally the aforementioned aclu report recommends hygienic self-serve or voluntary temperature-checking facilities rather than mandatory checks on the basis that voluntary measures to combat disease are generally more effective than mandatory ones 95 they further stress that anyone whose screened temperature denies them access to a critical service or function such as applying for benefits or appearing in court should be granted some other means of accessing that service or function 96 for companies using thermal facial recognition technology to monitor employee health and attendance employees should undergo a thorough informed consent process that outlines how long their biometric data will be stored and what policies are in place it is determined that they are beyond the threshold for a safe working temperature for example will the employee have the opportunity to contest the measurement or be offered a thermometer-based fever check will they be sent to a testing center andor will they be dismissed further for companies using thermal facial recognition andor thermal cameras alongside a contact tracing system such as the ramco technology discussed above there should be data limitation measures in place to maximize the privacy of the individual notice of fever detection should not include personally identifying information beyond consumer notifications however the protection of biometric data privacy demands that biotechnology companies practice transparency by focusing on reasonable expectations of entrustees instead of passive disclosure of information 97 ohm further calls for companies to be forthright by anticipating what a consumer does not understand and volunteering that information in a non-biased way 98 biotechnology companies developing and implementing thermal facial recognition technology can establish trust now through honest communication of the capabilities of the technology in a way that is accessible to all members of society additionally to halt mission creep we recommend against passive continuous monitoring of individuals temperature over time if thermal recognition technology continues to be integrated with other multimodal biometric technologies such as smartphone-linked wearables that collect and share protected health information with government agencies commercial 95 id at 7-8 96 id at 7 sites andor employers stringent data protections must be in place particularly as the notion of immunity certificates suggests the ability to re-open the post-covid-19 world we need to consider seriously which biometric data are essential and effective for preserving health how they will be used and stored in and beyond the pandemic and what we can do to ensure adequate safeguards are in place 99 despite evidence that thermal imaging technology is at present insufficiently sophisticated to combat the spread of sars-cov-2 or any similar virus governments and firms around the world are widely embracing it as part of a multimodal biometric surveillance strategy to curb the pandemic we should not wait until the chaos of the present moment subsides to adjudicate the effectiveness of technologies that will have major privacy implications once they become entrenched it is precisely at this moment when the technologies are emerging and quickly evolving that we should anticipate these privacy concerns and demand transparency and accountability we should be aware that governments and corporations may use these nascent technologies to collect temperature and other biometric data alongside other personal identifiers like names passports andor social security numbers now is the time to design technologies with privacy in mind alongside institutionalizing multi-pronged proactive oversight and redress mechanisms for the future as governments in the united states and abroad begin to haltingly reopen societies under intensifying economic and public pressure the demand for reliable symptom detection and contact tracing systems will continue to increase both the public and private sectors have reacted quickly to these needs undertaking partnerships and technological collaborations to curb the spread of covid-19 in a climate driven by such urgency relatively unproven technologies like thermal facial recognition will continue to proliferate rapidly deeply entrenching themselves in society without a high standard of independent technical validation holistic comparison of risks and benefits and proactive policy enactment many of the changes to how our biological information is collected stored and analyzed may be irreversible  statistical analysis of the impact of environmental temperature on the exponential growth rate of cases infected by covid-19 g livadiotis  we perform a statistical analysis for understanding the effect of the environmental temperature on the exponential growth rate of the cases infected by covid-19 for us and italian regions in particular we analyze the datasets of regional infected cases derive the growth rates for regions characterized by readable exponential growth phase in their evolution spread curve and plot them against the environmental temperatures averaged within the same regions derive the relationship between temperature and growth rate and evaluate its statistical confidence the results clearly support the first reported statistically significant relationship of negative correlation between the average environmental temperature and exponential growth rates of the infected cases  the daily number of new cases infected by covid-19 is currently exponentially growing for most countries affected by the virus however this exponential growth rate varies significantly for different regions over the globe it is urgent and timely to understand the reasons behind this regional variation of the exponential growth rates little information is known about this matter while there are indications that the environmental temperature may be a factor for instance northern and colder us and italian regions experienced much more incidents than others typically the evolution curve of the spread of the coronavirus initiates with a pre-exponential phase characterized by a mild logarithmic growth followed by the outburst phase of the exponential growth social-distancing measures against the spread may affect the evolution curve in a way that the exponential growth slows down and starts to decay depending though on the effectiveness and applicability of these measures however after the decay of the spread at some place new infected cases may outburst in other places marked with insignificant number of cases until that moment then a newly growth phase may appear for example fig1 left shows the evolution curve of spread for the infected cases in mainland china clearly we observe the whole growthdecay cycle as well as a new re-growth phase super-strict measures such as complete shut down and quarantines can successfully lead to the deceleration of the exponential growth of infected cases giugliano 2020  unfortunately they cannot be successfully applied and followed within vast regions and especially for a long and indefinite period of time inevitably measures may be loosened during the decay phase leading to the birth of an equally disastrous re-growth phase us  italy right phases color-coded pre-exponential pre-exp exponential exp growth decelerated growth decay and possibly a re-growth day t1 corresponds to 1152020 for china 2202020 for italy 2272020 for us evolution in china cases follows the whole growth-decay cycle and a new re-growth phase italian cases are characterized by a milder exponential rate entered the phase of decelerated growth on march 12 us suffers with a larger exponential rate and it is not clear whether has entered the decelerated growth phase the exponential growth rate for china rose as high as 01690017 while for italy and us the rates were 00900004 and 01210003 respectively with correlation coefficient  099 the exponential growth is the most effective phase for the evolution curve of infected cases and the most important question regarding this evolution is still open black et al 2020  what can influence the exponential growth rate and thus flatten the curve measures strict or not may affect the evolution of new infected cases by shifting the spread curve from the exponential to the decelerated growth it should be noted though that measures do not affect the exponential growth rate itself but only the period of time that this exponential phase applies then what factors do affect the exponential growth rate the age distribution in the place where the outburst occurs is unlikely to be a factor indeed the number of new cases is known to be positively correlated with age however the exponential growth rate china 0169 us 0121 italy 0090 -decreasing rate appears to be negatively correlated to the age median of these countries china 374 us 381 italy 455 -increasing age hence the age is likely irrelevant to the rate variations in addition culture in social activities may be a factor for example this might be contributing in the observed differences among the exponential rates in the cases of china italy and us  fig1  however what is causing the major variation of exponential rates among different regions of the same culture it is apparent that culture does not constitute the main factor influencing the exponential rate figure 2 shows the regional variation of infected cases left and average winter temperature right in italy the possible negative correlation observed between regional number of infected cases and winter temperature in italy is an indication of the influence of temperature on the exponential growth but it certainly does not constitute a necessary condition the reason is that the map plots the total number of the infected cases n t  which does not depend only on the exponential rate  but also on the initial number of cases n 0  it is generally accepted that the initial infected cases in italy were travelled directly from china since some destinations are more favorable than others then the initial number of cases n 0  as well as the current number of cases n t which is proportional to n 0  should be subject of regional variation therefore there is a non-negligible possibility the observed regional variation of the number of infected cases n t to be caused by the regional distribution of the initial cases n 0  in such a case main airport cities would have incredibly high number of infected cases outplaying a possible negative correlation of daily infected cases with regional average temperature t the latter may be one of the reasons of the high numbers of cases observed in new york city and rome on the other hand in their letter to the white house members of a national academy of sciences committee said that there is some evidence to suggest that coronavirus may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity however given the lack of host immunity globally this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread without the concomitant adoption of major public health interventions relman 2020  nevertheless it has to be stressed out that there were no statistical analyses focused on the exponential growth rates of the infected cases in regions with different temperatures for instance several authors eg pawar et al 2020 yao et al 2020 found insignificant correlations between temperatures and confirmed cases however their analysis was performed on the number of the infected cases n t  which is subject to the randomness of the initial cases n 0 as explained above and not to the exponential growth rate  which is dependent on physical characteristics of the coronavirus binding protein and environment analysis of regional cases can show whether the speculated negative correlation between temperature and number of infected cases is true meaning a negative correlation between temperature and exponential growth rate if the environmental temperature plays indeed a substantial role on the virus spread then this can provide promising results such as the estimation of the critical temperature that may eliminate the number of daily new cases in heavily infected regions the purpose of this paper is to improve understanding of the effect of environmental temperature on the spread of covid-19 and its exponential growth rate then we calculate the exponential growth rates of infected cases for us and italian regions derive the relationship of these rates with the environmental temperature evaluate its statistical confidence and determine the critical temperature that eliminates this rate a standard model for describing the evolution of the infected cases by viruses is given by      n t is the number of total infected cases evolved from the initial n 0 cases n max is the maximum possible number of infected cases  is the exponential growth rate and becomes clear for x t 1 where i is negligible leading to the function of negative feedback i models factors that flattens the curve such as the measures taken against spreading while these factors are not affecting the exponential growth rate  they become more effective as the number of cases increases getting closer to n max  exponent b controls the effectiveness of these factors strict loose measures correspond to smaller larger values of b figure 3 shows the evolution curve of the number of new n t  n t1 n t  and total infected cases n t  and how this curve flattens for stricter measures smaller values of b as observed in fig3b  stricter measures nicely modeled by decreasing b do not affect the exponential rate  but they successfully flatten the curve however the same can be achieved by downgrading the exponential growth rate it is apparent then how much useful would it be to know the factors that can flatten the curve by decreasing directly the exponential rate applied measures could be loosen and shorter model 1 originates from the logistic map family eg livadiotis 2005 and references therein wu et al 2020  other complicate versions such as the susceptible-infectious-recovered models eg ciarochi 2020 may be expressed by multi-dimensional differential or difference equations eg elaydi 2005 and references therein livadiotis et al 2016  but still the curve flattening is governed by the same features the two composites the exponential growth e and the negative feedback i are just the main and necessary conditions for reproducing the growth-decay phases of the spread curve their interplay shows how the spread curve can be flattened as a result of stricter measures independently of the existent exponential rate  cc-by-nc-nd 40

reproduction number r 0 eg proportional to its logarithm and negative correlation with the incubation period  eg inverse proportional milligan and barrett 2015  the number r 0 is a measure of how contagious a disease is it provides the average number of people in a susceptible population that a single infected person will spread the disease to over the course of their infection ciarochi 2020  and depends on the physical characteristics of coronavirus hao 2020  the incubation period  is the time elapsed between exposure to coronavirus and first symptoms during this period an infected individual cannot infect others other characteristic periods and time intervals are the latent period between exposure and infection and the generation time mostly concerned with transmission process nishiura 2010  characteristic values for covid-19 are 5-6 days and r 02 -4 chen 2020  the rate expression can be written as  and involves all the physical characteristics of the mechanisms of infection and the environmental interactions this can be easily derived considering difference equations that is iterated discrete maps eg see livadiotis and elaydi 2012 kwessi et al 2018 dayeh et al 2018  setting the time to be given in discrete -steps then which can be written in terms of eq 2 where the exponential rate is given by the main factors that can affect the exponential rate  are a culture in social activities and b environmental temperature andor other thermodynamic parameters intense cultural and social activities have reasonably a positive correlation with r 0  as previously mentioned measures against the virus spread do not effectively influence the exponential growth rate eg they do not change the culture in social activities which are characteristics of the particular population but they can just cease these activities for some period of time on the other hand the environmental temperature t can affect all the parameters influencing exponential rate we approach this dependence by i a linear approximation of the phenomenological relationship between exponential rate and temperature and ii the connection of reproduction number with arrhenius behavior with negative activation energy i the temperature can affect the physical properties of coronavirus such as the incubation time  as well as the reproduction number r 0 that depends on these physical properties hao 2020  a linear approximation absorbs the weak temperature dependence of any parameters involved in the exponential rate then eq5 gives where we set the intercept to be given in normal conditions of atmospheric temperature and pressure ntp that is t20 c 0  p 1atm then we rewrite the exponential rate as ii coronavirus uses their major surface spike protein to bind on a receptor

medrxiv preprint the mechanism behind can lead to rates negatively correlated with temperature ie increasing rate with decreasing temperature this is consistent to reaction rate expressed by the arrhenius exponential with and benson 1984  then the effective reproduction number 0   r t is expressed as a product combining the reproduction number in the absence of temperature effect 0 r   and the arrhenius exponential rate namely then eq 5 gives we rewrite this expression as reactions of negative activation energy are barrier-less relying on the capture of the molecules in a potential well increasing decreasing the temperature leads to a reduced gained probability of the colliding molecules capturing one another exponential spread is mainly related to outdoors activities while the decelerated growth caused by effective measures is related to indoors activities therefore as long as the exponential growth takes place the environmental temperature has an effective role on the chemical reaction between virus and spike protein due to the negative activation energy decreasing the environmental temperature reduces the probability of virus-protein reaction thus the virus may stay inactive on air or surfaces and eventually die it should be noted that both the models 7b and 10b consider that the exponential rate  or the reproduction number r 0  are subjects to a component influenced by the culture in social activities intercept  0  and a component mostly influenced by the temperature slope p 2  in this way the slope may indicate to some universal quantity involved such as the negative activation energy next we employ the above two expressions of exponential rate  and temperature t eqs7a10a in order to set the two types of statistical models for fitting   measurements for us and italian regions we use publicly available datasets of 1 average enviromental temperature of us and italian regions eg see wwwncdcnoaagovdata-accessland-based-station-dataland-based-datasetsclimate-normals itclimate-dataorg wwwweather-atlascom 2 time series of the number of daily infected cases of us and italian regions eg see wwwthelancetcom wwwprotezionecivilegovit we analyze the datasets of regional infected cases in us and italy derive the relationship of the exponential growth rate of the number of cases with temperature and evaluate its statistical confidence first we derive the exponential growth rates of the infected cases characterizing each examined region of italy and us then we plot these values against the environmental temperatures of each region and perform the corresponding statistical analysis we proceed according to the following steps i collect the time series of the current infected cases n t for all us and italian regions for each of the us and italian regions we plot logn t  and logn t  with time t detect the time intervals of linear relationship corresponding to the phase of exponential growth fit the datapoints within this region and derive the slope on linear-log scale that is the exponential growth rate  the total n t and new cases n t should be characterized by the

environmental temperature data and calculate the temperature averaged over the whole examined region the incubation period  is longer than the time scale of a single day or night thus the temperature is averaged over the daily and nightly measurements iv co-plot all the derived sample values   where each pair corresponds to each examined region then apply a linear fitting in order to derive the linear relationship between t and  as well as evaluate the statistical confidence of this relationship repeat the same for all us and italian regions determine the critical temperature t c for which the rate becomes negligible to eliminate the uncertainties of t c as a fitting parameter we perform the linear fitting with the statistical model repeat iv and v with pairs of t -1 t -1   we estimate

derivatives are numerically derived we will use two linear statistical models a  as given by eqs7a10a  both can be written with the linear expression the statistical confidence of the dependence of the exponential growth rate on the environmental average temperature may be sufficiently high for the acceptance of any of the two statistical models the goodness of the fitting of each model is evaluated using two types of statistical tests the reduced chi-square the p-value of the extremes and their combination eg frisch et al 2013 schwadron et al 2013  fuselier et al 2014  while students t-test is also used for evaluating the statistical confidence of the derived slopes -reduced chi-square the goodness of a fit is estimated by the reduced chi-square value 2 -students t-test this is another test for evaluating the statistical confidence of the slope derived from the linear fitting of the temperature-rate sample points t i t i   i  i  and t i -1 t i -1   i  i  we examine whether the slope p 2 p 2 has significant difference from the zero slope null hypothesis slope is zero by performing the students t-test with t m p 2 p 2  where the corresponding p-value is derived 9 from the integration of t-distribution  the students t-test is not passed for the null hypothesis that they examined slope equals zero when the corresponding p t -value is less than the acceptable confidence limit of 005 then the null hypothesis is rejected meaning the slope has statistically significant difference for zero in addition we examine the slopes estimated for us with those estimated for italian regions by deriving  the linear fitting of logn t  or logn t  with time t within the region of exponential growth phase resulted to the respective rates given by the fitted slope their weighted averages are shown in table 1 for us and in table 2 for italian regions while plotted against the average regional temperature in figs 5 and 6 respectively the method of weighted fitting for double uncertainties x i x i   i  i  as described by fasano and vio 1988  is used for estimating the fitting parameters  0  t c  together with their statistical propagation and total errors the fits of the linear statistical model with temperature x i t i  left panels in figs 5 6 as well as of the alternative statistical model with inverse temperature right panels in figs 5 6  are both characterized with high statistical confidence attaining high p-values 005 and reduced chi-squares 2 red  values close to 1 also both fits provide similar estimations of t c  the fitting results are shown in table 3  we also examine whether the sample points t i t i   i  i  are subject to statistically significant concentrations or rarefactions namely whether possible heterogeneities within the distribution of sample points plays significant role in the fitted relationship for this we derive the temperature-rate relationship and its statistical confidence by fitting the homogenized set of sample points instead of the raw sample points then we examine whether the fitting parameters differ from those derived from fitting the raw sample points we homogenize the sample points by grouping them in temperature binning of t  1 c 0 eg see livadiotis  desai 2016 we estimate the weighted mean and error of the rates included in each bin in the case of us regions we also performed a homogenization of rates by grouping the temperaturebinned means in rate binning of   001 d -1  in the case of sample points with inverse temperatures t i -1 t i -1   i  i  the procedure is exactly the same homogenized datasets result in a smooth relationship between the values of binned temperature and rate as it can be observed in the plots of rate against temperature or inverse temperature left or right lower panels respectively and for both us and italy regions figs 5 and 6 respectively  the results are highly supportive of the negative correlation between rate and temperature the results are shown in table 4  we observe that the linear relationships of the growth rate with temperature or inverse temperature are characterized by high statistical confidence for the homogenized datasets p-values much higher than significant limit of 005 2 red  far from the significant limits of 01 and 10 therefore the arrangement of sample points do not affect significantly the fitting results in addition as shown in tables 3 and 4  the linear fits of sample points t i t i   i  i  and t i -1 t i -1   i  i  do not pass the students t-test for the null hypothesis that their slopes equals zero ie the corresponding p t -values are less than the acceptable confidence limit of 005 therefore the negative correlation of environmental temperature with the exponential rate is statistically significant accepted with confidence 95  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity

the sample points t i t i   i  i  of us and italian regions first we perform the students t-test to compare the slopes corresponding to us and italian regions we find high p t -values 005 for both fits of xt and xt -1  thus the two populations are likely characterized by the same slope tthe respective intercept  0 does not pass the same test ie the intercepts corresponding to us and italian

not performed for the binned datasets since they are characterized by smaller p-values -see figs 5 and 6 the results are shown in table 5  we observe that the optimization is reached for two values of the shift  we estimate the weighted average of the results corresponding toe the two shifts the weighted mean is performed separately for the fitting cases of xt and xt -1  however the weighted mean of the critical temperature is performed for all four results fitting of datasets combined for us and italian regions with the latters rates shifted by  the optimal fitting corresponds to shifts  0031

relationship of negative correlation between the exponential growth rate and the average environmental temperature derived for us and italian regions in particular we analyzed datasets of regional

statistical models with the datasets of environmental temperature or its inverse and exponential growth rate finding their relationship and evaluating its statistical confidence the two linear models developed and used for the statistical analysis are a the statistical confidence of fitting was evaluated using the reduced chi-square values the p-value of extremes and a testing measure that combines both of these values also the statistical confidence was also evaluated using the students t-test where the derived slopes compared to a hypothetical zero slope the sample points of temperature or inverse temperature and exponential growth rate were also tested for statistically significant concentrations or rarefactions namely for possible heterogeneities within the distribution of sample points that could have significant role in the results the statistical analysis of the homogenized temperature-rate data points concluded that the negative correlation between temperature and exponential rate is stable having no statistically significant variability due to concentrations or rarefactions and it is characterized by a high statistical confidence we also performed a students t-test and ensured that the difference between two sample means of us and italian regions is not statistically significant a possible universality may characterize the slope of the temperature-rate relationship this verifies the modeling developed and used by this analysis where the exponential rate  or the reproduction number r 0  are subjects to a component influenced by the culture in social activities intercept  0  and a component influenced by the temperature slope p 2  in this way the slope may indicate to a universal quantity involved such as the negative activation energy since the derived slopes for us and italian regions are characterized by no statistically confident difference we improved the statistics of the estimated fitting parameters by combined the sample points of us and italian regions from the derived relationship among others we were able to derive the values of the negative activation energy e a  and the reproduction number r 0 at normal conditions and how this depends on temperature therefore the results clearly showed that there is indeed statistically significant negative correlation of temperature on the exponential growth rate of

temperature with the exponential growth rate it was reasonable to ask for the critical temperature that eliminates the exponential rate and thus the number of daily new cases in infected regions this was found to be t c8 61  43 f 0 for us regions it is straightforward to ask when the environmental temperature will climb above this critical value as an example figure 10 plots the daily average temperatures in san antonio texas shown that will be clearly above the estimated t c threshold in the second half of may figure 10  according to the statistically confident relationship between exponential growth rate of infected cases shown in fig8  the critical temperature which eliminates the exponential growth and thus the covid-19 spread is t c  861  43 f 0  the plot shows also the may-june daily nightly and 24h-averaged environmental temperatures in san antonio texas averaged over the last three years the daily average temperatures will be clearly above the estimated t c threshold in the second half of may thus the plot suggests a possible date for loosening the strict measures in san antonio that is may 24 the resulted high statistical confidence of the negative correlation of the environmental temperature on the exponential growth rate of the cases infected by covid-19 is certainly encouraging for loosening super-strict social-distancing measures at least during the summery high temperatures however we are by no-means recommending a return-to-work date based only on this study but we do think that this should be part of the decision as well as an inspiration for repeating the same analysis in other heavily infected regions the steps of these analyses may be followed as i identify different outbreaks in regions with the same culture in social activities and different environmental temperature ii estimate the exponential growth rates for these regions from the time series of infected cases iii plot the derived rates against the environmental temperature averaged for these regions and repeat the analysis of this study to determine the temperature-rate relationship and its statistical confidence  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

even if both are coronaviruses sars largely died out during the northern hemisphere summer of 2003 when the virus became significantly less infectious however while the covid19 virus appears to be considerably less lethal than sars which had a fatality rate of 96 killing 774 of the 8098 reported patients 1 it is more infectious and though the virus was very quickly identified and its genome sequenced it does not automatically translate into detailed information about infectivity virulence and how it interacts with the human immune system one of the earlier suggestions that has now been largely scotched was that the covid19 virus became infectious before patients showed the first symptoms which would make containment measures such as quarantining less effective like locking the stable door after the horse has bolted this hypothesis arose after a cluster of cases was reported in germany appearing to have originated from an individual who had flown in from china but did not report symptoms until after returning to china however as was pointed out by amesh adalja senior scholar at the johns hopkins centre for health security it was then established that the person had indeed experienced symptoms in germany before they were reported by other people in that cluster what is true though is that a significant number of people infected have experienced mild symptoms which itself is a problem during the early stages of an outbreak when strenuous efforts are being made to prevent its spread it means some cases will go undetected because the symptoms are so mild that coronavirus infection is not suspected at least initially as jeremy farrar director of the wellcome trust pointed out early on the wide range of severity in symptoms is one of the major challenges the cases of patients with only very mild symptoms or people who are asymptomatic may be masking the true numbers infected and the extent of persontoperson transmission several key aspects of the covid19 virus are more clear now one being that it is likely to subside during the summer similar to the sars outbreak in 2002 as most coronaviruses become far less infectious under warm weather these respiratory infections all tend to be winter diseases said by paul hunter professor of health protection at the norwich school of medicine university of east anglia uk the big one that stopped sars was summer in the northern hemisphere this has the corollary that warm countries are much less affected hunter noted there was only one single case of sars in the whole of africa and that was south africa where there are seasonal variations in temperature however he also cautioned against complacency noting that mexico experienced quite a high number of cases during the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic despite the country being hot except at higher altitudes inland so there are other factors determining infectivity beyond temperature hunter added it is however the virus infectivity which has prompted fears that it could become endemic it is substantially less lethal than sars but a lot more infectious hunter said on the other hand it is substantially less infectious than seasonal influenza but more lethal as a result the degree of severity has been exaggerated by the data so far while almost all the extreme and fatal cases have been notified there has been considerable underreporting of mild cases early data on closed cases that is people who had either died or recovered indicated a fatality rate as high as 20 at time of writing however the death rate among more recent cases had subsided to about 15 with the highest risk for the elderly this pattern is typical of most respiratory virus outbreaks even if part of the effect is an illusion resulting from the fact that reporting of less severe cases only tends to catch up later on it also reflects the common decline of virulence during such epidemics partly resulting from strong selective pressure imposed by social distancing quarantine and other public health measures 2 these measures reduce the rate of transmission and slow down progression of the outbreak giving the virus more time to attenuate social distancing amplifies selection for longersurviving lowvirulence subgroups so that the majority of the population during the later stages of an outbreak are exposed to less virulent phenotypes 2 in addition many of the most vulnerable individuals are infected earlier on so that later cases are also less serious because they involve more robust individuals according to hunter in the longer term the wuhan virus should not be anywhere near as serious because an endemic disease affects more young people who are by then the nonimmunes he said that was indeed the case even for the great spanish influenza pandemic 191819 which caused a much larger proportion of severe cases and deaths among younger people than most other flu outbreaks that was when spanish flu was in its first flush not after it had become endemic hunter explained seen in this light criticisms of the quarantining and other social distancing methods employed against the coronavirus are either overreactions or wide of the mark even if they fail to contain the outbreak they effectively accelerate the attenuation process and should reduce the number of severe cases and fatalities in this regard the chinese authorities have won widespread praise for the rapid reactions once the severity of the outbreak had become clear both in terms of identifying the virus and of isolating infected individuals the excellence of the chinese response is first of all making the early diagnosis that it was coronavirus and secondly that it was a novel coronavirus and then sequencing the genome in very short order was brilliant said william schaffner infectious diseases specialist at vanderbilt university medical centre nashville tennessee usa then they did something else that was also terrific that they had learnt from sars they communicated that information transparently completely honestly and instantaneously to the worlds scientific community that meant three things happens immediately firstly countries around the world including our own cdc centres for disease control quickly ran their own pcr tests in their own laboratories and so were able to implement testing very promptly number two within hours of transmission of that genomic information people began working on a vaccine  number three research began looking for therapies both new compounds and among existing compounds that might have an effect on that virus schaffner also a past president of the us national foundation for infectious diseases was less complementary though about the chinese communication about transmission within the key areas especially wuhan over time on the public health side we have established very standard methods pioneered by the cdc epidemiologists to do public health interventions in the field he explained there is concern that those rigorous epidemiological methods still have not been employed optimally in china that public health information and the clinical information is only just now being shared there has been reluctance on that aspect to transmit that information transparently and quickly as schaffner added the who and cdc now have standing offers to work with their chinese counterparts in the field but so far those have not been accepted according to schaffner the chinese command and control method of governance has enabled them rapidly to quarantine up to 50 million people in the affected areas but it works less well when it comes to disseminating more sensitive information he does feel it is a missed opportunity for china to show itself in a positive light i think it ought to have been a matter of national pride said schaffner it should have been an opportunity to show how open the country is to the world this could also delay the return to normality when the outbreak does start subsiding schaffner identified two possible metrics that could be used by global health authorities to determine when it would be safe to return to business as usual one is a determination of new cases in wuhan he explained but to have confidence in that metric we need to be sure that testing intensity is reasonably constant  we are not sure how reliable that is schaffner therefore suggested that the rest of the world would be unable to rely on that metric there may though be one other metric that can help us and that is the number of exportations from wuhan and hubei the other area district at the epicentre of the outbreak to other parts of china and the rest of the world he added if you can show a diminution in those exportations that will give public health and governments generally the confidence they can back off some of these quarantine restrictions there is though growing optimism over developing therapies against the covid19 virus this applies particularly to vaccines and antibodies to neutralize the active sites of the virus surface that expedite the penetration of host cells according to michael farzan cochair of the department of immunology and microbiology scripps research la jolla ca usa this virus is a close cousin of sarscov and like sarscov it chooses meaning has been selected to move rapidly from host to host before an adaptive immune response emerges he explained because of this and unlike hiv1 and ebolavirus it keeps its key epitopes exposed probably so that it can be more efficient at binding the next cell this makes it very vulnerable to antibody neutralization and thus it is a relatively easy virus to protect against i refer to it as stupid on a spectrum where hiv which lives in the face of an active immune system for years is a genius furthermore as farzan added it does not mutate rapidly for an rna virus because unusually for this category it has a proofreading function in its polymerase 3 in short a vaccine and especially a vaccine targeted in part to the receptorbinding domain of the 2019ncov entry protein the spike or s protein should be effective he said as this protein is protected against mutation a vaccine would not need regular updates unlike seasonal influenza vaccines another longstanding question is the exact sequence of events and interactions with the host immune system in severe and fatal cases death usually results from respiratory failure following pneumonia which is either caused directly by the virus or caused by secondary infection by opportunistic bacteria such as streptococcus in the case of influenza outbreaks pneumonia usually results from secondary bacterial infections that come in only when the primary virus infection has subsided indeed the majority of deaths associated with the great spanish influenza pandemic of 19181919 were caused not by the influenza virus alone but by bacterial pneumonia following the initial viral infection 4 unlike influenza viruses however some coronaviruses such as covid19 are believed to cause pneumonia directly although that does not prevent subsequent bacterial secondary infections there is already evidence that the virus has caused some severe cases of pneumonia directly with no evidence of other known respiratory viral or bacterial pathogens after conducting microbiological testing 5 there is still debate over the relative roles of primary viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia in the wuhan outbreak and how to deal with it hunter is convinced that it is a primary viral pneumonia echoing some of the early studies as well as more extensive analysis of the sars outbreak 6 my reason for that is people are saying antibiotics dont work in this case and they work for secondary pneumonia but not primary also the early symptoms of this novel coronavirus infection are in the lower respiratory tract this again is unlike most if not all influenza virus strains where lower respiratory tract symptoms come later presumably from secondary bacterial infection hunter agreed though that some patients will get secondary bacterial pneumonia as well and that could account for some of the severe cases however john edmunds who develops control programmes for disease at the london school of health and tropical medicine in the uk reckons that the relative roles of bacterial and viral pneumonia are not yet clear some anecdotal reports seem to suggest that most patients are initially ok and then get severe disease which might indicate a bacterial superinfection but how consistent this pattern is is anyones guess again there is a lack of clinical as well as epidemiological data that are coming out edmunds commented this question of viral versus bacterial pneumonia is important for treatment because the latter would require the routine use of antibiotics whereas the primary viral infections would be treated with antivirals and antibodies overall as the outbreak continues to develop and new data come out of china there are at least good prospects of treating patients with antiviral and antibody treatments until an efficient vaccine becomes available  the danger of stories in global health sophie harman   have you heard the story about fidel castro and the ugandan army you know the one where after years of fighting yoweri museveni and the national resistance movement come to power in 1986 and shortly after sending the new ugandan army to cuba for army medicals find that some soldiers are hiv positive on discovering this so the story goes museveni decides to be a leading example in the global response to hivaids to avoid any stigma or accusations that his military is weak several people told me this story when i was researching hivaids in kampala in 2005 i now tell it to my students embellishing a phone call between castro and museveni the story gets a bit distorted as i try to hold the attention of 90 undergraduate students but does not lose the power of what it communicates about the relationship between militaries national security and global health the story could be made up another folk tale spread by museveni or his political opponents but it makes sense to the people who believe it and provides an insight into why militaries became a focus of the hivaids response in the early 2000s anyone working in science medicine and global health would have heard a story like thisan explanation as to how things came to be that is not necessarily based on evidence fact or peer-reviewed research as efforts to contain coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 show one part of responding to outbreaks is to control the stories and misinformation that spread good science and evidence-based medicine can lead us to dismiss such stories especially if they perpetuate falsehoods or a threat to life stories in this respect are dangerous they are dangerous when they spread false information they are dangerous when we impose single narratives and they are dangerous when we think them irrelevant to the work of science medicine and global health 

 stories become dangerous when we overlook or dismiss them as a source of knowledge if the 201416 outbreak of ebola taught us anything it is if you want to understand how a disease spreads look to the stories of the communities it affects stories of foreign actors coming into communities to spread disease matter because they change how communities and individuals are engaged in information exchange stories about fear of the military matter as they suggest inducement to behaviour change is more about short-term fear of immediate harm than long-term health and protection if you do not listen to these stories any intervention to stop the spread of diseases however scientifically advanced is likely to fail too often when we dismiss stories we dismiss women in many low-income and middle-income countries it is women who experience the front line of health services we know that it is women who bear the brunt of delivering on global targets of child health are understandably the focus of maternal health and are the ones more likely to go to hivaids care and treatment clinics to collect anti-retroviral treatment for themselves and their husbands however womens everyday knowledge and stories of how health systems function in particular settings are usually devalued or ignored especially in policy and agenda setting all too often womens stories reveal inconvenient truths for governments and international actors the starkest examples come from womens stories of seeking abortion outside of formal health systems in countries where access to safe abortion is restricted or criminalised then there are the stories of women avoiding clinics to deliver their babies because they know someone who went to the clinic and did not come out alive scientific evidence from around the world shows that safe delivery with a skilled birth attendant and available support for birth complications reduce risks to both baby and mother however such evidence does not necessarily stack up if your lived reality is clinics that can be more than 50 km away from your home are often understaffed do not have basic supplies may charge hidden fees and possibly detain you if you cant pay and are the same place your aunty died in the past these sorts of circumstances do not count as scientific evidence but such stories draw on knowledge derived from experience and matter when pregnant women weigh up their birthing options stories may contradict scientific evidence but they are derived from an everyday perception you can throw as many incentivesbaby kits small payments education campaignsto get women to deliver in clinics but unless you listen and see the stories of these women as an everyday reality of how health systems work little will change other stories have much greater visibility the rise of the global health hero story in the past decades obscures women further men working in global health have cemented their leadership through biographies and high-profile interviews that focus on their life stories male dominance of such stories is perhaps unsurprising given men disproportionately assume leadership positions in global health however male-dominated story-telling has important impacts on the wider politics of global health governance it increases the space men take up in our narratives and imagination on global health reproducing the norm of men as leaders and individual visionaries that get things donethe single heroic leader with the necessary vision dynamism and obstinacy to address the worlds greatest problems focusing on the individual or emphasising their stubborn quest for change obscures the collaborative nature on which most breakthroughs and delivery in science and global public health take place it also runs the risk of creating false idols looked to as the solutions for every crisis the individual hero the single narrative invisible women and the stories we dismiss all point to the ethical dangers of who has the right to tell use and consume stories too often stories are used in ways that allow audiences to eat the trauma of the story-teller eating trauma has long been a device of international charities in their fundraising appeals this presents a conundrum to story-telling in global health how to communicate humanity in a way that does not feast on the trauma of others we need to think through the ethics of how we use stories in our work the role of the story-tellers and the platforms and context in which they are happy or consent to story-telling there is an ethical imperative to go beyond writer chimamanda ngozi adichies warning of the single story wherein power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person but to make it the definitive story of that person to recognise the complexity of individual characters and fundamentally to allow the story to adapt and change as people adapt and change story-tellers have to own their story and how it is told and used the growth in measles in the usa and loss of elimination status during 2019 in albania czech republic greece and the uk show the dangerous impact stories can have on the health of a population stories about the side-effects of vaccines based on rumour or something read on the internet are never based on fact but presented in a way that grasps the attention of concerned parents given the dangers of such anti-vaxxer narratives the default would understandably be to dismiss such quackery and restate the science yet to dismiss is to be remiss what such stories even dangerous ones show us is how society is responding and making sense of advances in science and medicine dangerous stories gain greater traction in times of economic and political instability stories cannot simply be rebuffed by science because at their core is a fiction and construction of a narrative that people can understand and for some reason trust want to believe or are encouraged to believe by politicians family members or neighbours among others more than science and evidence appreciating the context in which such dangerous stories arise can help challenge them in many ways actors working in science and medicine recognise the power of stories to educate inform and create empathy and in so doing are telling stories to popular audiences the counter to fake news and false narratives is that people want to engage with knowledge facts and evidence audiences who may not read medical journals still marvel at advances in science and the politics of health and seek knowledge to make sense of the world especially at a time when the quality of debate and evidence in the political world is found wanting the desire for knowledge and stories that help us make sense of ourselves our bodies and place in the world is reflected in the stories we want to read see and hear the burst of clinician memoirs such as adam kays this is going to hurt amanda browns the prison doctor and elizabeth fords sometimes amazing things happen has disrupted the dominance of how-to-get-rich diet and self-help books in non-fiction reading hospital dramas continue to be popular draws to television and streaming audiences after the success of the global health film festival who will host its own film festival the health for all film festival this year audiences want stories about health and the people and systems that provide health care people are curious about the mysteries of organs such as the brain and are thrilled by stories of neurosurgeons such as henry marsh because he explains not only how the brain works but also his relationships with patients colleagues and his own health we want to kick away the pedestal to see how clinicians cope with the everyday possibility of life and death in turn clinicians want to share their stories as a means of making sense of their own work and connecting with their patients common humanity expressed through stories connects story-tellers and audiences clinicians and patients the corollary to the danger of stories is that stories make people less scared fear comes from uncertainty misunderstanding and a failure to recognise humanity in one another stories are dangerous when they are ignored taken out of context are fiction masquerading as fact or used to dominate silence or demonise other people but stories have long been a means to explain what is happening to us to think through our fears and relate to each other as human beings this is the real power of stories in global health provision of comfort making sense of our health and place in the world challenging our preconceptions and defeating fear through stories of common humanity  collective response to the media coverage of covid-19 pandemic on reddit and wikipedia nicol gozzi michele tizzani michele starnini fabio ciulla daniela paolotti andr panisson nicola perra  the exposure and consumption of information during epidemic outbreaks may alter risk perception trigger behavioural changes and ultimately affect the evolution of the disease it is thus of the uttermost importance to map information dissemination by mainstream media outlets and public response however our understanding of this exposure-response dynamic during covid-19 pandemic is still limited in this paper we provide a characterization of media coverage and online collective attention to covid-19 pandemic in four countries italy united kingdom united states and canada for this purpose we collect an heterogeneous dataset including 227 768 online news articles and 13 448 youtube videos published by mainstream media 107 898 users posts and 3 829 309 comments on the social media platform reddit and 278 456 892 views to covid-19 related wikipedia pages our results show that public attention quantified as users activity on reddit and active searches on wikipedia pages is mainly driven by media coverage and declines rapidly while news exposure and covid-19 incidence remain high furthermore by using an unsupervised dynamical topic modeling approach we show that while the attention dedicated to different topics by media and online users are in good accordance interesting deviations emerge in their temporal patterns overall our findings offer an additional key to interpret public perceptionresponse to the current global health emergency and raise questions about the effects of attention saturation on collective awareness risk perception and thus on tendencies towards behavioural changes  in the next influenza pandemic be it now or in the future be the virus mild or virulent the single most important weapon against the disease will be a vaccine the second most important will be communication 1  this evocative sentence was written in may 2009 by john m barry in the early phases of what soon after become the h1n1 2009 pandemic in his essay barry summarised the mishandling of the deadly 1918 spanish flu highlighting the importance of precise effective and honest information in the onset of health crises eleven years later we find ourselves dealing with another pandemic the cause is not a novel strain of influenza but these words are unfortunately still extremely relevant in fact as the sars-cov-2 sweeps the world and the vaccine is just a far vision of hope the most important weapons to reduce the burden of the disease are non-pharmaceutical interventions 2 3  social distancing became paramount gatherings have been cancelled mobility within and across countries have been dramatically reduced while such measures have been enforced to different extents across nations they all rely on compliance their effectiveness is linked to risk and susceptibility perception 4  thus the information that citizens are exposed to is fundamental history repeats itself and we seem not be able to learn from our past mistakes as happened in 1918 despite early evidences from china 5 6  the virus was first equated by many to the normal seasonal flu as happened in 1918 many national and regional governments organised campaigns aimed at boosting social activities and thus local economies actively trying to convince people that their cities were safe and that  andrepanissonisiit  nperragreenwichacuk the spreading was isolated in far away locations for example the hashtag milanononsiferma milan does not stop was coined to invite citizens in milan to go out and live normally free aperitifs were offered in venice in hindsight of course is easy to criticise the initial response in italy in fact the country has been one of the first to experience rapid growth of hospitalizations 7  however the mayor of london twelve days before the national lockdown and few days after the extension of the cordon sanitaire to the entire country in italy affirmed via his official facebook page we should carry on doing what weve been doing 8  more in general in several western countries the news coming from others reporting worrying epidemic outbreaks were not considered as relevant for the internal situation this initial phase aimed at conveying low local risk and boosting confidence about national safety has been repeated at different times across countries a series of surveys conducted in late february provide a glimpse of the possible effects of these approaches they report that citizens of several european countries despite the grim news coming from asia were overly optimistic about the health emergency placing their risk of infections to be 1 or less 9  as happened in 1918 the countries that reacted earlier rather than later were able to control the virus with significant less victims 10 11 12 13 14  history repeats itself but the context often is radically different in 1918 news circulated slowly via news papers controlled by editorial choices and of course words of mouth in 2009 we witnessed the first pandemic in the social media era newspapers and tv were still very important source of information but twitter facebook youtube wikipedia started to become relevant for decentralized news consumption boosting peer discussions and misinformation spread today these platforms and websites are far more popular integral part of society and instrumental pieces of the national and international news circulations together with traditional news media they are the principal sources of information for the public as such they are fundamental drivers of people perception opinions and thus behaviours this is particularly relevant for health issues for example about 60 of adults in the usa consulted online sources to gather health information 15  with respect to past epidemics and pandemics studies on traditional news coverage of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic highlighted the importance of framing and its effect on peoples perception behaviours such as vaccination intent stigmatisation of cultures at the epicentre of the outbreak and how these factors differ across countriescultures 16 17 18 19 20 21  during zika epidemic in 2016 public attention was synchronised across us states driven by news coverage about the outbreak and independently of the real local risk of infection 22  with respect to covid-19 pandemic itself a recent study clearly shows how google searches for coronavirus in the usa spiked significantly right after the announcement of the first confirmed case in each state 23  several studies based on twitter data also highlight how misinformation and low quality information about covid-19 although overall limited spread before the local outbreak and rapidly took off once the local epidemic started in the current landscape this has the potential to boost irrational unscientific and dangerous behaviours 24 25 26  on the other hand despite some important limitations 27  modern media has become a key data source to observe and monitor health in fact posts on twitter 28 29 30 31 32 33  facebook 34  and reddit 35 36  page views in wikipedia 37 38 and searches on google 39 40 have been used to study nowcast and predict the spreading of infectious diseases as well as the prevalence of noncommunicable illnesses therefore in the current full-fledged digital society information is not only key to inform peoples behaviour but can be used to develop an unprecedented understanding of such behaviours as well as of the phenomena driving them the context where covid-19 is unfolding is thus very heterogeneous and complex traditional and social media are integral parts of our perception and opinions have the potential to trigger behaviour change and thus influence the pandemic spreading such complex landscape must be characterized in order to understand the public attention and response to media coverage here we tackle this challenge by assembling an heterogeneous dataset which includes 227 768 news and 13 448 youtube videos published by traditional media 278 456 892 views of topical wikipedia pages 107 898 submissions and 3 829 309 comments from 417 541 distinct users on reddit as well as epidemic data in four different countries italy united kingdom united states and canada first we explore how media coverage and epidemic progression influence public attention and response to achieve this we analyze news volume and covid-19 incidence with respect to wikipedia page views volume and reddit comments our results show that public attention and response are mostly driven by media coverage rather than disease spreading furthermore we observe typical saturation and memory effects of public collective attention moreover using an unsupervised topic modeling approach we explore the different topics framed in traditional media and in reddit discussions we show that while attentions of news outlets and online users towards different topics are in good accordance interesting deviations emerge in their temporal patterns also we highlight that at the end of our observation period general interest grows towards topics about the resumption of activities after lockdown the search for a vaccine against sars-cov-2 acquired immunity and antibodies tests overall the research presented here offers insights to interpret public perceptionresponse to the current global health emergency raises interrogatives about the effects of attention saturation on collective awareness risk perception and thus on tendencies towards behavioural changes how is collective attention shaped by news media coverage and epidemic progression to tackle this important question we collected an heterogeneous dataset that includes covid-19 related news articles and youtube videos published online by mainstream information media relevant posts and relative discussion of geolocalized reddit users and country-specific views to wikipedia pages related to covid-19 for italy united kingdom united states and canada see subsections a b c of methods and materials for details this choice aims to provide an overview of media coverage and a proxy of public attention and response on the one hand the study of news articles and videos allows us to estimate the exposure of the public to covid-19 pandemic in traditional news media on the other hand the study of users discussions and response on social media through reddit and information seeking through wikipedia page views allows us to quantify the reaction of individuals to both the covid-19 pandemic and news exposure as mentioned in the introduction previous studies showed the usefulness of social media internet use and search trends to analyze health-related information streams and monitor public reaction to infectious diseases 41 42 43 44 45  hence we consider volume of comments of geolocalized users on the subreddit rcoronavirus 1 to explore the public discussion in reaction to media covering the epidemic in the various countries while we consider the number of views of relevant wikipedia pages about covid-19 pandemic to quantify users interest it is important to stress how reddit and wikipedia provide different aspects of online users behaviour and collective response in fact while reddit posts can be regarded as a general indicator of the online discussion surrounding the global health emergency the number of access to covid-19 related wikipedia pages is a proxy of health information seeking behaviour hisb hisb is the act through which individuals retrieve and acquire new knowledge about a specific topic related to health 46 47  and it is likely to be triggered on a population scale by a disrupting event such as the threaten of a previously unknown disease 48 49  normalized weekly volume of news articles and youtube videos news reddit comments reddit wikipedia views wikipedia related to covid-19 pandemic and covid-19 incidence covid inc in different countries our analysis starts by comparing in figure 1  the weekly volume of news and videos published on youtube wikipedia views and reddit comments of geolocalized users in comparison with the weekly covid-19 incidence in the four countries considered it can be seen how as covid-19 spreads both media coverage and public interest grow in time however public attention quantified by the number of reddit comments and wikipedia views sharply decreases after reaching a peak despite the volume of news and covid-19 incidence remaining high furthermore the peak in public attention consistently anticipates the maximum media exposure and maximum covid-19 incidence the correlation between media coverage public attention and the epidemic progression is quantified more in details in figure 2  the plot shows that news coverage of each country is strongly correlated with covid-19 incidence both global and domestic and slightly less with the volume of reddit comments and wikipedia views which in turn are much less correlated with covid-19 incidence both global and domestic this holds for all countries under consideration and highlights how the disease spreading triggers media coverage and how the public response is more likely driven by such news exposure in each country rather than covid-19 progression beyond these observations it is interesting to notice from figure 2 that italy is the only country where news volume shows higher correlation with domestic rather than global incidence this suggests that italian media coverage follows more closely the internal evolution rather than the global one at odds with respect to other countries this is probably due to italy being the location of the first covid-19 outbreak outside asia this observation is supported by figure 3  showing the citation share of italian locations by italian news media before and after the first covid-19 death was confirmed in italy on 20200220 after this date italian locations represent about 74 of all places cited by italian media in our dataset with an increase of 45 with respect to the same statistics calculated before similar effects though generally less intense can be observed also in the other countries therefore while media coverage is generally well synchronized with the global covid-19 incidence the media attention gradually shifts towards the internal evolution of the pandemic as soon as domestic outbreaks erupt arguably this may have played an important role in individual risk perception we can speculate that re-framing the emergency within a national dimension had the potential to amplify the perceived susceptibility of individuals 50 51 and thus increase the adoption of behavioural changes 4 52  indeed previous studies showed how at the beginning of february 2020 people were overly optimistic regarding the risks associated with the new virus circulating in asia and how their perception sharply changed after first cases were confirmed in their countries 9 53  to explore more systematically the relationship between media coverage public attention and epidemic progression we consider a linear regression model to nowcast separately for each country collective public attention quantified with the number of comments by geolocalized reddit users or visits to relevant wikipedia pages given the volume of media coverage or the covid-19 incidence as independent variables we include also memory effects in the public attention by considering an exponential decaying term in the news time series 22 see subsection d of methods and materials for details we compare the three models where the independent variables are the domestic incidence the news volume the news volume plus a memory term by using the akaike information criterion aic 54 and coefficient of determination r 2  we found that the model considering only covid-19 incidence has much less predictive power than the ones considering me- dia coverage see table ii in methods and material this enforces the idea that collective attention is mainly driven by media coverage rather than covid-19 incidence in addition we found that including memory effects improves significantly the model performance not surprisingly the coefficients of the memory effects term reported in table i are negative for all countries this implies that public attention actually saturates in response to news exposure and gives us the chance to quantify the rate at which this phenomenon happens the results presented so far are in very good accordance with findings obtained in previous contexts related to epidemics and pandemics indeed a similar media-driven spiky unfolding of public attention measured through the information seeking and public discussions of online users has been observed during the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic 57 58  the 2016 zika outbreak 59  the seasonal flu 60 and during more localized public health emergency such as the 2013 measles outbreak in netherlands 61  our findings confirm the central role of media showing how media exposure is capable of shaping and driving collective attention during a national and global health emergency media exposure is an important factor that can influence individual risk perception as well 62 63 64  the timing and framing of the information disseminated by media can actually modulate the attention and ultimately the behaviour of individuals 2  this becomes an even greater concern in a context where the most effective strategy to fight the spreading are containment measures based on individuals behaviour for this reason in the next section we characterize media coverage and online users response more specifically in terms of content produced and consumed  while collective attention and media coverage are well correlated in terms of volume the content and topics discussed by media and consumed by online users may not be as synchronized 65 66  to shed light on this issue we adopt an unsupervised topic modeling approach to extract prevalent topics in the news articles mentioned and discussed on reddit often indeed users on reddit post a submission containing a news article and discussion unfolds in comments under such submission differently from the first part and to provide a comprehensive overview of the topics discussed here we do not take into account any geographical context nonetheless in the supplementary information we provide some insights also on the specific topics discussed by users in different countries we characterize the main topics discussed on reddit by considering all submissions that include a news article in english we then apply a topic modelling approach on the content of this news article set specifically we extract topics by means of non-negative matrix factorization nmf 67  a popular method for this kind of tasks see subsection e of methods and materials for details in this way we extract the n  64 most relevant topics in the news shared on reddit as a second step we apply the model trained on the reddit news to the set of articles published by mainstream media that is we characterize the news published by media in terms of the topics discussed on reddit this choice allows us to directly compare the topics covered by media with the public discussion around such news exposure a complete list of the 64 topics extracted with the most frequent words is provided in the supplementary information we consider the number of articles published on a certain topic as a proxy of general interest of traditional media towards it while we measure the collective interest of reddit users by the number of comments under the news articles on a specific topic figure 4 shows an overview of the topics extracted and a comparison of the interest of media and reddit users we find a diverse and heterogeneous set of topics among others we recognize topics about the global spreading of the virus outbreaks who cdc covid-19 symptoms treatment hospitals and care facilities symptoms medical treatment medical staff care facilities the economic impact of the pandemic and responses from the governments to the upcoming crisis economy money different societal aspects sports religious services education and also the possible interven- overall the attention of traditional media and reddit users towards different topics are in good accordance indeed in figure 4 we represent the difference between interest share towards different topics in media and reddit submissions that is we compute the percentage share of attention dedicated by news outlets and reddit users to each topic and we subtract these two quantities we observe a maximum absolute mismatch in interest share of 261 nonetheless we observe that reddit users are slightly more interested to topics regarding health symptoms medical treatment non-pharmaceutical interventions and personal protective equipment social distancing face masks studies and information on the epidemic research surveys santa clara study cdc and also to specific public figures such as anthony fauci interestingly the santa clara study topic refers to the discussion about a controversial scientific paper suggesting that a much higher fraction of the population in the santa clara county was infected respect to what originally thought 68  since the study suggests a lower mortality rate the preprint has been quickly leveraged to support protest against lockdowns 2  while substantial flaws have been detected in the scientific methodology of the paper 3  the topics overview presented so far does not take into account any temporal dynamics of interest however topics showing a similar overall statistics may present a mismatch in temporal patterns hence in the following we take into account the temporal evolution of interest towards different topics in figure 5 we represent each topic as a single point its x-coordinate y-coordinate indicates when such topic reached 50 of its total relevance in news outlets on reddit during the analysis interval see subsection e of methods and materials for a formal definition of the relevance of a topic therefore topics at the bottom left became relevant very early in the public discussion among these we recognize themes centred on early covid-19 outbreaks ie chinese japanese iranian and italian outbreaks the events related to cruise ships specific countries ie israel singapore and malaysia and also topics regarding early health issues such as symptoms confirmed cases and the cdc on the contrary topics in the top right became relevant toward the end of the analysis interval early may reasonably we find here topics about the resumption of activities after lockdown ie reopening the feasibility and timing of a possible vaccine against sars-cov-2 ie vaccine and discussions regarding acquired immunity and antibodies tests ie immunity in-between we find all other topics clustered around end of march and mid-april 2020 the period when the general discussion surrounding covid-19 pandemic aroused sharply as also shown in figure 1  note that the diagonal plotted as a dashed line in figure 5 separates topics according to their temporal evolution above below the diagonal we find topics whose interest on reddit grows slowly quickly with respect to the media coverage therefore above the diagonal the interest of reddit users is mainly triggered by media exposure while below it the interest grows faster and declines rapidly despite sustained media exposure while the top-left and bottom-right regions are empty indicating that as a first approximation temporal patterns of attention by traditional media and reddit users are well-synchronized interesting deviations from the diagonal are observable for example above the diagonal one can find mainly topics related to various outbreaks economics and politics for which the interests on reddit follows the media coverage below the diagonal we observe topics more related to everyday life such as schools medical staff care facilities and lockdown for which the attention on reddit accelerates with respect to media coverage and then declines rapidly note that our view of topics discussed on reddit is limited since we only consider topics from news articles shared in submissions and do not explicitly take into account content expressed in comments this ensures a proper comparison with topics extracted from news published and explains the absence of points in the bottom right corner of figure 5  in this work we characterized the response of online users to both media coverage and covid-19 pandemic progression as a first step we focused on the impact of media coverage on collective attention in different countries characterized as volumes of country-specific wikipedia pages views and comments of geolocalized reddit users we showed that collective attention was mainly driven by media coverage rather than epidemic progression rapidly saturated and decreased despite media coverage and covid-19 incidence remaining high this trend is very similar to that observed during other outbreaks 57 58 59 60 61  also we showed how media coverage sharply shifted to the domestic situation as soon as the first death was confirmed in the home country discussing the implications for re-shaping individuals perception of risk 9 53  as a second step we focused on the dynamics of content production and consumption we modeled topics published in mainstream media and discussed on reddit showing that reddit users were generally more interested in health data regarding the new disease and interventions needed to halt the spreading with respect to media exposure by taking into account the dynamics of topics extracted we show that while their temporal patterns are generally synchronized the public attention for topics related to politics and economics is mainly triggered by media exposure while the interests for topics more related to daily life accelerates on reddit with respect to media coverage of course our research comes with limitations first we characterized the exposure of individuals to covid-19 pandemic by considering only news articles and youtube videos published online by major news outlets however individuals are also exposed to relevant information through other channels with television on top of these 69  second a 2013 pew internet study found that reddit users are more likely young males 70  showing that around 15 of male internet users aged between 18 and 29 declare to use reddit compared to the 5 of women in the same age range and to the 8 of men aged between 30 and 49 similarly informal surveys proposed to users showed that most of respondents were males in their late teens to mid-20s and that female users were very much in the minority 71  furthermore reddit is much more popular among urban and suburban residents rather than individuals living in rural areas 70  besides socio-demographic biases other works suggested also that reddit has become more and more a self-referential community reinforcing the tendency to focus on its own contents rather than external sources 72  thus perceptions interests and behaviours of reddit users may differ from those of the general population a similar argument may be raised for wikipedia searches indeed the usage of internet especially for information seeking purposes can vary across people with different socio-demographic backgrounds 73 74 75 76  finally our view on online users reaction is partial indeed we do not consider other popular digital data sources such as for example twitter the reason behind this choice is twofold first many studies already characterized public response during the current and past health emergencies through the lens of twitter 25 43 45 58 59 77 78 79 80  second several studies have reported high prevalence of bots as drivers of low quality information and discussions on covid-19 on this platform 24 25 81 82 83  thus careful and challenging extra steps would be necessary to isolate identify and distinguish organic discussionsreactions possibly originated from traditional media from those sparked by social bots we leave this for future work in conclusion our work offers further insights to interpret public response to the current global health emergency and raises questions about possible undesired effects of communication on one hand our results confirm the pivotal role of media during health emergencies showing how collective attention is mainly driven by media coverage therefore since people are highly reactive to the news they are exposed to in the beginning of an outbreak the quality and type of information provided might have critical effects on risk perception behaviours and ultimately on the unfolding of the disease on the other hand however we found that collective online attention saturates and declines rapidly despite media exposure and disease circulation remaining high attention saturation has the potential to affect collective awareness perceived risk and ultimately propensity towards virtuous individual behavioural changes aimed at mitigating the spreading furthermore especially in case of unknown viruses attention saturation might exacerbate the spreading of low quality information which is likely to spread in the early phases of the outbreak when the characteristics of the disease are uncertain future works are needed to characterize the actual effects of attention saturation on human perceptions during a global health emergency our findings suggest that public health authorities should consider to reinforce specific communication channels such as social media platforms in order to compensate the natural phenomenon of attention saturation indeed these channels have the potential to create a more durable engagement with people through a continuous loop of direct interactions currently we see public health authorities issuing regularly declarations on social media however the cdc didnt even have a twitter account in 2009 during h1n1 pandemic the account was created in may 2010 while this is just an example it underlines how we are relatively new to communicating such global health emergencies through social medias therefore there is great need to further reinforce and engage people through these channels alongside public health authorities should consider to strengthen additional communication channels an example can be represented by participatory surveillance platforms all over the world such as influenzanet flu near you and flutracking 84 85 86  which have the potential of delivering in-depth targeted information to individuals during public health emergencies to promote the exchange of information between people and public health authorities with the potential to enhance the level of engagement in the community 87  in this section we provide general information about the data sets collected and the methods used we collect news articles using news api a service that allows to download articles published online in a variety of countries and languages 88  for each of the country considered we download all relevant articles published online by selected sources in the period 20200207 -20200515 we select relevant articles considering those citing one of the following keywords coronavirus covid19 covid-19 ncov-19 sars-cov-2 note that for each article we have access to title description and a preview of the whole text in total our dataset consists in 227 768 news 71 461 published by italian 63 799 by uk 82 630 by us and 9 878 by canadian media additionally we collect all videos published on youtube by major news organizations in the four countries under investigation via their official youtube channels using the official api 89  in doing so we download title and description of all videos and select as relevant those that mention one of the following keywords coronavirus virus covid covid19 sars sars-cov-2 sarscov2 the reach of each channel measured by number of subscribers varies quite drastically from more than 9 million for cnn usa to about 12 thousand for ansa italy in total the youtube dataset consist of 13 448 videos 3 325 by italian 3 525 by british 6 288 by american ans 310 by canadian channels it is important to underline that while there is a good overlap between the sources of news articles and videos some do not match this is due to the fact that not all news organizations run a youtube channel and others do not produce traditional articles in the supplementary information we provide a complete list of news outlets and youtube channels considered reddit is a social content aggregation website where users can post comment and vote content it is structured in subcommunities ie subreddits centered around a variety of topics reddit has already proven to be suitable for a variety of research purposes ranging from the study of user engagement and interactions between highly related communities 90 91 to post-election political analyses 92  also it has been used to study the impact of linguistic differences in news titles 93 and to explore recent web-related issues such as hate speech 94 or cyberbullying 95 as well as health related issues like mental illness 96  also providing insights about the opioid epidemics 77 97  we used the reddit api to collect all submissions and comments published in reddit under the subreddit rcoronavirus from 15022020 to 15052020 after data cleanup by removing entries deleted by authors and moderators we keep only submissions with score  1 to avoid spam we remove comments with less than 10 characters and with more than 3 duplicates to avoid using automatic messages from moderation final data contains 107 898 submissions and 3 829 309 comments from 417 541 distinct users for the submissions we then selected entries with links to english news outlets the content of the urls was extracted using the available implementation 4 of the method described in 98  resulting in 66 575 valid documents reddit does not provide any explicit information about users location therefore we use self reporting via regular expression to assign a location to users reddit users often declare geographical information about themselves in submissions or comment texts we used the same approach as described in 97  that found the use of regular expressions as reliable resulting in high correlation with census data in the us although we acknowledge a potential higher bias at country level due to heterogeneities in reddit population coverage and users demographics we selected all texts containing expressions such as i am from or i live in and extracted candidate expressions from the text that follows the expression to identify which ones represented country locations by removing inconsistent self reporting we were able to assign a country to 789 909 distinct users from which 41 465 have written at least one comment in the subreddit rcoronavirus 13 811 from usa 6 870 from canada 3 932 from uk and 445 from italy wikipedia has become a popular digital data source to study health information seeking behaviour 57 99  and to monitor and forecast the spreading of infectious diseases 100 101  here we use the wikimedia api 102 to collect the number of visits per day of wikipedia articles and the total monthly accesses to a specific project from each country we consider the language as indicative of a specific country suggesting the relevant projects for our analysis to be in english and italian ie enwikipedia and itwikipedia respectively we choose the articles directly related to covid-19 and the ones in the see also section of each page at the time of the analysis 20200207 -20200515 including country-specific articles see supplementary information for full list of web pages considered except for the italian where the language is highly indicative of the location the number of the access to english pages are almost evenly distributed among english-speaking countries to normalize the signal related to each country we weight the number of daily accesses to a single article from a specific project p s p d with the total number of monthly accesses from a country c to the related wikipedia project t c p d such that the daily page views from a given wikipedia project and country is where the denominator is the total number of views of the wikipedia specific project the total volume of views at day d from a country c is then given by the sum over all the articles a and projects p namely y c d  ap y c ap d above we showed how media coverage covid-19 incidence and public attention are correlated even across four different countries to move a step forward in this analysis we considered a linear regression model that predicts for each country the public response given the news exposure to include memory effects in the public response to media coverage we consider also a modified version of this simple model in which we weight cumulative news articles volume time series with an exponential decaying term 22  formally we define the new variable where  is a free parameter that sets the memory time scale and is tuned with cross-validation more details in the supplementary information these two models are compared to a linear regression that considers only covid-19 incidence to predict public collective attention then the models considered are where y t can be either the volume of reddit comments of geolocalized users or country specific wikipedia visits and u t is the error term in table ii we report the results of the three regressions in terms of akaike information criterion aic 54  we observe that the model considering both news volume and memory effects is generally the better choice while the model considering covid-19 incidence only is the worst topic modeling has emerged as one of the most effective methods for classifying clustering and retrieving textual data and has been the object of extensive investigation in the literature many topic analysis frameworks are extensions of well known algorithms considered as state-of-the-art for topic modeling latent dirichlet allocation lda 103 is the reference for probabilistic topic modeling nonnegative matrix factorization nmf 67 is the counterpart of lda for the matrix factorization community although there are many approaches to temporal and hierarchical topic modeling 104 105 106  we choose to apply nmf to the dataset and then build time-varying intensities for each topic using the articles publication date starting from a dataset d containing the news articles shared in reddit we extract words and phrases with the methodology described in 107  discarding terms with frequency below 10 to form a vocabulary v with around 60k terms each document is then represented as a vector of term counts in a bag-of-words approach we apply tf-idf normalization 108 and extract a total of k  64 topics through nmf where 2 f is the frobenius norm and x  r dv is the matrix resulting form tf-idf normalization subject to the constraint that the values in w  r dk and h  r kv must be nonnegative the nonnegative factorization is achieved using the projected gradient method with sparseness constraints as described in 109 110  the matrix h is then used as a transformation basis for other datasets eg with a new matrix x we fix h and calculate a new w according to eq 3 for each topic k we build a time series s k for each dataset d where s t k is the strength of topic k at time t for the news outlets dataset s is the set of all documents shared at time t in news outlets for reddit we weight each shared document by its number of comments and s is the set of all documents shared at time t in reddit and c i is the number of comments associated to document i finally we define the relevance of a topic as the integral in time of the strength therefore given t 0 and t f as the startend of our analysis interval and given k  the coordinates of figure 5 are the t 12 such that authors would like to thank the startup quick

bioinformatics biochemistry and potential effects on virulence ramsey connor f rachel roper l   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov caused a pandemic with 800 deaths worldwide in only a few months 1 its genome was rapidly sequenced 2 and analysis of the identified predicted proteins is advancing bioinformatic analysis predicts that the sars-cov nonstructural protein 1 nsp1 is translated from the most 5 coding region of the sars-cov genome 2 3 4 it is predicted to be cleaved from a large viral polypeptide to form a mature peptide of 20 kda in agreement with recent reports 3 5 the conservation of a viral protein indicates its importance in the virus life cycle the nsp1 sequence is highly conserved in sars-cov isolates sequenced from humans civet cats and bats implying that it is crucial to replication of the virus survival in the host or spread in susceptible populations the full-length nsp1 protein is reported to be conserved in all 130 to date sars-cov isolates 4 in which the replicase proteins are predicted to be expressed therefore the nsp1 protein seems to be absolutely conserved in all replication-competent sars-cov virus isolates here we discuss the sars-cov nsp1 protein from the following perspectives first bioinformatics analysis shows that it is a unique and highly conserved protein second biochemical studies by kamitani et al show the first functional data for nsp1 which implicate it in enhancing rna degradation 5 and third we discuss how nsp1 might contribute to the unique virulence of sars-cov whereas the sars-cov nonstructural proteins 316 are predicted to be conserved in both approximate size and sequence homology in all groups of coronaviruses 4 bioinformatics analyses show that the sars-cov nsp1 is a unique and novel sequence blastp e-value scores for nsp1 compared between sars-cov isolates are typically 1  1099 high percentage identity but after all sars-cov hits are considered only poor blast e values 085 remain which indicates that nsp1 has no significant similarity to any known sequences 6 the closest hits are to vertebrate not viral genes similarly blastn and tblastn showed no significant similarity score 013 and 13 between sars-cov nsp1 nucleotide sequence and any other nucleotide sequence in the ncbi databases coronavirus or non-coronavirus thus the sars-cov nsp1 is unique among coronaviruses 7 and could contribute to the exceptional pathogenesis of sars-cov in humans 1 although direct demonstration of an nsp1 effect on virulence is yet to be shown because there is no significant similarity to other genes a function for nsp1 cannot be inferred from knowledge of related gene functions similarly the nsp1 tertiary nmr structure 8 showed a novel fold ma johnson personal communication with no significant similarity to other proteins and thus the structure provided little insight into protein function finally motif analysis of sars-cov nsp1 showed that no significant protein functional motifs were present 9 10 these data all attest to the uniqueness of the sars-cov nsp1 protein and make it especially important and interesting to characterize recently two groups have begun to characterize the sars-cov nsp1 protein showing that it is present in infected cells as a 20 kda protein as expected and demonstrating that the nsp1 protein is localized in the cytoplasm of infected or uninfected cells in which it is ectopically expressed 3 5 in an exciting turn of events it has now been reported that plasmid-driven expression of nsp1 causes a sharp reduction in the expression of proteins driven by promoters from simian virus 40 sv40 cytomegalovirus cmv and interferon ifn without necessarily affecting cell viability 5 further investigation indicated the specific mrna was also decreased whereas rrna remained unaffected transfected nsp1 rna capped and polyadenylated decreased host protein synthesis and the inclusion of actinomycin d to block new transcription showed a much stronger inhibition of protein synthesis in the presence of nsp1 this indicated that while translation of new transcripts was proceeding in cells not treated with actinomycin d translation from pre-existing transcripts was blocked by nsp1 5 this suggests but does not directly prove that nsp1 increases rna degradation decreased mrna levels and decreased translation of pre-existing mrna presumably as a result of degradation were also seen during infection with sars-cov together these data provide the first evidence of a function for the sars-cov nsp1 protein the mechanism of action of nsp1 remains mysterious it is possible that the observed effect of nsp1 protein on infected cells is caused by induction of a generalized stress response which causes host shut-off rather than specifically causing rna degradation for example cells transfected with nsp1 rna showed reduced viability 33 compared with cells transfected with chloramphenicol acetyl transferase rna 99 however it seems likely that degradation of rna would plausibly cause cell death evidence suggesting that the presence of nsp1 inside cells does not simply induce a non-specific host cell shutdown includes the following observations normal actin rna levels normal sendai virus n-protein expression and replication in nsp1-transfected cells stable rrna levels and finally the fact that 293 cells transfected with plasmid expressing nsp1 maintained 98 viability after 48 h 5 among the possible hypotheses for nsp1 function are that nsp1 might i have nuclease activity either alone or as part of a complex with host proteins ii alter rna-interacting proteins or rna to make it more nuclease sensitive iii be required for the formation or activity of a cellular rnase or iv affect the localization of rna which could subsequently affect its stability andor degradation because there are no identifiable nucleotide-binding sites nuclease homologies or motifs 6 10 perhaps the latter mechanisms are more likely nsp1 has been localized intracellularly with other viral replication proteins 11 however the nsp1 effect on rna has been demonstrated in the absence of other viral proteins thus the functional significance of this association should be further studied furthermore the specificity of nsp1 remains to be elucidated if nsp1 decreases all rna viral and cellular is it still an advantage to the virus because viral transcription occurs at a much higher rate or is nsp1 somehow targeted to degrade cellular transcripts or even certain cell transcripts specifically the fact that it promotes degradation of several mrna sequences from different organisms but not rrna suggests some form of specificity however in some cases nsp1 does not decrease host protein levels appreciably and yet it seems to decrease even its own expression 5 certainly these questions will be the focus of future studies virus depression of host protein synthesis might give a competitive advantage to viral protein production and hence replication many viruses with both dna and rna genomes dampen host protein synthesis by various mechanisms 12 13 14 interestingly however not all of the identified genes that decrease host protein synthesis affect viral replication in vitro  in the case of the herpes virus vhs protein an effect is seen solely in virulence in vivo
14 these data suggest that at least in some cases the effects of host protein shut-off might not be competitive for protein production as much as subversive of the immune response for example a cell that is not expressing adequate levels of mhc class i or ii molecules will be impaired in its antigen presentation capacity both in initiating an adaptive immune response and in being targeted by it cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl killing figure 1
 indeed it has been shown that the herpes protein that causes rna degradation inhibits antigen presentation by dendritic cells 15 and directly decreases the specific immune response to the virus 16 additionally production of proinflammatory cytokines which alert the innate immune system to the presence of virus can also be blocked 17 the kinetics of the response also suggest involvement of the innate immune response because the presence of a gene that decreases host protein production can enhance viral replication in vivo before measurable adaptive immunity 14 because sars-cov is ifn-sensitive 18 19 nsp1 control of ifn might be crucial for sars-cov survival 5 how sars-cov nsp1 functions remains to be answered removal of the nsp1 protein function from the virus 20 will enable determination of its effects on replication andor virulence in vivo however these experiments will require careful design and analysis because indiscriminate deletion of nsp1 sequence would remove cis-acting elements required for replication nsp1 effects on mhc expression antigen presentation cytokine production and ctl killing all need to be explored nsp1 could block induction of specific immunity by blocking host protein synthesis and antigen presentation or cytokine synthesis from sars-cov infected cells 21 22 23 or it could block presentation of viral peptides on infected cells thus masking and protecting infected cells from ctl killing determining this difference is essential to predicting sars-cov vaccine success if nsp1 blocks generation of specific immunity a well-designed sars-cov vaccine will circumvent this problem it is certainly possible to generate both good neutralizing antibody titer and t lymphocyte responses to sars-cov vaccines 24 however vaccination could be ineffective if cells harboring virus do not present viral peptides so that they can be recognized and eliminated by ctl killing evidence has been presented that sars-cov nsp1 a novel protein unique to sars-cov induces degradation of rna and diminishes subsequent protein synthesis similar to the reduction of rna seen in infected cells 5 this is an exciting step that will enable the field of sars-cov research to confirm and extend  or refute  these observations the specificity and biochemical mechanism of action is still to be elucidated as are the potential effects of the rna degradation on virulence and the immune response to sars-cov box 1
 creation of a virus with a functional nsp1 knockout 20 will enable direct demonstration of nsp1 effects on replication in vitro and virulence in animal models 1 24 these experiments will answer whether the sars-cov nsp1 is an important factor in the high virulence of sars-cov compared with related coronavirusesbox 1unanswered questions regarding sars-cov nsp1

  the orchestra of reovirus cell entry bernardo mainou a   as obligate intracellular parasites viruses depend on their host to replicate and spread viral tropism for specific cells tissues and hosts is determined by the presence and accessibility of host factors the virus needs to replicate the outcome of infection is also influenced by the ability of the host to mount an antiviral response to infection viruses differ in the specific host molecules used to infect cells and how they evade host immune pathways however general principles used by viruses to take over host cells are conserved viruses attach and enter cells cross the cellular lipid bilayer deliver viral nucleic acid to an intracellular site usurp cellular factors for replication and exit understanding the host and viral factors that promote or mitigate viral infection is essential for the development of efficacious antiviral therapeutics and the engineering of improved viral vectors for gene delivery and oncolytic purposes the reoviridae are a family of non-enveloped double-stranded rna dsrna segmented viruses initially isolated from the stools of children in the 1950s 1 2 reovirus is an acronym for respiratory enteric orphan virus 3 members of the reoviridae include rotavirus the most common cause of pediatric gastroenteritis 4 bluetongue virus an economically important arthropod-transmitted virus that causes disease in ruminants 5 and mammalian orthoreovirus reovirus which infects humans although disease is restricted to the very young 3 6 serological studies have shown that most humans are exposed to reovirus during childhood with 35 of children under a year old and approximately 60 of children aged 1119 years being seropositive for reovirus antibodies 7 despite the presence of reovirus-specific antibodies the majority of reovirus infections in humans are asymptomatic reovirus-associated symptoms include coryza pharyngitis cough and gastroenteritis 8 9 and virus infection has been associated with neonatal biliary atresia 10 reovirus is also associated with the development of celiac disease by promoting loss of tolerance to dietary antigens 11 reovirus studies in mice have enhanced our understanding of how the virus disseminates from primary sites of replication 12 13 14 15 16 illustrate the importance of the innate and adaptive immune responses in controlling infection 1720 and revealed the importance of the gut microbiota in reovirus infection of the gastrointestinal tract 21 the reovirus particle is 85 nm in diameter and is composed of two concentric capsid shells that contain 10 dsrna gene segments 22 23 reoviruses contain three large segments l1 l2 and l3 three medium segments m1 m2 and m3 and four small segments s1 s2 s3 and s4 that encode 11 viral proteins with the s1 gene segment encoding two viral proteins 3 three reovirus serotypes have been identified t1 t2 and t3 based on antibody-mediated neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition hai assays 3 four parental viruses isolated in the 1950s from human stool samples 2 type 1 lang t1l type 2 jones t2j type 3 abney t3a and type 3 dearing t3d are commonly used as parental strains a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for t1l and t3d reoviruses allows facile manipulation of their genome and has enabled studies to understand the contribution of specific viral components to reovirus biology 24 in neonatal murine animal models reovirus infection via oral or respiratory routes results in primary infection of the gut or lungs followed by dissemination to secondary sites of replication 3 16 the brain heart liver and spleen all support viral replication and are sites of secondary viral replication 3 12 16 dissemination from the intestine occurs via neural and hematogenous routes depending on the viral strain 13 16 following oral inoculation t1l spreads via hematogenous routes infects ependymal cells in the brain and causes nonlethal hydrocephalus 15 t3d spreads via hematogenous and neural routes infects neurons and causes lethal encephalitis 13 15 16 these serotype-dependent differences in tropism are linked to the s1 gene segment-encoded 1 protein 25 26 viral-induced disease is limited to neonatal mice reovirus replication in the brains of 710-day-old mice is limited and these mice have decreased mortality reovirus infection of adult mice results in poor viral replication at primary sites of infection little dissemination to secondary sites and little to no mortality 27 28 adult mice with an impaired type i interferon response or those lacking b and t cells are susceptible to reovirus-induced disease suggesting that these components of the immune system are important to limit reovirus-induced pathogenesis in adult animals 18 29 30 in this review the focus is on how host and viral molecules interact during virus cell entry and how modulation of these steps affects the outcome of reovirus infection the process of reovirus cell entry involves attachment to target cells via a strength-adhesion mechanism whereby the virus attaches to cells by low-affinity interactions with cell-surface carbohydrate followed by strong-affinity interactions with cell-surface proteinaceous receptors virions are then internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis uncoated by endosomal proteases resulting in the release of the transcriptionally active viral core into the cytoplasm where viral nucleic acid is delivered successful viral entry requires an intricate interplay of host and viral factors host innate and adaptive antiviral factors target specific steps in the cell entry process to inhibit infection fig 1
 reovirus attachment to cells occurs via interactions of the s1-encoded reovirus attachment fiber 1 to cell-surface carbohydrates 31 both t1 and t3 reoviruses bind sialic acid although they do so through different regions of the 1 protein 32 33 34 t1 reovirus agglutinates human and non-human primate erythrocytes whereas t3 reovirus agglutinates erythrocytes from various mammalian species 35 36 suggesting these serotypes engage different glycans glycan array screening revealed that t1 reovirus binds gm2 glycan whereas t3 reovirus binds various sialylated glycans 32 33 34 glycan binding by reovirus dictates viral tropism and spread in vivo t1 reovirus that is deficient in gm2 binding does not infect ependymal cells as efficiently and induces substantially less hydrocephalus in infected animals than wild-type reovirus 37 t3 reoviruses that are deficient on sialic acid binding are impaired in their ability to disseminate from the intestines to secondary sites of viral replication and replicate to lower titers in the spinal cord and brains of infected animals 38 39 monoclonal antibodies that neutralize t1 and t3 reovirus infection by binding sites on 1 also impair t1 and t3 hemagglutination of erythrocytes suggesting they impair t1 and t3 glycan binding 40 together these studies highlight the role of low affinity binding of cell-surface carbohydrates to reovirus infection and reovirus-mediated pathogenesis in small animal models following attachment to carbohydrate reovirus engages a proteinaceous receptor junctional adhesion molecule-a jam-a 41 jam-a is an immunoglobulin superfamily protein that localizes mainly to cellular tight junctions 42 all three reovirus serotypes bind jam-a through the head domain of attachment fiber 1 and reovirus structural protein 2 affects the efficiency of the interaction between the virion and jam-a through an unknown mechanism 41 4345 also some rotavirus strains also use jam-a and other tight junction proteins as co-receptors for cell entry 46 whereas engagement of cell-surface carbohydrates is of low affinity binding to jam-a is of high affinity 44 jam-a binding does not mediate viral internalization as deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of jam-a which includes a pdz-binding domain that promotes binding of jam-a to scaffolding proteins within tight junctions is dispensable for reovirus infection 4749 it is not known how reovirus gains access to jam-a in tight junctions as reovirus infection does not appear to disrupt tight junction integrity during infection of polarized cells 50 this is in contrast to group b coxsackieviruses which enter cells by attaching to decay-accelerating factor daf on the apical surface promoting the disruption of tight junctions that allows virus access to the tight junction-resident coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor car 51 it is possible that reovirus engages pools of jam-a not found in tight junctions or is transported to tight junctions without substantial disruption of cellular barrier integrity the role of jam-a in reovirus infection in vivo has been determined through pan jam-a and tissue-specific jam-a knockout mice 12 14 although jam-a is necessary for reovirus dissemination from the intestines and reovirus-induced disease reovirus infection of the gastrointestinal tract is unaltered in jam-a knockout animals 12 14 intracranial inoculation of jam-a knockout animals does not affect virus replication in the central nervous system cns 12 the role of jam-a in reovirus dissemination to secondary sites of infection was defined through the use of endothelial-specific and hematogenous-specific jam-a knockout mice 14 eliminating jam-a expression from endothelial cells impaired reovirus dissemination from the gut in contrast lack of expression of jam-a in hematopoietic cells did not alter reovirus dissemination these data suggest that jam-a is not required for infection of the gut or cns but essential for reovirus dissemination from the gut into the bloodstream through reovirus infection of jam-a-expressing endothelial cells during reovirus infection of the gut the virus binds and is taken up by microfold m cells 52 53 interestingly during respiratory infection reovirus also uses m cells to gain access to the lungs 54 the virus does not actively replicate in m cells but transits through these cells and infects m cell-adjacent enterocytes through the basolateral surface 52 53 reovirus antigen is also detected in the villus tips of infected animals 12 13 although it is unclear if this represents primary infection or sites of replication after the virus has trafficked through intestinal m cells moreover the presence of host bacterial microbiota positively influences reovirus infection of the gut 21 although there is no direct evidence to show if jam-a expression is necessary for reovirus infection of specific sites within the gut the lack of an impairment on reovirus replication within the gastrointestinal tract in jam-a knockout animals strongly suggests that infection of intestinal cells is jam-a independent the identity of the cellular receptor that promotes reovirus infection of the gut is unknown reovirus infection of the cns is jam-a independent 12 through genome-wide rnai screening nogo receptor 1 ngr1 a glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi-anchored protein that is expressed on the cell surface of neurons was shown to mediate infection of primary murine cortical neurons as well as hela cells and chinese hamster ovary cho cells 55 expression of ngr1 in trans enhances reovirus attachment to cells and ngr1-specific antibodies impair reovirus attachment and infectivity of cho cells reovirus infection of primary murine cortical neurons lacking ngr1 and infection in the presence of ngr1-specific antibodies is severely impaired suggesting that ngr1 is key for productive infection of neurons interestingly in vitro-generated infectious subvirion particles isvps that lack the 3 structural protein but contain the 1 attachment fiber are unable to infect ngr1-expressing cho cells these data indicate that ngr1 mediates reovirus infection of a subset of cells in the cns and that engagement of ngr1 by reovirus occurs either through the 3 structural protein or a specific conformation of the 1 attachment fiber found in virions ngr1 expression in the cns mirror sites that are susceptible to t3 reovirus infection including the thalamus middle and outer layers of the cerebral cortex the ca3 region of the hippocampus and cerebellar purkinje cells 12 56 whether ngr1 is essential for infection of the cns in vivo how it affects reovirus pathogenesis by t1 and t3 reoviruses and how it affects reovirus infection at other sites besides the cns remain to be determined following attachment to cell-surface carbohydrate jam-a and ngr1 reovirus is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis endocytosis in some cells is dependent on 1 integrin 48 57 although it is unclear if the virus directly or indirectly engages 1 integrin or if the virus utilizes signaling from 1 integrin to promote endocytosis the viral core protein 2 has conserved rgd and kge integrin-binding motifs that are solvent exposed in the virion 56 58 however it is not known if these motifs mediate direct interaction with 1 integrin or if they have another function during reovirus infection although the cytoplasmic tail of jam-a is dispensable for reovirus internalization 47 npxy motifs found in the cytoplasmic tail of 1 integrin are necessary for efficient infection and internalization 57 npxy motifs have been shown to mediate the association of 1 integrin with the actin cytoskeleton and regulate integrin signaling 59 several rotavirus strains use integrins to infect cells 60 suggesting a conserved mechanism exploited by the reoviridae the exact signaling events and molecules recruited to the site of viral entry triggered by the engagement of integrins by reovirus are not well defined reovirus endocytosis is primarily dependent on clathrin 57 61 however there is mounting evidence that other mechanisms are involved in the cellular uptake of the virus including dynamin-dependent and dynamin-independent mechanisms 57 62 following internalization the virus is transported through rab5-positive early endosomes to rab7- and rab9-positive late endosomes where cathepsin proteases perform acid-dependent proteolysis of the viral particle 6367 jam-a is observed in the same endosomal compartments as reovirus during cell entry 67 viral particles are also observed in slow and fast recycling compartments but impairment of these compartments does not diminish reovirus infectivity 67 it is unclear if virus present in recycling compartments is recycled to the cell surface where it may re-initiate cell entry or if this compartment is a non-productive cell entry route it is possible that virions that end up in the recycling compartment define a subset of viral particles that failed to induce the necessary molecules or signaling events needed for productive cell entry different reovirus particle types use distinct endocytic entry routes which affect the fate of the infected cell whereas virions must traverse through early and late endosomes to productively infect cells in vitro-generated isvps enter cells by engaging cell-surface carbohydrate and jam-a followed by receptor mediated endocytosis and transport to early but not late endosomes 41 62 66 68 during the natural course of infection isvps are generated during the endocytic transport of virions through the endosomal system by cathepsin cleavage of the viral particle presumably in late endosomes 64 69 as isvps have been proteolytically digested infection with extracellularly-produced isvps is able to bypass the need for cathepsin-mediated digestion of the virion to promote membrane penetration in vivo isvps are generated in the intestinal lumen by resident proteases and are thought to be the type of viral particle that enters m cells in the gut 70 in intestinal epithelial cells the alternate endocytic transport route taken by isvps yields a dampened innate immune response and induction of a pro-survival state through tgf- production 71 in contrast infection of intestinal epithelial cells with virions strongly activates the innate immune response and results in significant levels of cell death 71 these data indicate that the route of infection can greatly affect not only the fate of the incoming virion but also the ultimate outcome of infection it remains to be determined if isvps infect other cells beyond those in the gut during in vivo infection and whether pro-survival pathways are induced following reovirus infection of the intestines engagement of several host factors beyond cell-surface carbohydrate jam-a ngr1 and 1 integrin are important for efficient reovirus cell entry src kinase the prototype member of the src family of kinases is activated and colocalizes with reovirus virions during cell entry 72 infection in the presence of a src kinase inhibitor or infection of cells that are devoid of src kinase results in the aberrant transport of reovirus to lysosomes 72 the activation of src family kinases is also used by coxsackievirus b following engagement of daf 51 suggesting this is a conserved mechanism used by viruses to productively enter cells in the context of coxsackievirus infection fyn kinase activation promotes actin rearrangement that is needed for the transport of virions to tight junctions and subsequent internalization by caveolin-mediated endocytosis 51 in contrast to coxsackievirus src activity does not affect the overall internalization of reovirus how reovirus activates src and the downstream factors modified by src that promote reovirus infection are not known other molecules that modulate reovirus infection at the cell entry step include serotonin receptors 5-htr and the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 ifitm3 73 74 inducing 5-htr signaling with the agonist 5-nonyloxytrymptamine 5-nt impairs reovirus infection whereas antagonizing 5-htrs enhance infectivity 74 treatment of cells with 5-nt impairs reovirus infection by affecting cell entry kinetics through disruption of early endosome localization 74 the effect of 5-nt is not reovirus specific as infection with the alphavirus chikungunya virus and the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv both of which use early endosomes to enter cells was impaired by 5-nt 43 75 76 the interferon-inducible ifitm3 which localizes to late endosomes restricts infection of reovirus virions but not isvps 73 ifitm family of proteins has been shown to restrict infection of coronaviruses filoviruses and influenza virus at a step involving late endosomes 77 78 as such the late endosomal compartment appears to be a bottleneck where the host has evolved mechanisms to antagonize virus infection by a variety of viruses reovirus access to the late endosomal compartment results in the proteolytic disassembly of virions by cathepsins b l and s 63 65 79 80 cathepsin proteolysis is also used during ebola virus entry 81 82 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov utilizes cathepsins to process its glycoprotein prior to fusion with the cell membrane 83 84 cathepsin cleavage in late endosomes give rise to isvps which are characterized by the loss of the outer capsid protein 3 conformational changes in 1 and cleavage of the major capsid protein 1 3 although the low ph environment of the late endosome is essential for cathepsin activity 69 artificially lowering endosomal ph is detrimental to reovirus infection 85 these data suggest that reovirus disassembly kinetics are perfectly orchestrated to use both the lower ph environment of late endosomes and the proteolytic activity of cathepsins cleavage of the 1 protein releases an n-terminally myristoylated fragment that associates with cellular membranes and is capable of pore formation 86 87 the interaction of the 1 cleavage fragment with lipid membranes not only drives pore formation but also affects the disassembly of the viral particle 88 89 besides cathepsins the cellular chaperone hsp70 participates in reovirus cell entry by removing residual 1 fragments from virions 90 it is unclear if hsp70 activity also promotes the transport of the virion across the endosomal membrane the cell entry process culminates with endosomal membrane penetration by a transcriptionally active viral core that delivers viral transcripts in the cytoplasm of host cells 3 studies on reovirus cell entry have shown an intricate process used by the virus to attach to host cells trigger endocytic events that culminate with membrane penetration by the viral particle and release of viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm of cells it is revealing that a variety of viruses from reovirus to coronaviruses picornaviruses and filoviruses have evolved to use similar molecular mechanisms to gain entry into their host this highlights the importance of studies of host and pathogen interactions as they are likely to illuminate mechanisms used by several viruses and provide valuable insights for the development of antiviral therapeutics  the impact of covid-19 on share prices in the uk 1 rachel griffith peter levell rebekah stroud  the spread of  and international measures to contain it are having a major impact on economic activity in the uk in this paper we describe how this impact has varied across industries using data on share prices of firms listed on the london stock exchange and how well targeted government support for workers and companies is in light of this  in this paper we describe how the impact of covid-19 has varied across industries using data on share prices of firms listed on the london stock exchange and how well targeted government support for workers and companies is in light of this this follows ramelli and wagner 2020 who describe the impact on the us and china by looking at changes in share prices and gormsen and koijen 2020 who provide further analysis of the us shares prices convey important information on market expectations on firms current and future profitability buying a share or stock makes the purchaser a part-owner of a company shareholders get a vote in certain corporate decisions for example to select members of the company board and perhaps more importantly they are also paid a share of the companys profits dividends importantly the values shares are trading for in the stock market tells us not only about how well a company is doing today but also how well they are expected to do in the future this is because the price of a share reflects not only the dividends a company currently pays but also investors expectations of the dividends it will pay in future years if investors believe the dividends a company pays will go up they will be willing to pay more to get hold of its shares today and consequently its share price will rise if on the other hand investors are worried about the future profitability of a company its share price will fall changes in share prices in the present therefore reveal information about the future making them a useful source of information for understanding how a given event is expected to affect different companies and industries in the context of the rapid spread of covid-19 changes in share prices reflect market expectations about a number of effects including changes in final demand people are buying more of some items and less of other items changes in intermediate demand the firms that they sell to are changing what they want to buy and how much and restrictions in supply it may be difficult for some firms to obtain inputs they need due for example to interruptions to their supply chain stock market data is available much more rapidly than official data on for example unemployment or gdp growth indeed it is updated second by second as investors act on the latest information making a valuable and timely source of information it does have a few limitations however when it comes to measuring the impact of the crisis it does not include small firms firms which are not listed on the stock exchange the third sector or the public sector which might be affected quite differently for example many public sector services have seen an increase in demand during the crisis in addition many of these firms operate internationally so changes in their share prices will represent the effects not only on the uk economy but also in other markets that they operate in finally other factors may also have affected share prices over this period for example a price war between major oil producing countries led to a falls in international oil prices and the share prices of fossil fuel companies companies in late february and march figure 1 shows the percentage change in the price of the ftse all-share price index over the period from 2 january to 20 may the price index remained pretty steady in the early weeks of the crisis but saw a sharp decline in the weeks following the announcement of a lockdown in northern italy and fell to its lowest point in the week following the announcement of social distancing in the uk down 35 from the start of january as lockdowns have steadily been eased across the world and in the uk some of this decline has been reversed taking the overall decline in the ftse all-share index over the period to 21 figure 2 shows the change in the share price of all firms listed on the london stock exchange relative to the ftse all-share index between 2 january and 20 may 2020 the industries that have been hardest hit include tourism and leisure which includes air travel fossil fuels production and distribution insurance retailers excluding food and drug retailers and some large manufacturing industries at the other end of the spectrum some industries have outperformed the market including food and drug manufacturers and retailers utilities high tech manufacturing and tobacco unsurprisingly firms in medical and biotech research have also outperformed the market increasing by 6 compared to the overall decline of 21 the timing of changes in share prices reflects the timing of changes in market expectations figure 3 shows the cumulative change in share price over the period for the four sectors with the largest increase and the largest decrease in their relative share price over the period from 2 january to 23 march 2020 for most of these sectors changes in share prices did not take place steadily over the period instead big changes in share prices occurred from the end of february in the days following italys introduction of a lockdown in lombardy with very little change in prices in the period before the exceptions to this are the gas and water automotive and parts and fossil fuel production sectors where changes in share prices took place steadily over the three-month period possibly driven by other factors on 17 march the government announced a raft of measures aimed at protecting workers and businesses affected by measures taken to contain the spread of covid-19 these included a 12-month business rates holiday for firms in the retail leisure and hospitality industries and a coronavirus job retention scheme jrs that would pay 80 of employee wages for furloughed workers up to a maximum of 2500 per month for each employee this package is aimed at least in part at preventing otherwise viable businesses from shutting down the value of these measures will vary greatly across sectors labour intensive sectors in particular are likely to benefit more from the jrs than other industries in other sectors capital costs and purchases of inputs from other industries are more significant the benefit to firms in these industries will depend crucially on their ability to adjust their costs as they reduce output for instance airlines may use less fuel as more planes are grounded and flights cancelled but they may still face the costs of leasing and maintaining those planes the extent to which firms can quickly reduce their costs and then when the recovery starts quickly scale up again will depend on many factors such as what these costs are and what sort of supply relationships they have to get an idea of the potential benefit of the jrs scheme for different industries relative to how badly those industries are likely to be affected figure 4 plots the potential coverage rates of the jrs scheme against the cumulative relative share price declines for some of the key industries the horizontal axis shows the maximum extent of support the government has made available via jrs ie if every private sector employee working in that industry not only those in firms listed on the stock market was furloughed and all firms claimed the full 80 of labour costs up to the 2500 monthly limit we scale this by total output of firms in each industry the support will vary depending on how important labour is as a share of production compared to machines and intermediate inputs such as parts electricity etc and depending on the distribution of wages in each industry the vertical axis shows the size of the relative change in share prices from 2 january to 20 may 2020 as shown in figure 1  the size of each dot represents the number of people employed in that industry figure 4 shows that the support is more effectively targeted at some industries than others for example retail for which labour is a relatively high share of output has a comparatively high share of output covered by the jrs insurance airlines automotive and parts and building and materials on the other hand have relatively small shares covered by jrs tourism and leisure excluding air travel stands out in being one of the hardest hit industries in terms of seeing a large reduction in relative share price and having a relatively high share of protection through jrs as social distancing measures continue more capital-intensive firms that are not able to substantially reduce their costs may start to struggle more this may lead to pressure for further government support there are likely to be long-run costs to the economy if these firms were forced to shut down and the skills and experience of their workers were lost this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved 8 figure 4  potential coverage of coronavirus job retention scheme relative to output for different industries versus their share price changes relative to the ftse-all share index 2 january -20 may 2020 notes the vertical axis shows the size of the relative change in share prices from figure 1  the horizontal axis shows the potential coverage of the jrs scheme as a share of total industry output the size of each dot represents the number of people employed in each industry potential coverage of jrs is 80 wage costs in each industry up to a maximum of 2500 per worker per month to obtain the potential coverage of the scheme relative to output we multiply the potential coverage of each industrys wage bill by each industrys share of labour costs relative to total output labour shares are taken from the 2015 ons input-output tables the potential coverage of the jrs scheme is calculated using the 2018 quarterly labour force survey employment data are taken from the 2018 business resister of employment statistics jrs coverage for medical and biotech research and banking are taken from industries with sic codes beginning 64 and 72 respectively which are also included in the coverage rates for business services and financials respectively figure does not include data for alternative investment instruments engineering products household utilities metals mobile this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved 9 telecommunications or tobacco either because these sectors could not be mapped to industries in the inputoutput tables or because they had negligible employment shares we exclude healthcare and related services because the majority of employment in this industry is public sector  potential coverage of jrs for food and drug retailers is assumed to be the same as for retailers exc food and drug retailers  we have separated tourism and leisure excluding air travel and airlines for the purposes of the horizontal axis but the share price information is for these two activities combined  w o r k i n g p a p e r v

philipp darius leonie neuhuser ole teutloff  fabian braesemann fabian correspondence  braesemann github com  braesemann  corisk  while the coronavirus spreads around the world governments are attempting to reduce contagion rates at the expense of negative economic effects market expectations have plummeted foreshadowing the risk of a global economic crisis and mass unemployment governments provide huge financial aid programmes to mitigate the expected economic shocks to achieve higher effectiveness with cyclical and fiscal policy measures it is key to identify the industries that are most in need of support in this study we introduce a data-mining approach to measure the industryspecific risks related to covid-19 we examine company risk reports filed to the us securities and exchange commission sec this data set allows for a real-time analysis of risk assessments preliminary findings suggest that the companies awareness towards corona-related business risks is ahead of the overall stock market developments by weeks the risk reports differ substantially between industries both in magnitude and in nature based on natural language processing techniques we can identify corona-related risk topics and their perceived relevance for different industries our approach allows to distinguish the industries by their reported risk awareness towards covid-19 the preliminary findings are summarised an online index the corisk-index tracks the industry-specific risk assessments related to the crisis as it spreads through the economy the tracking tool could provide relevant empirical data to inform models on the immediate economic effects of the crisis such complementary empirical information could help policymakers to effectively target financial support and to mitigate the economic shocks of the current crisis  with covid-19 coronavirus reaching the level of a pandemic see fig 1a  governments and companies around the world are also exposed to the resulting risks for the highly interconnected global economy to slow down the spread of covid-19 governments in china europe the us and beyond are taking drastic measures such as travel warnings border and store closures regional lockdowns and curfews these measures are having drastic consequences for personal freedom and the economy some sectors such as airlines or hotels are facing a nearly complete breakdown of demand as a first reaction to the expected economic shocks the global stock markets have collapsed see fig 1b  in an attempt to mitigate the general economic downturn governments all over the world are providing considerable financial support the us government for example is preparing an aid package of 22 trillion in response to the virus 1  the german government plans to take up to 156 billion euros of additional debt equivalent to half of the federal budget for 2020 to support the economy 2  many of these immediate aid packages are not targeted to specific industries but are meant to support businesses in all parts of the economy while such general programmes can help to stabilise financial markets in the short term it is paramount for their long-term effectiveness to concentrate the support to those areas of the economy that are most in need for this reason governments have to identify the industries that are most severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic however in the current situation policy-makers lack reliable and up-to-date empirical data which would allow to assess industry-specific economic risks in real-time such information would be crucial to effectively target financial support as the crisis hits the economy and to mitigate the economic shocks the study presented here investigates a potential data source that could provide an empirical basis to identify industry-specific economic risks related to covid-19 and to inform models on the economic effects of the current crisi we examine company risk reports 10-k reports filed to the us securities and exchange commission sec and introduce a data-mining approach to measure firms risk assessments 1 in collecting all 1750 reports published from 30th january 2020 -the day the term coronavirus first appeared in a 10-k report -to 29th march we can assess and track the reported risk perceptions related to covid-19 for different industries preliminary findings suggest that the company risk reports show a forward-looking awareness of potential economic risks associated with the corona-crisis which is leading stock market developments by weeks moreover the awareness towards covid-19 differs substantially between industries for example while 48  of the firms in retail have mentioned the coronavirus as a potential economic risk only 22  of the businesses in financial services have done so thirdly based on natural language processing we can identify specific corona-related risk topics and their perceived relevance for the different industries lastly our approach allows us distinguish the industries by their reported risk awareness towards covid-19 while not all sectors of the economy mention severe short-term risk factors due to the corona-crisis the dense integration of business activities between all parts of the economy implies that adverse effects of the crisis could likely spread from currently affected industries to others over time the empirical information provided could help to inform macro-economic models on the effects of the corona-crisis and thus help to inform policy-makers to better target current economic support programmes to industries that report most severe risks at the current phase of the crisis the preliminary findings presented here are summarised in one compound index the corisk-index 2 tracks industry-1 sec filings represent financial statements of publicly listed companies including a risk assessment sec filings are imperative to comply with legal and insurance requirements and therefore should contain the most relevant risks as a result companies have a strong incentive to neither under-nor overestimate risks moreover analysing the most recent two-month period of sec filings represents a random sample of all companies since companies are obliged to report to the sec at a fixed but randomly assigned date independent of their industry 2 httpoxfordberlincorisk specific risk assessments related to covid-19 in real-time it is available on an interactive online dashboard this tool is constantly updated and the methodology will be refined it allows researchers policymakers and the public to estimate potential risk factors of covid-19 in individual sectors of the economy as the risk filings database is updated on a daily basis the online tool will allow tracking the potential impact of the crisis as it unfolds and spreads through the economy with more firms providing risk reports that describe the potential or real impacts of the crisis the tool will be refined to allow for a more granular perspective on individual industries and sub-sectors not all sectors of the economy are substantially affected in the early phase of the crisis but dense inter-connections between all parts of the economy imply that the adverse business effects might spread to other industries over time in this section we review related work on the economic consequences of covid-19 and studies on previous epidemics moreover we discuss the assessment of economic risks via reports such as the 10-k reports required by the u s securities and exchange commission sec global pandemics of infectious diseases are not a new phenomenon throughout the last century the world experienced several global and regional outbreaks most severely millions died during the spread of the spanish flu in 1918-1920 regarding the economic impact by sector gopinath 11 identifies manufacturing and the services sector as disproportionately affected in china based on the purchasing managers index ramelli and wagner 12 uses google search intensity to measure attention paid to covid-19 and stock market data to reveal the economic impact by sector their analysis shows that the energy retail and transportation sector experienced the largest losses in the united states and china whereas health care gained considerably in both countries the analysis by huang et al 13 also based on stock market data confirms that the services sectors seem to be the most severely affected in china in sum baldwin and mauro 10 provides valuable context insights and timely policy recommendations however none of the recent contributions provide an empirical database to analyse the economic risks of different industries based on up-to-date empirical evidence beyond highly aggregated stock market signals 3 at this point we want to highlight that it is not the aim of this study to present a model of risk forecasting that is competing with established macro-economic approaches in contrast the data-driven methodology presented here aims to explore an alternative data source that could help to inform such economic models the advantage of the data we provide here is the high time resolution more traditional sources of empirical information used to calibrate macro-economic model usually include for example unemployment rates while the value of such statistics is undisputed they are reported with a time-lag we perceive the purpose of the index provided here to be a complementary data source that could be compared with official statistics on the economic effects of the crisis over time while research on recent epidemics are limited to simulations 14 15  or specific sectors 16  the study of historical pandemics might provide informative empirical assessments of pandemic-related economic effects studies on the 1918 spanish flu confirm the primordial effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical such as for example social distancing interventions even if these come at the cost of economic slowdowns 17 18  moreover based on the historical data researchers find a correlation between mortality rates and declines in gdp consumption and returns on stocks 19 and an increase in poverty 20  however due to the global scope of the crisis for the highly inter-connected world economy of 2020 insights derived from past epidemics are of limited use in identifying the various industry-related risks during the covid-19 pandemic both the research on covid-19 and the historical pandemics rely on stock market information to quantify the economic effects of infectious diseases however stock market information comes with several drawbacks most importantly stock markets are prone to irrational herd behaviour and prices capture a variety of information signals into one aggregated index examining current stock market dynamics reveals a general economic downturn but it does not allow to isolate the sector-specific covid-19 risks therefore we propose to use sec reports which include risk statements we argue that these reports represent a promising real-time measure of industry-specific business risks furthermore the analysis of report statements discussing coronavirus allows to isolate the business risks exclusively associated with the covid-19 outbreak since the great recession hit the world economy in 2008 risk has been a crucial topic in governance and finance while risk assessments of the financial system led to diverse measures to make the world economy less vulnerable to economic shocks originating in the financial sector a health crisis such as the current pandemic poses different risks to the economy while government measures against the spread of the disease hinder the population from working and consuming which results in businesses interrupting production many economies face demand and supply shocks at the same time in particular as different industries rely on distinct input factor compositions and supply chains the sectors of the economy react differently to shocks 21  regarding the covid-19 crisis we expect sectors whose operations are more connected to supply from manufacturers in china to publicly report corona-related risk earlier than others these sectors are also highly connected and interdependent within the national economy and risk might spread between sectors 22 23  most risk assessment approaches focus on quantitative probability-based methods and financial data 24 25  the data published in such quantified risk assessments is often made available retrospectively which makes a real-time evaluation of risks difficult in contrast to such assessments we investigate the annual 10-k reports filed to the u s securities and exchange commission sec which provide verbal corporate risk disclosure and financial statements besides sec filings are imperative for legal and insurance requirements and they need to contain the most relevant risks to protect the company from legal liabilities depending on the volume of publicly traded stocks companies with a public float of over 700 million usd are obliged to report within 60 while smaller companies have 75 or 90 days after the end of the fiscal year furthermore the reports inform investment decisions and risk governance at the same time and thus companies as rational agents are likely to communicate moderate risk assessments 26  in fact prior work has underlined the forward-looking nature of the reports since they allowed a more effective prediction of volatility on stock market returns than the compared approaches 27  correspondingly we expect the 10-k reports to also provide forward-looking information on risk assessments during the observed time period and in particular on rising business risk in relation to the spread of covid-19 moreover the filing companies are categorised into sectors using the standard industry classifier which allows a real-time analysis of industry-specific risk developments in this study we apply natural language processing to extract corona-related risk information from the reports and analyse sector-specific differences in risk awareness and disclosure details in section 3 and in the appendix a based on the literature on the potential economic effects of pandemics and on the information available in business risks reports we derive the working hypothesis 4 of this study working hypothesis sec 10-k reports contain corona-related information which allow to track the industryspecific economic risk assessments in near real-time as the economic crisis unfolds this working hypothesis is split into five operationalised hypotheses a core assumption of the investigation of the risk reports is that they contain economic meaningful information accordingly the sentiment of the reports should reflect overall market conditions h 1 10-k risk reports contain economic relevant information on short-term market expectations i e they are correlated with overall stock market trends in the current crisis in contrast to stock indices which are essentially a highly aggregated signal of all market expectations risk reports provide a detailed outlook of individual risk factors and their potential influence on business outcomes 5 as some of the potential economic effects of the corona-crisis could be already foreseen when the disease was still largely concentrated in china in particular risks with respect to supply chain interruptions we hypothesise that industries are affected differently during the crisis depending on their business model as introduced in 28  the economic crisis will unfold in several phases with different characteristics those sectors of the economy that are more vulnerable to supply chain interruptions and short-term collapses of consumer demand should be more affected in the early phase of the crisis than other sectors corona-related risk factors in 10-k reports differ between industries 4 while the results provided in this working paper are largely descriptive we present the research hypotheses which have guided our data exploration 5 this should not imply that the firms have a correct risk forecasting model in place or that they actually use all available information to provide a best-possible risk prediction instead we assume that the firms report risks that they perceive as relevant at the time of reporting see also the methodological limitations section below a presumption of our approach is that firms try to honestly report relevant risks not that they actually predict them with more data becoming available over the next weeks in particular first statistics on the macro-economic effects such as unemployment rates we will incorporate predictive models to get a better understanding in how far the reported risk factors indeed correlate with advers effects experienced in the early phases of the crisis as the market expectations adjust all sectors suffer from restrictions to business activity which manifest in collapsing stock market prices however one would assume that those firms that show most severe corona-related risks in the early phase of the crisis will see most stock market losses h 4 stock prices of firms in industries that report high risks lose more value than other firms in the short term while the crisis unfolds adverse economic effects radiate through the highly inter-connected economic system as some sectors that are severely affected already in the early phase of the crisis face increasing challenges their problems transmit to other sectors in form of less demand reduced purchasing power or supply interruptions consequently we hypothesise that 6  h 5 as the crisis unfolds those sectors that are densely connected with industries that report high risks in the early phase of the crisis are likely to report increasing risks sooner than other industries to test the hypotheses we use web-mining techniques to collect data from sec 10-k reports and conduct text mining to extract information relevant for the individual hypotheses as outlined in the next section section 4 presents the results of the analysis the 10-k sec filings as legal reports to publicly communicate corporate risks and financial statements provide a valuable and innovative text data source for risk assessment 7 we use a web scraper to collect all 10-k filings published between 30012020 and 20032020 from the secs electronic data gathering analysis and retrieval system edgar database the filing documents contain the company names and central index keys cik as unique firm identifiers and the standard industry classifier sic that allow linking and comparing the filings data with individual business and industry data each 10-k filing contains a risk factor section item 1a under which the reporting company is obliged to disclose all types of risks their business might be facing to adequately warn investors companies are required to use plain english in describing these risk factors avoiding overly technical jargon that would be difficult for a layperson to follow the text of each risk factor section builds the document by which a company is represented in our analysis smaller reporting companies are hence not included in our analysis the entire risk factor text is set to lower case for further analysis before the occurrence of the main two keyword tokens corona and covid is counted any word containing one of the two main tokens is likewise counted hereby the measure corona-keyword count per report is created similarly each company that reports one of the keywords at least once is included in the share of corona-mentioning firms per industry  after text pre-processing we apply different natural language processing tools to analyse the risk factor section of the reports different sectors are facing different challenges therefore companies are reporting about different corona-related risks we aim to capture these risk topics via a keyword search on predefined topics in order to explore possible topics we use latent dirichlet allocation lda for unsupervised topic modelling similar to 29  we only apply the topic model to corona-related paragraphs in the risk sections we additionally examine the most frequent words 6 testing this hypothesis requires more time-series data and data on potential propagation mechanisms through the economy we plan to include an analysis on this in a revised of the working paper 7 the data source explored here is not meant to replace any established macro-economic statistics but rather to provide a complementary alternative source of data to identify immediate industry-specific risk perceptions and bi-grams in the documents using this exploratory analysis we define a set of topics by hand which are specified by keywords we then conduct a keyword search to count how much these terms are mentioned in the different industries in order to estimate the topic prevalence moreover we measure the sentiment of corona-related paragraphs via sentiment analysis additionally we build a sentiment-based risk indicator of the sentiment in sentences that mentioned the coronavirus and compare it to stock market movements during the observation period  fig 1b and 1d  a more detailed description of the different methods can be found in the appendix a the main results of our analysis are displayed in figure 1c and d as well as in figure 2  8 from the end of january 2020 an increasing number of 10-k reports refers to the coronavirus fig 1c  indicating an increasing awareness of covid-19 as a potential economic risk the overall sentiment of the 10-k reports decreased sharply red line in fig 1d  following the collapsed stock markets after 15th february red line in fig 1b  this timely correlation provides evidence in favour of research hypothesis h 1 -the 10-k reports provide economically relevant information moreover the sentiment of the text sections that discuss the corona-related business risk factors blue line in fig1d decreases already a few weeks before the overall negative business outlooks manifested in falling stock prices this observation supports hypothesis h 2 corona-related risk sentiments show a time lead compared with overall stock market dynamics from this comparison we conclude that the 10-k reports contain business relevant information that can be isolated -in contrast to the aggregated signal covered in stock indices alone investigating the reports can thus provide additional information about the firm-and sector-specific risks associated with the pandemic differences in corona-related risk assessment by industries are displayed in figure 2  not all sectors of the economy show a similar awareness of the potential business impacts of the pandemic  fig 2a  which provides evidence in favour the firms moreover differ substantially with regards to the intensity with which they discuss the potential impacts of the coronavirus to their businesses in the 10-k reports as fig 2b shows some firms in particular in retail and manufacturing mention terms related to the pandemic corona coronavirus covid substantially more often than other firms the 10-k reports moreover provide information about specific types of risk perceptions fig 2c provides a heatmap with important topics per sector the rows represent five relevant topics demand finance production supply and travel which have been derived from unsupervised topic modelling and subsequent uni-and bi-gram search 10 the cells of the heatmap are coloured according to the topic relevance i e the number of topic-specific keywords per industry additionally we have applied a hierarchical clustering algorithm on the data to identify related topics and sectors which report about similar topics tree-like dendrogram plots at the side of the heatmap 8 at this point we want to highlight again that the results reported here are preliminary with more data becoming available over the next weeks and hence with a refined methodology we expect to be able to report more in-depth analyses and conclusive findings these will be constantly updated on the online dashboard moreover we want to emphasise that all quantitative findings are build on data of u s firms it remains to be seen in how far the findings could be extrapolated to other economies 9 in some of the industries only very few firms have provided risk reports in the current observation period in particular in these groups the results are likely to change as more data become available 10 details of the text mining approach and the final keywords that define the topics are provided in the appendix the figure reveals that most firms either report demand and financial risk factors left branch of the top-dendrogram or production and supply chain risks middle branch of the top-dendrogram for example supply chain problems represent the biggest reproted risk component for firms in the retail industry while manufacturing firms report both supply and production risks as well as finance and potential demand risks while reports of the mining industry consider demand-related issues as the biggest risk factor other sectors such as real estate or education do not report extensively about any of the specific risk types these findings support hypothesis h 3 -corona-related risk factors reported in 10-k reports differ between industries with regard to occurrence and topical context the reports are thus a valid data source to identify sectors that face particular risk factors in the current early phase of the crisis based on the quantifiable corona-related risk factors inferred from the 10-k reports share of reports mentioning corona-risks per industry average count of corona-keywords per report sentiment of corona-related text sections we could categorise the industries into three risk groups details of the calculation of the risk ranking and the categorisation are provided in the appendix 11 the clustering of sectors into the groups is displayed in fig 2d  the lowest risk group 1 is dominated by infrastructure sectors such as construction and power supply but also includes financial services several intermediate risks group 2 are reported by different industries from the services sector for example admin services or information and communication the highest risk group 3 contains manufacturing retail education water supply and hospitality in contrast to hypothesis h 4 the different risk groups do not show substantial differences with regards to short-term stock losses while this observation is not aligned with our initial hypothesis it underlines that stock markets are less suited to differentiate industries by corona-related economic risk perceptions as the deteriorating overall market expectation dominate in the stock price signal other data sources like the 10-k reports investigated here provide a more granular perspective on covid-19 related perceived risks while a one-dimensional categorisation of risk assessments tends to over-simplify the crisis firms are facing it allows to compare the different industries and to identify those parts of the economy which currently report more or less severe effecs due to the immediate economic consequences of the pandemic the data-driven assessment reveals in particular that manufacturing and retail are among the industries that report to be most vulnerable to the changing economic environment not only decreasing consumer demand but particularly problems along the supply chain mark substantial risk factors for those industries on the other hand it is mostly firms from the information and communication services sector which are less dependent on the physical transport of goods that are currently reporting fewer risks moreover with only 4  of the 10-k reports mentioning the coronavirus as a potential risk factor the construction sector seems largely unaffected by the short term economic shocks the extent to which the industries are affected by corona-related business risks is likely to change over time accordingly the risk categorisation presented here is a static measure that needs constant updating and refinement as the crisis unfolds to do this the study is supplemented by an online dashboard which tracks the main findings 11 please note that the ordinal categorisation into different risk groups will be replaced by a continuous risk index for all industries as more reports are released over time the simplyfing categorisation of industries into risk groups would most likely need considerable adjustments over time as more reports will include corona-related risks with substantially lower values with more reports being released over time we will update and refine the corisk-index to allow for more fine-grained industry-specific analyses including breakdown by topics and sentiment the index starts with zero indicating no corona-related business risks in the reports we will track the corisk-index over the course of the corona crisis until the index reaches zero again as discussed in section 2 economies are characterised by dense flows of demand supply and capital between the industries accordingly we highlight this inter-connectedness in fig 3b  displaying the top-two cross-industry capital flows per sector within the u s economy based on 2015 the national input-output table provided by the oecd as the figure reveals specific parts of the economy are currently mentioning the most substantial risks in particular manufacturing retail and hospitality industries in the primary sector infrastructure and services are currently reporting fewer risks while the short term nature of the investigation presented here does not allow for industry-specific time-series investigations which would be necessary to provide final evidence in favour of hypothesis h 5 the dense interconnection between all parts of the economy indicates that it is only a matter of time until the risk factors from decreasing consumer demand and supply chain interruptions will transfer to the other parts of the economy 12 as the covid-19 pandemic unfolds governments are attempting to reduce contagion rates at the expense of personal freedom and negative economic effects sizeable cyclical and fiscal policy packages are prepared in order to counterbalance the dooming global economic downturn in order to ensure an effective usage of public crisis spending it is paramount to understand in detail which industries are most affected by the pandemic and currently most in need of support this study introduces a data-mining approach to measure the reported business risks induced by the current covid-19 pandemic we examine company risk reports filed to the us securities and exchange commission sec harnessing this data set enables a real-time analysis of potential risk factors preliminary findings show that the companies risk awareness is preempting stock market developments by weeks while stock prices typically condense the markets multiple signals the 10-k reports allow to isolates the company risk perceptions associated to the covid-19 outbreak moreover this risk awareness differs substantially between industries both in magnitude as well as in nature based on natural language processing techniques we can identify specific corona-related risk-topics and their relevance for the different industries supply chain-and production related issues seem to be mostly relevant for retail and manufacturing while several industries have reported demand-or finance related risk factors additionally our approach allows to cluster the industries into three groups of reported risk factors giving a better understanding of which industries are considering the most severe impacts at the current stage we summarise the corona-related business risk perceptions per industry in a compound index published online 13 the corisk-index which will be updated constantly over the course of the crisis provides an up-to-date database to identify the industries that report most substantial risk factors in the different phases of the unfolding economic crisis the online dashboard can provide a data source to inform economic models and to provide empirical information that could help to assess potential policies which aim to effectively target financial support and to mitigate the economic shocks of the current crisis 12 in the current version of the working paper fig 2e represents a simple visualisation of some relevant economic flows within the u s economy which imply likely propagation channels of adverse economic effects in a revised version we will include a more detaile network analysis to investigate potential risk propagation mechanisms 13 httpoxfordberlincorisk governments are eager to counterbalance the dooming global economic crisis induced by the covid-19 pandemic with cyclical and fiscal policy packages of enormous volumes democratic accountability demands this public crisis stimulus to be spend as effectively as possible our data-driven analysis of the 10-k sec filings provides an alternative data source which could be used to help identifying industries that are most severely affected by covid-19 in particular the industries in risk group 3 are currently reporting most severe effects from the sharply decreasing consumer demand and interruptions of the supply chain and might face substantial problems through the unfolding of the crisis 14 other parts of the economy in particular information-processing service industries and construction are currently reporting less severe corona-related risks however as the shock will transmit throughout the tightly inter-connected economy over time these industries are likely to face larger challenges at a later stage in time nonetheless at the current stage their core businesses seem to be less directly affected by supply chain interruptions and collapsing consumer demand than other industries our approach is based on the risk assessments in the u s securities and exchange commission sec filing reports thus the value of the approach relies crucially on company self-reporting while the firms are unlikely to provide a risk prediction with a high forecasting accuracy it might still be worth exploring the reports as alternative data source to measure risk perceptions as the reports serve as legal and insurance requirements against financial risks but also as a basis for investment decisions of investors companies are implicitly encouraged to neither over-nor understate the risks they are facing nevertheless our results are limited to this self-assessment as many of the implications of the corona crisis are still uncertain our approach thus reflects a way to approximate potential implications on current estimations of experts in the different sectors represented by the companies and does not include risks that are unforeseeable for themselves at a given point in time moreover the data to assess the precision of these estimations does not exist yet as there has not been a pandemic with comparable global economic consequences in recent time in the future we will evaluate our results by looking at employment data in different sectors moreover the pandemic continues to spread and will soon affect all industry sectors and all countries of the world as more and more companies will report on related risks the count of corona mentions alone will lose its information-value as a measure to differentiate between endangered industry sectors then more granular measures such as the identified topic categories will become more important to distinguish between different natures of risks the exploration of alternative data sources that are meant to complement or now-cast established economic statistics always comes with uncertainty for example it is not yet clear how the short-term risks described by the different industries will translate into long-term economic outcomes such as bankruptcies nonetheless we believe that the reports could be a reliable source of empirical information about the issues faced by different industries in the current situation and they might be used to inform forecasting models on industry-specific economic effects of the crisis as they help fill a data gap models that incorporate alternative data sources such as the one presented here could then be beneficial for developing economic support packages that are currently provided by governments all technical methods serve the higher purpose of providing timely and comprehensible insights into the industryspecific effects caused by the global outbreak of the coronavirus to mitigate susceptibility to errors and increase 14 at this point we want to emphasise again that the findings are preliminary and might change over time as more data becomes available and as the research methodology is refined moreover the risk categorisation presented in this study is not meant as a direct policy recommendation instead the tool is meant to provide an empirical source of information for real-time tracking of industry-specific risk perceptions which can help to inform policy makers in times of a fast-evolving economic crisis reproducibility we mostly draw from more basic technical methods this can be seen in the discovery of corona-relevant keywords which is based on the matching of regular expressions to avoid error-prone text pre-processing reduction of technical complexity however comes at the cost of diminished modelling fidelity and potential accuracy of results for instance the sentiment classifier has not been fine-tuned on text snippets discussing financial risks in particular further it may be questioned whether a generalist sentiment score yields a reliable measure for the assessment of risks additionally the lda-based topic modelling approach lacks in interpretability and robustness and we therefore only use it for exploration until now the topics and keywords we use for estimating topic prevalence are therefore hand-coded which limits the detection of topics to predefined terms in general the findings presented here should be considered as preliminary sensitivity checks are needed to validate their robustness and numerous extensions will help to better assess the potential value of the exploration of 10-k reports as a complementary data source to measure industry-specific risk factors we expect some of these limitations to be mitigated with more reports to be analysed in the near future adjusted results will be published on the online dashboard and in a refined version of the working paper the following impetus for future work builds directly on the identified methodological limitations and caveats mentioned throughout the paper rather than harnessing generalist sentiment analysis future efforts should explore risk classifiers trained on labelled financial risk assessments and entity sentiment analysis 30  the robustness of the results needs to be checked in more detail in particular we will compare historical stock market and unemployment data with risk measures extracted from 10-k reports to investigate the correlation between risk reports and overall economic trends this also holds for the natural language processing methods applied based on more data that is to be captured in the next weeks we will explore in how far different text mining methods lead to similar results with respect to the topics that can be extracted and what the effect of different keyword choices is on the results presented in the heatmap to investigate the potential propagation of risk factors through the economy we will include a network analysis based on input-output data to identify the most contagious areas of the economy another promising direction is the extension of the inter-sectoral u s-centred trade network to more comprehensive data on international inter-and intra-sectoral trade analysing inter-national cooperation networks 31  mining industry-specific key technologies 32 and drawing from more advanced network analysis techniques such as dynamicity 33 or sentiment-based network clustering 34 will be highly beneficial likewise the content of other online platforms such as wikipedia as a source for risk assessment could be explored 35 36  this could allow an estimation of operational risk channels and risk spillovers propagating between industries and countries due to global supply chains and peer-tier co-operations considering more financial data could include credit risks financial exposures of companies besides the comparison with additional financial signals we plan to include unemployment rates in our analysis as an exogenous variable to the sec risk assessment we are grateful for comments made by andrew stephen felix reed-tsochas felipe thomasz and slava jankin their comments have helped to substantially improve the working paper sentiment analysis on the sec filings serves the purpose of a more contextualised semantic understanding of the risk assessment concerning covid-19 we selected the paragraph of the risk report with the highest number of coronavirus mentions and calculated the sentiment based on the textblob api 39 using the code developed in 30  we use unsupervised learning techniques to identify the main topics that companies mention when describing coronavirus related risks latent dirichlet allocation lda is a bayesian computational linguistic technique that identifies the latent topics in a corpus of documents 40  this statistical model falls into the category of generative probabilistic modelling a generative process which defines a joint probability distribution over the observed random variable ie the words of the documents and the hidden random variables which is the topic structure in other words lda uses the probability of words that co-occur within documents to identify sets of topics and their associated words 29  the number of topics has to be defined in advance lda is a frequently used technique to identify main topics in a corpus nevertheless the interpretation of these topics can sometimes be difficult we thus perform lda for explorative purposes in our research only by additionally exploring the most common words and bi-grams we then define topics and the defining keywords by hand we then detect how often companies mention these keywords in the corona related risk sections to estimate how important the topics are in different sectors in particular we perform the following steps referring to section a3 we filter all sentences from the risk sections that mention either corona and covid thereby also accounting for coronavirus and covid-19 before we train the lda model we prepare the documents to achieve better performance of the method we remove all common english stopwords which are frequent words such as is  the  and and as well as those words which appear in at least 80 of the documents these words are not useful in classifying topics as they are too frequent and therefore decrease performance moreover we delete all words that do not occur in at least 2 documents we turn the documents into numerical feature vectors bag of words representation these vectors disregard word order and simply contain the number of times a word appears we then use lda to extract the topic structure like any unsupervised topic model this requires setting the number of topics a priori we selected this key parameter based on semantic coherence evaluating a range of 2 to 8 topics which leads to a final model of 4 topics the top 10 terms of each topic are displayed in table 2  the derived topics give a good insight into the general narratives of risks used in the documents nevertheless they are hard to interpret as the early corona-related risk reports are still quite generic such that most of the companies cover a lot of risk factors thus we make use of our insights from the topic modelling to define 5 main topics defined by keywords displayed in table 1  the choice of keywords is additionally informed by clustering the most frequently used words and bi-grams in the documents we then measure the frequency of these keywords per topic per industry in all of the documents to get more insights into the nature of risks different sectors are facing due to the pandemic production business operation business disruption product work stoppage labor disruption labor

antibody testing for covid-19 david jacofsky emilia jacofsky m marc jacofsky   an antibody also called an immunoglobulin is a protective protein produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance antigen such as a pathogen antibodies recognize and latch onto antigens in order to remove them from the body antibodies are proteins produced and secreted by b cells lymphocytes 17 because a principal function of b lymphocytes is antibody production it is important to understand the salient features of these defense molecules and describe their different isotypes or classes antibodies are glycosylated protein molecules present on the surface of b cells surface immunoglobulins serving as antigen receptors bcr or are secreted into the extracellular space where they can bind and neutralize their target antigens 17 a single antibody molecule consists of four protein chains two heavy h chains and two light l chains linked to each other by disulfide bonds the n-terminus regions of the heavy and light chains which collectively make up the antigen-binding site are where the variability between one antibody molecule and another resides hence determining specificity an important feature is that each antibody recognizes a specific antigen a phenomenon called antibody specificity for example an antibody that recognizes the mumps virus cannot recognize the measles virus and can only recognize one particular binding site on the mumps virus there will likely be multiple antibodies to multiple different binding sites on an antigen such as a virus for example some antibodies to covid-19 will target binding sites on proteins in the outer shell while some may target nucleic acid binding sites but each will be specific and unique only when two different but similar viruses have identical structures will cross-reactivity occur for example if multiple strains of a coronavirus have maintained regions of nucleic acid that have not undergone mutation an antibody that targets that region in one may target the identical region in another conversely an antibody that recognizes the measles virus generally cannot recognize the mumps virus five isotypes or classes of antibodies igm igd igg iga and ige exist and they are distinguished according to the c-terminus regions of the heavy chains which are constant and therefore do not participate in antigen binding instead these regions designated fc are important for the common effector functions of antibodies the means by which antibodies eliminate pathogens or alternatively cause tissue injury it should be noted that there are four subclasses or isotypes of igg antibodies igg1 igg2 igg3 and igg4 the distinction of which is beyond the scope of this discussion antibodies exert effector functions in three principal ways 17 antibodies are found in plasma and in extracellular fluid antibodies have three primary functions1antibodies are secreted into the blood and mucosa where they bind to and inactivate foreign substances such as pathogens and toxins neutralization antibody neutralization is important for protection from viruses as it can prevent the virus from then being able to enter and infect cells it is also important in binding to bacterial toxins and is the primary mechanism for protection conferred by successful vaccination2antibodies facilitate phagocytosis of foreign substances by phagocytic cells opsonization antibody binding for example will not prevent bacterial replication rather in this setting the mechanism of enhanced protection through opsonization will increase phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils3the third function is antibody activation of the complement system to destroy pathogens through lysis and enhanced chemotaxis
 after an infection the cells producing pathogen-specific antibodies multiply and increase proportionally as a result the body is protected from repeated infection this feature is called immunological memory one of the most significant features of the immune response is its ability to retain a memory of previous infections and this is also the principal behind the effectiveness of vaccinations this both protects individuals from reinfection and limits the spread of infection in a community immune memory can be very long-lasting immunological memory for the measles infection in adults decays so slowly it would take over 3000 years to decrease by half this therefore goes well beyond life-long protection for this particular antigen these robust durable changes are the reason that when we vaccinate the protection this produces delivers long-term benefits within an individual immune memory must be distributed throughout the body circulating antibodies travel in the blood reaching everywhere the circulation does including extracellular spaces and in secretions natural killer nk cells can remain on guard within tissues alert but not activated ready to attack rapidly if reinfection occurs nk cells are activated in response to macrophage-derived cytokines and they serve to contain viral infections while the adaptive immune response generates antigen-specific cytotoxic t cells that can clear the infection nk cells work to control viral infections by secreting interferon gamma and tnf while also stimulating nk cells nearby with such secretions and destroying physiologically challenged cells due to viral infection or malignancy through complex mechanisms outside the scope of this review finally some infections have such a profound impact on a species that the imprint of individual pathogens can be seen in the tree of evolution if an infection is lethal only individuals who have genes that encode effective resistance will survive to produce the next generation thereby driving herd immunity through natural selection rather than vaccination or infection modern methods of analyzing inheritance have demonstrated how the co-evolution of host and infection has shaped the make-up of the immune system and the receptors it uses for recognizing and fighting pathogens igg is the most abundant antibody isotype in the blood plasma accounting for 70 to 75 of human immunoglobulins antibodies igg binds antigen and drives the recognition of antigen-antibody complexes by leukocytes and macrophages igg is transferred to the fetus through the placenta and protects the infant until its own immune system is functional igg is largely responsible for long term immunity after infection or vaccination igm usually circulates in the blood accounting for about 10 of human immunoglobulins igm generally has a pentameric structure in which five basic y-shaped molecules are linked together b cells produce igm first in response to microbial infectionantigen invasion these are early phase immunoglobulins that will develop first during acute infection although igm has a lower affinity for antigens than igg it has higher avidity for antigens because of its pentameric structure igm by binding to the cell surface receptor also activates cell signaling pathways iga is abundant in serum nasal mucus saliva breast milk and intestinal fluid accounting for 10 to 15 of human immunoglobulins iga forms dimers ie two iga monomers joined together ige is present in minute amounts accounting for no more than 0001 of human immunoglobulins its primary role is to protect against parasites in regions where parasitic infection is rare ige is primarily involved in allergy igd accounts for less than 1 of human immunoglobulins igd may be involved in the induction of antibody production in b cells but its exact function remains unknown molecular test methods are considered the only reliable means of diagnosing an active case of covid-19 particularly early in the infection course and is the only means of determining if a patient is contagious to others by detecting the presence of viral genetic material in the nasal oral and respiratory tracts one can determine if a patient is actively shedding virus which can be spread to others these tests are perhaps of greatest utility early in the course of infection as they can confirm viral presence up to 2 days prior to the onset of symptoms given that antibodies may not be detectable until 6-7 days after symptom onset molecular tests can accelerate the diagnostic window by up to 9 days the duration of viral shedding can be highly variable and depend upon severity of symptoms length of illness and patient-specific immune response generally speaking viral shedding is undetectable 21 to 35 days after symptom onset or 3 to 5 days after a patient becomes asymptomatic at the end of the disease course viral load ultimately becomes undetectable and therefore a molecular test will not detect a prior infection even one that has recently resolved while point of care molecular tests for sars-cov-2 are becoming more widely available with faster result times all currently available tests require a laboratory analyzer platform which are generally in short supply and on back order for several months there remains a backlog of samples for molecular testing at many labs and public health officials have put in place strict guidelines requiring severe symptoms in order to qualify to receive a molecular test therefore there is a clear role for antibody testing as an important tool in the diagnostic toolbox for covid-19 antibody testing can provide important insight to individuals about their functional immunity to the ongoing pandemic giving piece of mind and assisting with decisions about return to community activities and the workplace these tests also provide valuable information to public health officials about the spread of virus in different communities especially in light of the high reported numbers of asymptomatic cases furthermore while never a primary diagnostic tool antibody status can be used to aid the clinical diagnosis of suspected non-critical cases that present 7 days or more after the start of symptoms in these cases the use of simple cost effective point of care antibody cassette systems can offload the pressure on molecular testing throughput to make those resources more immediately available to the acutely ill and critical patients with the rapid acceleration of the covid-19 pandemic there has been a rush to develop tests that can detect the presence of antibodies produced by the body in response to exposureinfection with the sars-cov-2 virus these testing methodologies rely on the antigen-antibody binding affinity described above the test principle relies on a recombinant antigen produced in the laboratory which is designed to mimic specific structures of the virus causing any antibodies present in whole blood or serum with a binding affinity to attach to the antigen the specificity of the test can be highly dependent upon the target antigen that is chosen as some viral structures can be highly conserved across broad families of virus and others can be highly derived and specific to a given strain therefore it is important to understand the cross reactivity to other viruses of the test being used so as to avoid misinterpretation of a false positive result that may be detecting an antigen from a similar virus yet not confer immunity to the sars-cov-2 virus these tests fall into two broad categories laboratory-based immunoassays which require a reader or analyzer to detect the reaction and cassette-based systems which can be read at the point of care through a change in color in an indicator region visible to the naked eye laboratory-based immunoassays have several technical advantages when compared to cassette-based systems because they are read by sensitive laboratory instrumentation and a controlled aliquot is delivered to the test system they can be considered quantitative or semi-quantitative tests therefore they can determine how much of a given antibody titer level is present per unit volume of serum and when operating at the margins of detection their sensitivity and specificity can be higher than cassette-based systems however these systems have real disadvantages infrastructure costs requirements for venous puncture additional steps in sample processing time to obtain results and practical through put challenges are problematic and substantially increase cost per test cassette-based systems rely on a color change that is visible to the human eye and is more appropriate for use at the point of care with almost immediate results available to healthcare workers and patients cassette systems use the principle of lateral flow immunoassay or immunochromatography the cassette contains a shallow well into which approximately 10 to 15ul eg two small drops from a finger prick of whole blood serum or plasma are placed along with a small quantity of buffer specific to the test kit the blood and buffer are absorbed into a porous test strip which is impregnated with recombinant viral antigens doped with an indicator eg colloidal gold latex particles europium or quantum dots antibodies from the serum bind to antigens in the test strip and are wicked laterally along the length of the test strip in the indicator regions of the test kit anti-human antibodies which are immobilized in the test strip will bind to the antigen-antibody complex and hold them in the indicator region the colloidal gold or other colorant accumulates in the indicator region leading to a visible change in color along a narrow band of the wicking substrate there may be one or more indicator regions with anti-human antibodies that are specific to igm igg or other immunoglobulins all tests should also contain a control indicator line to confirm that the test sample has appropriately wicked along the length of the assay and antigens in the test kit remain viable therefore confirming a valid test procedure figure 1
 this entire process from finger-stick to result occurs in less than 15 minutes these points of care test cassettes are intended to be read as a binary outcome presenceabsence for each antibody indicator region while the degree of color change may be an indicator of the quantity of antibody present in a sample variability between antibody concentrations in whole blood plasma and serum along with a buffer that is added in drops make it unreliable to attempt interpretation of color change intensity with most currently available technology kits that use fluorescent indicators can provide semiquantitative results with a hand-held or tabletop reader and appropriate sample preparation techniques but cannot be read by eye the advantages of lateral flow immunoassay kits are that they can be produced at low cost and in large quantities they can be used point of care with finger-stick whole blood samples require low human and facility resource utilization and can provide very rapid test results  while a patient remains on site this makes lateral flow immunoassay cassettes an ideal choice for population level sampling and workforce sampling for small and large employers as discussed further below since most test kits contain indicator lines for both igm and igg antibodies there are several different combinations and corresponding interpretations of results that may occur results themselves should always be interpreted in accordance with the package insert and instructions for use with the specific test kit being utilized but the following discussion is helpful in linking the binary results of the typical antibody test to clinical meaning and making informed recommendations for patients and the workforce as discussed earlier igm antibodies are produced in the short term after infection while igg are produced in a more delayed timescale the use of both is advantageous 18 19 20 in a recent study of 535 plasma samples taken from 173 patients with sars-cov-2 the median seroconversion time for total antibody ab igm and then igg were day-11 day-12 and day-14 separately the presence of antibodies was 40 among patients within 1-week since onset and rapidly increased to 1000 ab 943 igm and 798 igg 15 days after onset in contrast rna detectability decreased from 667 in samples collected before day-7 to 455 during day 15-39 combining rna and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for covid-19 p0001 even in early phase of 1-week since onset p0007 moreover a higher titer of ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification p0006 consistent with the understanding that more symptomatic patients are likely to have higher antibody responses and higher inflammatory markers on average using the sars coronavirus as an example igm antibodies generally rise above the detectable threshold for these point of care tests in approximately 5 to 7 days after the initial onset of symptoms assuming a patient does develop symptoms after infection the igm then remains above the detection threshold for 14 to 21 days from symptom onset about midway through the rise and fall of igm production around day 14 post-symptom onset igg will rise above detection levels igg production will generally continue to rise for 28 to 35 post symptom onset peaking around or after clinical recovery igg typically has a long half-life and will remain above detectable thresholds for months or even years after the resolution of infection the clinical level of functional immunity imparted by sars-cov-2 igg antibodies and their critical concentration cutoffs have not been determined for this virus therefore recommendations must be based on similar viruses and knowledge of the immune system ultimately this information will be available and quantitative tests will be valuable in determining immunity titers months and years after covid-19 infection or vaccination once vaccines exist based on experience with other viruses if reinfection does occur with the same pathogen one would expect symptom severity and duration to be greatly reduced due to the inherent memory of the immune system further the hyperimmune response that leads to ards and which is associated with the high mortality rate of this virus would expect to be mitigated by the presence of a prior immune response for the interpretation of results in an effort to make meaningful recommendations on community behavior to test recipients there are several factors that must be considered1is subject symptomatic or asymptomatic at the time of antibody testing2if symptomatic how long since symptom onset3igm positive or negative4igg positive or negative
 interpreting results when subject is asymptomatic at the time of testing 
both igm and igg are negative

figure 1
 left image subjects immune system has not produced any antibodies to the target viral antigen and is not suspected of having covid-19 it is not likely the subject has had the infection in the past and the subject is not immune to getting the infection in the future this result does not rule out that the subject was recently exposed to the virus and is not yet producing antibodies a subject that was recently exposed to the virus could spread the disease even if this test is negative and they are asymptomatic as long as the virus is spreading in the community the subject should continue to practice social distancing or current guidelines to protect themselves and those around them if the subject does develop symptoms they should seek medical care and repeat testing based on future potential exposure or symptoms 
igg is positive and igm is negative

figure 2

 the subjects immune system has produced longer acting antibodies to the target viral antigen subject likely had the infection several weeks ago even if no symptoms were present the subject has some degree of functional immunity to the virus depending upon the time that has passed since exposure it is unlikely that the subject is spreading virus a molecular test may be used to rule out viral shedding as discussed in greater detail in the next section 
igm is positive and igg is negative

figure 3
 this test result indicates that the immune system is actively producing antibodies to a recent infection the subject should immediately isolate from healthy individuals and seek further medical advice if symptoms develop this subject can likely spread disease to others even when asymptomatic subject may remain symptom free experience minor symptoms or worsening symptoms as the disease course progresses subject should be vigilant and seek care appropriate to the symptoms they experience after at least 14 to 21 days the subject should consider repeat testing to confirm their igg antibody status has become positive and they are outside the expected window to shed virus before returning to normal activities if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding status 
both igm and igg are positive

figure 4
 subjects immune system is actively producing antibodies to an ongoing infection that likely began more than 14 days ago subject should immediate isolate from healthy individuals and seek further medical advice if symptoms develop subject is likely experiencing an asymptomatic disease course but may still be able to spread the disease to others consider repeat testing in 7 to 14 days to confirm igg only status before returning to normal activities if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding status interpreting results when symptomatic at the time of testing 
both igm and igg are negative subjects immune system has not produced any antibodies to the target viral antigen if it has been greater than 7 days since onset of fever or other symptoms the disease is unlikely to be covid-19 but a full panel test including covid-19 influenza and bacterial bronchitis could be performed if available and recommended based on history and symptoms if it has been less than 7 days since the onset of symptoms covid-19 cannot be ruled out with antibody testing alone subject should isolate from others and could repeat antibody testing at least 7 days after the onset of symptoms unless a molecular test was available for confirmation if symptoms are severe and covid-19 is suspected based on clinical signs a molecular test is indicated for the detection of viral genetic material in respiratory samples subject should not return to normal activities until sars-cov-2 infection is ruled out through alternate diagnoses molecular testing or repeat antibody testing or appropriate time has elapsed after symptom development to rule out ongoing viral shedding shedding can occur up to approximately 31 days from exposure 
igg is positive and igm is negative subjects immune system has produced antibodies to the target viral antigen subject is likely in the later stages of the disease course but may still be contagious to others and capable of spreading the virus subject should remain isolated from disease negative population for at least 14 days to minimize the chance of spreading the virus if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding status 
igm is positive and igg is negative subjects immune system is actively producing antibodies to a recent infection with the target virus subject should immediately isolate from healthy individuals and seek medical care appropriate to the symptom severity they experience subject can spread the disease to others at this point in disease course after at least 14 to 21 days subject should consider repeat testing to determine igg status before returning to normal activities 
both igm and igg are positive subjects immune system is actively producing antibodies to an ongoing infection that likely began more than 14 days ago subject should immediately isolate from healthy individuals and seek further medical care appropriate to the symptom severity they experience subject can likely still spread the disease to others consider repeat testing in 7 to 14 days to confirm igg only status before returning to normal activities if more rapid return to community activities is warranted eg for critical industry workers a molecular test should be performed to assess viral shedding status as outlined above regardless of the testing methodology employed to detect antibodies these tests are not intended to be used a means to diagnose an active infection this is primarily because 1 there is a temporal lag between exposure to the virus and the development of antibodies by the immune system and 2 antibodies will persist long after the body has cleared an infection these tests are an excellent tool to be used in parallel with molecular testing patient history and clinical presentation in symptomatic patients or used in asymptomatic patients over a period of time to understand return to activity recommendations the temporal framework related to exposure onset of symptoms production of igm and igg symptom resolution and virus shedding throughout the course of disease have not been well quantified for sars-cov-2 specifically at this time most of the data and recommendations have been extrapolated from the studies done on the first sars outbreak in the early 21st century it is also important to understand that molecular testing is imperfect as well with up to 30 false negative rates in some series therefore when looking at the sensitivity and specificity of antibody testing one must be academic enough to recognize the inherent weaknesses of using such a test to evaluate another test it will be hard to know whether a positive antibody test in a patient with a negative molecular test means the former test is a false positive or the latter was a false negative physicians must truly diligence these products and be satisfied with the data as well as the track record of the company marketing it we expect a lot more information to be forthcoming in the peer-reviewed literature over the next 6 to 18 months which will improve the interpretation and utility of antibody tests a study in the wake of sars the similar coronavirus that triggered an epidemic in 2003 showed that survivors maintained neutralizing antibodies for two years on average with the number of antibodies declining thereafter other coronaviruses in circulation in the human species also lead to at least partial immunity for some period of time the immunity question has implications for whether covid-19 follows an annual cycle like seasonal influenza or becomes dormant for multiple years and then erupts again according to a recent publication in the journal science the authors noted that two other coronaviruses in circulation oc43 and hku1 which cause common colds result in about 45 weeks of immunity on average if the new virus follows that pattern it would probably create annual outbreaks they found 21 however generally speaking the sicker you become due to an infection and the robust immune system response to it the more robust the immunity provided therefore one might assume that those people who get the most ill have the longest and most effective immunity after a re-exposure to the same virus in a study by callow et al 22 people volunteered to have coronavirus 229e which also causes common cold symptoms inoculated up their nares ten became infected and eight developed cold symptoms one year later all but one of them returned to be re-infected again the majority were re-infected but those who had been ill before did not develop cold symptoms moreover the period during which the patients shed the virus and were potentially contagious was shorter the new virus sars-cov-2 is genetically similar to the first sars virus  hence the 2  but it affects people differently it is not as lethal as the original sars but is more easily spread ro is higher 23 many people who are infected do not develop symptoms at all and yet can potentially transmit the virus to others a very recent report from china that has not yet been peer-reviewed found a wide range of antibodies among people with mild cases of the virus most strikingly younger people had fewer antibodies in the wake of the disease  and 30 percent of those sampled had low levels some individuals had no trace of antibodies that has raised the question of whether a person with a mild or asymptomatic infection but confirmed by the sensitive pcr test might still be susceptible to a second infection the neutralizing antibody titers were positively correlated with plasma crp levels but negatively correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission indicating an association between degree of humoral response and cellular immune response however those with mild disease who do not develop high levels of antibodies may be at increased risk of re-infection but are not likely to get significant symptoms although the may be contagious therefore those without antibody production should likely be treated as if they never had the disease from a social distancing perspective even if they were proven to be positive with molecular testing longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to sars-cov-2 it will undoubtedly take time for this data to become available despite the hyperbolic media coverage regarding antibody testing initially positive and then a week later somewhat negative physicians must continue to do what we have always done we must accept that data especially early data is rarely complete or perfect and we must utilize the existing body of knowledge to make evidence-based decisions we believe that there exists a real value in antibody testing when performed properly with quality devices and a good understanding of how to interpret the clinical meaning of the results such testing can help educate decisions regarding social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment and can help risk stratify essential work force members as physicians we know that there is no perfect test and it behooves us all to make certain that we utilize as many data points as possible while trying to safely recover from both this pandemic and the possible secondary spikes in covid-19 incidence that may appear prior to widespread vaccination none of the authors have any conflicts to report  island geographies of separation and cohesion the coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the geopolitics of kalaallit nunaat greenland adam grydehj ilan kelman ping su   this paper considers the ways in which the coronavirus covid19 pandemic of 2020 is influencing the geopolitics of kalaallit nunaat in english greenland a highly autonomous subnational island jurisdiction snij of denmark we focus on how the pandemic has influenced both kalaallit nunaats relationship with the outside world and relations between people and places within the territory this sheds light on the geopolitical impacts of disease in island communities more generally the first case of covid19 in kalaallit nunaat was confirmed on 16 march 2020 at the time of writing 20 april 2020 kalaallit nunaat is the worlds only country or autonomous territory to have transitioned from confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus to no active cases this paper is a piece of research in realtime written on 313 april 2020 with minor revisions undertaken over the subsequent week and a half as events are still unfolding and policies are still developing in both kalaallit nunaat and denmark our research is thus a snapshot in time sacrificing the benefit of hindsight for the ability to describe and analyse transformative events while immersed in their provisionality next we discuss perceived links between islands geopolitics and infectious disease and then describe our methods we then provide an overview of kalaallit nunaats development from a colonised archipelago to an autonomous snij before describing the development of kalaallit nunaats discursive and policy approach to the covid19 pandemic we consider the geopolitical impacts of the pandemic before offering a short conclusion agnew 2003 p 5 defines geopolitics as an examination of the geographical assumptions designations and understandings that enter into the making of world politics islands are often regarded as geopolitical hotspots mountz 2015 ratter 2018 border islands

2020 all this plays a role in the manner in which islands and archipelagos have been envisioned claimed exploited and reclaimed within coloniality gmezbarris  joseph 2019 although the geopolitics of disease ingram 2009 are not exclusive to islands the fact that island geography is linked with particular patterns of centreperiphery power relations including colonial relations suggests that an island perspective on this topic may be worthwhile the association of islands with territorial boundedness and isolation has contributed to their use as convenient laboratories for studying disease eg mantle  pepys 1974 cliff  haggett 1980 however the effect of islandness on prevalence of disease is complex common methods of managing epidemics include quarantining suspected or confirmed cases and close contacts implementing information campaigns to provide the public with resources and advice on prevention and protection and restricting and controlling travel mccloskey  heymann 2020 wu  mcgoogan 2020 yang et al
2020 islands may be regarded as possessing geographical advantages in the execution of these methods due to their perceived isolation and their accompanying ability to control mobility and draw upon strong social capital baldacchino 2005 nevertheless the history of epidemics and pandemics suggests that as is true more generally even apparently isolated islands exist on a continuum of different degrees of isolation and connectedness baldacchino 2008 lewis 2009 grydehj  casagrande 2020 bridges tunnels causeways airports and highspeed ferries are increasingly connecting islands physically karampela et al

2012 the novel coronavirus causing covid19 was first identified in china at the end of 2019 and led to the 2020 pandemic on 13 january 2020 thailand reported the first case outside of china followed by the archipelagic country of japan on 16 january the disease has since spread to nearly all countries and territories around the world china has mainly approached the disease using traditional tactics such as isolation quarantine physical distancing of people community containment and travel restrictions these methods were introduced to china by dr wu liande regarded as the founder of chinas public health system to suppress the 1910 pneumonic plague outbreak in northeastern china ma  li 2016 for covid19 the chinese government initiated a strict lockdown of wuhan the city at the epicentre of the outbreak on 23 january 2020 suspending all internal and external transport for over two months a few days later hubei province as a whole was locked down and virtually all transportation was restricted and monitored at a national level these restrictions have proven effective at mitigating the spread of covid19 in china chinazzi et al
2020 macintyre 2020 with the main danger currently being reintroduction of the virus from other countries as covid19 spread worldwide many countries sought to balance epidemiological impact namely in mortality and economic losses the kalaallit nunaat governments approach to managing this highly contagious disease has been quite similar to chinas notwithstanding the tremendous differences between kalaallit nunaat and china in terms of geography population size culture and political system it is thus worth asking whether island status really does have any particular effect on the presence and prevalence of infectious disease while it could be argued that island isolation slows the arrival of coronavirus it would be premature to conclude that islands are generally safer from infection than nonislands what is more interesting for this paper is how island geopolitics affect and are affected by infectious disease the fact that we have undertaken this research and written this paper in the midst of events presents a number of challenges one challenge is that our literature search found no existing published scholarly research on the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on kalaallit nunaat a circumstance that highlights the novelty of the study but that also means we are building this research from scratch the only material available at the time of writing concerned impacts across countries including greenland eg crawford et al
2020 and nonpeer reviewed preprints eg chipperfield et al
2020 another challenge is that with the situation on the ground rapidly developing over the course of our research we are unable to obtain a perspective of distance or to do more than surmise at the pandemics longterm impacts in kalaallit nunaat as such this manuscript presents a snapshot of the situation in early april 2020 we must use the means of data collection available within the context of most countries being locked down by travel bans we thus rely here on a qualitative analysis of a combination of i unsystematically sampled newspaper articles ii a complete sample of articles present in the coronavirus theme section of the online version of sermitsiaq the largest kalaallit nunaat newspaper and a bilingual danishkalaallisut language publication between 27 january 2020 and 7 april 2020 n  363 iii social media posts on the online version of sermitsiaq and in individual and group facebook pages and iv personal written correspondence with seven kalaallit nunaat contacts of this papers first author from 16 april 2020 this correspondence was provided following the acquisition of informed written consent and all quoted correspondents declined an offer of anonymity the sample of individuals who engaged in written correspondence was not representative the sample included five residents of nuuk and two individuals living in copenhagen who together were six individuals of inuit ethnicity and one ethnic dane all seven respondents have university education ages varied from 28 to 56 and there were three women and four men because none of the authors speak or read the kalaallisut language we relied on information available in danish or english kalaallit nunaats second and third languages respectively among ethnic inuit knowledge of danish is associated with higher educational and socioeconomic status while knowledge of kalaallisut among ethnic danes is rare leading to differential opportunities for different social groups gad 2019 this results in a situation in which much official information media output and other material is produced in danish then translated into kalaallisut villadsen 2016 finally it is especially important to be aware of ones positionality  ones place within the system of coloniality  when researching colonised societies grydehj 2018 the authors are a multinational group of scholars the first author who grew up in the usa and now lives in copenhagen studies the intersection of culture politics and economy in island communities and has undertaken ethnographic research in nuuk the second author grew up in canada but lives in the uk after moving there from norway and is a disaster and health researcher focusing on islands and the polar regions the third author grew up in china and lives in guangzhou her research focus is the construction of community among ethnic minorities the first and second authors collaborate on research concerning conceptions of island sustainability and the first and third authors collaborate on research concerning islands and coloniality both these research collaborations have involved work concerning kalaallit nunaats relationship with denmark kalaallit nunaat is often called the worlds largest island 2166086 km2 but it is in fact an archipelago consisting of a large island ringed by numerous smaller islands this arctic territorys 56000 residents are spread throughout 74 coastal towns and settlements there are no road connections between towns and settlements which are instead linked by air aeroplane helicopter maritime ferry small boat with outboard motor and snowborne dogsled snowmobile transport some of which is seasonal and all of which is weather dependent scheduled international airplane flights connect various kalaallit nunaat towns with reykjavk iceland but the main overseas passenger transport lifeline is between copenhagen and kalaallit nunaats airport hub of kangerlussuaq population 500 from which flights run to smaller airports elsewhere in the territory many of which in turn connect by helicopter to other towns and settlements around 18000 people live in nuuk kalaallit nunaats capital largest town and centre of business and government kalaallit nunaat was settled by the ancestors of todays inuit who arrived in the northwest of the island from presentday nunavut around 800 years ago prior to the colonial period the inuit pursued a seminomadic subsistence hunting lifestyle danish colonialism began in 1721 with a religious mission led by the lutheran pastor hans egede this mission set the precedent for establishing permanent settlements in the form of colonial towns beginning a long process of colonially driven cultural change beukal et al
2010 rud 2017 sonne 2017 among the most immediately devastating impacts of this early colonial intervention was the introduction of disease in 17331734 smallpox brought over from copenhagen killed an estimated 10003000 inuit with the disease spreading rapidly as survivors fled from its epicentre in the areas surrounding nuuk klem 1966 bech 1999 gullv 2017 recurrent smallpox epidemics in later years were similarly catastrophic with an outbreak in the early 1780s nearly halving the population of nuuk and with an 1801 outbreak apparently reducing the populations of aasiaat by 42 per cent and of sisimiut by 89 per cent gad 1986 the earliest census of kalaallit nunaat undertaken in 1789 and including some estimates gave a total population of 5122 indicating that the epidemics of the early colonial period killed large proportions of the archipelagos inuit population the history of deadly diseases coming to kalaallit nunaat from denmark is thus at least as old as the history of colonialism in kalaallit nunaat kalaallit nunaat formally ceased to be a colony in 1953 when it was integrated into the danish state as a county a home rule system granting kalaallit nunaat considerable autonomy was introduced in 1979 in part due to denmarks increasing european integration with kalaallit nunaat ultimately leaving the european economic community predecessor to the european union in 1985 kalaallit nunaat today possesses complex relations with the european union of which it is classed as an overseas territory gad 2016 in 2009 kalaallit nunaat came under an even more empowering system of selfgovernment which significantly provided the snij with the right to become politically independent at the time of its own choosing opinion polls within kalaallit nunaat have consistently shown a substantial majority of respondents desiring eventual independence from denmark grydehj 2019 2019 kalaallit nunaat however remains strongly economically and institutionally dependent upon denmark grydehj 2020 2020 kalaallit nunaats colonial history and its aftermath have inevitably influenced the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on this territorys geopolitics public consciousness in kalaallit nunaat concerning the novel coronavirus emerged gradually and largely in reaction to developments in denmark highlighting the way in which many of kalaallit nunaats relations both material and intangible with the outside world are mediated through denmark early focus was also placed on developments in the faroe islands denmarks other highly autonomous snij which recorded relatively early confirmed cases of the virus in the first week of march 2020 and implemented an early strategy of widespread testing early concerns within kalaallit nunaat involved local fishery actors reliance on chinese labour for example the 60 chinese workers employed by polar seafood schultznielsen 2020a 2020 and reports spread through social media on 22 february concerning medical personnel in hazmat suits at the airport in nuuk sermitsiaqag 2020a as late as 3 march kalaallit nunaats epidemics commission which was coordinating with authorities in denmark was not recommending that the public take any exceptional measures kristiansen 2020a by 6 march the epidemics commission was recommending exceptional measures that closely followed danish policy such as advising against gatherings of over 1000 people kristiansen 2020b  an enormous number by kalaallit nunaat standards as it exceeds the populations of most settlements during this period kalaallit nunaat media reports concerning the novel coronavirus continued to be frequently accompanied by photographs of china andor chinese people as awareness of the situation in other countries and territories rose debate began among the kalaallit nunaat public regarding the appropriate response on 9 march it was feared that a plane from copenhagen had landed in kangerlussuaq carrying three infected individuals who had recently been in the faroes quarantine and selfisolation procedures were briefly introduced for some travellers but the subsequent covid19 tests came out negative sermitsiaqag 2020b some members of the public began arguing for the cancellation of all flights into the territory in order to prevent the virus from entering at this point scheduled flights were still running from copenhagen and reykjavik pele broberg 2020 a politician from partii naleraq used an open letter to the epidemics commission to propose a number of measures including use of kangerlussuaq as a checkpoint and quarantine site for people travelling into kalaallit nunaat on the evening of 11 march denmarks prime minister mette frederiksen announced that the country would be entering a state of lockdown from 13 march with the shutting of schools childcare and many private businesses and public institutions denmarks borders were closed to most international travellers from 14 march on 12 march the kalaallit nunaat government began recommending against all but essential travel as well as requesting that the public avoid hoarding and panic buying lindstrm 2020a the first case of covid19 in kalaallit nunaat a resident of nuuk was confirmed on 16 march the next day the government announced that all ordinary flights into out of and within kalaallit nunaat would be cancelled from 21 march and that people should furthermore avoid travelling between towns and settlements by boat dogsled or snowmobile lindstrm 2020b kindergartens and primary schools were also shut across kalaallit nunaat with exceptions for students whose parents were unable to care for them for example because they were performing vital work functions schultznielsen 2020b 2020 the government strategy was not simply to mitigate the impacts of the virus as was being pursued in denmark by this point but to prevent it from ever gaining a foothold in the territory to begin with leading to a focus on restriction of movement contact tracing and the locking down of nuuk in particular jrgensen 2020 on 6 april to the shock of many in kalaallit nunaat the danish government announced a planned gradual reopening of denmark from 15 april beginning with kindergartens and primary schools as a means of restarting the danish economy this was in some senses incompatible with the kalaallit nunaat strategy of eliminating the coronavirus from the snij entirely on 7 april the kalaallit nunaat government announced that kindergartens and schools outside of nuuk would begin reopening on 14 april but also that both internal and external travel restrictions would be extended until 1 may at the time of writing 22 april 1150 individuals have been tested for covid19 in various parts of kalaallit nunaat eleven infections have been confirmed all in nuuk and all 11 infected individuals have recovered over the past decades kalaallit nunaat has become progressively more integrated into global economic cultural and political systems these processes have challenged the idea that kalaallit nunaat is essentially isolated in the words of ulunnguaq markussen 2020 6 april personal correspondence a 28yearold student originally from uummannaq and now living in nuuk greenland always used to be far away from all the crises and now seems close to the rest of the world i think its the first time we truly feel that we are part of the world covid19 has highlighted both the fragility and the dangers of kalaallit nunaats global connections but it has also highlighted the strengths and opportunities connected to the territorys remote archipelagic geography on the one hand the disruptions to kalaallit nunaats everyday connections with denmark have set in relief the renewal and reinvention of these links from the establishment of new air links to copenhagen via reykjavik for the transportation of test samples to the sharing of resources and expertise for all the discussion of kalaallit nunaats potential to choose its own alliances with countries to both the east and the west grydehj 2016 covid19 has brought kalaallit nunaat and denmark emotionally closer together even as it has kept inuit and danes physically apart this matches the global shift from the initial instruction of social distancing to physical distancing for reducing coronavirus transmission on the important premise that people need to remain as social as possible without physical proximity this situation also resembles the aftermath of the tsunami that devastated parts of kalaallit nunaat on 18 june 2017 which resulted in an outpouring of both governmental and private support from denmark nordvang jensen 2017 ak bendtsen 2020 6 april personal correspondence a 40yearold working in tourism management originally from qaqortoq and now living in nuuk feels that the situation has had a positive effect on the relationship between kalaallit nunaat and denmark stating that she didnt realize how connected we are with denmark and how we help each other on the other hand the situation has also highlighted kalaallit nunaats capacity to stand by itself effectively designing and implementing policy in tense and rapidly developing situations kalaallit nunaats ability to survive and even thrive without its coloniser during germanys second world war occupation of denmark plays an important role in kalaallit nunaat national consciousness depending on how the situation develops the covid19 pandemic may come to play a similar role in kalaallit nunaat culture helping to clarify and rebalance what precisely kalaallit nunaat is capable of doing for itself what must come from denmark and what can come from elsewhere in the world as many of kalaallit nunaats key industries eg fishing tourism transport mining and hospitality face severe impediments or even total cessation of activities the government is stepping in to support both companies and individual employees with direct financial compensation munk veirum 2020 notwithstanding the reigning discourse of kalaallit nunaats economic dependence on denmark and its fundamental inability to act independently grydehj 2020 2020 the snij is acting very much like a great many sovereign states kalaallit nunaat has perhaps never seemed so independent as it does today these feelings of greater selfreliance may deepen further if denmarks 6 april shift toward an opening up policy comes to be seen not just as incompatible with but also as blatantly opposed to a kalaallit nunaat policy of virus eradication kalaallit nunaat is in some respects a product of colonial cartography an inuit territory boxed in with denmark and separated from its immediate neighbours in nunavut to the west it is only in the past century that kalaallit nunaat has been imagined as a collection of towns and settlements joined together into a national consciousness by a particularly legible island geography grydehj et al
2020 yet kalaallit nunaat is not simply an island territory it is specifically an archipelago with vast distances between towns and settlements that are not connected by road or rail on 17 march kalaallit nunaats prime minister kim kielsen explained the ban on internal flights within the territory by saying our country is unique in the sense that we are 74 isolated places which can each be shut down independently this allows us to keep the disease out of some towns and settlements lindstrm 2020b translation by first author the cultural economic and political gap between nuuk and kalaallit nunaats other towns and settlements has long been a matter of concern with many feeling that nuuk is an essentially danish town that has undue influence on the remainder of the territory grydehj 2014 conflicts between power centres and peripheries within archipelagos are not unique to kalaallit nunaat but are a common phenomenon favole  giordana 2018 at present nuuk  which as of 26 april is the site of all the snijs confirmed covid19 cases  finds itself in an unusual position subjected to a comprehensive lockdown while daily life in many other parts of kalaallit nunaat continues for many people along somewhat normal lines lars villadsen 2020 5 april personal correspondence translation by first author a 56yearold man originally from the small town of qasigiannguit and now living in nuuk writes thatin the rest of kalaallit nunaat restrictions are not nearly as strict as in nuuk  if were talking about use of public transport air greenland royal arctic line with its own passenger ship and the little regional shipping line disko line then transport has been halted for the time being  bearing in mind that there are not too many passengers anyway at this time of year the crisis is not so extreme relative to whats normal there are in any case few ordinary kalaallit who use these relatively expensive transport methods especially air greenlands and royal arctic lines prices where people have always been more or less tied to their locality people instead have tended to use small boats with outboard motors to get to the nearest settlement or town  there havent been big changes in product supply to and from towns settlements and regions
 two correspondents express that the situation has created a sense of distance and changing power relations between nuuk and the rest of kalaallit nunaat describing feelings of loneliness and powerlessness as well as concern about an inability to visit friends and family both elsewhere in the snij and overseas the travel restrictions between towns and settlements have caused a variety of problems for example with the small settlements in the vicinity of nuuk being totally cut off from their only nearby town and with some children living in settlements being cut off from their school when it reopened in midapril because the school is located in a different municipality than their home settlement kristiansen 2020c among the special measures in nuuk has been a total ban on alcohol sales introduced with no warning and immediate effect for the purpose of protecting children and families living under lockdown schultznielsen 2020c 2020 several correspondents identify unanticipated results of this ban on alcohol sales ranging from mockery by individuals in other towns and settlements where no such restrictions are in place to shifts in relative social status with people seeking to avoid social contact with ethnic danes who are regarded as more likely to be infected because they are most likely to have travelled overseas rather than ethnic inuit of lower socioeconomic status multiple correspondents also note the importance of digital media in general and social media in particular for connecting people across kalaallit nunaat and elsewhere in the arctic as indeed was the case long before the pandemic began lanteigne 2020 the longrunning facebook group politikkikkut oqalliffik  politisk diskussionsrum political discussion room which is predominantly in the kalaallisut language and has at present 12338 members is now dominated by posts concerning covid19 on 16 march the largely kalaallisut facebook group covid19mut illersorumallutik angerlarsimaannartut ikorfartoqatigiiffiat support group for those who stay home to protect themselves against covid19 which currently has 6969 members was established with the purpose of facilitating mutual assistance among people coping with the challenges of covid19 language has long been a point of social division in kalaallit nunaat due to kalaallisuts status as the most widely spoken language and danishs status as an elite language the snijs official language is the western dialect of kalaallisut there were complaints in the early days of the novel coronavirus spread in the snij that important information on the disease was being presented in danish alone in press conferences and on official websites thereby cutting off many members of society from timely and accurate information schultznielsen and kristiansen 2020 lindstrm 2020a infectious disease cannot be separated from geopolitics due to its inseparability from relations of space power and resources garrett 1994 ingram 2009 hierarchies of space and power are startlingly evident in a 2018 danish university encyclopaedia entry on hans egede which turns the leader of the early eighteenthcentury colonial mission to the true victim of the colonial processwhen the smallpox epidemic spread in 173334 egede truly witnessed his lifes work crumble hundreds of the newly christianised inuit greenlanders died misfortunes continued to rain down upon him in 1735 his wife gertrud died after a period of illness and exhaustion from the immense work involved in keeping the colony running while her husband was travelling her death was a great blow to hans egede who chose to send her body to denmark a year later the destructiveness of the epidemic and his wifes death pushed him into depression mlholm olesen 2018 translation by first author

2016 however globalised the world however integrated its economies and however mobile its people approaches to disease are still largely determined nationally regionally and locally the government of kalaallit nunaat may have found in the territorys archipelagic geography and small population a compelling argument for seeking to eradicate  not merely mitigate  the novel coronavirus such an argument proved impractical or insufficiently compelling for the government of denmark koch 2020 explained you dont want the virus to enter the country and you are in a position in greenland where you can actually shut down the country towns and settlements you cant do that efficiently in denmark policies that work in one society and one space may not work in another though the similarity of kalaallit nunaats strategy to that of china should caution against attempts to suggest any kind of geographical determinism yet the decisions made in different societies and spaces are mutually contingent pursuing mitigation in denmark may in the long term necessitate pursuing mitigation in kalaallit nunaat the same is true for more populous countries and territories that have pursued eradication strategies yet must adapt to a quite different policy approach internationally the covid19 pandemic has had complex effects on both kalaallit nunaats relationship with the world as a whole and its relationship with itself looking back at the snijs colonial history lars villadsen 2020 5 april personal correspondence translation by first author assertskalaallit nunaat was to a certain extent brought together by the introduction of home rule and selfgovernment but has since then always lacked someone or something around which to unite someone  because we dont regard for example the prime minister neither the current or the past andor the parliament as a gathering point for the population  as a result there are a lot of loyal adherents to kalaallit nunaat as a territorial unit simply because we have nothing else around which to unify the nation none of the political parties have sought to exploit the crisis to their own ends  so they say  i feel that kalaallit nunaat has never been more structurally dependent on denmark  but a lot of people wish that kalaallit nunaat could itself undertake testing of corona samples in nuuk instead of in copenhagen as the chief medical officer henrik l hansen puts it we are waiting to receive equipment  from the usa
 the imperial process by which the scattered peoples of todays kalaallit nunaat were gathered together into a colony then a county then a partly autonomous territory and now a highly autonomous territory has encouraged territorial understandings of nationhood understandings that are now under strain as kalaallit nunaat is pulled toward denmark and pulled apart from itself simultaneously three correspondents express the feeling that the coronavirus pandemic is serving to unite the nation into a collective to fight a common enemy in the form of covid19 it might be speculated whether kalaallit nunaats particular combination of islandness and colonial history has encouraged its decision to simultaneously distance itself from denmark and deepen its dependence on danish expertise in response to the pandemic however the fact that those remote island societies with geographies governmental systems and settlement patterns most closely resembling those of kalaallit nunaat also generally possess histories of colonisation complicates efforts to distinguish between the impacts of being a remote island and being a colonised remote island who can say whether for example the pacific island countries of federated states of micronesia kiribati marshall islands niue palau samoa solomon islands tokelau tonga tuvalu and vanuatu  all of which as of 21 april have instituted travel restrictions and report no confirmed covid19 cases  would be responding any differently to the pandemic were they not majority indigenous territories that were with the arguable exception of tonga subjected to european colonialism certainly remote island communities that were not subject to european colonialism of a similar nature eg australias norfolk island and the uk overseas territories in the south atlantic have implemented similar travel restrictions though such territories have populations and land areas much smaller than those of most of the colonised island states and autonomous territories meanwhile highly militarised or securitised territories struggle to exploit remote island geography in the same manner christmas island an australian external territory has become a covid19 quarantine site for australia similarly guam guhn a highly autonomous pacific island territory of the usa with its own history of changes in disease and healthcare due to colonisation hattori 2004 prasad  kurland 1997 could at least theoretically aspire to keep covid19 beyond its borders after taking quick efforts to contain the virus guhn has become a quarantine site for thousands of us military personnel from the uss theodore roosevelt an aircraft carrier that was stricken by large numbers of covid19 cases letman 2020 this has had knockon effects on other pacific island communities depending on flights from guhn such as the northern mariana islands another us territory as with many other policy areas there is always the potential for the geopolitical concerns of the metropole to override the interests of island societies remote island territories may be particularly likely to enjoy a degree of autonomy and independent decision making power but their interests may also be particularly easy for the metropole to overlook this highlights the manner in which the challenges and opportunities related to island geography often overlap the pacific island state of vanuatu has reported no cases of covid19 as of 21 april  although testing has not been widespread  yet on 5 april cyclone harold a category 5 storm passed over the archipelago causing extensive damage in both the capital of port vila and other islands  precisely at a time when vanuatu will struggle to receive support from or the attention of the international community mcgarry 2020 the situation is of course even more serious for island states and territories that like fiji have been hit by both the storm and the virus lyons 2020 similarly caribbean island states and territories are struggling with food insecurity and economic collapse due to the closure of borders and breaking of supply chains from the usa ewingchow 2020 island communities however small and remote they are or are assumed to be must innovate and adapt to global issues as they have always done kelman et al

2014  but also the sudden changes in economies such as almost no tourism and an expected drastic fall in remittances as the island diaspora lose their jobs the full implications of any changes to imports and exports such as trying to screen or disinfect for the virus are also not known all these challenges affect all locations the research questions for island studies epidemiology and disaster research include i whether different types of islands used or could have used any isolation or remoteness traits such as kalaallit nunaats limited international flights and cruises to counter the pandemic and ii whether island population characteristics make islanders more susceptible to the disease or mortality for it both questions have been investigated for islands for the 19181920 spanish flu pandemic eg mamelund 2011 mcleod et al
2008 and the 2009 ah1n1 influenza pandemic kool et al
2013 discussion of these questions cannot overlook geopolitical factors which may render particular islands more or less likely to restrict transport solicit external support come together in solidarity or possess the necessary machinery of governance to craft a localised response to pandemic as we have seen isolation is just one factor affecting how islands are exposed to and react to infectious disease geopolitics matter too kalaallit nunaat has so far triumphed over the 2020 pandemic more or less in isolation yet covid19 like kalaallit nunaat itself does not exist in isolation it is created through and perpetuated by relations among peoples places and institutions when kalaallit nunaat someday  probably sooner rather than later  resumes its air transport links with denmark reenters the shuddering world economy and resumes its place in the global flow of people and products the disease or a variant might reappear there is every chance that kalaallit nunaats success at eradicating covid19 will prove only temporary the coronavirus pandemic will nevertheless have changed kalaallit nunaats geopolitics the people of kalaallit nunaat will have a better idea of how much they owe to denmark how much they owe to themselves and what opportunities exist for future relations with other countries and territories they will also have a better idea of how nuuk and the snijs other towns and settlements relate to one another centres of power may be changing or shifting both externally and internally indeed it is increasingly being mooted both in kalaallit nunaat and abroad whether one result of the pandemic will be a longterm decrease in global connectivity the precise results of the present situation will only become clear in the future once the situation has further developed further research will be needed in the coming months and years research that can consider these issues in retrospect but as long as there is a community of kalaallit nunaat the archipelagos story will never be complete it will always be developing in relation  to appear in vaccine g schaefer owen clarence tam c julian savulescu chuan teck  voo teck chuan voo g schaefer o t voo c j savulescu   while a human challenge study holds the prospect of accelerating the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus sars-cov-2 it may be opposed due to risks of harm to participants and researchers given the increasing number of human deaths and severe disruption to lives worldwide we argue that a sars-cov-2 challenge study is ethically justifiable as its social value substantially outweighs the risks such a study should therefore be seriously considered as part of the global research response towards the covid-19 pandemic in this paper we contribute to the debate by addressing the misperception that a challenge study for the coronavirus would lower scientific and ethical standards for vaccine research and development and examine how it could be ethically conducted we also set out information that needs to be disclosed to prospective participants to obtain their consent key words covid-19 coronavirus pandemic human challenge study ethics vaccine as the world struggles to control the covid-19 pandemic some researchers have proposed a bold agenda using a challenge study to deliberately infect individuals in order to accelerate vaccine development 1 in the uk a challenge study is already underway using related coronaviruses that cause milder disease 2 a major limitation of this approach is that results using other coronaviruses might not directly apply to sars-cov-2 the coronavirus that causes covid-19 so should challenge studies specifically using sars-cov-2 be considered this prospect has been characterized as a loosening or lowering of research standards 3 however challenge studies that are well designed and implemented can be ethically sound and safe for participants 4 we believe that this option should at least be on the table although further analysis is needed to establish whether such a study is scientifically and ethically justifiable if as some characterise it efforts against covid-19 are akin to a war and likely a long-drawn one by the same analogy we should carefully consider what weapons can be used and how they should be deployed in an ethically acceptable manner here we examine how sars-cov-2 human challenge studies could be ethically conducted and some drawbacks and caveats challenge studies have aided development of treatments and vaccines for malaria influenza typhoid fever cholera and dengue 5 because these studies happen in a controlled environment it is easier for researchers to study natural disease progression than it would be in the field in traditional vaccine trials a high-risk population is usually studied but not everyone in that population is necessarily exposed and risk may not be evenly distributed peoples exposure to infection may vary and not everyone may be infected during the trial this means that large trials with substantial follow-up time to accumulate enough cases are needed to test vaccine efficacy a challenge study guarantees uniform exposure so can be done faster with fewer participants this approach could speed up vaccine development by eliminating ineffective candidates early on and accelerating field trials of the most promising vaccines the urgency of the current pandemic gives substantial weight to challenge studies as of 17 may 2020 more than 45 million covid-19 cases and more than 307000 deaths have been reported globally see world health organization covid-19 situation report those numbers will continue to rise and there is great uncertainty concerning how many more cases hospitalizations and deaths will eventually occur and how long the pandemic will last the pandemic is expected to trigger a prolonged global recession that will further negatively impact the health and well-being of individuals worldwide additionally candidate vaccines that have satisfied phase i safety and phase iia dosage trials could be administered to volunteers who are subsequently challenged with the virus as part of a phase iib trial to see how well the vaccine protects them as compared with a placebo or suitable alternative promising vaccines must eventually undergo large-scale testing in at-risk communities but the process of assessing candidate vaccines prior to large phase iii trials could be substantially accelerated by challenge studies 1 6 it is difficult if not impossible to give a precise estimate concerning how much time could be saved in vaccine development through a challenge study it is already very uncertain whether the uss goal of developing a vaccine within 18 months is feasible given numerous logistical difficulties and the fact that most candidate vaccines will fail 7 and challenge studies themselves will take some time to establish including production of a version of the virus that can be deployed in such a study but just as uncertainty about the feasibility of developing a vaccine within 18 months should not preclude extraordinary efforts already underway it is worthwhile to now begin the process of preparing for a sars-cov-2 challenge study like other vaccine efforts it is possible a challenge study would not result in an effective intervention nevertheless making a vaccine available even a few weeks sooner than otherwise possible via a challenge study would save many lives and relieve pressure on strained health systems and would have global social benefits by allowing countries and economies to resume normal activity that much earlier challenge studies pose substantial risks to participants and wider society as of this writing there is no proven effective treatment for covid-19 while the us and japan have given emergency use authorization for remdesivir with more countries likely to follow suit the underlying clinical evidence for its effectiveness remains limited and at present it does not demonstrate lowered mortality 8 some have argued that a challenge study is inappropriate for any potentially fatal disease that lacks effective treatment 9 one possibility is to begin preparing for challenge studies now and only recruit subjects once there is a proven effective treatment however such a hard-and-fast rule is insensitive to actual risk levels that may be acceptable even in the absence of treatment estimates of covid-19 mortality and serious complications vary with current symptomatic case fatality figures ranging from above 10 in france spain and italy to around 1 in singapore 10 case fatality figures may be over-estimates because they typically omit asymptomatic individuals who do not present for treatment more reflective of the risk of a challenge study would be the infected fatality ratio which includes asymptomatic infections for example a french model has extrapolated from surveillance data to estimate an infected fatality ratio of 7 in that population 11 and recent antibody testing suggests there may be even more asymptomatic infections than are confirmed due to limited testing 12 results from a serological study in residents of la county imply an infected fatality ratio in that population of about 07 13 in addition there is a clear age effect with substantially lower mortality in younger individuals in the french model individuals age 20-29 were estimated to have an infected fatality ratio of 007 11 which is roughly in line with the annual risk of dying in a traffic accident 14 a sars-cov-2 challenge study would therefore likely recruit younger individuals to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes results in this population may not generalize to older individuals and those with co-morbidities who would most benefit from effective vaccines nevertheless this approach could accelerate progression of promising candidate vaccines to phase iii trials in high-risk groups close monitoring for severe adverse reactions within the challenge study would also enable more rapid treatment this would help lower the risk of harm compared with community transmission where lack of detection of relevant symptoms could delay hospitalization careful participant selection and monitoring would minimize risks to the point where a challenge studys risks would be lower than other risky activity such as the risk of death for front-line healthcare workers during the pandemic 15 this suggests a covid-19 challenge studys risks would be ethically acceptable-if there is substantial prospect of great social benefit justification for human challenge studies would need to rigorously demonstrate that the relevant knowledge could not be generated in a similar timeframe using less risky approaches by way of comparison during the 2016 zika virus epidemic a challenge study was considered but ultimately rejected by a national institutes of health ethics panel due to concerns about participant safety third-party harms and social value 16 at the time it was believed that because the disease was widespread in certain regions a more traditional design of testing a vaccine in the community could achieve similar social value as a challenge study without posing as many risks to participants as well as third parties through for example male participants infecting female partners with the disease then transmitted to fetuses a similar argument about lack of necessity could be made against sars-cov-2 challenge studies however the global harm wrought by covid-19 in terms of effect on lives and livelihoods massively overshadows that of zika the risks then of a sars-cov-2 challenge study would be more easily outweighed by the social value of a challenge study that can substantially improve understanding of covid-19 and accelerate vaccine development the public benefit of this acceleration though will depend on the covid-19 pandemic situation in the coming months the slowing of transmission via social distancing measures andor development of effective treatments may lessen the urgency of accelerated vaccine development however if successful treatments are found a challenge studys risk profile will also substantially fall even if transmission is slowed absent herd immunity or an effective vaccine the possibility of a second wave remains in that case challenge studies would become potentially even more advantageous over field trials because limited community spread due to social distancing would mean fewer naturally occurring cases that could be used to demonstrate a vaccines efficacy this scenario would bear some resemblance to the present situation for zika now that infection rates have fallen dramatically notably this fall has spurred calls to revisit the prospect of a zika challenge study to improve the likelihood an effective vaccine will be in place should zika ever resurface in large numbers 17  challenge studies offer substantial monetary compensation the ongoing coronavirus study pays participants gbp3500 2 some ethical guidelines such as those from the council for international organizations of medical sciences hold that financial compensation should only be used to offset time and inconvenience in order to ensure people are not induced to participate against their better judgment 18 this position has come under considerable scrutiny on a variety of bases including scepticism that payment has a substantial distorting effect on judgment and concern that such a policy results in underpayment that is paying subjects less than what would be fair or acceptable 4 even if payment is made to compensate for risks undertaken this does not imply that compensation may be used to justify the risks and burdens imposed justification for a sars-cov-2 challenge study should depend solely on its prospective social benefits outweighing the risks even with appropriate participant selection criteria to minimize harms fair compensation and high-quality safety monitoring the physical risks of a challenge study are substantial how much risk should we allow individuals to undertake wartime analogies imply quite a lot if individuals can volunteer to risk their lives on the battlefield why not allow them to do so in the global fight against a key difference is the nature of potential negative externalities of a challenge study as sars-cov-2 is highly infectious risk of community spread from participants can be mitigated by isolation and infection control measures participants would maintain their right to withdraw from challenge studies but prevailing isolation and quarantine laws would apply to separate infected participants from the community even if they refused further observation and testing in the study even with such measures the possibility always exists of infecting research team members despite adequate personal protective equipment or of individuals being infectious for longer than previously believed but if research is key to pandemic response then researchers like healthcare workers should be allowed to bear the risks of conducting a challenge study as part of frontline work a further concern is that challenge studies could divert resources -medical personnel equipment and other infrastructure -away from treatment centres and public health efforts that sorely need them they should therefore be conducted in areas where healthcare systems are not overburdened and unlikely to become overburdened as the challenge study is undertaken ill participants might have rightful claim to prioritisation for critical care resources like ventilators or recently developed treatments that are in short supply analogous to the priority proposed for healthcare workers given their social contribution and the risks they undertake 20 such prioritisation which is based on the principle of reciprocity might come at the cost of non-participants with consequent negative health effects to ensure fairer allocation and maximization of the medical utility of scarce resources all patients needing critical care could be assessed equally based on short-and long-term survival prospects with priority given to research participants only if they have equivalent prognoses and some prospect of benefit however any such prioritization would be subject to prevailing critical care triage or treatment policies in the relevant setting due to the substantial risks involved special care should be taken concerning the information conveyed during the informed consent process and participants assessed to ensure they truly understand what they are undertaking 4 box 1 details essential information for potential participants to understand the content of this list reflects generally accepted informational components of informed consent relating to benefits risks procedures and other consequences of enrolling in the challenge study this is not an exhaustive list and omits elements of informed consent like information on marketability of resultant products or data confidentiality policies that while important do not raise particularly unique issues for a sars-cov-2 challenge study a difficulty with obtaining adequately informed consent is that much information about covid-19 including actual mortality risk and infectiousness after recovery is still highly uncertain and models have been rapidly adjusting since the early days of the pandemic uncertainty however does not preclude adequate informed consent phase i safety trials for instance by definition have an uncertain risk profile advances in community testing and subsequent modelling of covid-19 will help reduce this uncertainty and improve upon the informed consent process for a potential challenge study but as long as the probable range of risks is acceptable as argued above uncertainty does not preclude the provision of adequate informed consent  the stakes of a sars-cov-2 challenge study are high due to the risks of harm to participants there may be devastating repercussions for all other human challenge studies if one or more volunteer participants were to experience significant adverse outcomes or even death from intentional exposure to covid-19 a sars-cov-2 challenge study should not just be welldesigned with appropriate safeguards to minimize risk but its inherent risks and its justification -seeking to more quickly reduce the human toll of the pandemic as a global good -should be communicated to the public to minimize potential fallouts we have argued that challenge studies could be ethically conducted without lowering of scientific and ethical standards-they merit serious consideration as the human toll of the covid-19 pandemic continues to grow funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors the authors have no competing interests to declare  4 what is a medical theory paul thagard   modern medicine has produced many successful theories concerning the causes of diseases for example we know that tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis and that scurvy is caused by a deficiency of vitamin c this chapter discusses the nature of medical theories from the perspective of the philosophy history and psychology of science i will review prominent philosophical accounts of what constitutes a scientific theory and develop a new account of medical theories as representations of mechanisms that explain disease an account of the nature of medical theories should illuminate many aspects of the development and application of medical knowledge most importantly it should contribute to understanding of medical explanation both at the general level of causes of diseases and at the individual level of diagnosis of particular cases of a disease medical researchers seek to explain the causes of diseases such as tuberculosis while physicians seek to identify diseases that explain symptoms such as fever a medical theory such as the bacterial theory of tuberculosis provides good explanations at both the general and individual levels the primary aim of this chapter is to show how these explanations work a secondary aim is to show how an account of medical theories can shed light on other aspects of medical research and practice including the nature of medical discovery the process of evaluation of competing medical theories and the ways in which effective treatments of disease depend on the development of good mechanistic theories about diseases 48 p thagard before examining various accounts of what theories are it is useful to review some important examples of medical theories until the advent of modern scientific medicine in the middle of the nineteenth century the worlds predominant medical theories attributed diseases to various kinds of bodily imbalances in europe the humoral theory of disease originated with hippocrates around 400 bc it held that diseases arise because of imbalances in the bodys four humors blood phlegm yellow bile and black bile treatment consisted of attempts to restore the proper balance by ridding the body of excessive quantities of blood bile or phlegm by techniques such as bloodletting and purgatives humoral medicine is no longer practiced unlike traditional chinese medicine which is also based on a theory that diseases are caused by imbalances according to chinese medicine which is even older than the hippocratic theory everything in the universe including the human body is governed by principles of yin and yang diseases arise when the body has an improper balance of these principles and they can be treated by herbs and other techniques that restore the proper balance thagard and zhu 2003 describe the conceptual structure and explanation patterns of traditional chinese medicine traditional indian medicine is similarly ancient and also explains diseases as arising from imbalances lad 2003 describes the doctrine of ayurveda as follows according to ayurveda health is a state of balance between the body mind and consciousness within the body ayurveda recognises the three doshas or bodily humors vata pitta and kapha seven dhatus or tissues plasma blood muscle fat bone nerve and reproductive three malas or wastes feces urine and sweat and agni the energy of metabolism disease is a condition of disharmony in any of these factors the root cause of imbalance or disease is an aggravation of dosha vata-pitta-kapha caused by a wide variety of internal and external factors thus ancient theories of medicine all attributed diseases to imbalances modern scientific medicine emerged in the 1860s and 1870s when louis pasteur and others originated the germ theory of disease according to which contagious diseases such as cholera are caused by microorganisms like bacteria the germ theory is really a class of theories applying to many specific diseases each of which is associated with a specific infectious agent these include the bacterium that causes cholera the virus that causes 49 aids the protozoan that cause malaria the fungus that causes atheletes foot and the prions that cause spongiform encephalopathies eg mad cow disease the twentieth century saw development of additional classes of medical theories nutritional diseases such as scurvy and beriberi are explained by deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamins autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus are explained by the immune system becoming overactive and attacking bodily tissues genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis are explained by mutated genes that cause defects in the physiological functioning other maladies such as heart disease and cancer are often caused by combinations of genetic and environmental factors see thagard 1999 for a review of the explanation patterns associated with these classes of disease all these medical explanations are consistent with the following first attempt to provide an account of the nature of medical theories analysis 1 a medical theory is a hypothesis about the cause or causes of a particular disease this account does not go very far however because it says nothing about the nature of hypotheses and the causal explanations intended to link diseases with causes in search of a deeper account i will now examine the major philosophical views of the nature of scientific theories here are the most influential accounts of the nature of theories that philosophers have so far proposed 9 syntactic a theory is a collection of universal generalisations in a formal language 9 model-theoretic a theory is a set-theoretic structure 9 paradigm a theory is a world view based on exemplars 9 third-world a theory is an abstract entity in an autonomous nonphysical non-mental world 9 cognitive a theory is a mental representation of mechanisms i will explain each of these accounts and assess them with respect to how well they apply to the history of medicine and with respect to how much they shed light on the nature of explanation evaluation discovery and treatment in the 1950s and 1960s the syntactic view was the accepted one in the philosophy of science see for example nagel 1961 hempel 1965 suppe 1977  the logical positivists thought that theories could be represented 50 p thagard by universal generalisations in a formal language such as predicate calculus for example we might formalise the plasmidium theory of malaria by an expression such as xpx -- mx and xmx -- px which say that anyone infected by this parasite gets malaria and that anyone with malaria has been infected by the parasite there are many problems with this syntactic account that i can mention only briefly first relationship between causes and diseases are rarely universal because there are usually many interacting factors involved some of them unknown in contagious diseases there are usually many more people infected by the relevant microorganism than those that come down with the disease second universal generalisations are inadequate to characterise causality because they cannot distinguish between cases where a generalisation is true accidentally and ones where it derives from underlying causal structure third the syntactic view of theories assumes that explanation is a matter of logical deduction from universal generalisations but it is rare outside physics for scientists to be able to generate deductive explanations in medicine there is rarely a tight deductive relationship between hypotheses about causes and the diseases they explain finally the syntactic account of theories has nothing to say about how medical hypotheses can be discovered or about how they can be used to suggest treatments of disease the model-theoretic sometimes called the semantic account of theories was devised to overcome the excessively linguistic nature of the syntactic account see suppe 1977  a model in the relevant sense is a structure consisting of a set of objects that provides an interpretation for sentences in a formal language on this account what matters about a theory is not its particular linguistic expression but rather its specification of a set of models that are intended to include the world the model-theoretic account is difficult to apply to medical theories because they are rarely susceptible to formalisation moreover this account has nothing to say about the nature of explanation causality discovery and treatment hence it is clear that we need a richer conception of medical theories in 1962 thomas kuhn published the structure of scientific revolutions which introduced the term paradigm into the philosophy and history of science should we consider a medical theory as a paradigm kuhns use of the term was notoriously vague but he eventually identified two key senses as a world view and as a set of exemplars which are standard examples of problem solutions kuhn 1977  neither of these senses applies well to medical theories even the most general medical theory the germ theory of disease does not constitute a world view and it is not evident what in medical science constitutes an exemplar kuhn had some important insights about scientific theories as a part of conceptual systems and about the magnitude of conceptual change in the development of knowledge but these can be pursued more fruitfully within the cognitive account of theories discussed in the next section karl poppers 1959 early work in the philosophy of science was similar to the logical positivists view of theories as syntactic structures but he later proposed that theories are part of a third world of intelligibles distinct from the first world of physical objects and the second world of mental states the third world is the world of possible objects of thought the world of theories in themselves and their logical relations of arguments in themselves of problem situations in themselves popper 1972 p 154  i fail to see however what is gained by postulating this mysterious additional world in accord with contemporary cognitive science i would deny even the division between poppers first and second worlds mental states are physical states of the brain moreover poppers treatment of theories as abstract entities in an autonomous world sheds no light on questions of evaluation causality and discovery and we have already seen reasons to doubt the deductive view of explanation that popper assumes hence i will now turn to what i think is a more plausible view of medical theories cognitive science is the interdisciplinary investigation of mind and intelligence embracing the fields of psychology neuroscience linguistics philosophy and artificial intelligence since its origins in the 1950s the central hypothesis of cognitive science has been that thinking is a kind of computational process in which algorithmic procedures operate on mental representations a mental representation is a structure in the mindbrain that stands for something this hypothesis has been fertile in generating explanations of many aspects of thinking such as problem solving learning and language use from the perspective of cognitive science it is natural to think of a scientific theory as a complex of mental representations including concepts rules and visual images see thagard 1988 thagard  1992 thagard  1999 and giere 1988 1999  moreover the main processes involving scientific theories including discovery explanation and evaluation can be understood computationally discovery is an algorithmic process of building new representations and medical explanation is a process of connecting a representation of a disease with a representation of a relevant cause evaluation of competing theories is a computational process that determines which is the best explanation of all the evidence the cognitive perspective suggests the following answer to the question of what is a medical theory analysis 2 a medical theory is a mental representation of the cause or causes of a disease this analysis is still very general however because it neither specifies the kinds of mental representations that are involved in the explanation of diseases nor does it detail the particular kinds of mental procedures that produce discovery explanation and evaluation to show how the cognitive conception can give a rich account of medical theories i will work through a case history of a novel disease sars severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was first reported in china in february 2003 and quickly spread to other countries cdc 2004  more than 8000 people became sick with sars of whom more than 900 died the symptoms of sars include high fever headache discomfort body aches dry cough and the development of pneumonia sars is spread by close contact involving respiratory droplets the cause of sars was identified with remarkable speed in march 2003 a novel coronavirus now called sars-cov was discovered in patients with cases of sars by april there was strong evidence that this virus caused the disease ksiazek et al 2003  moreover by may investigators had sequenced the complete genome of sars-cov showing that it is not closely related to previously characterised coronaviruses rota et al 2003  thus in a matter of months medical researchers managed to discover the plausible cause of the new disease the medical theory here is sars is caused by the virus sars-cov let us now look at this theory as a kind of mental representation first what is the mental form of the concept of sars the traditional view of concepts is that they are defined by necessary and sufficient conditions so that we would have a definition of the form person p has sars if and only if p has the symptoms x y and z there is abundant psychological evidence however that the traditional view does not adequately characterise mental concepts murphy 2002  a prominent alternative theory of concepts is that they consist of prototypes that describe typical rather than universal features of the objects that fall under a concept accordingly we should think of a disease concept as involving the specification of a set of typical features involving symptoms as well as the usual course of the disease here is an approximate prototype for sars in the form of a structure that artificial intelligence researchers frame such as winston 1993 call a a kind of infectious disease typical symptoms high fever dry cough lung infection typical course fever then cough then pneumonia typical treatment antiviral drugs isolation cause sars-cov this structure is flexible enough to allow the existence of sars patients whose symptoms and disease development are not typical how are symptoms mentally represented in some cases a purely verbal representation is adequate for example temperature greater than 38 degree celsius but there is enough evidence that human minds also operate with visual auditory and other kinds of representations a physicians representation of dry cough for example may be an auditory and visual prototype based on extensive clinical experience with many patients with dry and wet coughs similarly part of the mental representation of pneumonia may be based on visual images of x-rays that show what pneumonia typically looks like even more obviously visual is the representation of the cause of sars the virus sars-cov pictures and diagrams of this virus and its relatives are available on the web at such sites as 9 httpwww-micromsbleacuk3035coronaviruseshtml 9 httpwwwrkmcomauviruscoronavirusindexhtml viruses are too small to be photographed through ordinary microscopes but electron microscopy reveals their basic structure the term coronavirus derives from the crown-like appearance of this class of viruses in images generated by electron microscopes hence the mental representation of the sars virus is multimodal including both verbal information such as that its genome has 29727 nucleotides and visuospatial information about its shape and structure diagrams are also very useful for displaying the genome organization and protein structure of the sars virus rota et al 2003  it is not unusual for human concepts to be grounded in modality-specific systems barsalou et al 2003 reviewed experimental evidence that conceptual processing activates modality-specific brain areas thus it is plausible that the mental representation of both the disease sars and its cause the sars-cov coronavirus are multimodal involving visual as well as verbal representations now we get to the hard part how does the mind represent cause philosophers have attempted to give verbal reconstructions of the concept of causality from hume on constant conjunction to kant on the causal schema to modern philosophers who have tried to tie causality to probability theory i suspect that all these attempts have failed to characterise causal knowledge because they neglect the fact that peoples understanding of causality is also multimodal i do not know whether this understanding is innate or learned very early but people acquire or instantiate the concept of causality through non-verbal perceptual experiences including ones that are visual tactile and kinesthetic michotte 1963  even infants have strong expectations about what they can expect to see and what they can expect to happen when they interact with the world baillargeon et al 1995 report that infants as young as 25 months expect a stationary object to be displaced when it is hit by a moving object by around 6 months infants believe that the distance traveled by the stationary object is proportional to the sise of the moving object thus at a very primitive stage of verbal development children seem to have some understanding of causality based on their visual and tactile experiences the brain contains regions of the parietal and prefrontal cortices that serve to integrate information from numerous perceptual sources and i speculate that understanding of causality resides in higher-level nonverbal representations that tie together such visualtactilekinesthetic perceptual inputs various writers in philosophy and psychology have postulated causal powers that go beyond relationships such as co-occurrence and conditional probability harr6 and madden 1975 cheng 1997  my multimodal hypothesis suggests how this appreciation of causal powers may operate in the mind children know little about logic and probability but they quickly acquire a sense of what it is for one event to make another happen understanding of simple mechanisms such as the lever and even of complex ones such as disease production depends on this preverbal sense of event causation in sum the mental representation of the seemingly straightforward hypothesis that sars is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus is highly complex and multimodal hence from the perspective of the cognitive conception of theories a medical theory is an integrated multimodal representation formation of such theories requires building verbal visual and other perceptual representations of the disease and its cause cognitive science is replete with detailed computational theories of the acquisition of concepts so the cognitive approach can easily address the problem of understanding how medical theories are discovered similarly there is a well-developed psychological theory and computational model of explanatory coherence that describes how competing theories can be evaluated using artificial neural networks thagard 1992  this leaves the major problem of saying how the cognitive conception of theories can shed light on the nature of medical explanation which requires attention to the topic of mechanisms this discussion will also illuminate the relationship between diseases and their causes as i have argued elsewhere modern explanations of disease based on molecular biology are largely concerned with biochemical mechanisms  to understand what biological mechanisms are it is useful to examine the nature of machines created by people in general a machine is an assemblage of parts that transmit forces motion and energy to each other in order to accomplish some task to describe a machine and explain its operation we need to specify its parts their properties and their relation with other parts most importantly we need to describe how changes to the properties and relationships of the parts with respect to force motion and energy enable the machine to accomplish its tasks consider the basic lever shown in fig 1  it consists of only two parts a stick and a rock but levers are very powerful and have enabled people to build huge structures such as the egyptian pyramids the lever in fig 1 operates by virtue of the fact that the stick is rigid and is on top of the rock which is solid applying force to the top of the stick tactile and kinesthetic perception makes the bottom of the stick to move and lift the block visual perception thus accomplishing the machines task similarly biological mechanisms can be explained by identifying the relevant parts and interactions my approach to medical theories is in keeping with the mechanismbased view of explanation espoused by such philosophers of science as fig 1  a simple machine the lever 56 p thagard salmon 1984 and bechtel and richardson 1993  machamer et al 2000 p 3 characterise the mechanisms as entities and activities organised such that they are productive of regular changes from start or set-up to finish or termination conditions i prefer the term part to entity because it indicates that the objects in a mechanism are part of a larger system and i prefer interaction and change to activity because they sound less anthropomorphic more importantly i find the reference to start and finish conditions highly misleading because the biochemical mechanisms needed to explain biological functioning often involve ongoing feedback processes rather than unidirectional changes hence i will simply say that a mechanism consists of a group of parts that have properties and relationship with each other that produce regular changes in those properties and relationships as well as to the properties and relationships of the whole group to apply this to medical explanations we need to identify for a particular disease the biochemical mechanisms that cause it the general mechanisms for viral infection and disease causation are well understood eg freudenrich 2004  a virus typically has three parts nucleic acid consisting of dna or rna which contains genetic instructions a coat of protein that protects the nucleic acid and a lipid membrane or envelope that surrounds the coat for the sars coronavirus the envelope carries three glycoproteins including a spike protein that enables the virus to bind to the cell receptors once a virus has attached itself to a cell it enters it and releases its genetic instructions that recruit the cells enzymes to make parts for new viruses the parts are assembled into new viruses which then break out of the cell and can infect other cells schematically the mechanism is attachment  entry  assembly  replication  release viral replication in itself does not produce disease symptoms which can arise from two sorts of mechanisms first viral release may directly cause cell damage or death as when the sars virus infects epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract second the presence of the virus will prompt an autoimmune response in which the body attempts to defend itself against the invading virus this response can induce symptoms such as fever that serves to slow down the virus replication schematically these two mechanisms are obviously these mechanisms of disease symptom causation can be broken down much further by specifying the relevant parts such as the proteins responsible for viral replication and the autoimmune cells that attack viruses and the relevant processes such as cell destruction and autoimmune responses these two kinds of mechanisms in company with the mechanisms of viral activity together explain how viruses such as the sars-cov cause diseases like sars a similar mechanistic account of medical explanation can be given for many other genetic nutritional autoimmune and cancerous diseases hence we can enhance the cognitive conception of the nature of medical theories as follows analysis 3 a medical theory is a mental representation of mechanisms that generate the states and symptoms of a disease note that the parts and changes in biological mechanisms are often represented visually as well as verbally so for most medical theories the mental representation is multimodal disease explanation is a mental process of manipulating representations of mechanisms to link their parts and changes to representations which may also be multimodal of states and symptoms of diseases i use the phrase states and symptoms to acknowledge that people may have diseases before they display any symptoms although the word cause has been dropped in the enhancement of analysis 2 by analysis 3 i do not mean to suggest that causality can be replaced by mechanism in the explanation of disease saying that the parts and interactions of a mechanism produce regular changes are equivalent to saying that they cause regular changes so we need to maintain the unanalysed multimodal concept of causality that i proposed earlier attempts to analyse causality away by means of concepts of universality or probability have been unsuccessful and my account of medical explanation does not try to eliminate causality from understanding of theories and explanations rather i propose that peoples comprehension of machines and mechanisms presupposes an intuitive notion of causality that derives from non-verbal experience analysis 3 gives a good account of the nature of medical theories as they are currently used by medical researchers and practitioners discovery of disease explanations involves formation of hypotheses about mechanisms that link causal factors such as microorganisms with disease states and symptoms evaluation of competing theories involves determining the most plausible set of mechanisms for producing a set of symptoms in the case of sars a dominant theory of disease causation was generated with remarkable speed although many other diseases remain unexplained however there is a serious limitation in analysis 3 that i now want to address medical theories are representations of biochemical mechanisms but increasingly such representations are to be found not in minds or books but in computer databases i will briefly describe several such databases and then discuss their implications for understanding the nature of medical knowledge here are six major computer databases of the sort that are becoming increasingly important for understanding the causes of diseases figure 2 is a vivid example of the kind of pictorial information that is available in these databases it shows a pathway that is necessary for understanding how defects in regulation of the protein cftr can lead to cystic fibrosis with rapid developments in genomics and proteomics the biochemical bases for a number of diseases are being understood the development of these computer databases demonstrates a stark difference between theories in physics and those in biomedicine a theory in physics such as newtonian mechanics or relativity can be stated in a small fig 2  depiction of the pathway for cftr regulation whose defects are believed to be the major cause for cystic fibrosis this diagram can be found on the web at httpbiocartacompathfileshcftrpathwayasp reprinted with permission of biocarta number of equations that can be grasped by anyone who has taken the time to learn them but no single human being has the time energy or memory capacity to learn even just the metabolic pathways for a simple organisms such as e coli the ecocyc database contains information on 4363 e coli genes 165 pathways and 2604 chemical reactions karp et al 2002  hence the biochemical understanding of any disease by a human scientist needs to be supplemented by access to computer databases that describe genes proteins and their interactions because biomedical mechanisms are being represented in computer databases and not minds or books the representation of the mechanisms for understanding diseases are distributed among various human minds and computers giere 2002 reached a similar conclusion about physics arguing that research in high-energy physics is performed by a complex cognitive system consisting of an accelerator detectors computers and all the people working on an experiment accordingly i propose my final analysis of the nature of medical theories analysis 4 a medical theory is a representation possibly distributed among human minds and computer databases of mechanisms whose proper and improper functioning generate the states and symptoms of a disease analysis 4 does not contradict any of the previous 3 analyses offered above but it expands them to allow the increasing role of bioinformatics in medical theorising i have added the clause about proper and improper functioning to indicate that explanations of disease presuppose a background of normal biological operation that has broken down the extension of my analysis of medical theories to encompass bioinformatics does not undermine any of the criticisms made in section 3 of various philosophical accounts of the nature of theories the syntactic model-theoretic paradigm and third-world accounts still fail to capture the complexity of medical theories and explanations in particular they do not illuminate the ways in which multimodal representations of mechanisms are crucial to the explanation of disease explanations of disease do not always need to go down to the deep biochemical level displayed in fig 2  depending on the problem and audience at hand a medical explanation may operate at a superficial level for example when physicians tell ordinary patients how they got sick but explanation is not merely pragmatic it should draw on established knowledge of mechanisms described at the level of detail appropriate for the task at hand the most important task in medical research after determining the causes of diseases is developing treatments for them whereas drug discovery used to be largely a matter of serendipity or exhaustive search current pharmaceutical research is based on deep understanding of the molecular bases of disease once investigators have identified how defective pathways lead to various diseases they can search selectively for drugs that correct the defects  i have defended a cognitive account of medical theories but there is a great need for further research in cognitive science to describe the mental structures and processes that are used in medical theory and practice psychology and the other fields of cognitive science have contributed to powerful theories of mental representation and processing for example theories of concepts rules images and neural networks thagard 2005  but here are some difficult unanswered questions that are crucial to further our understanding of how minds do medicine 1 how do brains represent changes of the sort that mechanisms produce 2 how do brains operate cooperatively with multimodal representations for example combining verbal and visual information 3 how do brains accomplish an innate or learned intuitive understanding of causality that emanates from integrated multimodal representations 4 what would it take for computers to be able not only to contain information about genes proteins and pathways but also to use that information to reason about them in order to generate explanations and treatments thus there is much work to be done to develop the cognitive conception of medical theories from a philosophical account into a full-fledged psychologicalcomputational theory of medical reasoning  coronavirus questions that will not go away interrogating urban and
socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures ashraf salama m   on 20th january 2020 epidemiologists at the chinese centre for disease control and
prevention published an article stating that the first cluster of patients with
pneumonia of an unknown cause had been identified on 21st december
2019 in wuhan  bfpg 2020 a city with a
population of more than 11 million following this announcements were made -- that
thousands of cases were identified in china and substantial numbers of cases were
broadcasted in many countries around the world on 30th january whos
director-general declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of
international concern  who 2020 given
that thousands of cases have been reported reaching all corners of the world in one
month this declaration was coupled with a number of recommendations related to
early detection of infection isolating and treating infected cases contact tracing
and social distancing measures that correspond to the level of risk in each country
with a key objective to interrupt or delay and hopefully limit the virus spread within the united kingdom public health england announced it is moving the risk
level to the british public from very low to low on
22nd january this is also when first two patients in the uk tested positive for
coronavirus after two chinese nationals from the same family staying at a hotel in
york fell ill a plane clearing britons from wuhan and evacuees went into a 14-day
quarantine at a specialist hospital in merseyside  bfpg 2020 after confirming the first transmission of
disease within the uk the government decided not to follow italy and china where
the highest figures of infection and death were recorded the lockdown approach that
imposes restrictions on liberty and movement was not favoured by the government
instead throughout february 2020 the government advised a range of voluntary
restrictions such as social distancing and if any symptoms are
exhibited self-isolation and quarantine on the 5th march infected cases were
reported in all areas of the uk 105 in england six in scotland three in wales
and one in northern ireland  bbc
2020 by the third week of march the prime minister announced a further set of measures as
part of a nationwide lockdown  beadsworth
2020 this was due to the continuous increase in infected and death
cases which reached according to public health england a total of 14543 cases
and 759 deaths on 27th march  phe 2020
the virus is highly infectious and at the time of writing this article there is no
known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 disease despite claims
by various governments that a vaccine or treatment is being developed the key
measure of the global public health campaign in response to the pandemic is social
distancing which in essence is avoiding face contact and encouraging physical
distancing the significant contributions to stop and treat viruses and associated diseases fall
within various academic disciplines and professions most important medical
scientists biologists and public health researchers are the key contributors to a
pandemic of this nature and scale they conduct laboratory research to understand
the attributes of the virus and the characteristics of the family of viruses it
belongs to they experiment develop test and advance vaccines for mass use and
eventually identify effective treatments professionals and scholars from other
disciplines are also contributors such as mathematicians and computer scientists
whose work through modelling techniques enable an effective understanding of
global patterns of virus spread and mortality rates social and behavioural
scientists contribute to the development of policies in the sense that they enable
institutions and organisations to identify risks and manage responses as they relate
to their employees and communities while addressing issues related to anxiety
loneliness and mental health architecture and urbanism as academic disciplines and professions that influence in
many different ways individuals communities and societies can support efforts
through developing new insights into the impact of a pandemic on cities and urban
environments now and in the future developing new understandings relevant to the
characteristics of urban spaces which ensue from these insights conducting research
to comprehend the socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures and guidelines
introduced by governments and authorities to fight the spread of the disease
identifying new conceptions related to emerging lifestyles which stem from the new
spatial environments that integrate working and living patterns and ultimately
developing design responses towards creating healthy environments that successfully
accommodate the infected populations while addressing the associated social and
psychological ramifications at the time of writing this article there is no sufficient or available empirical
research conducted to address to the preceding areas of potential contributions both
at the architectural building and urban city scales this article nonetheless
aims to interrogate these areas by instigating important questions while striving to
generate responses through conceptualisation operationalization and referencing
the available literature the fundamental aim is to underscore relevant factors
originate insights of potential use to policy makers architects and planners
highlight areas where future research will be critically needed and emphasise the
positive role architecture and urban design and planning fields can play in
developing healthy environments in a globally virtual world social distancing measures are a vital part of mitigating pandemics they complement
other measures in decreasing the prospect of the spread of disease the current body
of knowledge points out that social distancing is not a new measure to mitigate the
spread but has been introduced and practiced during the past several decades
researchers have developed important evidence on the potential impact of social
distancing arguing that it is moderately effective  ahmppi 2019 therefore where socio-economic impacts are
insignificant social distancing has been viewed at least as an acceptable
temporary measure while referred to as physical distancing in many writings social
distancing is a set of infection control actions envisioned to slow down or delay
and eventually stop the spread of an infectious disease  harris et al 2020 it aims to reduce the
likelihood of contact between persons carrying an infection and others who are not
infected so as to reduce virus transmission sickness and minimise mortality 
hensley 2020 despite the suggestion made by ahmppi
2019 there appears to be growing evidence of the effectiveness of social
distancing when infection is transmitted through droplet contact which may result
from all forms of physical contact between people and contact with contaminated
surfaces and fabrics it is also effective when transmission is airborne where the
virus can survive in the air for a period of time there is no clear evidence
however that social distancing is effective when infection is transmitted through
contact with water food or through insects social distancing measures were introduced by the world health organization in
response to the initially gradual and then exponentially global spread of
coronavirus the measures were generic in nature and were subject to various
interpretations of governments in the global north and the global south so they can
respond to the level of risk in each country or even residential neighbourhood or
locality these interpretations range from flexible or minor social distancing
measures to lockdown or in some countries various types of curfews during defined
timeframes within the day or the week measures of social distancing are practiced at both institutional and individual
levels at an institutional level there is common agreement on what social
distancing entails as evidenced in government documents of countries around the
world  phe 2020 pancap 2020 in this context the key elements are school
closure workplace closure and cancellation of mass gatherings this is further
expanded to include closure of small businesses restaurants cinemas theatres
bars pubs and clubs according to phe
2020 at an individual level social distancing entails reducing or
minimising interaction between people and involves a avoidance of non-essential
use of public transport especially during rush hours b working from home where
possible with regulations set for employers to support this c avoidance of contact
with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus covid-19 which include
high temperature andor new and continuous cough d avoidance of large gatherings
and gatherings in smaller public spaces and e avoidance of gatherings with friends
and family with recommendations to use distance technology including phone
internet and social media strikingly many social media posts online newspapers portals and discussion
boards and academic platforms are now introducing and discussing the notion of the
new normal portraying this as a new paradigm which will involve
many new realities and intensive online activities that range from retail and
shopping to banking and higher education prevision to name a few it is argued
social distancing is here to stay for much more than a few weeks it will
upend our way of life in some ways forever  lichfield 2020 there is strong evidence that there is now
a high degree of acceptability among governments institutions organisations and
universities that contemporary societies are approaching a new era characterised by
intensive digitalvirtual practices to which the way of life must be adapted in
particular and in the immediate future until it becomes actually
normal there is a general appreciation that such a new normal will have
negative consequences which include loneliness reduced productivity unhealthy
sleeping and eating habits potential obesity and loss of various benefits
associated with reduced human-human and human-environment interactions with social distancing measures the remarkable shift from the physical to the
virtual and the acceptance of this there are many social and spatial implications
that architects planners and built environment professionals would be keen to
examine in this respect key questions arise to address various scales and scopes
and can be outlined as follows the preceding questions do not cover the entire spectrum of issues and potential
impacts arising from social distancing and the new normal for example issues
associated with risk management construction processes and practice management are
not included yet the questions cover some fundamentals that are believed to be of
interest to the global community of architects and urban designers and planners and
that are predicted to generate new conceptions develop new insights and eventually
inform new thinking about the future of architecture and urbanism this would also
instigate a discourse on role of architecture and urbanism in developing healthy
environments and supporting emerging lifestyles in a post pandemic virtual era answering complex questions like the ones presented in the preceding section requires
responses underpinned by a commitment to trans-disciplinarity it should be seen as
a form of research involving co-operation among different parts of society
professionals and academia  dunnin-woyseth
 nielsen 2004 pohl  hirsch
hadorn 2008 in order to meet complex challenges in the context of
covid-19 spread and the resulting new normal and eventually the actual normal
therefore trans-disciplinarity is about blurring then transcending the boundaries
of different disciplines starting from tangible real-world problems knowledge is
developed produced and reproduced based on a collaboration of people from different
disciplinary backgrounds  doucet  janssens
2011 its hybrid nature and non-linearity enables it to transcend and
indeed incorporate any academic disciplinary structure adopting trans-disciplinary
thinking at conceptual and critical analysis levels a framework is developed
through which responses to the questions are based on operationalization of concepts
and theories derived from various disciplines as they relate to architecture and
urbanism  figure 1 outlined as follows while the discussion does not fully address every single discipline shown in the
diagram all the perspectives and dimensions discussed have to do with researching
and designing built environments it is argued that infectious disease has a direct relationship with urban
development and would result in significant impact on our understanding of
urbanism hang 2020 suggests that
the increasing density of cities has generated conditions for the rapid spread
of viruses by comparing the spread of sars-cov in 2003 and sars-cov-2 in
201920 it is evident that population density has a direct impact on the rapid
spread in the case of sars-cov within china more than 5000 people were
infected and more than 300 died over a period of eight months yet in the case
of sars-cov-2 more than 4000 people were infected over a period of seven weeks
this could be attributed to the fact that chinese cities have developed into
both dense and sprawling urban areas with higher population density resulting
from migration from rural to urban areas klaus 2020 interviewed michele acuto professor of global urban
politics in the school of design at the university of melbourne and the
question of density and density management were central to the discussion and
were portrayed as the  long term survival in a pandemic
world klaus
2020 supports this view and argues  part of the
history of urbanization is building and managing your way out of infectious
diseases such as cholera outbreaks in the middle of the 19th
century 
badger 2020 adopts an opposing view
and argues that high density is not necessarily a public health issue she
evidences this by putting the case of singapore and hong kong as urban
environments that are dense or denser than new york and how they were able to
develop early testing and extensive tracing of coronavirus cases rather than
extensive isolation she advocates density for the multiple benefits it brings
to cities unique cultural richness these include facilitating mass
transportation creating walkable environments enabling the masses to enjoy
public spaces supporting childrens needs through urban parks and
playgrounds limiting climate emissions supporting personal and public safety
to name a few it is increasingly acknowledged following sennett 2016 and shenker 2020 that the future of cities will involve a renewed
focus on developing architectural and urban solutions that enable people to
socialise without higher densities and sardines-like
packing the work of keil et al
2020 suggests that there is a close relationship between urban
development and new or re-emerging contagious diseases rapid means of
transportation the continuous expansion of urban sprawl and connectivity
between urban life and nature are factors that contribute to such a spread from
urban peripheries to urban centres however patterns of disease emergence and
spread within urbanisation would require in-depth empirical modelling and
investigations of historical cases and juxtaposing these with the case of
coronavirus spread the persistent question that urban design and planning experts will face in the
future is about balancing conflicting value on the one hand densification and
making cities more compact and concentrated for the environmentally and socially
sustainable benefits compactness is viewed to bring on the other hand
compartmentalisation and separation of populations through various measures
including social distancing as a key tool being used to delay or stop virus
spread while compactness and density are important determinants for successful
urban environments in cultural social and environmental terms current
discussions suggest that the future development of cities will witness
encounters between contested requisites including public health climate and
socio-economic dynamics in meeting the challenge of the covid-19 spread cities are adopting various
strategies at a large scale while cities are at the forefront of the response
to the pandemic they will likely see enduring transformation and permanent
changes while it is argued that cities and urbanism have been shaped by
contagious disease for centuries the global nature of covid-19 is anticipated
to bring significant changes to policies and the associated institutional and
individual behaviours in essence these changes while they have already
started to alter the way people live and work will alter how cities are planned
and managed for decades to come null 
smith 2020 identified a number of areas that delineate various
strategies restricting access to travel and questing for alternatives to public
transit locally and globally measures for limiting travel are most apparent in the sense
of how cities are now operating in a short period of time travel restrictions
among other measures have had negative impacts including destroyed economies
unemployment and a dramatic reduction in industrial production however some
positive impacts are also witnessed in terms of a reduction in air pollution and
carbon emissions in the cases of italy and china nasa satellite data
illustrate significant changes in air pollution levels  nasa 2020 and a 25 drop in carbon emissions as
lockdown and restrictions started to show results  null  smith 2020 coupled with the reduction in train and bus operations in many cities around the
world local and global travel restrictions are expected to have significant
implications on the what and how of urban planning in the future given the
established correlations between morality rates and urban air pollution with
positive impacts on the health of urban societies however these will need to
be balanced in the context of climate change and sustainability if the city is
expanded rather than compacted this must be associated with better connectivity
through alternative forms of public transport as people avoid crowds and
movement is restricted reports suggest that public transit use has taken a
sharp decline  hawkins 2020 moovit 2020 nuki 2020 the planning of future cities would be
derived from enhanced policies that further support cycling and walking contagious disease outbreaks are indeed global incidents as evident in the
spread of coronavirus from wuhan to various cities around the world lockdown
and quarantining of many mega and global cities is impacting the global
condition at various scales including globalised urban lifestyles the rapid
spread of disease takes place through infrastructures of globalisation which
includes global air travel links keil
et al 2020 argue that airports are often
located at the peripheries of cities and urban areas and this raises questions
about responsibility and accountability in terms of managing disease spread to
the wider urban regions in 2003 sars impacted global centres of trade and
commerce including beijing hong kong singapore and toronto however covid-19
has severely impacted global cities in the global north such as london and new
york and global infrastructure such as airport hubs aviation networks and
places of industrial production an interesting phenomenon emerges out of the current discussion of the threat of
covid-19 there is a heavy focus on discussing repercussions of spread in
universal terms and this reinforces existing inequalities  wilkinson 2020 in particular
informal settlements and slums in the global south and the associated urban
poverty do not seem to have enjoyed a sufficient share within current
discussions and media reports this could be attributed to the fact that these
settlements are already on the margin and that communities are already
underrepresented where crises are the norm and thus there is nothing new
despite the significant lack of information there is a risk that infection
rates and transmission will be significantly higher than in planned cities and
urban areas to alleviate the negative consequences of these and introduce
positive interventions in informal settlements in the long term architects and
planners would need to establish new lenses through which they can comprehend
health and living conditions that generate relevant intervention strategies geographical locations refer to the key places and areas that influence
peoples perception of the city such as living working shopping and
entertainment places or destinations derived from the theory of territoriality
home zone and home range are constructs that
represent areas which influence peoples mental image of important
geographical locations establishing links between the physical environment and
social behaviour theorists and researchers have examined these insights in
various contexts  abdel-hadi et
al 2011 altman
1975 rapoport 2005 salama et al 2013 in
this respect it is important to discern how these constructs can be
differentiated home zone signifies an environment with minor or no requirement
for transportation this includes locales that are accessed effortlessly through
walking thereby stimulating a sense of ownership and belonging among the
residents within these locales irrespective of scale and size home range
denotes a more inclusive mental image of the entire residential environment
placing emphasis on the perceived geographical boundary such as that of
residential neighbourhood or clusters of housing developments within urban design and planning disciplines a city is perceived as a fluid
dynamic system which involves material and non-material inputs and outputs that
flow in out and within this relates to the notion of geographical locations
and represents at a larger scale a process of movement and mobility within the
city and beyond in historical writings  burgess 1925 sorokin
1927 and contemporary debates  geyer  kontuly 1996 movement and urban mobility have been
discussed from various perspectives in the past the focus was on social and
behavioural factors recently however the notion of networks the spatial
structure and the peoples perception of both were introduced understanding urban mobility or movement patterns within the city will be crucial
to conceiving interaction measures between geographical locations within the
spatial structure urban networks and the associated operational requirements
the distribution of functions and uses peoples movement patterns and
the rhythm of commuting between geographical locations within the city will all
constitute important design and planning criteria that carefully consider health
and the potential spread of disease within the citys urban structure
acting as imperatives these considerations will enable lessening or
eliminating the spread of viruses to various geographical locations from the
urban peripheries and around airports to urban cores or residential
neighbourhoods this incudes in depth modelling of how far from and how long it
takes to commute to the city core from living areas to work areas public
places entertainment places and within residential neighbourhoods such
modelling should also embed user types and age ranges with a focus on
vulnerable groups since social distancing measures are currently planned to last at least six
months it is believed that they will have various forms of impacts on both
urban researchers and the public concepts and theories related to place
attachment personal space and relationships between individuals and groups as
well as proximity to nature will need to be revisited place attachment is highly influenced by an individual and his or her personal
experiences  rollero  de piccoli
2010 it is multi-dimensional and cannot be explained through a
cause and effect relationship since it depends on a reciprocal relationship
between human behaviour and past and current experiences  giuliani 2016 scannell  gifford 2010 in essence it relates to affect
cognition and behaviour places of attachment include the home neighbourhood
urban settings and natural landscapes attachment to these places is typically
measured through many qualities depending on the typology and use of place
these qualities include aesthetics heritage family connection recreation
therapeutic biological diversity wilderness home intrinsic spiritual
economic life-sustaining learning and future post pandemic place attachment
conception would involve reweighing many of these qualities with more emphasis
placed upon on qualities related to healthy hygienic sanitised and healing
environments this may also lead to the rise of disaster psychology which aims
to examine the relationship between a city urban area or neighbourhood and
their inhabitants attitudes and emotions in the context of detrimental
incidents such as coronavirus spread and an increasing sense of personal safety
and health the established canons of personal space and proximity relationships introduced
in the mid 1960s  hall 1966 and
hall  hall 1966 are
critical to grasp in the context of social distancing measures personal space
determines how people relate socially and psychologically and can be represented
by an area bubble with an invisible boundary surrounding the persons
body into which intruders may not come such a bubble is carried everywhere one
goes based on intensive empirical studies hall 1966 explained the relative distances between people
depending on the relationships they have and classified them in four discrete
distance ranges intimate distance 1 to 46 cm personal distance 46 to 122
cm social distance 12 to 37 m and public distance 37 to 76 m and
more with social distancing measures and the minimum allowance of 2 meters
personal distance the relative distance ranges would entirely change
especially if social distancing measures are viewed in the future as accepted
standards currently there is a growing interest in designing healing environments ryan et al 2014
argues that the surge of interest in creating spaces and places that support
health and wellbeing is viewed as a renaissance in design thinking and the way
in which buildings and cities are designed and built salingaros 2015 contends that biophilic design
effectively eliminates stress and anxiety from the built environment and is
achieved by maintaining thoughtful engagement with nature recently researchers
have been investigating the syntactic relationships between people and nature 
asfour 2019 rice 2019 to 
grierson 2019 in such a quest they attempt to demonstrate the
role of architecture and urbanism in developing healthy and healing environments
and how design can be informed to allow critical humannature associations to
prosper social distancing measures may encourage less association with people
in urban settings and may give further rise to biophilic design trends the urban has been defined as a place of encounter
assembly simultaneity  lefebvre
1970118 it is argued that there are two polar perspectives
associated with the term which stem from various disciplinary territories
urban form and urban life while urban from is the sphere of urban designers
architects urban planners and transportation engineers urban life is the
territory of social scientists human geographers and sociologists as argued
by susser 2002 urban form refers to
the spatial concentration of populace within a specific area of land limits to
building and population densities and certain qualities of buildings and
spaces urban life epitomises the collective which refers to
the diffusion of the system of values attitudes customs and behaviours of a
specific group of people associations between urban form and urban life have
been studied thoroughly  salama et
al 2017a through a sustained and consistent
understanding that they cannot be discussed in isolation where urban form is
shaped and influenced by urban life and urban life arises from urban form the urban place has been expressed in various studies as having contrasting
attributes based on the characteristics of form and the nature of the activities
taking place within that form positive attributes include diversity tolerance
association integration personal network-formation  fischer 1977 and frequent spontaneous interactions
while these qualities represent an ideal condition and confirm lefebvre 1970 postulation the urban
place has been portrayed in negative attributes  halpern 1995 that include anonymity detachment
loneliness formalised social control segregation isolation fear and mental
illness the covid-19 social distancing measures will have an impact on the
perception of some of these qualities especially if these measures in part or
in whole become the norm and part of the new normal an example for this is
that spontaneous interactions would become less or non- spontaneous while
formalised social control will take place as a positive rather than a negative
attribute the suggestion made by walzer 1986
that public space is where we share with strangers people who
arent our relatives friends or work associates could entirely
change given the cognizance of users regarding the risks associated with
engaging with others they do not know if social distancing measures become part
of the collective psyche of societies it could lead to a significant change in
comprehending the needs in public spaces by revisiting the notions of social
interaction assembly and simultaneity active engagement which represents the
direct experience a person has with a place and the people within it would be
limited or directed more towards passive engagement that involves meeting the
need for encounter without becoming actively involved this includes watching
the passing scene rather than talking or doing since the mid 1970s urban theorists have conceived various triadic relationships
that established a common understanding of places canter 1977 developed an understanding of the
constituents of place which include psychological conceptions physical
attributes and actions and behaviours punter 1991 introduced mental image form and activity while
mongomery 1998 discussed factors
that generate a sense of place involving meaning physical setting and activity
post pandemic urban design would need to emphasise factors relevant to spatial
proximity as it relates to health in order to limit the potential spread of
viruses or reacting to peoples awareness of it this could eventually
lead to altering the triadic relationships which were part of urban discourse
for several decades social distancing guidelines coupled with operating in a post pandemic virtual world
will instigate new living and working patterns which will result in different
spatial requirements and place standards to understand the spatiality of these
dynamics it is crucial to relate to the body of knowledge developed within social
sciences  adler et al
1987 which has significant implications on the notion of place as a
human product involving human choices following giddens 1984 and pred
1984 these products and choices are based on factors relevant to how
different elements of a society interact and a critical understanding of people
organisations agencies and the power that each element of a society has this
understanding can be further elaborated based on ethnographic and anthropological
perspectives as they relate to the built environment  salama 2011 salama
et al 2017b from an ethnographic perspective the concept of life-mode  hojrup 2003 offers insights into the understanding that
human values are constrained by cultural-relational dialectics and are products of
cultural life modes which can be classified according to work styles self-employed
mode wage-earner mode and career-oriented mode from an anthropological
perspective douglas 1996 discusses a
life style scheme that relates to attitudes rather than work these attitudes can be
envisaged as sub-cultures that include competition and individualism isolation and
avoidance of social controls equity and negotiation and hierarchical communities
the two perspectives have direct spatial implications on how post pandemic emerging
patterns of living and working will be spatially accommodated the spatial implications resulting from the two perspectives can be extrapolated when
looking at various manifestations of the home environment and home choices  salama 2011 in terms of work the
self-employed life mode is where means of production are owned and included within
the house this means that the home environment is conceived as an integrated living
and working place where work time and spare time are not separated the wage-earner
life mode means that the home environment is regarded as either a primary place
serving recreational purposes or a place where important spare-time family or
personal activities are undertaken the career-oriented life mode means that the
home environment reflects the personal progress position social status and past
and recent experiences additionally the notion of sub-cultures determines housing
preference based on social attitudes especially isolation and avoidance of social
control and will manifest in post pandemic housing choices including preferred
aspects related to the house integration within the neighbourhood and the overall
house size and image whether work-based or status- and attitude-based the spatial attributes of home and
work environments post pandemic should be seen as a product of distancing measures
and of operating in a virtualdigital world which will instigate new living and
working patterns these implications will influence the existing housing stock and
working places which will require appropriation and adaptation and the new
developments of home and work environments requiring new standards and
specifications the public health catastrophe caused by coronavirus and the rapid spread of covid-19
disease has significant impacts on societies and cities around the world the
trans-disciplinary conceptual framework utilised for analysing urban and
socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures reveals important insights into the
factors that will impact future education research and practice of architecture
and urban design and planning these factors act as a base for potential
contributions of architecture and urbanism as academic disciplines and professions
to develop new insights into the impact of a pandemic on cities and urban
environments and the socio-spatial implications of covid-19 measures and guidelines
immediate research areas were classified under three key areas urban dynamics
during and post covid-19 socio-spatial implications of distancing measures and the
requirements of the new spatial environments to accommodate post pandemic emerging
living and working patterns  figure 2 as the
spread of covid-19 has influenced individuals communities organisations and
governments its impacts will be on every level and scale from global networks and
infrastructure to global cities and urban regions and from residential
neighbourhoods and public spaces to home and work environments and will continue
for many years to come according to forsyth 2020 
the current pandemic brings the question of designing for infectious
diseases back to the forefront however and raises important questions for
future research and practice therefore the development of
healthy environments must be central to architecture and urbanism in the future
despite that health does seem to be absent within the education and practice of
architecture and urban design and planning professions forsyth 2020 asserts this view and argues 
for the past decades those looking at the intersections of planning
design and public health have focused less on infectious diseases and more on
chronic disease hazards and disasters and the vulnerable
rice 2019 maintains that the design
of the built environment is a determinant of health and thus there is an increasing
need for greater synergy between architectural and urban education research and
practice and public health the spread of the disease generated a condition which is labelled as the new normal
resulting from social distancing measures and is characterised by human detachment
isolation and engagement in a virtual world coupled with an emphasis on working
from home through the utilisation of information and telecommunication technologies
the acceptability of the new normal as a result of attempting to limit the disease
spread appears to be a catalyst for a future stable condition the actual normal
while addressing health in a post pandemic virtual world negative consequences
emerge where many people around the world will be living and working in confined
spaces surrounded by gigantic cities and massive high-rise agglomerations the new normal  to be the actual normal  was foretold in the writings
of theorists in architecture and urbanism manuel castells in his book the rise of the network society economy society
and culture 2000 developed a methodical theory of the information
society which is based on the overpowering impacts of information technology in a
contemporary global world his assumption that the global city is not necessarily a
place but a process seems to manifest in the future stable condition the visionary
trilogy of the late william mitchell is clear evidence that the actual normal
represents the prospects of societies and cities the stable condition of the actual normal is palpable in the city of
bits  mitchell 1995 where
mitchell examines architecture and urbanism in the context of the digital
telecommunications revolution the continuing miniaturization of electronics the
commodification of bits and the growing domination of the digital over the
physical in the e-topia 1999 mitchell
examines the way in which an electronically connected world will shape cities of the
future and the associated urban relationships with a focus on digital
infrastructure and its implications for future daily lives mitchell asserts that we
must extend the definitions of architecture and urban design to integrate virtual
places as well as physical ones and interconnection by means of telecommunication
links as well as by pedestrian circulation and mechanized transportation systems he
proposes strategies for the creation of cities that not only will be sustainable but
also will make economic social and cultural sense in an electronically
interconnected and global world while this conceptualisation would seem an
imaginary future it appears now as a representation of the stable condition of the
actual normal mitchells book me the
cyborg self and the networked city 2003 answers the question of how the
transformation of wireless technology and the creation of an interconnected world
are changing our environment and our lives he argues a world governed less and less
by boundaries and more and more by connections requires the reconstruction of our
environment and our cities and reconsideration of the ethical foundations of
architecture urbanism and allied disciplines in a transition period called the new normal which will eventually become a stable
condition of the actual normal societies communities and individuals appear to be
at odds speculating the future that future seems to have already arrived at our
doorsteps perhaps forcefully perhaps arbitrarily perhaps in a shock and
awe manner but surely at the expense of disease panic mental illness and
death no data are associated with this article  a sir model assumption for the spread of covid-19 in different communities ian cooper argha mondal chris antonopoulos g   in december 2019 a novel strand of coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan hubei province china causing a severe and potentially fatal respiratory syndrome ie covid-19 since then it has become a pandemic declared by world health organization who on march 11 which has spread around the globe 1 2 3 4 5 who published in its website preliminary guidelines with public health care for the countries to deal with the pandemic 6 since then the infectious disease has become a public health threat italy and usa are severely affected by covid-19 7 8 9 millions of people are forced by national governments to stay in self-isolation and in difficult conditions the disease is growing fast in many countries around the world in the absence of availability of a proper medicine or vaccine currently social distancing self-quarantine and wearing a face mask have been emerged as the most widely-used strategy for the mitigation and control of the pandemic in this context mathematical models are required to estimate disease transmission recovery deaths and other significant parameters separately for various countries that is for different specific regions of high to low reported cases of covid-19 different countries have already taken precise and differentiated measures that are important to control the spread of the disease however still now important factors such as population density insufficient evidence for different symptoms transmission mechanism and unavailability of a proper vaccine makes it difficult to deal with such a highly infectious and deadly disease especially in high population density countries such as india 10 11 12 recently many research articles have adopted the modelling approach using real incidence datasets from affected countries and have investigated different characteristics as a function of various parameters of the outbreak and the effects of intervention strategies in different countries respective to their current situations it is imperative that mathematical models are developed to provide insights and make predictions about the pandemic to plan effective control strategies and policies 13 14 15 modelling approaches 8 16 17 18 19 20 21 are helpful to understand and predict the possibility and severity of the disease outbreak and provide key information to determine the intensity of covid-19 disease intervention the susceptible-infected-removed sir model and its extended modifications 22 23 24 25 such as the extended-susceptible-infected-removed esir mathematical model in various forms have been used in previous studies 26 27 28 to model the spread of covid-19 within communities here we propose the use of a novel sir model with different characteristics one of the major assumptions of the classic sir model is that there is a homogeneous mixing of the infected and susceptible populations and that the total population is constant in time in the classic sir model the susceptible population decreases monotonically towards zero however these assumptions are not valid in the case of the spread of the covid-19 virus since new epicentres spring up around the globe at different times to account for this the sir model that we propose here does not consider the total population and takes the susceptible population as a variable that can be adjusted at various times to account for new infected individuals spreading throughout a community resulting in an increase in the susceptible population ie to the so-called surges the sir model we introduce here is given by the same simple system of three ordinary differential equations odes with the classic sir model and can be used to gain a better understanding of how the virus spreads within a community of variable populations in time when surges occur importantly it can be used to make predictions of the number of infections and deaths that may occur in the future and provide an estimate of the time scale for the duration of the virus within a community it also provides us with insights on how we might lessen the impact of the virus what is nearly impossible to discern from the recorded data alone consequently our sir model can provide a theoretical framework and predictions that can be used by government authorities to control the spread of covid-19 in our study we used covid-19 datasets from 29 in the form of time-series spanning january to june 2020 in particular the time series are composed of three columns which represent the total cases itotd active cases id and deaths dd in time rows these datasets were used to update parameters of the sir model to understand the effects and estimate the trend of the disease in various communities represented by china south korea india australia usa italy and the state of texas in the usa this allowed us to estimate the development of covid-19 spread in these communities by obtaining estimates for the number of deaths d susceptible s infected i and removed rm populations in time consequently we have been able to estimate its characteristics for these communities and assess the effectiveness of modelling the disease the paper is organised as following in sec 2 we introduce the sir model and discuss its various aspects in sec 3 we explain the approach we used to study the data in 29 and in sec 4 we present the results of our analysis for china south korea india australia usa italy and the state of texas in the usa section 5 discusses the implications of our study to the flattening the curve approach finally in sec 6 we conclude our work and discuss the outcomes of our analysis and its connection to the evidence that has been already collected on the spread of covid-19 worldwide the world around us is highly complicated for example how a virus spreads including the novel strand of coronavirus sars-cov-2 that was identified in wuhan hubei province china depends upon many factors among which some of them are considered by the classic sir model which is rather simplistic and cannot take into consideration surges in the number of susceptible individuals here we propose the use of a modified sir model with characteristics based upon the classic sir model in particular one of the major assumptions of the classic sir model is that there is a homogeneous mixing of the infected i and susceptible s populations and that the total population n is constant in time also in the sir model the susceptible population s decreases monotonically towards zero these assumptions however are not valid in the case of the spread of the covid-19 virus since new epicentres spring up around the globe at different times to account for this we introduce here a sir model that does not consider the total population n but rather takes the susceptible population s as a variable that can be adjusted at various times to account for new infected individuals spreading throughout a community resulting in its increase thus our model is able to accommodate surges in the number of susceptible individuals in time whenever these occur and as evidenced by published data such as those in 29 that we consider here our sir model is given by the same simple system of three ordinary differential equations odes with the classic sir model that can be easily implemented and used to gain a better understanding of how the covid-19 virus spreads within communities of variable populations in time including the possibility of surges in the susceptible populations thus the sir model here is designed to remove many of the complexities associated with the real-time evolution of the spread of the virus in a way that is useful both quantitatively and qualitatively it is a dynamical system that is given by three coupled odes that describe the time evolution of the following three populations1
susceptible individuals st these are those individuals who are not infected however could become infected a susceptible individual may become infected or remain susceptible as the virus spreads from its source or new sources occur more individuals will become infected thus the susceptible population will increase for a period of time surge period2
infected individuals it these are those individuals who have already been infected by the virus and can transmit it to those individuals who are susceptible an infected individual may remain infected and can be removed from the infected population to recover or die3
removed individuals rmt these are those individuals who have recovered from the virus and are assumed to be immune rmt or have died dt
 furthermore it is assumed that the time scale of the sir model is short enough so that births and deaths other than deaths caused by the virus can be neglected and that the number of deaths from the virus is small compared with the living population based on these assumptions and concepts the rates of change of the three populations are governed by the following system of odes what constitutes our sir model1dstdtastitditdtastitbitdrmtdtbitwhere a and b are real positive parameters of the initial exponential growth and final exponential decay of the infected population i it has been observed that in many communities a spike in the number of infected individuals i may occur which results in a surge in the susceptible population s recorded in the covid-19 datasets 29 what amounts to a secondary wave of infections to account for such a possibility s in the sir model 1 can be reset to ssurge at any time ts that a surge occurs and thus it can accommodate multiple such surges if recorded in the published data in 29 what distinguishes it from the classic sir model the evolution of the infected population i is governed by the second ode in system 1 where a is the transmission rate constant and b the removal rate constant we can define the basic effective reproductive rate reastb as the fate of the evolution of the disease depends upon it if re is smaller than one the infected population i will decrease monotonically to zero and if greater than one it will increase ie if ditdt0re1 and if ditdt0re1 thus the effective reproductive rate re acts as a threshold that determines whether an infectious disease will die out quickly or will lead to an epidemic at the start of an epidemic when re  1 and s  1 the rate of infected population is described by the approximation ditdtabit and thus the infected population i will initially increase exponentially according to iti0eabt the infected population will reach a peak when the rate of change of the infected population is zero ditdt0 and this occurs when re1 after the peak the infected population will start to decrease exponentially following itebt thus eventually for t   the system will approach s  0 and i  0 interestingly the existence of a threshold for infection is not obvious from the recorded data however can be discerned from the model this is crucial in identifying a possible second wave where a sudden increase in the susceptible population s will result in re  1 and to another exponential growth of the number of infections i the data in 29 for china south korea india australia usa italy and the state of texas communities are organised in the form of time-series where the rows are recordings in time from january to june 2020 and the three columns are the total cases itotd first column number of infected individuals id second column and deaths dd third column consequently the number of removals can be estimated from the data by2rmditotdidddsince we want to adjust the numerical solutions to our proposed sir model 1 to the recorded data from 29 for each dataset community we consider initial conditions in the interval 01 and scale them by a scaling factor f to fit the recorded data by visual inspection in particular the initial conditions for the three populations are set such that s01 ie all individuals are considered susceptible initially i0rm0imaxdf1 where imaxd is the maximum number of infected individuals id consequently the parameters a b f and imaxd are adjusted manually to fit the recorded data as best as possible based on a trial-and-error approach and visual inspections a preliminary analysis using non-linear fittings to fit the model to the published data 29 provided at best inferior results to those obtained in this paper using our trial-and-error approach with visual inspections in the sense that the model solutions did not follow as close the published data what justifies our approach in the paper a prime reason for this is that the published data including those in 29 we are using here are data from different countries that follow different methodologies to record them with not all infected individuals or deaths accounted for in this context s i and rm  0 at any t  0 system 1 can be solved numerically to find how the scaled by f susceptible s infected i and removed rm populations what we call model solutions evolve with time in good agreement with the recorded data in particular since this system is simple with well-behaved solutions we used the first-order euler integration method to solve it numerically and a time step h2005000004 that corresponds to a final integration time tf of 200 days since january 2020 this amounts to double the time interval in the recorded data in 29 and allows for predictions for up to 100 days after january 2020 obviously what is important when studying the spread of a virus is the number of deaths d and recoveries r in time as these numbers are not provided directly by the sir model 1 we estimated them by first plotting the data for deaths dd vs the removals rmd where rmdddrditotdid and then fitting the plotted data with the nonlinear function3dd01ekrmwhere d
0 and k are constants estimated by the non-linear fitting the function is expressed in terms of only model values and is fitted to the curve of the data thus having obtained d from the non-linear fitting the number of recoveries r can be described in time by the simple observation that it is given by the scaled removals rm from the sir model 1 less the number of deaths d from eq 34rrmd
 the number of infections peaked in china about 16 february 2020 and since then it has slowly decreased the decrease only occurs when the susceptible population numbers decrease and this decrease in susceptible numbers only occurred through the drastic actions taken by the chinese government china quarantined and confirmed potential patients and restricted citizens movements as well as international travel social distancing was widely practiced and most of the people wore face masks the actual numbers of infections have decreased at a greater rate than predicted by the sir model see figs 1 and 2 our results in figs 1 and 2 provide evidence that the chinese government has done well in limiting the impact of the spread of covid-19 from the plots shown in figs 3 and 4 it is obvious that the south korean government has done a wonderful job in controlling the spread of the virus the country has implemented an extensive virus testing program there has also been a heavy use of surveillance technology closed-circuit television cctv and tracking of bank cards and mobile phone usage to identify who to test in the first place south korea has achieved a low fatality rate currently one percent without resorting to such authoritarian measures as in china the most conspicuous part of the south korean strategy is simple enough implementation of repeated cycles of test and contact trace measures to match the recorded data from india with predictions from the sir model 1 it is necessary to include a number of surge periods as shown in fig 5 this is because the sir model cannot predict accurately the peak number of infections if the actual numbers in the infected population have not peaked in time it is most likely the spread of the virus as of early june 2020 is not contained and there will be an increasing number of total infections however by adding new surge periods a higher and delayed peak can be predicted and compared with future data in fig 5 a consequence of the surge periods is that the peak is delayed and higher than if no surge periods were applied the model predictions for the 30 september 2020 including the surges are 330 000 total infections 700 active infections and 7 500 deaths whereas if there were no surge periods there would be 130 000 total infections 700 active infections and 6 300 deaths with the peak of 60 000 which is about 40 of the current number of active cases occuring around 20 may 2020 thus the model can still give a rough estimate of future infections and deaths as well as the time it may take for the number of infections to drop to safer levels at which time restrictions can be eased even without an accurate prediction in the peak in active infections see figs 5 and 6 a surge in the susceptible population was applied in early march 2020 in the country the surge was caused by 2 700 passengers disembarking from the ruby princes cruise ship in sydney and then returning to their homes around australia more than 750 passengers and crew have become infected and 26 died two government enquires have been established to investigate what went wrong also at this time many infected overseas passengers arrived by air from europe and the usa the australian government was too slow in quarantining arrivals from overseas from mid-march 2020 until mid-may 2020 the australian governments introduced measures of testing contact tracing social distancing staying at home policy closure of many businesses and encouraging people to work from home from figs 7 and 8 it can be observed that actions taken were successful as the actual number of infections declined in accord with the model predictions there have been no further surge periods from end of may 2020 these restrictions are being removed in stages the sir model can be used when future data becomes available to see if the number of susceptible individuals starts to increase if so the model can accommodate this by introducing surge factors as of early june 2020 the peak number of infections has not been reached when a peak in the data is not reached it is more difficult to fit the model predictions to the data in the model it is necessary to add a few surge periods this is because new epicentres of the virus arose at different times the virus started spreading in washington state followed by california new york chicago and the southern states of the usa the need to add surge periods shows clearly that the spread of the virus is not under control in the usa by the end of may 2020 the number of active infected cases has not yet peaked and the cumulative total number of infections keeps getting bigger this can be accounted for in the sir model by considering how the susceptible population changes with time in may during that time to match the data to the model predictions surge periods were used where the normalized susceptible population s was reset to 02 every four days what is currently happening in the usa is that as susceptible individuals become infected their population decreases with these infected individuals mixing with the general population leading to an increase in the susceptible population this is shown in the model by the variable for the susceptible population s varying from about 006 to 020 repeatedly during may until this vicious cycle is broken the cumulative total infected population will keep growing at a steady rate and not reach an almost steady-state the fluctuating normalized susceptible variable provides clear evidence that government authorities do not have the spread of the virus under control see figs 9 and 10 the plots in figs 11 and 12 show that the peak in the total cumulative number of infections has not been reached as early as june however the peak is probably not far away if there are no surges in the susceptible population then one could expect that by late september 2020 the number of infections will have fallen to very small numbers and the virus will have been well under control with the total number of deaths in the order of 2 000 in mid-may 2020 some restrictions have been lifted in the state of texas the sir model can be used to model some of the possible scenarios if the early relaxation of restrictions leads to increasing number of susceptible populations if there is a relatively small increase in the future number of susceptible individuals no series impacts occur however if there is a large outbreak of the virus then the impacts can be dramatic for example at the end of june 2020 if s was reset to 08 s08 a second wave of infections occurs with the peak number of infections occurring near the end of july with the second wave peak being higher than the initial peak number of infections subsequently the number of deaths will rise from about 2 000 to nearly 5 000 as shown in figs 13 and 14 if governments start lifting their containment strategies too quickly then it is probable there will be a second wave of infections with a larger peak in active cases resulting to many more deaths 
figure 15 shows clearly that the peak of the pandemic has been reached in italy and without further surge periods the spread of the virus is contained and number of active cases is declining rapidly the plots in panels a b in fig 16 are a check on how well the model can predict the time evolution of the virus these plots also assist in selecting the models input parameters the term flattening the curve has rapidly become a rallying cry in the fight against covid-19 popularised by the media and government officials claims have been made that flattening the curve results in i reduction in the peak number of cases thereby helping to prevent the health system from being overwhelmed and ii in an increase in the duration of the pandemic with the total burden of cases remaining the same this implies that social distancing measures and management of cases with their devastating economic and social impacts may need to continue for much longer the picture which has been widely shown in the media is shown in fig 17a the idea presented in the media as shown in fig 17a is that by flattening the curve the peak number of infections will decrease however the total number of infections will be the same and the duration of the pandemic will be longer hence they concluded that by flattening the curve it will have a lesser impact upon the demands in hospitals figure 17b gives the scientific meaning of flattening the curve by governments imposing appropriate measures the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced and combined with isolating infected individuals will reduce the peak number of infections when this is done it actually shortens the time the virus impacts the society thus the second claim has no scientific basis and is incorrect what is important is reducing the peak in the number of infections and when this is done it shortens the duration in which drastic measures need to be taken and not lengthen the period as stated in the media and by government officials figure 17 shows that the peak number of infections actually reduces the duration of the impact of the virus on a community mathematical modelling theories are effective tools to deal with the time evolution and patterns of disease outbreaks they provide us with useful predictions in the context of the impact of intervention in decreasing the number of infected-susceptible incidence rates 30 31 32 in this work we have augmented the classic sir model with the ability to accommodate surges in the number of susceptible individuals supplemented by recorded data from china south korea india australia usa and the state of texas to provide insights into the spread of covid-19 in communities in all cases the model predictions could be fitted to the published data reasonably well with some fits better than others for china the actual number of infections fell more rapidly than the model prediction which is an indication of the success of the measures implemented by the chinese government there was a jump in the number of deaths reported in mid-april in china which results in a less robust estimate of the number of deaths predicted by the sir model the susceptible population dropped to zero very quickly in south korea showing that the government was quick to act in controlling the spread of the virus as of the beginning of june 2020 the peak number of infections in india has not yet been reached therefore the model predictions give only minimum estimates of the duration of the pandemic in the country the total cumulative number of infections and deaths the case study of the virus in australia shows the importance of including a surge where the number of susceptible individuals can be increased this surge can be linked to the arrival of infected individuals from overseas and infected people from the ruby princess cruise ship the data from usa is an interesting example since there are multiple epicentres of the virus that arise at different times this makes it more difficult to select appropriate model parameters and surges where the susceptible population is adjusted the results for texas show that the model can be applied to communities other than countries italy provides an example where there is excellent agreement between the published data and model predictions thus our sir model provides a theoretical framework to investigate the spread of the covid-19 virus within communities the model can give insights into the time evolution of the spread of the virus that the data alone does not in this context it can be applied to communities given reliable data are available its power also lies to the fact that as new data are added to the model it is easy to adjust its parameters and provide with best-fit curves between the data and the predictions from the model it is in this context then it can provide with estimates of the number of likely deaths in the future and time scales for decline in the number of infections in communities our results show that the sir model is more suitable to predict the epidemic trend due to the spread of the disease as it can accommodate surges and be adjusted to the recorded data by comparing the published data with predictions it is possible to predict the success of government interventions the considered data are taken in between january and june 2020 that contains the datasets before and during the implementation of strict and control measures our analysis also confirms the success and failures in some countries in the control measures taken strict adequate measures have to be implemented to further prevent and control the spread of covid-19 countries around the world have taken steps to decrease the number of infected citizens such as lock-down measures awareness programs promoted via media hand sanitization campaigns etc to slow down the transmission of the disease additional measures including early detection approaches and isolation of susceptible individuals to avoid mixing them with no-symptoms and self-quarantine individuals traffic restrictions and medical treatment have shown they can help to prevent the increase in the number of infected individuals strong lockdown policies can be implemented in different areas if possible in line with this necessary public health policies have to be implemented in countries with high rates of covid-19 cases as early as possible to control its spread the sir model used here is only a simple one and thus the predictions that come out might not be accurate enough something that also depends on the published data and their trustworthiness however as the model data show one thing that is certain is that covid-19 is not going to go way quickly or easily i am attaching herewith a copy of our manuscript

the receipt of the manuscript  title is the spread of covid-19 across countries influenced by environmental economic and social factors mohammad hossain alamgir  the sars-cov-2 virus emerged from wuhan china is spreading all over the world in an unprecedented manner causing millions of infection and thousands of deaths however the spread of the disease across countries and regions are not even why some countries and regions are more effected than some other countries and regions we employ simple statistical methods to investigate any linkage between severity of the disease and environmental economic and social factors of countries the estimation results indicate that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus infection is higher in countries with lower yearly average temperature higher economic openness and stronger political democracy however findings of this analysis should be interpreted carefully keeping in mind the fact that statistical relations do not necessarily imply causation only clinical experiments with medical expertise can confirm how the virus behaves in the environment  the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic started all on a sudden and has posed serious threat for the existence of normal human life the novel virus named afterward as sars-cov-2 belongs to highly pathogenic coronavirus family and causes severe acute respiratory disease covid-19 leading even to death for some cases 1  the speed of human-to-human transmission of the pathogen is unprecedented it has spread to most of the countries of the world within 4 months of its first known transmission to human and the number of infected people as well as the number of deaths caused by the virus is increasing every day till date the first human case of present outbreak of coronavirus is identified in wuhan the capital of hubei province of china in december 2019 12  though the virus is spreading many countries the speed and severity of spread vary country to country europe is badly affected than asia africa and south america though south korea thailand japan and singapore were affected immediately after china wide-spread infections were observed in italy and spain before those countries despite having political and economic connection and national borders with china myanmar and north korea report very few cases of infection other european countries and usa were also hit within a very short period nevertheless other asian african and south american countries are less affected till the beginning of april 2020 the uneven transmission mechanism to countries raises the question-what factors do influence the pathogen to spread is the virus attacking countries with lower temperature or higher precipitation or higher openness biological explanation can answer many questions related to transmission mechanism  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity

the disease at the initial stage of the pandemic as the virus continues to spread many countries any connection with badly effected countries may equally responsible for the transmission in other words level of international connection of a country is probably playing a vital role in country-tocountry transmission of the virus international trade alternatively economic openness can be treated as a good measure of international connection of a country thus economic openness is likely to play an important role in the spread of the disease if a country is more open the virus will find it easier to transmit from human to human by crossing national borders once the virus is in the rate of spread within a country will depend on several factors some of which are difficult to identify some though can be pointed out by educated guess population density level of urbanization social cohesiveness and weather conditions can be primarily identified as influential factors of human-to-human transmission of a pathogen viability of infectious viruses is found being affected markedly by environmental factors like temperature and humidity 3  social economic and environmental changes around

evidence that fear of economic penalties sometimes lead authorities to under-report epidemics 4  countries of autocratic rulers are reluctant to reveal exact or approximate number of cases as it may hamper their reign adversely moreover social cohesiveness is likely to be higher in free societies leading to possibilities of more infections of a highly pathogenic disease though democratization does not necessarily mean social cohesiveness or integrity it can be used as a proxy to assess how much the citizens of a society are involved in social activities if social activities are higher the chance of more infections are higher thus the level of democratization is a possible inducer of the number of cases of infection underlying factors influencing the present spread mechanism of

human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 occurs mainly through a close contact with patients of covid-19 or incubation carriers in a groundbreaking work published on 30 january 2020 riou and althaus 2020 apprehended that the spread of the novel virus will depend on two key properties first the reproduction number r0 average number of secondary cases by an infectious index case value of which is estimated as 22 greater than the threshold level 1 second the dispersion parameter of secondary cases k whose value is liable for super-spreading a low value of k would lead a steady growth of the epidemic though the outbreak appears to have started from a single or multiple zoonotic transmission in wuhan 10  the spread outside of china is clearly human-to-human transmission human-to-human transmission may be direct or indirect direct humanto-human transmission occurs because of close contact with a patient however the virus can stay in the environment for sometimes and can infect a susceptible person if get contacted this indirect human-to-human transmission is likely to depend on many factors including pathogenic characteristics and environmental factors this study aims to explore the effects of few environmental social and economic characteristics of countries on country-wise number of infection cases per one million people we hypothesize that number of infection cases

openness suggests that the more a country is involved in international trade ie export and import the more it is vulnerable to coronavirus infection this finding is plausible as more international trade bring forth more interaction with overseas people and pave the way for the viral infection in the same manner the positive sign of democracy index indicates that more democratic countries are affected more by the disease this is may be the result of the fact that the democracy index may imply social cohesiveness or social integration people are likely to be more involved in social activities and festivals in a country which is more democratic than a country ruled by an autocrat moreover autocratic rulers are generally reluctant to publish the actual figure of fatalities and try

coronavirus is quickly spreading and causes significant damage mimicking the spread of computer viruses within a network kindervag 2020 in the digital world it is common practice to design and incorporate solutions that can help overcome virus attacks for every new generation a new security layer is added to ensure the ever-mutating computer viruses do not harm the digital structure ahlefeldt 2020 could policymakers planners and architects inspired by the digital world learn from its cybersecurity to make our built environment more resistant to the virus could we design and build our cities to stop the virus from spreading if so could we install an antivirus-built environment ready to help in the protection from coronavirus or other pandemics infectious disease has already transformed our places through architecture design and urban planning previously many trends in architecture and urbanism that we see today were derived from similar measures taken before to ensure the health hygiene and comfort of urban residents our built environment has always exhibited the capacity to evolve after the crisis chang 2020 dejtiar 2020 muggah  ermacora 2020 this study encourages the search for suitable design ideas trends and planning theories to provide the required protection from virus attacks and continue to add more layers in the defense system of our built environment to cope with this pandemic professionals in architecture urban planning sectors and design agencies have already switched their focus to visualize the post-pandemic era however there is inadequate research conducted to imagine how the antivirus-built environment would look to address this gap this study reviews architecture and urban story developments from the past centuries we then review research areas affected by the covid-19 pandemic and highlight their related questions we then analyze the social distancing and quarantine as a design problem in the post-pandemic era subsequently some lessons learned from the pandemic are presented to visualize and introduce the studys vision about the antivirus-built environment in the 14th century the bubonic plague motivated the fundamental urban improvements of the renaissance cities cleared overcrowded living quarters expanded their margins developed early quarantine facilities and opened large public spaces in the 20th century infectious disease was one of the drivers of urban renewal modernist architects saw design as a cure to the sickness of overcrowded cities where tuberculosis typhoid polio and spanish flu breakouts encouraged urban planning slum clearance tenement reform and waste management chang 2020 lubell 2020 during the industrial era cholera and typhoid influenced the sanitary reform movement these epidemics contributed to developing water and sewage systems to fight the pathogens eventually leading to a sanitary innovation and required the streets to be straighter smoother and wider to install underground pipe systems furthermore the third plague pandemic in 1855 changed the design of everything from drainpipes to door thresholds and building foundations budds 2020 klaus 2020 wainwright 2020 the wipe-clean esthetic of modernism can be partially attributed to tuberculosis the modern architectural designs were inspired by an era of purity of form strict geometries modern materials and a rejection of ornamentation modernist architects designed these curative environments as cleansed physically and symbolically from disease and pollution beyond their esthetic appeal these features embodied modernist preoccupations with the healing effects of light air and nature these buildings included large windows balconies flat surfaces that would not collect dust and white paint emphasizing the appearance of cleanliness budds 2020 chang 2020 against this background the current health crisis should develop our built environment to increase the security layers that help to prevent the spread of infections and diseases in this context there are multiple areas of research needed regarding covid-19 when the world health organization who declared the fast-spreading covid-19 as a pandemic citizens around the globe hastened to go home this global pandemic significantly influenced our personal and professional lives and has a direct bearing upon the very foundations of urban planning and architecture theory and practice allam  jones 2020 haleem javaid vaishya  deshmukh 2020 saadat et al 2020 consequently the pandemic has led to questions of how architects and planners could present and install antivirus-related ideas or update the existing spaces as well as at what stage can the pandemic affect our physical and built environment to extend the scope of research needed from the academic community table 1
reviews certain required research areas affected by covid-19 and highlights their related questions professional and extensive research is required on all levels and scales in these areas to prevent the virus from spreading the answers to these questions could help in predicting the post-pandemic style and visualizing the required antivirus system since most humans spend most of their daily lives inside the built environment it is essential to understand the potential transmission dynamics of infection as individuals move through the built environment covid-19 can be transmitted both by air and via direct and indirect contact viral particles can be directly deposited on surfaces or suspended due to natural and mechanical airflow patterns or other sources of turbulence in the indoor environment dietz et al 2020 horve et al 2020 the who has prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 15 or 2 m about 6 feet to minimize the risk of infection however more recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over 2 m from an infected person bourouiba 2020 setti et al 2020 in addition oklahoma state university researchers simulated different environmental and movement conditions to see if a six-foot social distancing policy is enough their results indicate this policy is enough if the ambient air is static oklahoma state university 2020 other factors and wearing protective clothes affect the transmission dynamics of infection however who is continuously changing and updating all the mentioned distances based on the latest information and researches conducted by professionals the pandemic has brought a greater sense of appreciation for our homes people need houses that can effectively provide social isolation and offer protection from viruses and infections the expectation is that even after the quarantine period more people will work from home consequently the future of home design might change dejtiar 2020 kashdan 2020

transformation the density in offices might probably change and firms will not need more space because of work from home policies consequently high-rise buildings would become more expensive to build and become less efficient depending on how productive remote work proves to be in this pandemic it is hastening the shift from structured office environments to more flexible virtual and home-based work arrangements which could mean a reversal of the open-office trend and the search for better other natural ventilation and healthy design options alter 2020 muggah  ermacora 2020 regarding

to combat the spread of infection beggs et al 2000 kovach et al 2017 molla 2020 to accommodate work from home situations we could even reexamine old urban typologies many urban approaches might increase the protection and defense system of our cities and avoid high density and overcrowding policymakers and planners should use the current crisis to review planning theories and based on the results they should take a step back in searching about how past cities are structured 
expanding horizontally during a pandemic the human proximity of heavily populated cities poses further risks the larger the population the higher the concentration of covid-19 in cities regarding the impact of social distancing planners and architects might design according to expanding horizontally approaches with more available open spaces which could be essential to prevent the spread of infections and diseases liu 2020 novakovic 2020 
fewer density cities because social distancing measures are essential to the containment effort some have blamed the density of cities for the rapid spread of the infection and considered suburbs to be the safest places urbanization might take a step back to enhance villages and city suburbs particularly with the increased acceptance of digital transformation makhno 2020 nicola et al 2020 wainwright 2020 however the impacts of higher density on social interactions and sustainability are still controversial issues mousavinia pourdeihimi  madani 2019

shows the proposed vision about how nature and advanced technology approaches help in visualizing antivirus-built environments to stop the virus from spreading however selecting the best antivirus strategy depends on many factors posing new challenges to choose that could be used or planned as long-term reforms we must be proactive not reactive and continue to update this antivirus-enabled paradigm and install new approaches within its framework many questions still require further multidisciplinary studies this study does not present answers it originates insights for areas where future research will be critically required to update the proposed vision the proposed vision in this study does not have an expiration date when the covid-19 pandemic ended most of healthy architecture and urban approaches could be applicable to the pandemics to come we could imagine all housing buildings as self-sufficient independent and healthy neighborhoods and making smart use of the available technologies it is crucial to make urban areas more resilient to emergencies response to face epidemics and other possible future emergencies of every kind there is no end in sight to the covid-19 pandemic but it has helped us predict what post-pandemic architecture and urbanism might look like although we are not going to overhaul how we have been building architecture and cities before based on the current circumstances and emergency measures we should review our design strategies and planning theories we could more effectively use healthy design and planning strategies to face pandemics and create a less pullulated more sustainable architecture and urbanism in general moreover if we harnessed the security layers not only to prevent ever-mutating virus attacks but a healing approach that could be implemented in the post-pandemic era it could help build a sustainable environment therefore is this transformation in our physical and built environment a temporary reaction or the new normal with spread of the covid-19 pandemic additional questions will undoubtedly arise and additional security layers should be added to update an antivirus-enabled paradigm this study does not present answers it only provides insights for areas where future research will be critically required to extend the scope of research required based on the lessons learned from this crisis this study introduces a vision about the required antivirus-built environment that can be updated to stop the virus spreading or mitigate its impacts however selecting the best antivirus strategy depends on many factors such as the abilities and capabilities of each community and environment the global pandemic has highlighted the limitations of how we manage our built environment regarding how we should design build and run our built environment however it has given us a chance to learn nevertheless certain questions remain such as will we regard these unique lessons if so we should think more specifically about the benefits of this forced experimentation and implement further developments to select which could be used or planned as long-term reforms from a transformative viewpoint in this context the pandemic increased the requirement for policymakers planners and architects to think more out of the box trying to reshape our physical spaces and reset the existing build environment or develop more ideas to face future virus attacks these changes give us a glimpse at how our cities could change for the better and the worse in the long-term however it is too early to judge how responses to covid-19 will affect design and urbanism theories these results call for urgent efforts to further explore our built environment and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder this approach must be parallel to other sustainable approaches embracing not impinging natural resources and not harming our environment if we can manage that our present architecture and cities will continue to serve us well however the post-pandemic era will see multiple challenges that require a better understanding of covid-19 and its socioeconomic effects on society the future remains uncertain and thus future multidisciplinary studies are required the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest  a sir model assumption for the spread of covid-19 in different communities ian cooper argha mondal chris antonopoulos g  in this paper we study the effectiveness of the modelling approach on the pandemic due to the spreading of the novel covid-19 disease and develop a susceptible-infected-removed sir model that provides a theoretical framework to investigate its spread within a community here the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infectedremoved sir model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically to the contrary as we show herein it can be increased in surge periods in particular we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities represented by countries and the state of texas in the usa the sir model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of covid-19 by the sir model that we propose here as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions our analysis takes into account data from january to june 2020 the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures we propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of covid-19 and on the number of susceptible infected and removed populations until september 2020 by comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches we deduce that the spread of covid-19 can be under control in all communities considered if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease  in december 2019 a novel strand of coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan hubei province china causing a severe and potentially fatal respiratory syndrome ie covid-19 since then it has become a pandemic declared by world health organization who on march 11 which has spread around the globe 1 2 3 4 5  who published in its website preliminary guidelines with public health care for the countries to deal with the pandemic 6  since then the infectious disease has become a public health threat italy and usa are severely affected by covid-19 7 8 9  millions of people are forced by national governments to stay in self-isolation and in difficult conditions the disease is growing fast in many countries around the world in the absence of availability of a proper medicine or vaccine currently social distancing self-quarantine and wearing a face mask have been emerged as the most widely-used strategy for the mitigation and control of the pandemic in this context mathematical models are required to estimate disease transmission recovery deaths and other significant parameters separately for various countries that is for different specific regions of high to low reported cases of covid-19 different countries have already taken precise and differentiated measures that are important to control the spread of the disease however still now important factors such as population density insufficient evidence for different symptoms transmission mechanism and unavailability of a proper vaccine makes it difficult to deal with such a highly infectious and deadly disease especially in high population density countries such as india 10 11 12  recently many research articles have adopted the modelling approach using real incidence datasets from affected countries and have investigated different characteristics as a function of various parameters of the outbreak and the effects of intervention strategies in different countries respective to their current situations it is imperative that mathematical models are developed to provide insights and make predictions about the pandemic to plan effective control strategies and policies 13 14 15  modelling approaches 8 16 17 18 19 20 21 are helpful to understand and predict the possibility and severity of the disease outbreak and provide key information to determine the intensity of covid-19 disease intervention the susceptible-infected-removed sir model and its extended modifications 22 23 24 25  such as the extended-susceptible-infected-removed esir mathematical model in various forms have been used in previous studies 26 27 28 to model the spread of covid-19 within communities here we propose the use of a novel sir model with different characteristics one of the major assumptions of the classic sir model is that there is a homogeneous mixing of the infected and susceptible populations and that the total population is constant in time in the classic sir model the susceptible population decreases monotonically towards zero however these assumptions are not valid in the case of the spread of the covid-19 virus since new epicentres spring up around the globe at different times to account for this the sir model that we propose here does not consider the total population and takes the susceptible population as a variable that can be adjusted at various times to account for new infected individuals spreading throughout a community resulting in an increase in the susceptible population ie to the so-called surges the sir model we introduce here is given by the same simple system of three ordinary differential equations odes with the classic sir model and can be used to gain a better understanding of how the virus spreads within a community of variable populations in time when surges occur importantly it can be used to make predictions of the number of infections and deaths that may occur in the future and provide an estimate of the time scale for the duration of the virus within a community it also provides us with insights on how we might lessen the impact of the virus what is nearly impossible to discern from the recorded data alone consequently our sir model can provide a theoretical framework and predictions that can be used by government authorities to control the spread of covid-19 in our study we used covid-19 datasets from 29 in the form of time-series spanning january to june 2020 in particular the time series are composed of three columns which represent the total cases i d tot  active cases i d and deaths d d in time rows these datasets were used to update parameters of the sir model to understand the effects and estimate the trend of the disease in various communities represented by china south korea india australia usa italy and the state of texas in the usa this allowed us to estimate the development of covid-19 spread in these communities by obtaining estimates for the number of deaths d susceptible s infected i and removed r m populations in time consequently we have been able to estimate its characteristics for these communities and assess the effectiveness of modelling the disease the paper is organised as following in sec 2 we introduce the sir model and discuss its various aspects in sec 3 we explain the approach we used to study the data in 29 and in sec 4 we present the results of our analysis for china south korea india australia usa italy and the state of texas in the usa section 5 discusses the implications of our study to the flattening the curve approach finally in sec 6 we conclude our work and discuss the outcomes of our analysis and its connection to the evidence that has been already collected on the spread of covid-19 worldwide the world around us is highly complicated for example how a virus spreads including the novel strand of coronavirus sars-cov-2 that was identified in wuhan hubei province china depends upon many factors among which some of them are considered by the classic sir model which is rather simplistic and cannot take into consideration surges in the number of susceptible individuals here we propose the use of a modified sir model with characteristics based upon the classic sir model in particular one of the major assumptions of the classic sir model is that there is a homogeneous mixing of the infected i and susceptible s populations and that the total population n is constant in time also in the sir model the susceptible population s decreases monotonically towards zero these assumptions however are not valid in the case of the spread of the covid-19 virus since new epicentres spring up around the globe at different times to account for this we introduce here a sir model that does not consider the total population n  but rather takes the susceptible population s as a variable that can be adjusted at various times to account for new infected individuals spreading throughout a community resulting in its increase thus our model is able to accommodate surges in the number of susceptible individuals in time whenever these occur and as evidenced by published data such as those in 29 that we consider here our sir model is given by the same simple system of three ordinary differential equations odes with the classic sir model that can be easily implemented and used to gain a better understanding of how the covid-19 virus spreads within communities of variable populations in time including the possibility of surges in the susceptible populations thus the sir model here is designed to remove many of the complexities associated with the real-time evolution of the spread of the virus in a way that is useful both quantitatively and qualitatively it is a dynamical system that is given by three coupled odes that describe the time evolution of the following three populations 1 susceptible individuals st these are those individuals who are not infected however could become infected a susceptible individual may become infected or remain susceptible as the virus spreads from its source or new sources occur more individuals will become infected thus the susceptible population will increase for a period of time surge period furthermore it is assumed that the time scale of the sir model is short enough so that births and deaths other than deaths caused by the virus can be neglected and that the number of deaths from the virus is small compared with the living population based on these assumptions and concepts the rates of change of the three populations are governed by the following system of odes what constitutes our sir model where a and b are real positive parameters of the initial exponential growth and final exponential decay of the infected population i it has been observed that in many communities a spike in the number of infected individuals i may occur which results in a surge in the susceptible population s recorded in the covid-19 datasets 29  what amounts to a secondary wave of infections to account for such a possibility s in the sir model 1 can be reset to s surge at any time t s that a surge occurs and thus it can accommodate multiple such surges if recorded in the published data in 29  what distinguishes it from the classic sir model the evolution of the infected population i is governed by the second ode in system 1 where a is the transmission rate constant and b the removal rate constant we can define the basic effective reproductive rate r e  astb as the fate of the evolution of the disease depends upon it if r e is smaller than one the infected population i will decrease monotonically to zero and if greater than one it will increase ie if dit thus the effective reproductive rate r e acts as a threshold that determines whether an infectious disease will die out quickly or will lead to an epidemic at the start of an epidemic when r e  1 and s  1 the rate of infected population is described by the approximation dit dt  a  b it and thus the infected population i will initially increase exponentially according to it  i0 e abt  the infected population will reach a peak when the rate of change of the infected population is zero ditdt  0 and this occurs when r e  1 after the peak the infected population will start to decrease exponentially following it  e bt  thus eventually for t   the system will approach s  0 and i  0 interestingly the existence of a threshold for infection is not obvious from the recorded data however can be discerned from the model this is crucial in identifying a possible second wave where a sudden increase in the susceptible population s will result in r e  1 and to another exponential growth of the number of infections i the data in 29 for china south korea india australia usa italy and the state of texas communities are organised in the form of time-series where the rows are recordings in time from january to june 2020 and the three columns are the total cases i d tot first column number of infected individuals i d second column and deaths d d third column consequently the number of removals can be estimated from the data by since we want to adjust the numerical solutions to our proposed sir model 1 to the recorded data from 29  for each dataset community we consider initial conditions in the interval 0 1 and scale them by a scaling factor f to fit the recorded data by visual inspection in particular the initial conditions for the three populations are set such that s0  1 ie all individuals are considered susceptible initially is the maximum number of infected individuals i d  consequently the parameters a b f and i d max are adjusted manually to fit the recorded data as best as possible based on a trial-and-error approach and visual inspections a preliminary analysis using non-linear fittings to fit the model to the published data 29 provided at best inferior results to those obtained in this paper using our trial-and-error approach with visual inspections in the sense that the model solutions did not follow as close the published data what justifies our approach in the paper a prime reason for this is that the published data including those in 29 we are using here are data from different countries that follow different methodologies to record them with not all infected individuals or deaths accounted for in this context s i and r m  0 at any t  0 system 1 can be solved numerically to find how the scaled by f  susceptible s infected i and removed r m populations what we call model solutions evolve with time in good agreement with the recorded data in particular since this system is simple with well-behaved solutions we used the first-order euler integration method to solve it numerically and a time step h  2005000  004 that corresponds to a final integration time t f of 200 days since january 2020 this amounts to double the time interval in the recorded data in 29 and allows for predictions for up to 100 days after january 2020 obviously what is important when studying the spread of a virus is the number of deaths d and recoveries r in time as these numbers are not provided directly by the sir model 1 we estimated them by first plotting the data for deaths d d vs the removals r d m  where r d m  d d  r d  i d tot  i d and then fitting the plotted data with the nonlinear function where d 0 and k are constants estimated by the non-linear fitting the function is expressed in terms of only model values and is fitted to the curve of the data thus having obtained d from the non-linear fitting the number of recoveries r can be described in time by the simple observation that it is given by the scaled removals r m from the sir model 1 less the number of deaths d from eq 3 the rate of increase in the number of infections depends on the product of the number of infected and susceptible individuals an understanding of the system of eqs 1 explains the staggering increase in the infection rate around the world infected people traveling around the world has led to the increase in infected numbers and this results in a further increase in the susceptible population 14  this gives rise to a positive feedback loop leading to a very rapid rise in the number of active infected cases thus during a surge period the number of susceptible individuals increases and as a result the number of infected individuals increases as well for example as of 1 march 2020 there were 88 590 infected individuals and by 3 april 2020 this number had grown to a staggering 1 015 877 29  understanding the implications of what the system of eqs 1 tells us the only conclusion to be drawn using scientific principles is that drastic action needs to be taken as early as possible while the numbers are still low before the exponential increase in infections starts kicking in for example if we consider the results of policies introduced in the uk to mitigate the spread of the disease there were 267 240 total infections and 37 460 deaths by 27 may and in the usa 1 755 803 and 102 107 total infections and deaths respectively thus even if one starts with low numbers of infected individuals the number of infections will at first grow slowly and then increase approximately exponentially then taper off until a peak is reached comparing these results for the uk and usa with those for south korea where steps were taken immediately to reduce the susceptible population there were 11 344 total infections and 269 deaths by 27 may the number of infections in china reached a peak about 16 february 2020 the government took extreme actions with closures confinement social distancing and people wearing masks this type of action produces a decline in the number of infections and susceptible individuals if the number of susceptible individuals does not decrease then the number of infections just gets increased rapidly as at this moment there is no effective vaccine developed the only way to reduce the number of infections is to reduce the number of individuals that are susceptible to the disease consequently the rate of infection tends to zero only if the susceptible population goes to zero here we have applied the sir model 1 considering data from various countries and the state of texas in the usa provided in 29  assuming the published data are reliable the sir model 1 can be applied to assess the spread of the covid-19 disease and predict the number of infected removed and recovered populations and deaths in the communities accommodating at the same time possible surges in the number of susceptible individuals figures  1-17 show the time evolution of the cumulative total infections i tot  current infected individuals i recovered individuals r dead individuals d and normalized susceptible populations s for china south korea india australia usa italy and texas in the usa respectively the crosses show the published data 29 and the smooth lines solutions and predictions from the sir model the cumulative total infections plots also show a curve for the initial exponential increase in the number of infections where the number of infections doubles every five days the figures also show predictions and a summary of the sir model parameters in 1 and published data in 29 for easy comparisons we start by analysing the data from china and then move on to the study of the data from south korea india australia usa italy and texas the number of infections peaked in china about 16 february 2020 and since then it has slowly decreased the decrease only occurs when the susceptible population numbers decrease and this decrease in susceptible numbers only occurred through the drastic actions taken by the chinese government china quarantined and confirmed potential patients and restricted citizens movements as well as international travel social distancing was widely practiced and most of the people wore face masks the actual numbers of infections have decreased at a greater rate than predicted by the sir model see figs 1 and 2  our results in figs 1 and 2 provide evidence that the chinese government has done well in limiting the impact of the spread of covid-19 from the plots shown in figs 3 and 4  it is obvious that the south korean government has done a wonderful job in controlling the spread of the virus the country has implemented an extensive virus testing program there has also been a heavy use of surveillance technology closed-circuit television cctv and tracking of bank cards and mobile phone usage to identify who to test in the first place south korea has achieved a low fatality rate currently one percent without resorting to such authoritarian measures as in china the most conspicuous part of the south korean strategy is simple enough implementation of repeated cycles of test and contact trace measures  to match the recorded data from india with predictions from the sir model 1 it is necessary to include a number of surge periods as shown in fig 5  this is because the sir model cannot predict accurately the peak number of infections if the actual numbers in the infected population have not peaked in time it is most likely the spread of the virus as of early june 2020 is not contained and there will be an increasing number of total infections however by adding new surge periods a higher and delayed peak can be predicted and compared with future data in fig 5  a consequence of the surge periods is that the peak is delayed and higher than if no surge periods were applied the model predictions for the 30 september 2020 including the surges are 330 000 total infections 700 active infections and 7 500 deaths whereas if there were no surge periods there would be 130 000 total infections 700 active infections and 6 300 deaths with the peak of 60 000 which is about 40 of the current number of active cases occuring around 20 may 2020 thus the model can still give a rough estimate of future infections and deaths as well as the time it may take for the number of infections to drop to safer levels at which time restrictions can be eased even without an accurate prediction in the peak in active infections see figs 5 and 6 a surge in the susceptible population was applied in early march 2020 in the country the surge was caused by 2 700 passengers disembarking from the ruby princes cruise ship in sydney and then returning to their homes around australia more than 750 passengers and crew have become infected and 26 died two government enquires have been established to investigate what went wrong also at this time many infected overseas passengers arrived by air from europe and the usa the australian government was too slow in quarantining arrivals from overseas from mid-march 2020 until mid-may 2020 the australian governments introduced measures of testing contact tracing social distancing staying at home policy closure of many businesses and encouraging people to work from home from figs 7 and 8 it can be observed that actions taken were successful as the actual number of infections declined in accord with the model predictions there have been no further surge periods from end of may 2020 these restrictions are being removed in stages the sir model can be used when future data becomes available to see if the number of susceptible individuals starts to increase if so the model can accommodate this by introducing surge factors  as of early june 2020 the peak number of infections has not been reached when a peak in the data is not reached it is more difficult to fit the model predictions to the data in the model it is necessary to add a few surge periods this is because new epicentres of the virus arose at different times the virus started spreading in washington state followed by california new york chicago and the southern states of the usa the need to add surge periods shows clearly that the spread of the virus is not under control in the usa by the end of may 2020 the number of active infected cases has not yet peaked and the cumulative total number of infections keeps getting bigger this can be accounted for in the sir model by considering how the susceptible population changes with time in may during that time to match the data to the model predictions surge periods were used where the normalized susceptible population s was reset to 02 every four days what is currently happening in the usa is that as susceptible individuals become infected their population decreases with these infected individuals mixing with the general population leading to an increase in the susceptible population this is shown in the model by the variable for the susceptible population s varying from about 006 to 020 repeatedly during may until this vicious cycle is broken the cumulative total infected population will keep growing at a steady rate and not reach an almost steady-state the fluctuating normalized susceptible variable provides clear evidence that government authorities do not have the spread of the virus under control see figs 9 and 10 the plots in figs 11 and 12 show that the peak in the total cumulative number of infections has not been reached as early as june however the peak is probably not far away if there are no surges in the susceptible population then one could expect that by late september 2020 the number of infections will have fallen to very small numbers and the virus will have been well under control with the total number of deaths in the order of 2 000 in mid-may 2020 some restrictions have been lifted in the state of texas the sir model can be used to model some of the possible scenarios if the early relaxation of restrictions leads to increasing number of susceptible populations if there is a relatively small increase in the future number of susceptible individuals no series impacts occur however if there is a large outbreak of the virus then the impacts can be dramatic for example at the end of june 2020 if s was reset to 08 s  08 a second wave of infections occurs with the peak number of infections occurring near the end of july with the second wave peak being higher than the initial peak number of infections subsequently the number of deaths will rise from about 2 000 to nearly 5 000 as shown in figs 13 and 14 if governments start lifting their containment strategies too quickly then it is probable there will be a second wave of infections with a larger peak in active cases resulting to many more deaths figure 15 shows clearly that the peak of the pandemic has been reached in italy and without further surge periods the spread of the virus is contained and number of active cases is declining rapidly the plots in panels a b in fig 16 are a check on how well the model can predict the time evolution of the virus these plots also assist in selecting the models input parameters the term flattening the curve has rapidly become a rallying cry in the fight against covid-19 popularised by the media and government officials claims have been made that flattening the curve results in i reduction in the peak number of cases thereby helping to prevent the health system from being overwhelmed and ii in an increase in the duration of the pandemic with the total burden of cases remaining the same this implies that social distancing measures and management of cases with their devastating economic and social impacts may need to continue for much longer the picture which has been widely shown in the media is shown in fig 17a  the idea presented in the media as shown in fig 17 a is that by flattening the curve the peak number of infections will decrease however the total number of infections will be the same and the duration of the pandemic will be longer hence they concluded that by flattening the curve it will have a lesser impact upon the demands in hospitals figure 17b gives the scientific meaning of flattening the curve by governments imposing appropriate measures the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced and combined with isolating infected individuals will reduce the peak number of infections when this is done it actually shortens the time the virus impacts the society thus the second claim has no scientific basis and is incorrect what is important is reducing the peak in the number of infections and when this is done it shortens the duration in which drastic measures need to be taken and not lengthen the period as stated in the media and by government officials figure 17 shows that the peak number of infections actually reduces the duration of the impact of the virus on a community mathematical modelling theories are effective tools to deal with the time evolution and patterns of disease outbreaks they provide us with useful predictions in the context of the impact of intervention in decreasing the number of infected-susceptible incidence rates 30 31 32  in this work we have augmented the classic sir model with the ability to accommodate surges in the number of susceptible individuals supplemented by recorded data from china south korea india australia usa and the state of texas to provide insights into the spread of covid-19 in communities in all cases the model predictions could be fitted to the published data reasonably well with some fits better than others for china the actual number of infections fell more rapidly than the model prediction which is an indication of the success of the measures implemented by the chinese government there was a jump in the number of deaths reported in mid-april in china which results in a less robust estimate of the number of deaths predicted by the sir model the susceptible population dropped to zero very quickly in south korea showing that the government was quick to act in controlling the spread of the virus as of the beginning of june 2020 the peak number of infections in india has not yet been reached therefore the model predictions give only minimum estimates of the duration of the pandemic in the country the total cumulative number of infections and deaths the case study of the virus in australia shows the importance of including a surge where the number of susceptible individuals can be increased this surge can be linked to the arrival of infected individuals from overseas and infected people from the ruby princess cruise ship the data from usa is an interesting example since there are multiple epicentres of the virus that arise at different times this makes it more difficult to select appropriate model parameters and surges where the susceptible population is adjusted the results for texas show that the model can be applied to communities other than countries italy provides an example where there is excellent agreement between the published data and model predictions thus our sir model provides a theoretical framework to investigate the spread of the covid-19 virus within communities the model can give insights into the time evolution of the spread of the virus that the data alone does not in this context it can be applied to communities given reliable data are available its power also lies to the fact that as new data are added to the model it is easy to adjust its parameters and provide with best-fit curves between the data and the predictions from the model it is in this context then it can provide with estimates of the number of likely deaths in the future and time scales for decline in the number of infections in communities our results show that the sir model is more suitable to predict the epidemic trend due to the spread of the disease as it can accommodate surges and be adjusted to the recorded data by comparing the published data with predictions it is possible to predict the success of government interventions the considered data are taken in between january and june 2020 that contains the datasets before and during the implementation of strict and control measures our analysis also confirms the success and failures in some countries in the control measures taken strict adequate measures have to be implemented to further prevent and control the spread of covid-19 countries around the world have taken steps to decrease the number of infected citizens such as lock-down measures awareness programs promoted via media hand sanitization campaigns etc to slow down the transmission of the disease additional measures including early detection approaches and isolation of susceptible individuals to avoid mixing them with no-symptoms and self-quarantine individuals traffic restrictions and medical treatment have shown they can help to prevent the increase in the number of infected individuals strong lockdown policies can be implemented in different areas if possible in line with this necessary public health policies have to be implemented in countries with high rates of covid-19 cases as early as possible to control its spread the sir model used here is only a simple one and thus the predictions that come out might not be accurate enough something that also depends on the published data and their trustworthiness however as the model data show one thing that is certain is that covid-19 is not going to go way quickly or easily  a physicist view of the airborne infection luis anchordoqui a eugene chudnovsky m  naturally produced droplets from humans such as those produced by breathing talking sneezing and coughing include several types of cells eg epithelial cells and cells of the immune system physiological electrolytes contained in mucous and saliva eg na   k   cl   as well as potentially several infectious agents eg bacteria fungi and viruses in response to the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 epidemic which has become a major public health issue worldwide we provide a didactic overview of airborne germ transmission as seen from a physics perspective we also provide a recommendation that could help to slow down the spread of the virus  to understand and prevent the spread of a virus like sars-cov-2 it is important to estimate the probability of airborne transmission as aerosolization with particles potentially containing the virus although there have been reports favoring the possibility of creating coronavirus aerosols 1  thus far no aerosolized coronavirus particles have been found in searches within the hospital rooms of sars-cov-2 patients 2  in this brief report we provide an overview on the possible threat of sars-cov-2 airborne infection from a physics point of view in the presence of air resistance compact heavy objects fall to the ground quickly while light objects exhibit brownian motion and follow the pattern of turbulent convection of the air for aerosol particles containing the virus the boundary between these two behaviors depends on the size of the particle we begin with a simple question how long does a virus float in the air under the influence of gravity to answer this query we model the virus as a sphere of radius r  90 nm and mass m  25  10 19 kg 3  and we assume that this spherical particle is suspended in a viscous fluid the air feeling the earths gravitational field herein gravity tends to make the particles settle while diffusion and convection act to homogenize them driving them into regions of smaller concentration on the one hand the convection mechanism provides particle macro-mixing within the fluid through the tendency of hotter and consequently less dense material to rise and colder denser material to sink under the influence of gravity on the other hand the diffusion mechanism acts on the scale of an individual particle micro-mixing slowly and randomly moving through the media under the action of gravity the virus acquires a downward terminal speed that follows from stokes law and is given by where g 98 ms 2 is the acceleration due to gravity and is the virus mobility in the fluid and where   18  10 5 kgms is the dynamic viscosity of air 4  sub- 2 into 1 we find that the downward terminal speed of the virus in dry air is indeed negligible v down  8  10 8 ms it is therefore clear that gravity plays no role in the motion of an isolated virus through the air rather it follows a convection pattern in a manner similar to how smelly substances move through the air the survival probability of the virus in the dry air is then given by the likelihood of survival outside its natural environment the half-life of sars-cov-2 in aerosols has been found to be about 11 hours 1  we have seen that the coronavirus can go airborne staying suspended in the air however the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets produced mostly while sneezing and coughing then to ascertain whether airborne transmissible sars-cov-2 can survive and stay infectious in aerosols we must double-check that the falling time of a droplet from a height of about two meters is larger than its evaporation time scale to this end we assume that the drops are also spherical and hence the mass can be simply estimated as where   997 kgm 3 is the density of water and r the droplet radius for large droplets whose diameters 1000 m the effect of air resistance is negligible and so the falling time can be directly estimated using newtons equations for gravitational settling for smaller droplets whose diameters  100 m the falling times must instead be determined using the downward terminal speed given in 1 straightforward exercise to show that the time for falling 2 m in saturated air is 06 s for droplets with r  500 m 60 s for those of r  50 m 600 s about 10 minutes for those of r  5 m and 60000 s about 166 hours for those of r  05 m the droplet evaporation time scale as computed by wells using droplet evaporation data collected by whytlaw-gray and patterson is shown in table i 5  the assumption of pure water droplets in unsaturated air at 18  c was used for the evaporation calculations such that the theoretical droplets are capable of complete evaporation by direct comparison of the droplet evaporation and falling times we can conclude that somewhere between 100 and 200 m lies the droplet size ie the diameter which identifies droplets of mouth spray that reach the ground within the life of the droplet as against droplets that evaporate and remain in the air as droplet-nuclei with attached sars-cov-2 infection several investigations have been carried out to continue improving the precision of wells analyses and to study the various external environmental such as temperature and humidity factors that may alter his estimates see eg 6  the sizes of the droplets and droplet-nuclei produced by sneezing and coughing were studied by the microscopic measurement of 12000 droplet stain-marks found on slides exposed directly to mouth-spray and of 21000 stain-containing droplet-nuclei recovered from the air on to oiled slides exposed in the slit sampler 7  from this data sample it was found that the original diameters of respiratory droplets ranged from 1 to 2000 m and that 95 were between 2 and 100 m and that the most common were between 4 and 8 m this suggest that in principle droplet-spray could drive direct airborne infection of sars-cov-2 the spread of a sneeze in the air has been studied by ultrafast imaging at mit 8 9  it was found that even the largest droplets from a sneeze can float in the air for up to 10 minutes which allows them to reach the far end of a large room this points towards convection in the air being the primary mechanism of the spread of the infection from the physics point of view we cannot find a good justification for a stationary 6-feet separation in a situation when people spend long time together in a room droplets containing the virus move in the air via convection the convection pattern in a room can be very complex see fig 1  it depends on the location of air conditioners radiators windows and all items in the room as well as on people producing vortices by moving around the existing vortices in the air can make a location far away from the source of droplets more dangerous than the location 6 feet away this applies to meeting rooms office spaces supermarkets department stores etc the airflow pattern should be studied for all such facilities to avoid the spread of infection to large distances from a single infected person the safest rooms must be those equipped with the air sucking ventilator at the top like hospital surgery rooms 11  the theoretical and computational techniques and resources used in this research were supported by the us national science foundation nsf grant phy-1620661 laa

briefly reviewed interpretation and applications of feline coronavirus antibody tests are described and general recommendations are provided for practitioners some of the major unresolved questions regarding coronavirus infections of cats are delineated  the coronaviruses are a large and widely distributed family of single-stranded ribonucleic acid viruses and are important causes of respiratory and enteric disease vasculitis serositis hepatitis and encephalomyelitis in several avian and mammalian species siddell et al 1983  feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev of swine canine coronavirus ccv and human respiratory-tract coronaviruses of the 229e group together comprise an antigenic cluster of closely-related viruses within the coronaviridae family pedersen ward  mengeling 1978  in fact the major structural polypeptides of fipv tgev and ccv are so similar antigenically that some regard these three agents as host-range mutants rather than as individual viral species horzinek lutz  pedersen 1982  in domestic and exotic cats fipv is the aetiologic agent of a lethal disease-feline infectious peritonitis fip-characterized by fibrinous serositis vasculitis and formation of disseminated pyogranulomas wolfe  griesemer 1966  montali  strandberg 1972 hayashi et al 1977  serosal membranes liver kidneys omentum lungs eyes and central nervous system are commonly affected the pathology is the result of complex immunologically mediated phenomena involving arthus-like antigen-antibody-complement interactions across vessel walls jacobse-geels daha  horzinek 1980  1982 pedersen  boyle 1980 weiss dodds  scott 1980 weiss  scott 1981a-c hayashi lshida  fujiwara 1982  recent studies have shown that some cats with either naturally or experimentally-acquired serum coronavirus antibody experience a more rapid fulminating disease course following fipv exposure than do coronavirus antibody-negative cats receiving the same challenge dose pedersen  boyle 1980 weiss dodds  scott 1980 weiss  scott 1981a-c  a potential state of antibody-mediated hypersensitivity thus exists in certain coronavirus antibodypositive cats challenged with fipv with this antibody perhaps 1 accelerating the uptake of fipv in the form of immune complexes into reticuloendothelial and polymorphonuclear cells and 2 promoting widespread destructive inflammatory reactions in blood vessel walls and tissues through immune complex deposition and complement activation jacobse-geels daha  horzinek 1980 pedersen  boyle 1980 weiss dodds  scott 1980 weiss  scott 1981a-c hayashi et al 1983a hayashi et al  1984  uptake of fipv into macrophages appears to be enhanced by impaired t lymphocyte function hayashi et al 1983b  in addition to fipv cats are susceptible to natural infection with certain enteric coronaviruses which may or may not be variants of fipv pedersen et al 1981 mckiernan et al 1981 dea roy  elazhary 1982  these feline enteric coronaviruses fecvs can produce a range of effects from asymptomatic infection of the gastrointestinal tract to severe enteritis in kittens and adult cats the nature of the relationship between fecvs and fipv is perhaps illuminated by the observation that certain fipv strains are capable of producing either fip or enteritis or both hayashi et al  1983a  intestinal lesions can also be produced in newborn pigs by oral inoculation with virulent fipv woods cheville  gallagher 1981  it is thus possible that fecvs and fipv represent pathogenetic rather than host-range variants of a single coronavirus typevariants possessing however a relatively broad spectrum of virulence from asymptomatic infection to enteritis to lethal disseminated fip barlough 1984b  reports indicate that at least two other coronaviruses in the fipv antigenic cluster can infect cats under experimental conditions tgev which produces an asymptomatic infection and is excreted in faeces for as long as three weeks post-exposure reynolds  garwes 1979  and ccv which also produces an asymptomatic infection and is excreted from the oropharynx for at least one week stoddart baldwin  scott 1984  at present the frequency of infection of cats in nature with these two coronaviruses is not known coronavirus 229e of human beings does not appear to replicate to any extent in experimentally-inoculated cats barlough 1984a  in fip hypersensitization by coronavirus antibody is dependent upon the identity of the coronaviruses that originally incited the antibody response thus antibody arising from exposure to fipv or fecvs can hypersensitize weiss dodds  scott 1980 pedersen  boyle 1980 pedersen et al 1981 weiss  scott 1981a-c  while antibody resulting from exposure to tgev ccv or coronavirus 229e usually does not witte et al 1977 woods  pedersen 1979 barlough 1984a barlough et af 1984b stoddart baldwin  scott 1984  however some sensitization due to a tgev strain apparently occurred in one report toma et al 1979  it should be emphasized at this point that the mere presence of coronavirus antibody in an animals serum does not mean that fip will ever develop in that animal in the future even after repeated fipv exposure fip is a relatively uncommon disease in nature even in crowded cattery situations the vast majority of coronavirus antibody-positive cats will never develop it the factors that determine whether fip does develop following fipv exposure are multiple probably including dose and virulence of infecting virus strain route of exposure age and immune status at time of exposure possibly genetic predisposition concurrent viral infections eg feline leukaemia virus and adverse environmental influences such as stress and overcrowding scott weiss  hoshino 1979 barlough  weiss 1983  the route by which fipv is spread in nature is still unknown however it is most likely that initial infection results from ingestion andor inhalation of the virus virus is probably excreted into the environment by a number of routes in oral and respiratory secretions faeces and possibly urine close contact between cats usually is required for effective transmission of fipv although the possibility of virus transmission in excreta and by other indirect methods on clothing bedding feeding bowls etc also exists the potential for transmission by haematophagous arthropods is unknown transmission across the placenta to the developing foetus although suggested in the past flagstad  larsen 1976 pastoret  henroteaux 1978  has not yet been conclusively proven to occur in common with many other enveloped viruses fipv is quite unstable once outside its host and is rapidly inactivated by many common detergents and disinfecting agents such as sodium hypochlorite bleach pedersen 1976 barlough  weiss 1983  the clinical diagnosis of fip is made by evaluation of history and presenting signs and the results of supportive laboratory procedures  clinicopathologic and serologic procedures important in diagnosis include analysis of thoracic and abdominal effusion viscous opaque straw-coloured to yellow specific gravity 1017 to 1047 protein 5 to 10 gdl variable cell numbers high fibrin content haemogram clinical chemistry profile serum protein electrophoresis hypergammaglobulinaemia serum coronavirus antibody titre and biopsy when possible it is important to remember that a biopsy is the only test procedure that can be used to definitively diagnosis fip in the living animal explortory laparotomy with organ punch biopsy of affected tissues especially liver spleen omentum and mesenteric lymph node is the preferred technique for collection of biopsy samples percutaneous needle biopsy cannot be recommended owing to the friability of diseased organs and the potential for serious haemorrhage similarly complete necropsy examination with histologic evaluation of suitable tissues will provide a reliable diagnosis after death any diagnosis of fip made in the absence of biopsy or necropsy examination must be considered presumptive this is because of the large number of potential fip look-alike diseases that can affect cats these can include lymphosarcoma and other tumours especially those involving the liver biliary tract kidneys or lungs cardiomyopathy pyothorax chylothorax septic peritonitis hepatitis internal abscessation diaphragmatic hernia pansteatitis toxoplasmosis cryptococcosis and tuberculosis barlough  weiss 1983  thus in individual cases clinicopathologic and serologic procedures will assist in ruling out possible diagnoses but only biopsy or necropsy examination will definitively identify the fip disease process laboratory test procedures for detection of coronavirus antibody in feline sera include biological assays such as virus neutralization vn non-biological immunochemical techniques such as indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and kinetics-based elisa kela and other methods such as agar gel immunodiffusion and passive haemagglutination  though the availability of such tests varies worldwide either fipv itself or one of the other coronaviruses in the fipv antigenic cluster usually tgev or ccv can be used as the target antigen in most of these assays the use of non-fipv coronaviruses in antibody-testing procedures has become popular in recent years because of long-standing difficulties in routinely propagating fipv in the laboratory in general the immunochemical tests especially the ifa have gained the greatest popularity among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in part because of their relative ease of performance and widespread availability of the pertinent immunotechnologies it has been proposed on the basis of serosurvey data that most fipv infections in nature result only in seroconversion without progression to lethal disseminated fip  this is because serum coronavirus antibody can be found not only in cats with fip but also in many healthy cats and in many cats with other diseases indicating that exposure of cats to coronaviruses is much more widespread than was once believed in the general healthy feline population-excluding cats in catteries and multiple-cat householdsapproximately 10 to 40 per cent of cats will have positive coronavirus antibody titres note positive refers only to the presence of antibody not to the presence of the fip disease process a special situation is encountered when cats are clustered together in catteries in which case positive titres are either completely absent ie there has been no coronavirus exposure or are present in 80 to 90 per cent of the cats within a household indicating efficient spread of virus once it has been introduced the occurrence of coronavirus antibody in a cattery does not necessarily correlate with its fip history eg antibody has been found in healthy cats in catteries that have experienced death losses to fip as well as in catteries that have never lost a cat to fip most cats with histopathologically confirmed fip have serum coronavirus antibody often of high titre  because many cats with undiagnosed illnesses also have elevated titres indicating previous coronavirus exposure interpretation of their titres may be difficult added complexity has been contributed to interpretation of coronavirus antibody titres in healthy cats and in cats with undiagnosed illnesses by the finding that other coronaviruses eg fecv and experimentally tegv and ccv can also infect cats and generate coronavirus antibodv in their sera because these viruses are all serologically cross-reactive with each other and with fipv and because several of them are used relatively interchangeably in commercially available coronavirus antibody tests the non-specificity of these tests is readily apparent the serodiagnostic potential of these assays ie their ability to identify cats with active fip andor potential virus carriersexcretors is thus limited not only by the widespread distribution of serum coronavirus antibody in the feline population but also by the possibility that non-fipv coronaviruses may be responsible for some of the seroconversions that they detect the actual distribution of antibodies in the general feline population to each of these coronaviruses is therefore unknown and will remain unknown until highly specific assays capable of differentiating antibody against one coronavirus eg fipv from antibody against another eg tgev are developed these difficulties are compounded further by the plethora of test procedures ie ifa vn elisa kela employed by different laboratories and by the absence of standardization of testing protocols results are therefore best interpreted in the light of specific information provided by the testing laboratory utilized on the significance of titre levels generated by the individual test that it performs effect of recent vaccination recent research has shown that antibody against bovine serum components can be found in the serum of certain cats-antibody capable of reacting with antigenically similar bovine serum components present in cell cultures used to propagate target viruses for immunochemical assays such as the ifa elisa and kela  because such serum components can adhere tightly to both cells and virus johansson bergquist  grandien 1976 kraaijeveld madge  macnaughton 1980  reactivity against them can be mistaken for a coronavirus antibody response unless feline serum samples are tested in parallel against uninfected cell culture control preparations  one possible explanation for the presence of this reactivity is routine vaccination owing to the frequent presence of extraneous cell culture material in many partially purified commercial biologicals routine parenteral vaccination would seem to provide an ideal opportunity for vaccinees to respond immunologically not only to vaccine virus but also to immunogenic elements of cell culture medium such as bovine serum proteins bonin schmidt  schmidt 1973 johansson bergquist  grandien 1976 tizard 1982 barlough et al  1984a barlough et al  1985 snyder eernisse  erickson 1983  kela studies have shown that this reactivity dissipates with time and that the probability of encountering it can be minimized if serum samples for elective serotesting are drawn no sooner than three to four months following the most recent parenteral vaccination  the presence of serum coronavirus antibody in any cat whether healthy or diseased is indicative of only one thing previous exposure to a coronavirus in the fipv antigenic group a positive coronavirus antibody titre while consistent with a clinical diagnosis of fip does not indicate that a cat actually has fip because many healthy cats and many cats with other diseases are also coronavirus antibody-positive neither however does a positive titre indicate that a cat is protected against fip because most cats with fip also are coronavirus antibody-positive considering that fip occurs only sporadically in the general feline population and that most cats in fip-problem households are coronavirus antibody-positive and yet do not contract fip it would appear that many cats perhaps most cats with coronavirus antibody are protected against the natural disease the question remains whether it is coronavirus antibody that actually confers this protection or whether unrecognized cellular immunologic factors are involved it is especially important to realize that present-day coronavirus antibody tests have absolutely no predictive value ie a positive titre in no way indicates that a cat is doomed to develop fip at some uncertain future date despite all the problems with current feline coronavirus antibody testing methods there are still some select situations in which determination of antibody titres can be of benefit to the veterinary surgeon and to the cat owner   i  as a screening test to determine the presence or absence of antibody in a previously untested household and to detect potential virus carriersexcretors when introducing new cats into coronavirus antibody-negative households based on our current understanding of feline coronaviral serology screening would appear to be the major use for coronavirus antibody testing today screening of cats in a household experiencing undiagnosed disease problems may be especially useful only about 10 to 20 per cent of the cats a minimum of three in such a household need to be tested because antibody will be either totally absent or present in 80 to 90 per cent of the animals scott weiss  hoshino 1979  while the discovery of coronavirus antibody-positive cats in such households will not diagnose the problem knowledge that coronavirus antibody is absent may be helpful in ruling out an fipv-group coronavirus as the aetiologic culprit 2 as an aid and nothing more than an aid in the clinical diagnosis of a diseased cat with signs suggestive of fip a coronavirus antibody titre determination should be given no more weight than any of the other routine procedures used in arriving at a clinical diagnosis a positive titre will not diagnose fip but a negative titre will usually rule it out coronavirus antibody-negative fip cases a very small percentage of cats with fip do not have detectable coronavirus antibody in their sera several explanations for this phenomenon are possible  1 detectable antibody may sometimes disappear from the circulation during the terminal stages of the disease submission of serum from some moribund cats thus may result in a negative titre determination despite the presence of disseminated fip barlough 1983  2 immune-complexing is an important immunopathologic feature of fip in certain cases if extensive immune complexing is present at the time of testing it is conceivable that there may be little free unbound coronavirus antibody available to be detected this cloaking effect may in fact be the explanation at least in part for the absence of detectable antibody in the serum of some moribund cats 3 the swiftness of the fip disease process is an important factor especially in animals without previous coronavirus exposure cats experiencing a peracute disease course such as some young kittens may display a rather sluggish antibody response that can be more difficult to detect in the earlier stages especially if a non-fipv coronavirus tgev ccv is used by the laboratory for antibody detected although serologically cross-reactive with fipv these viruses nevertheless are different from fipv and thus are not as sensitive as fipv at detecting lower levels of specific anti-fipv antibody a test-and-removal programme for coronavirus antibody-positive cats similar to that utilized for feline leukaemia virus-positive cats based upon current scientific information cannot be recommended scott 1979 barlough  weiss 1983  because there is no available serodiagnostic test that can differentiate between antibody-positive cats with fip antibody-positive cats with diseases other than f1 p or fip-immune seropositive cats that can specifically identify antibodypositive cats that are excreting fipv or that can even identify the exact coronaviruses against which the antibodies in seropositive cats were raised there is no known medical reason for destroying these animals there is no recognized environmental reservoir of fipv the natural reservoir is assumed to be infected cats how then does the virus maintain itself in these animals for how long do infected cats harbour the virus for how long do they excrete the virus and by what routes what route is most important for effective virus transmission to other cats is excretion continuous or intermittent is it possibly stress-related what percentage of cats infected with fipv actually become chronic carriers to what extent is a coronavirus antibody-positive cat a potential disease threat to other cats with which it may come into contact can an infected queen infect her kittens in utero if so does in utero infection result in disease clearly further research will be required before these questions and others can be satisfactorily resolved importantly an antigen detection test for identifying carrier animals that are excreting fipv similar to those currently available for feline leukaemia virus infection is urgently needed so that rational flpv control procedures can be devised until then control must be based on isolation of cats with suspected fip and maintenance of coronavirus antibody-negative catteries when possible euthanasia of coronavirus antibody-positive cats to achieve this latter purpose however cannot be justijied this work was supported by unrestricted contributions to the cornell

at the turn of the twenty-first century
 public health officials began to notice an increase in the number of human infections with highly pathogenic avian h5n1 influenza virus originating from birds in close proximity to people the possibility of influenza pandemics is always a concern but this zoonotic jump seemed particularly worrisome because the case fatality rate cfr was approximately 60 fortunately the virus did not acquire mammalian transmissibility and there were no confirmed examples of human-to-human spread nevertheless there was great concern that if the virus did acquire human transmissibility and maintained such a high cfr the world could face a public health emergency of unprecedented danger for comparison the cfr during the 1918 influenza epidemic  which many believe to be the worst influenza pandemic in history was approximately 25 another development in the mid-2000s was the creation in the usa of the national science advisory board for biosecurity nsabb whose charge was to advise the us government on so-called dual-use problem in biomedical research research being performed with beneficial goals in mind but the results of which could be misused for nefarious purposes the nsabb delved into the dual-use controversy early in its tenure when the us government asked it to review the paper describing the reconstruction of the influenza virus strain responsible for the 1918 epidemic 1 although the nsabb voted to recommend publication the editor of science made it clear that the journal would have published the article irrespective of the nsabb vote unless the paper was classified 2 for the next half decade the nsabb struggled with the problem of how to deal with dual-use research in the biological sciences and proposed identifying a small subset of science known as dual-use research of concern or durc as that domain on which to focus efforts while the nsabb was formulating durc definitions and devising recommendations two laboratories set out to experimentally test whether h5n1 virus could become transmissible in what is thought to be the best animal model for such studies the ferret research groups led by yoshi kawaoka in the usa and ron fouchier in the netherlands took similar approaches albeit with different starting strains first engineering the ability of the virus to bind to human receptors and then serially passaging it through ferrets both obtained the same answer the h5n1 virus could attain the ability to be transmitted via respiratory droplets they wrote manuscripts and submitted them for publication in nature and science respectively 3 4 in late 2011 the nsabb had the opportunity to evaluate its policies and recommendations when the us government learned of the two submitted manuscripts describing these high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses hpaiv  that had been made mammalian transmissible it asked the nsabb to advise it whether publication was wise given potential biosecurity concerns the details of the deliberations of the nsabb and its ultimate decision to recommend publication have been described in detail elsewhere but briefly the nsabb determined that the benefits of the research outweighed the biosecurity risks 5 hence the first round of the controversy was focused primarily on biosecurity issues after the 2012 decision on the two influenza papers the situation quieted for a couple of years until a series of biosafety lapses at us government laboratories at the cdc and the nih received rekindled interest on the problem these laboratory incidents received a high degree of public attention spearheaded by the reporting of alison young at usa today this conjunction of laboratory accidents together with additional follow-up publications eg 6 puts the h5n1 story in a new light namely whether similar experiments in which new phenotypes are added to pathogens gain-of-function gof studies could be conducted safely and whether they should be pursued at all confronted with a public outcry combined with a serious scientific debate on the benefits and risks of gof-type experiments in 2014 the nih which has administrative responsibility for the nsabb imposed a moratorium on us-funded gof experiments with pathogens of pandemic potential ppp those being influenza virus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus mers-cov  while sars-cov had disappeared from the human population due to a highly successful public health containment endeavor the mers-cov outbreak had emerged in the middle east and was and still is ongoing at the time the us government also charged the nsabb with making recommendations about the future of gof research httpswwwphegovs3dualusedocumentsgain-of-functionpdf we have summarized the events of 2014 in a series of papers and those details will not be recounted here 7 8 instead our focus will be to make the case for the scientific and moral value of gof-type research provided that it can be conducted safely hence the second round of the controversy was focused less on biosecurity and intentional release and almost entirely on biosafety we have previously argued that the h5n1 experiments and similar gof studies provide benefits at many levels from the practical to the epistemological 9 10 some tangible benefits of gof studies involving influenza virus includethe results of gof experiments can be definitive for example the 2012 gof studies showing that hpaiv could acquire the capacity for mammalian transmissibility established that these influenza viruses had the biological capacity to emerge as a contagious human pathogen prior to these studies it was not clear whether the absence of human transmissibility in the isolated cases of hpaiv was a result of a biological limitation in the ability of the virus to be mammalian transmissible or just a stochastic effect such that the necessary mutations had not occurred the 2012 gof studies unequivocally established the capacity of these hpaiv for mammalian transmission which in turn implies pandemic potential to our knowledge there are no other experiments or analysis that could have provided such definitive information hence these experiments provide a warning to humanity of the dangers posed by these hpaiv strains and suggest that similar dangers lurk in other influenza strains in this regard similar experiments have shown that h7n1 has the capacity of mammalian transmissibility 11 extending the threat horizon to h7 virusesthe results of gof experiments can inform on important biological questions for example gof experiments yielded mutants that when analyzed showed that higher and lower ph optima for the hemagglutinin were associated with enhanced virulence in birds and mammals respectively 12 this information is important for knowing how influenza viruses jump from birds to humans which is a critical step in the emergence of new pandemic strainsgof experiments can be used to produce new viral strains to improve vaccine production one of the hurdles in vaccine preparation is the adaptation and growth of vaccination strains in eggs for efficient production gof-type of experiments can be used to identify mutations that facilitate replication of influenza strains in eggs and this information could facilitate vaccine production 13
 are there other claimed benefits that have been derived from the h5n1 studies at the time of publication the authors and others argued that the results would inform surveillance efforts and vaccine development it is unclear to us how much surveillance has benefitted although the mutation information has been used in monitoring 14 15 as we and others have pointed out there is a danger of focusing on the exact mutations discovered in the ferret experiments because there may be other genetic routes to human transmissibility 10 some have noted that by the time such mutations have been detected in avian populations it might be too late to stop the spread due to the relative rates with which we can identify those mutations using current technology and the rate of spread of influenza virus 16 17 increased awareness of the threat of h5n1 however must certainly have led to better isolation of patients who have been exposed to the virus in this regard it seems reasonable to assume that any onward transmission of an avian strain would occur largely in the healthcare setting as has been the case with sars-cov and mers-cov and rapid intervention could prevent a widespread outbreak while monitoring the mutations discovered in the laboratory from gof experiments is not sufficient to predict dangers from environmental isolates it is important to note that while both groups obtained viruses with different mutations they both achieved similar phenotypes of enhanced stability of the ha protein  as our ability to predict phenotype from genotype improves this becomes increasingly important a big caveat to overstating the importance of this however is the contribution of epistasis to any given phenotype for example the same mutations identified by the fouchier group when introduced into a different h5n1 background yielded a different ha phenotype 18 this implies that insights gained from one set of mutations in one strain are unlikely to be generalizable to other strains given sequence differences hence with the hindsight of half a decade of work since the original controversy in 2012 it appears that gof-type experiments are very informative with regard to big questions such as whether mammalian virulence and transmissibility potential exists in hpaiv but may be less useful in making fine-scale molecular predictions as mentioned above in 2014 the us government mandated a moratorium on gof-type experiments involving ppp such as influenza mers-cov and sars-cov  to the best of our knowledge us-supported experiments to examine changes in transmission of avian influenza viruses have largely stopped the fouchier lab did publish a follow-up report to their original science manuscript in which they narrowed down the exact mutations that enabled transmission in the ferret model but based on the publication date it appears that this work was completed prior to the moratorium 19 in the mers-cov field the development of a small animal model that faithfully reproduces human transmission and disease has been slowed significantly by the moratorium mers-cov uses the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 protein as a receptor and the human and murine proteins differ enough such that the virus cannot use the mouse molecule transgenic mice that express human dpp4 ubiquitously experience a broader set of symptoms than do humans when infected with wild-type mers-cov 2023 this problem was recently overcome by developing a transgenic mouse expressing a mutant dpp4 in which two key amino acids were mutated from the mouse allele to the human allele however the authors still needed to passage the virus through these transgenic mice to derive a gof variant that recapitulated human disease 24 this gof virus was subsequently used to show the efficacy of a promising nucleotide prodrug originally initially developed for ebola virus for treating mers 25 continuing efforts to produce a mouse-adapted mers-cov in wild-type mice have been prohibited 26 r baric personal communication the question remains how does society at large and the scientific community and regulatory agencies in particular weigh the risks and benefits the difficulty lies largely in trying to apply quantitative risk assessment measures to the problem the benefits of all biological research not just gof research often do not make themselves apparent until years or even decades after the experiments are performed on the other hand the risks even when theoretical manifest themselves in the present when the experimentation is done fortunately we have not had real examples of laboratory accidents leading to significant morbidity or mortality the 1977 reintroduction of h1n1 into human circulation has been attributed to a laboratory mishap although not all agree since other explanations are possible 2729 as discussed below some authorities have presented worst-case scenarios based on hypothetical calculations whereas others have used similar types of data to come up with numbers at the extreme opposite end of the spectrum arguing that the likelihood of such events is extremely low perhaps the greatest benefit of this controversy has been an increased attention to biosafety when working with dangerous pathogens in 2014 the nih proposed a biosafety stewardship month as a means to promote increased attention to biosafety and many institutions took advantage of this opportunity indeed while it can be misleading to draw strong conclusions from the absence of events the types of events that found their way into the news media earlier in this decade seem to have decreased significantly another benefit of the controversy was that it has stimulated efforts to gain comparable information in systems that do pose the same biosafety or biosecurity risks as working on the wild-type virus for example a recent study reporting that only three mutations were needed to switch h7n9 tropism to human cells was performed using an attenuated virus 30 the first concern is the potential for misuse of any information or product generated by gof research by bad actors the worry here is that once the results of gof studies are published bad actors could replicate the work for nefarious purposes such as a terrorist attack such concerns were expressed for example in connection with the aforementioned 2012 publication of studies of engineered avian flu virus transmissibility in ferret models 5 3 4 as noted above the question whether to permit publication was considered by the nsabb which eventually allowed publication judging that the risk of misuse was outweighed by the potential benefits this is neither the first nor the last occasion on which questions have been raised about the risks of dual-use research with examples ranging far beyond biomedical research to include such technologies as unmanned aerial vehicles being used as weapons and hacking being used for the stuxnet cyberattack cyberwarfare tools can be used to enhance national security by disarming opponents while at the same time finding employment in crime such as occurred recently when the leaked national security agency code was used in spring 2017 for global ransomware attacks such misuse of gof research is certainly possible but one serious problem in an ethical evaluation of possible misuse is the difficulty of estimating the likelihood and potential impact of misuse one can imagine numerous different scenarios involving everyone from major state actors and non-state terrorist organizations to freelance mischief-makers working in a home basement lab there is no way to quantify over so many possibilities let alone to assay systematically the effects that such a diverse array of actors might achieve the misuse concern is further complicated by the fact that the cost and complexity of using relevant tools such as crisprcas9  continues to decline making ever easier the replication of even unpublished research indeed the risks of the democratization of crisprcas9 technology go well beyond gof research and there has been a call for a much more concerted international public debate about monitoring and possibly regulating access to some of those tools see 31 given these difficulties what is the responsible way for gof researchers to proceed with respect to potential misuse this is a place where prudence might be a better guide than cost-benefit analysis thus one notes that for the researchers own safety gof research with especially dangerous pathogens must be done in labs with very high biosafety standards at least biosafety level bsl -3 that means that except for the rare suicidal individual such research will only be feasible in countries with the necessary biosafety facilities and protocols and the list of such facilities today includes mostly nations with proven records of responsible research conduct nations which also have the technical expertise to conduct such research entirely on their own of course one could imagine a nation like north korea aspiring to a bioweapon capability and as they have demonstrated with their successes in offensive cyber operations ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons there is no lack of technical talent in north korea for all of these reasons the risk of publication of gof research related to misuse of biotechnology seems to have receded from the forefront of concern in addition the scientific publishing community is much more aware of these issues and many journals have instituted internal reviews for papers that include durc eg 32 33 the more prominent worry today is about accidently unleashing the very kind of global pandemic that one was seeking to prevent a number of critics have argued that the risk of inadvertently creating a global pandemic through accidental release of an engineered human-transmissible pathogen with high virulence and case fatality rate vastly outweighs any benefits that might be obtained from such research eg 34 thus one source claims a 001 to 01 probability per year of research in a bsl-3 lab of an accidental release of highly transmissible influenza virus that would kill between 200000 and 16 million people 35 36 if this is a reliable estimate thats a scary prospect on the other hand one of the authors of the original h5n1 studies has calculated the risks to be much much lower 37 given a claimed risk on that high a scale how shall we think about the balance between benefit and risk first we must ask some tough questions about the risk analysis itself many factors go into such an analysis including historical data on accidental exposure in bsl-3 and bsl-4 labs and simulation studies of disease spread after accidental exposure we consider each of these factors separately to date only one reasonably sophisticated simulation study for the spread of a potentially pandemic influenza virus has been reported 38 this is the study cited by lipsitch and inglesbsy 35 36 the researchers who conducted the simulation study had to make many assumptions about such variables as virulence case fatality rate latency time demographics geography response capabilities of public health authorities and monitoring of lab personnel for symptoms of exposure the simulation model was robust against variations in many of these parameters but there were considerable differences in outcome with some variations such as early detection of initial exposure still on the whole the numbers are grim with the right combination of factors it is theoretically possible for an accidental release to wreak havoc that brings us to the question of how probable such a catastrophic event is and the science of risk-benefit analysis the other major component of the risk calculationthe chance of accidental exposure or releaseis generally estimated on the basis of historical data which with its foibles is far less robust the spate of accidents in us bsl-3 labs a few years ago rightly aroused concern among experts but also generated in the public mind a perception of risk that might not accurately represent the current state of affairs after more stringent monitoring and review procedures were implemented the annual rate of accidental exposure today could easily be ten to one hundred times smaller than it appeared to be in 2013 of course 200000 to 16 million deaths per lab year is still reason for worry but then there are other factors to consider the reported accidental exposures aggregate data on all organisms that require high levels of biosafety containment none of those cases involved gof research and given the attention being paid to gof by comparison with research on say natural pathogens it is not at all clear that we can reasonably extrapolate from the historical data on accidental exposure to the risk of accidental exposure or release in gof research there are still deeper problems with a cost-benefit approach to assess the ethics of gof research first assessing the risk of accidental release and an attendant global pandemic is only one small part of a more comprehensive cost-benefit analysis which must always compare the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action proponents of gof research argue that it can play a crucial role in preventing or lessening the effects of a global pandemic by enabling mitigation factors such as early detection and the rapid development of vaccines one obvious additional risk then is the risk of a global pandemic that might have been prevented or mitigated by continuing gof research that risk is even more difficult to quantify than the risk of pandemic through accidental release still it must be part of a comprehensive analysis and since its major consequence eg a global pandemic is just as severe as a pandemic caused by accidental release such a scenario would loom just as large as the accidental release scenario in a thorough cost-benefit analysis another deep problem with conventional cost-benefit analyses is that they usually do not include the intrinsic benefit of new knowledge 9 one might think that knowledge is something too ephemeral to be quantified or one might argue that if knowledge counts as a benefit it does so only through the consequences of such knowledge for human flourishing which means that it does enter our calculations indirectly though measures of the costs and benefits of human health and human suffering one does not want to indulge uncritically in the mantra of knowledge for knowledges own sake a trope that has too often been used to justify research but the fact remains that on the whole increased knowledge brings increased ability to promote the good and to mitigate suffering new knowledge can always be used for evil ends but how we use that knowledge is a moral choice and if we dont have that knowledge in the first place then we cannot use it for the good exactly how new knowledge will contribute to future human flourishing in a complex and rapidly changing technical and social world is usually unforeseeable at the time when the new knowledge is first generated technology ethicist shannon vallor dubs this the problem of technosocial opacity 39 thus it would seem impossible to include the long-term effects of new knowledge production in a cost-benefit analysis of the research generating that knowledge the only way to fairly assess the benefits of such research is to put a premium on knowledge production per se how to do that is the hard problem and that difficulty must be added to the list of reasons suggesting that cost-benefit analysis is a seriously limited tool for policymaking about scientific research perhaps the deepest problem with the cost-benefit approach to policymaking is what we have termed elsewhere the apocalyptic fallacy 40 imagining an unintentional global pandemic as one possible outcome of gof research is tantamount to assigning infinite negative utility to such research in a cost-benefit analysis thus it makes no difference how low the probability of such an outcome might be infinite negative utility multiplied by any finite probability totally swamps every other term in a cost-benefit analysis meaning that no imagined benefits of alternative courses of action however great excepting eternal salvation for all of humankind can make a difference in the calculation what this means is that cost-benefit analysis is effectively useless in such settings at least with regard to the moral assessment of something like gof research if cost-benefit analysis is the epitome of reason and rationality in policymaking then reason fails us in cases where the risks include the extermination of a significant fraction of all human life nevertheless there is still value in risk analysis as the above-cited simulation study of disease spread after accidental exposure and release amply demonstrates a careful risk analysis can point us toward those factors that are critical for minimizing risk such as enhanced biosafety protocols and rapid public health responses but when promoted to the public and policymakers as forecasting a doomsday scenario such analyses risk inducing panic that overwhelms practical reason similarly comparisons of the risks of gof research to the events leading to the development of the nuremberg code do not serve a useful purpose in the discussion 34 the use of the word nuremberg connotes an association with war crimes that is simply inappropriate for use in a rational discussion about experiments that are ostensibly being done by well-meaning scientists trying to prepare humanity for confronting a potential pandemic although we are well aware that the nuremberg code and the war crimes of the high echelons of the nazi hierarchy are very different things the problem lies in the symbolism of the phrase and how it may be perceived by the public we urge that it not be used and in fact it is possible to discuss these important principles without invoking the name of the city with its historical baggage if cost-benefit analysis is not the optimal tool for policymaking with respect to gof research what is earlier we mentioned the virtue of simple prudence in thinking about dual-use research and technology perhaps that is the answer here as well technology ethicists have given the name precautionary principlepolicymakers prefer sophisticated names like thisto the homespun idea of prudence but prudence is really a simple idea familiar to us all it means think before you act and do not act if you are not sufficiently secure in thinking that you will do more good than harm thinking before acting should include risk analysis in settings such as gof research but a risk analysis is not the end of clear thinking it is only the beginning where does this leave us one major conclusion is this for almost every form of human activity there is a nonvanishing probability of catastrophic outcomes any casual individual act could set in motion a chain of events that would lead to the rise of the next world war this is highly improbable but possible and the consequences would be cataclysmic outweighing any imaginable good that might derive from that action therefore the precautionary principle would suggest that we do nothing but doing nothing can equally well engender a sequence of events leading to human extinction we conclude therefore one should act this dilemma highlights a fatal contradiction lurking within any attempt to rationally assess actions that might entrain consequences with infinite negative utility via cost-benefit analysis how otherwise should we proceed this is not a hard question think about both risks and benefits take obvious precautions and then make the prudent choice with enhanced biosafety protocols and improvements in the public health response we should not ban gof research but monitor it the relevant research communities should insist upon stringent norms for the conduct of the research and in safety protocols provided that these conditions are met there is no obvious reason why gof type of experimentation should not go forward  covid-19 and pets when pandemic meets panic nicola parry m a   on december 31 2019 china alerted the world health organization to a cluster of unusual cases of pneumonia that were diagnosed in wuhan in hubei province china although the cause at that time was unknown the patients symptoms and clinical features were most suggestive of a viral etiology on january 7 2020 officials reported that they had isolated the causative agent behind the cases-a novel coronavirus 1 2 3  the name of this novel virus evolved quickly to its now official designation as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 with coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 becoming the official name of the disease caused by the virus 3  global spread of the virus has been rapid and the covid-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 worldwide more than 1 million cases of sars-cov-2 infection have now been confirmed and more than 51000 people have died of covid-19 4 the animal welfare impact and while the pandemic has resulted in devastating consequences for health systems and economic stability throughout the world it has also had undesirable but perhaps not surprising ramifications for animal welfare in particular for veterinary and animal welfare professionals the wave of fear among the general public is of great concern with respect to how this pandemic will affect pets at the original epicenter of the outbreak in wuhan many residents were forced to leave behind their pets when authorities evacuated people from their homes reports suggest that owners left enough food and water to last their pets for a few days until they hoped to be able to return home again but now more than 6 weeks later many owners still have not returned home animal welfare organizations in china estimate that in hubei alone tens of thousands of cats and dogs have been left behind facing starvation and death 5  concern also rapidly emerged among pet owners and the general public in late february 2020 when a dog in hong kong tested positive for the novel coronavirus this was considered to be the first known case of potential human-to-animal sars-cov-2 transmission 6  the 17-year-old male pomeranian was tested after his owner developed covid-19 although the dog had no clinical signs he was taken to a nearby animal quarantine facility where oral nasal and rectal swab specimens were collected from him for sars-cov-2 testing the oral and nasal swabs returned weak positive results additional swab specimens were collected from the dog on two further occasions over the next five days and they again tested weak positive the dog remained under mandatory quarantine at the facility for 14 days before returning home nevertheless despite having no signs of clinical illness the dog died just 2 days after returning home the cause of death remains unknown because the owner did not consent to post-mortem examination however given the dogs elderly age and because he reportedly had underlying health conditions experts believe it is unlikely that his death was related to the positive sars-cov-2 test result 7 8 9  this first case sparked fears among the public resulting in acts of animal abuse by people who believed that pets might start to spread the virus to people one group known as the urban construction administration announced it would kill cats and dogs found outdoors to prevent transmission of sars-cov-2 and even officials in hunan and zhejiang provinces announced they would begin killing pets that were found in public 5  the hong kong society for the prevention of cruelty to animals issued a statement to inform the public that there is no evidence to show that pets can transmit the virus to people and warning people against compromising animal welfare 5  but this did little to calm peoples fears and panic among pet owners and the general public has also spread globally anecdotal reports have been widespread in the media and on social media about an increase in the number of pets being abandoned at this time while many owners fear their animals might transmit sars-cov-2 to them others also now find themselves unemployed and unable to afford to care for a pet 10  on the positive side with many people now finding themselves isolated at home during the pandemic rates of pet adoptions and fosters at many shelters have also markedly risen-often cancelling out or markedly exceeding the high rates of abandonment this is good news for people and pets who now get to enjoy the great advantages of the human-animal bond during this unique time of great need inevitably however some experts worry that many of these pets will be returned to the shelter when life eventually returns to a new normal 10 11 12  the origin of sars-cov-2 one common factor linking some of the first patients that were diagnosed with covid-19 in wuhan was a history of visiting or working at the local huanan seafood market this was also reported to be a wet market that dealt in the sale of various live animals 1 2 3  because of this many experts have suggested that the disease in humans originated via initial animal-to-human spread of the novel virus the sars-cov-2 has been genetically identified and sequenced and shown to be related to other similar known coronaviruses that circulate among bats such as the sars coronavirus and the mers coronavirus 13  so bats are considered to be the most likely natural reservoir of this novel coronavirus however the first case of covid-19 in wuhan occurred in a patient who had no link to the seafood market 1  also bats are reported to be rare in markets in china 14  although the sars-cov-2 may theoretically transmit directly from bats to humans the evidence so far suggests it more likely spreads indirectly through another animal playing the role of an intermediate host to transmit the virus to humans although an intermediary animal species has not yet been definitively identified it could have been one of the wild live animal species sold at the seafood market in wuhan the idea of this novel virus emerging at the animal-human interface is not a new concept zoonotic diseases with a wildlife reservoir have long been recognized as a significant public health problem indeed up to three-quarters of infectious diseases that emerge in humans are known to be zoonotic 15  the events that facilitate emergence of new zoonotic diseases and their geographical spread are complex and affected by multiple factors at multiple levels including those related to the pathogen environment humans and animals although we still have much to learn about sars-cov-2 a complexity of animal human and environmental factors have inevitably played a critical role in its emergence 16  as such a one health approach will eventually be critical as part of the response to this emerging infectious disease traditionally veterinary professionals have treated animals medical professionals have treated people and ecologists have taken care of the environment however recognizing the complex interconnectedness of the health of animals humans and the environment the one health approach eliminates this fragmented strategy instead it uses a collaborative multisectoral and transdisciplinary approach-working at the local regional national and global levels engaging professionals across many disciplines such as veterinary human and environmental health 17  as such it aims to improve public health outcomes by understanding and preventing risks that arise at the interface between animals humans and their environments 16  what about the pets that have tested positive for sars-cov-2 so far despite more than 1 million people around the world having tested positive for the virus only 4 cases have been reported in which pets have apparently tested positive for sars-cov-2 these have involved 2 dogs and 2 cats in all 4 cases the animals owners were sick with covid-19 and are believed to be the most likely source of transmission of the virus to their pets although neither of the 2 dogs showed any clinical signs one of the cats did have signs of illness shortly after the pomeranian in hong kong tested positive for sars-cov-2 in march 2020 a second dog in hong kong also tested positive for the virus after the second dogs owner a 30-year-old woman was diagnosed with covid-19 her 2 dogs were sent to the quarantine facility for testing oral and nasal swabs from one of them a german shepherd dog tested positive for the virus however swabs collected from the second a mixed breed dog tested negative 7 18  in late march 2020 health officials in belgium reported that a cat from lige province had also tested positive for sars-cov-2 about 1 week after its owner was diagnosed with covid-19 unlike the 2 dogs that tested positive for the virus the cat did show signs of illness including diarrhea vomiting and difficulty breathing 19  samples of vomit and feces from the cat were tested at the faculty of veterinary medicine of the university of lige and genetic tests showed high levels of sars-cov-2 in those samples according to dr daniel desmecht the cat reportedly recovered after 9 days 19  on march 31 officials in hong kong reported that a cat was being kept in quarantine after testing positive for sars-cov-2 via oral nasal and rectal swabs this cats owner had also been diagnosed with covid-19 however the cat had no clinical signs of illness 20  so far for the 4 pets in hong kong and belgium the available clinical and diagnostic information is incomplete but based on what we know at this stage from the media accounts there is no definitive evidence to suggest that any of the animals were actually infectious by all accounts real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr tests were used to detect sars-cov-2 in the 4 pets however it is important to remind pet owners and members of the general public that just because a sample from a pet tests positive using this method this is not necessarily synonymous with the pet being infectious and in the cases of these 4 pets we also do not have enough information to know whether they were even truly infected with the virus although rt-pcr is a highly sensitive testing method a positive result indicates only the presence of viral nucleotides in the sample however it does not indicate how those viral particles ended up in the sample in the first place so it does not tell us whether the virus actually infected the animals in which case the viral particles could be a breakdown product of the infection or whether viral nucleotides were present in the samples because the animals merely came into direct contact with the virus perhaps by licking either their sick owners or contaminated surfaces in the home thus the positive rt-pcr results in these pets do not necessarily indicate the presence of viable virus that was infectious and could potentially have put other people or animals at risk of sars-cov-2 infection so overall we must be careful to avoid overinterpreting the positive results in these pets certainly in the case of the cat in belgium if the owner consents to serologic testing this may prove helpful to indicate a previous sars-cov-2 infection by detecting the presence of sars-cov-2-specific antibodies however the presence of these antibodies still would not necessarily prove that the sars-cov-2 infection had resulted in the cats clinical signs interestingly although not a pet a female malayan tiger at the wildlife conservation societys bronx zoo in new york city also tested positive for sars-cov-2 on april 5 officials believe the source of the virus was a zookeeper who was actively shedding virus the animal was one of several tigers and lions who showed signs of a dry cough however because of the need for general anesthesia to collect diagnostic samples from these big cats this tiger was the only one of the animals with clinical signs that was tested for the virus 21  again at this stage the significance of this positive result in this tiger and its association with the animals clinical signs remain unclear although the cat in belgium had diarrhea vomiting and difficulty breathing this constellation of clinical signs isnt enough to suggest that the cat had full-blown covid-19 or even true sars-cov-2 infection these clinical signs are relatively nonspecific and can arise in cats in association with various nonspecific and specific conditions in fact one confounding factor in the cats case is the fact that other coronaviruses do affect cats coronaviruses represent a large family of viruses the coronaviridae that can cause a variety of diseases of differing severity in animals as well as in humans these viruses are well established in different animal species as causes of a range of conditions that predominantly affect the gastrointestinal tract respiratory system and nervous system 22  coronaviruses are well recognized as causes of disease in cats feline enteric coronavirus fecv is a ubiquitous enteric virus in the cat population and although it is highly contagious and commonly infects cats via feco-oral transmission it typically produces either no clinical signs or only mild diarrhea however in a small percentage of cats fecv undergoes mutation to produce feline infectious peritonitis fip virus this mutant variant of fecv is responsible for causing fip a devastating and lethal systemic infection that is considered to be one of the most significant infectious diseases in cats 23  in dogs canine respiratory coronavirus crcov affects the respiratory system typically contributing as one of many pathogenic organisms to cause canine infectious respiratory disease cird also widely known as kennel cough infection with crcov is usually associated with mild self-limiting clinical signs that typically are nonspecific and include dry cough sneezing and nasal discharge however infection with this virus can potentially progress to pneumonia in some cases and has been associated with outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in dogs in shelters and boarding facilities 24 25  another distinct coronavirus canine coronavirus ccov affects the gastrointestinal tract in dogs and can cause gastroenteritis that may range in severity from mild to severe disease enteric infection in dogs is usually self-limiting and typically produces either no clinical signs or only mild enteritis 26  in contrast to this ccov which shows only enteric tropism a pantropic pathogenic variant of ccov has also been described in association with an outbreak of fatal systemic disease in puppies aged approximately 6-8 weeks old at a pet shop in italy the clinical signs in the puppies included fever lethargy inappetence vomiting hemorrhagic diarrhea ataxia and seizures the animals died 2 days after the onset of clinical signs at postmortem examination lesions were present in multiple tissues including the intestines liver spleen kidneys lungs and lymph nodes ccov was also detected in multiple tissues including the lungs suggesting the potential for this pathogenic variant to also contribute to the pathogenesis of cird 26  however none of these more typical feline or canine coronaviruses are directly associated with the current novel coronavirus outbreak despite belonging in the same family of viruses they are all distinct from the sars-cov-2 which is responsible for causing covid-19 no evidence that pets play a key role in sars-cov-2 transmission we are still in the early stages of understanding how this novel virus affects humans let alone animals so more time and testing will be necessary to better understand how exactly sars-cov-2 behaves in pets routine testing of pets for sars-cov-2 is not recommended at this time instead it is currently being reserved for cases in which animal and public health officials believe a pet should be tested because it is linked to a person with confirmed covid-19 27  however some testing has been performed to date officials in hong kong have tested samples collected from more than 25 pets living in homes in which their owners either had received confirmed diagnoses of covid-19 or had been in close contact with someone with the disease yet only 2 dogs and 1 cat from this group have tested positive for sars-cov-2 20  idexx laboratories a multinational veterinary diagnostics company has also developed a pcr-based sars-cov-2 test although the test is not available for commercial use the company is actively monitoring for emergence of sars-cov-2 in companion animals so far idexx has analyzed more than 4000 samples from dogs cats and horses with respiratory signs many of these specimens came from regions experiencing covid-19 cases in humans however so far all the samples have tested negative for the novel virus 28  overall based on the early data so far no significant evidence exists to suggest that pets or other animals pose a substantial threat to people or other animals with respect to transmitting sars-cov-2 nevertheless given the rising concern among the general public major health organizations including the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc the world health organization who and key animal health organizations have all issued statements aiming to calm peoples fears about their pets being a source of the novel virus 20  29  30  31  32 33  there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare the world organisation for animal health has emphasized inevitably the crucial focus right now during this current pandemic is to control human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 and this requires each of us to play a key role to reduce community spread of the virus however the unfolding of this pandemic has again highlighted the complex interrelationships that exist between animals people and the environment ultimately a multidisciplinary one health approach will thus inevitably be critical to develop appropriate strategies to effectively prevent and control future outbreaks of covid-19 and given the speculation that wild live animal species may be linked to this pandemic this collaborative approach will also require the expertise of wildlife forensic specialists at best trading at wet markets like the one in wuhan often tends to occur under poor regulatory and welfare standards and illegal wildlife trade frequently coexists at these locations indeed many experts also hope that this crisis could represent the end of the global wildlife trade the author is a section editor of forensic science international reports and has previously authored chapters of veterinary textbooks nma

knowledge production on covid19 yunpeng zhang fang xu   the more knowledge we accumulate the more ignorance we produce ignorance  in spite of its prevalence in human affairs and profound consequences  receives little attention outside the philosophical dialogue about knowledge production proctor 2008 2008 in this commentary about the publics response to the outbreak of the covid19 in the united states and western europe we explore the transpacific and transatlantic production of ignorance from the authors experiences and observation in california and belgium respectively as migrant chinese academics in social sciences caught up in the fight against the sarscov2 virus in china and countries where we live  belgium and the united states  we are distressed and worried for family and friends back at home in china and in our adopted home countries we feel being stuck between a rock and a hard place we are critical of the chinese state and its various policies in our own research thus try our best to sift through myriad information about chinas response coming from within and outside china in order to distinguish between the applicable public health lessons and chinas ideologydriven propaganda yet to our own surprise we frequently find ourselves on the defensive due mainly to the ignorance surrounding the measures taken by the chinese authorities to contain the pandemic and china in general such ignorance we believe prevents constructive debates on useful lessons to be learnt and reforms needed to improve the public health system within and beyond china this crisis has been exploited to accumulate political capital contributing to the escalation of racial conflicts and intensification of geopolitical tensions it is also detrimental to building trust and organising global collective action which is desperately needed to control the pandemic in this commentary we aim to dissect the ignorance as we have observed and experienced we will start with a brief introduction of proctors 2008 2008 insight into agnotology  the study of ignorance this is followed first by a close reading of a selection of articles and commentaries published by journalists and researchers in mass media in the event of a pandemic anxiety and fear can drive people to overconsume information about the virus its origin spread threat prevention measures and possible cures structured by desiresof knowledge producers and commercial interests of media outlets representations in mass media are not only main sources of information for the general public but also feed into the structures of feelings and interests in different societies existing accounts tend to be split between idealisation and demonisation of chinas political system and responses to the pandemic they often adopt a binary homogenous view of the west andor china which remove complexities of the development of the pandemic on the ground and marginalise different voices we are particularly disheartened by the conflation of orientalism and sinophobia in many discussions which reinforces knowledge hierarchy and fuels racism and microaggression in everyday life these ramifications are illustrated through our personal encounters in the third section privileged to live in the relatively liberal and secluded environment of the academia we do not often encounter racial discrimination or microaggression that our lesser privileged fellow migrants experience however this global pandemic has awakened us to the reality that we had been avoiding the deep reflection that orientalism is alive and well in aiding the political production of knowledge and influencing the publics view on the orient and the oriental to borrow from edward said 1979 it is our hope that we as both migrant outsiders and academic insiders can shed light on this hardtoswallow reality agnotology is a term introduced by proctor 2008 2008 to refer to the growing field of studies of ignorance from a foucauldian perspective ignorance is part of the knowledge production process foucaults archaeological approach to knowledge sets out to uncover discursive struggles and excavate subjugated knowledges knowledges that are disqualified or dismissed by dominant standard and sanctioned discourses foucault 2003 agnotology pursues similar endeavours but places the accent more explicitly on the practices and politics that exclude delay supress deny erase or marginalise some forms or sources of knowledge proctor  schiebinger 2008 there are many different typologies and overlapping notions of ignorance gross  mcgoey 2015 in this commentary we adopt proctors distinction of three forms of ignorance  as a native state as a selective choice and a strategic play proctor 2008 2008 the first refers to an innocent gap in knowledge it is an innocent form of ignorance in that it is impossible to know everything about a constantly changing world and that ignorance can motivate intellectual pursuits of research or education so over time these gaps can be filled in the second instance ignorance is the product of selective inattention this is not necessarily problematic however after all it is beyond our cognitive capacity to register all sensory information especially in the digital era we live in but politics and culture do play a role in making these selections  funding priorities divisions of scientific labour and competition between them and value systems that people submit to to name a few examples in the third instance politics and power become more decisive ignorance is a wilful act it is created sustained and reproduced a process that involves different lines of labour and various devices choices are made by some people with good or bad intentions to decide what should be kept from others for how long and in which way these choices raise questions as to the relations of power involved in the production of ignorance the sociospatial distribution of ignorance and the consequences these types of ignorance are not mutually exclusive but often entangled in practice a native state of ignorance may be caused and perpetuated by selective attention or strategic plays studying ignorance requires a moment of reflection on our own ignorance given the fact that neither of us were trained or have worked in the fields of medicine virology epidemiology or public health in general and that knowledge about the virus and the pandemic is still rapidly emerging we will leave the daunting challenges of identifying epidemiological features and clinical treatments of the disease  overcoming the native state of ignorance  to colleagues at the frontline of this public health emergency our focus is on ignorance surrounding representations of chinas response and accumulated knowledge about the covid19 given our language skills we are inevitably ignorant of knowledge communicated in languages we do not know and will have to limit our attention to currently accessible materials as native mandarin chinese speakers we however have the advantage of accessing materials in chinese which allows us to observe the role played by language in silencing certain knowledge in response to the question from the financial times to compare authoritarian systems  namely china and russia to western democracies in handling the pandemic emmanuel macron did not give a straightforward answer but marked a strong distinction and strength of western democracies  free and transparent information which are considered to be in the dna of western democracies but lacking in china and russia mallet  khalaf 2020 he claimed that the immediacy of the information bears no comparison with ours social media are not free in those countries you dont have any social media  and there are obviously some things happening which we dont know about its up to china to tell them mallet  khalaf 2020 although he believed that cooperation and dialogues between countries of different political systems are necessary he warned that we should not allow ourselves as citizens of free democracies to be hypnotised by the way authoritarian regimes handle crises mallet  khalaf 2020 the interview is representative of a dominant discourse about chinas response to the pandemic and a paradigm frame of china in general since the lockdown of wuhan authoritarianism has been invoked by journalists politicians and academics to explain the suffering of residents in china and to characterise the measures taken by chinese authorities to bring the pandemic under control as the epicentres started to shift to europe and the us and the chinese authorities reopened its economy chinas authoritarian regime on the one hand is blamed for delayed responses and resultant socioeconomic upheavals in many countries in the west on the other many people in western democracies are confronted with questions  which political system is better and is china the future when questions are framed around the binary of authoritarian versus democratic countries like these answering them  even in a balanced way  often conjures up discomfort and requires cautious calibration of vocabulary we engage with representations framed on authoritarian politics given its weight in representing china and imagining political life after the pandemic our main point is not that they are necessarily biased against china although some of them do contain factual errors or deliberate misrepresentation they raise some undoubtedly important questions about media censorship freedom of expression abusive state power and disempowerment of cdc in chinas political system however what worries us here is the danger of ready submission to and fixating attention on this conceptual category of authoritarianism in destructing if not completely distorting social realities unless we are ready to give in to conspiracy theories believing that the virus is manmade or genetically modified we must admit that there are objectively existing knowledge gaps about the sarscov2 virus since it is a new virus it takes time to overcome this form of ignorance  a native state proctor 2008 2008  and prepare mitigation strategies that are proportional to available knowledge perceived risks and available resources at a given moment this temporal dimension is also necessary when assessing the responses of different governments and the production of ignorance in retrospect otherwise instead of challenging ignorance we may risk reproducing it a relevant example here is jeffery wasserstrom professor in history at university of california irvine and author of several books on modern china whose critiques of chinas responses were published in the guardian to support his claim that local politicians in wuhan and hubei province acted in accordance with the incentive structure of chinas authoritarian state systems to conceal information wasserstrom 2020 suggested that they had known of the first case as early as 8 december 2019 he referred to an article from bbc published on 27 january 2020 feng 2020 the original article from bbc did not mention the source specifically it does match with the date of the first case stated in the press release from the wuhan municipal health commission published on 11 january 2020 wuhan municipal health commission 2020 what the bbc journalist failed to communicate clearly and which wasserstrom failed to triangulate is that this first case was backdated through retrospective epidemiological study wuhan municipal health commission 2020 it is also intriguing that his piece does not refer to the openaccess article published in the lancet on 24 janurary which would have thickened the plot he attempted to develop in that study researchers pinned the date when the first patient showed symptoms on 1 december 2019 huang et al 2020 but again it is crucial to bear in mind that this research was done retrospectively and that it takes time to make accurate diagnosis of infections with unknown causes during a flu season it is justified to doubt information from chinas official sources however this is more because it is secondary data rather than because it comes from china andor from its official organs it is problematic to let a priori concern over authoritarianism  featured by secrecy lack of transparency and corruption  prevent us from doing our job of verifying and triangulating data while wasserstrom may be unintentional researchers at the henry jackson society a ukbased foreign policy think tank deliberately omitted information when crossreferencing a source from outside mainland china their ignorance is deliberate and strategic proctor 2008 2008 it is produced to accumulate political capital to establish culpability and legal responsibilities of china they compiled a timeline to show that there was a deliberate coverup the evidence they relied on was a journalistic report on south china morning post which based on documents of the chinese government seen only by this journalist claimed that the first case was recorded on 17 november 2019 and there were 266 cases by the end of 2019 when the chinese state informed who ma 2020a 2020b although the journalist cautiously suggested that some cases may be identified retrospectively ma 2020a 2020b this was removed in the henry jackson societys report by silencing such noises  and only by doing so these researchers can confidently conclude with certainty that chinas medical authorities withheld authorisation to report the outbreak both internally and to the public henderson et al 2020 p14 a textbook example of authoritarian politics in response to similar misrepresentation by the sky news australia the journalist later clarified in her tweet posted on 13 april 2020 and emphasised that there was no indication when the chinese government was made aware of the case and chinese doctors only realised they were dealing with a new disease in midtolate december 2019ma 2020b the lens of authoritarianism is also used to interpret the drastic measures taken by the chinese authorities and question their effectiveness bruce buckley china specialist reporting for the new york times took issue with the lockdown of wuhan in his article published on 5 february 2020 and maintained that this level of measure is a vast medical experiment conceivable only in authoritarian china buckley 2020 the phrase medical experiment conjures up the fear of a repressive authoritarian regime for emma grahamharrison a journalist for the guardian it was suspicious that two newly built hospitals were not running at full capacity one week after their completion grahamharrison 2020 in her article published on 19 february 2020 she referred to the lack of capacity of existing hospitals in wuhan not long ago citing an article from the wall street journal published on 5 february the parallel efforts of converting exhibition halls and a sports stadium to emergency hospitals and the absence of militarystyle emergency field hospitals an easier solution to the shortage of medical care facilities in her view instead of providing an answer through grounded research or consultation with medical communities she opted for an easy explanation of authoritarian politics she held that the complicated reality on the ground is a reminder of one of the main challenges for beijing as it struggles to contain the coronavirus its own secretive authoritarian system of government and its vast censorship and propaganda apparatus grahamharrison 2020 her conclusion appears to be influenced by her interviewee steve tsang professor of politics at soas china institute who believed that construction of these hospitals is more an attempt of the communist party to manage its image mainstream media in the west are filled with similar accounts of chinas responses to the pandemic with china watchers and china specialists focusing on authoritarian politics this may have the worrying effect of drowning out the sobering voices from the expert communities on the frontline fighting this pandemic within china the decision to lockdown wuhan was not irrational but was based on the input from the scientific community about the virus and its threats while there was much uncertainty about the virus during the early weeks of the outbreak in wuhan by the time the chinese authorities decided to seal off the city it was clear to an epidemiologist li lanjuan who proposed quarantining wuhan to the elite politicians in beijing on the night of 22 january that the virus can transmit between humans even during the incubation period dong et al 2020 this was later confirmed by an article published by researchers from the university of hong kong in the lancet on 24 january 2020 which additionally reported cases of asymptomatic patients chan et al 2020 according to li lanjuan in the interview in view of the huge traffic around the chinese spring festival and the danger of this disease it was a drastic but necessary decision in order to prevent further spread of the virus nationwide dong et al 2020 when it comes to treatment hospital for chinese experts is also not an undifferentiated category not every hospital was capable of treating patients with a highly infectious disease and a triage system was needed to treat patients with symptoms with different severities and to avoid overwhelming a stressed healthcare system what emma grahamharrison called emergency hospitals were in fact quarantine centres for patients with mild symptoms and without underlying conditions to avoid cluster transmission within families or communities and to keep patients under close medical monitoring and provide rapid intervention in case their conditions worsen as explained by wang chen a pulmonologist and an expert in critical care medicine during an interview on 7 february 2020 the paper 2020 these two new hospitals were designed and equipped to mainly treat infected patients with more severe symptoms or underlying conditions researchers at nanfang zhoumo 2020 the decisions of chinese authorities are based on knowledge accumulated about the disease the threat to public health chinas own conditions and available resources at that time iterations of chinas response through the lens of authoritarianism are as much about china as about the wests selfimagination they are symptomatic of and perhaps due to the conflation of sinophobia orientalism and statephobia since the eighteenth century sinophobia has become a dominant way for the west to conceive of china zhang 2008 generalisations about china  a threatening deviant despotic backward and inferior other  are invoked to constitute the west classifying a nation or a regime as authoritarian consolidates the wests power as a knowing subject to define others and affirms its moral authority and superiority characteristic here is the analysis from the economist 2020 drawing on a dataset on disasters compiled by researchers at catholic university of louvain in belgium it concluded that disasters killed more people in authoritarian countries than in democracies defined as countries with free and fair electionsthe economist 2020 even though chinas response may testify to the capacity of authoritarian governments in mobilising resources within a short period of time the lack of transparency and limited participation of civil society still renders it inferior to democratic countries when it comes to disaster interventions the economist 2020 this distinction  authoritarianism versus democracy  also derives strength from the fear of the state or statephobia in foucaults word across political camps in the west the growth of surveillance and security state apparatus under neoliberalism has led to strong worries and resistance against the state hannah 2016 compounded by radical lefts construction of the state as the enemy of real democracy this has led to an often undifferentiated critique of the state and the expansion of its power hannah 2016 little wonder that agamben 2020 a warrior against excessive expansion of state power voiced strong protest against the emergency measures taken by the italian authorities according to him these measures were to legitimatise the normalcy of state of exception in the name of public health agamben 2020 as iek 2020 pointed out agambens reasoning suffers a crucial flaw  why would any state adopt measures that only harm both its own legitimacy and the interest of capital in his view agambens commentary is the extreme form of a widespread leftist stance of reading the exaggerated panic caused by the spread of the virus as a mixture of power exercise of social control and elements of outright racism blame nature or china iek 2020 iek is right to worry that undifferentiated critique of active state interventions may temper political imaginations and prevent measures that are needed to bring the pandemic under control measures taken by the chinese government are perhaps the worst nightmares for liberals and leftists even though they were needed to slow the spread and prevent as many deaths as possible as revealed by stephen grey and andrew macaskill 2020 journalists reporting for reuters scientific advisors for boris johnson ruled out measures adopted by china very early on because such drastic actions would never be acceptable in a democracy like the uk giuseppe conte too in his interview with bbc defended his decision and believed that draconian measures like chinas are unacceptable in democratic countries lowen 2020 against the backdrop of orientalism it is no surprise that the fatality rate of covid19  often used as an indicator of the performance of different governments  has been a subject of heated debate there are abundant accusations of the chinese state for underreporting the number of deaths in order to manage its image and keep itself in power qin  li 2020 there is little doubt that the real death toll is likely to be higher given the unpreparedness of the chinese authorities during the early days of the pandemic as we were finalising this commentary the chinese government raised the death toll by 50 per cent in wuhan on 17 april to include unreported presumed deaths of covid19 at home and miscategorised deaths in then overwhelmed hospitals this was quickly considered as evidence of deliberate coverup of an authoritarian state and an attempt to restore chinas image qin 2020 2020 despite that new yorks health department made a similar adjustment only three days later goodman  rashbaum 2020 this is yet another example of misplaced criticism about the trustworthiness of data based on political ideology there is no factual evidence from the accusers the west whereas the burden of proof falls upon the accused china moreover the proof from china is subject to the verification and approval of the accuser the irony is that this scepticism about chinas data and distrust of an authoritarian state did not translate into effective measures in many democratic countries now with the benefit of hindsight to prepare for the threat of this disease to their healthcare systems in belgium for example until early march leading virologists and microbiologist still compared the covid19 to a more severe flu in communicating the risk to the public and informing policy decisions dierckx 2020 it took only a few days before medical professionals ran out of masks while the federal government was then caught up in the endless scandals of getting supplies of masks bervoet 2020 de nil 2020 limiting attention to the chinese state actions also ignore other important forces and dynamics that contributed to chinas effective control of the pandemic see harvey 2020 macron is correct about censorship in china in mallet  khalaf 2020 but he like many in the west haunted by the image and anxiety of a digital surveillance state is overestimating the capacity of the chinese state in controlling flows of information to bypass censorship netizens in china have long used technology tools eg vpn and discursive tactics to share information online wu  alaimo 2018 as we have seen in the past months investigative journalism grassroots activists and social media have played an important role in alerting the public about the outbreak in wuhan and forcing the government to act with more accountability and care chen 2020 medical professionals across china rallied to support wuhan ordinary citizens both home and abroad quickly sent supplies and support to help families friends and healthcare workers in china most citizens in china also actively followed the advice form health authorities and medical professionals focusing on authoritarian politics either to praise or to despise does not do justice to the efforts made by citizens in china to defy the projected figures in mathematical models schiebinger 2008 describes in her study about selective ignorance in knowledge transfer between the peripheries and the colonial centre not all knowledge gained in african colonies about abortifacients was transferred back to the imperial centre because such knowledge was deemed irrelevant or against the political agenda for population growth and expansion in the colonies the frame of authoritarianism is one device that polices flows of knowledge across societies and cultures labouring ignorance such ignorance has been exploited by many elites in the west to deflect domestic pressure which disturbingly inflates antichina sentiments and racism within china nationalist sentiments  reinforced by perceived hostility from the west  have grown significantly this has been harnessed by the chinese state to shape narratives about its own management of the crisis and the political system at home and abroad spiral geopolitical tensions like these undermine not only global cooperation to control the pandemic but also collective efforts to bring about a more just equal and fair world in addition to media knowledge about the disease is also shared through social interactions in everyday lives many overseas chinese like us have been following updates and advice shared by chinese authorities and friends in china sharing such knowledge often involve awkward moments here we refer mainly to public health lessons and not these heated talks about socalled wet market which does not even have a corresponding word in mandarin chinese or the consumption of bats in this section we will present xu fang one of the coauthors anecdotal experience in california to exemplify how distrusting and discrediting knowledge from china can take subtle forms in everyday encounters which intersects with race and gender on 24 march xus friend in coventry uk posted information about a webinar by dr zhang wenhong director of the department of infectious diseases in huashan hospital at fudan treatment and research centre the webinar was organised by the chineseamerican biopharmaceutical society located in the san francisco bay area dr zhang has emerged as a social media celebrity across china and likely among chinese people overseas as well for his expert knowledge bluntness in warning the public and calmness and frankness in describing the outbreak the free event was completely booked within three hours from her observation the peak number of simultaneous participants for the webinar reached close to 7500 during dr zhangs presentation the 40minute presentation mostly covered the epidemics spread in shanghai multiple measures the shanghai municipal government took and dr zhangs teams experience diagnosing and treating covid19 patients in shanghai the covid19 ward they work in is the place all infected cases in shanghai have been treated it is a presentation with lots of statistics and medical jargon since dr zhang cited findings published in the lancet and works published by his team in peerreviewed medical journals such as jama or medrxiv the presentation and the qa afterwards provided valuable information not covered by western mainstream media at that time such as the rate of cluster infection the effectiveness of oxygen therapy and the unlikelihood of infection from being in the same enclosed public space with little interaction such as in an elevator with a covid19 patient xu uploaded the printscreened slides and audio recording of the webinar to a google folder and shared the link with two dozen friends and coworkers in and out of academia in the united states via text message or personal email immediately after the webinar with the introduction if you believe social distancing is the way to go consider a listen thanks to him and his team shanghai a city of 30 million so far has only 414 cases 329 recovered and four deaths as of today she was aware that friends in the west who did not have a wechat account or did not pay much attention to the outbreak statistics in china were unlikely to know who dr zhang is or why his experience and knowledge are valuable and thus would need some evidence to recognise this opportunity what happened afterwards inspired this section of the commentary the responses from xus professional friends and acquaintances split along race regional origin and gender lines even when age and level of education are taken into consideration granted her observation is based on a rather selective and small sample since she did not find it necessary or unobtrusive to post the link to her facebook or linkedin accounts either of which reach a much bigger network of professional connections that decision or reservation to be more precise is due to the concern of encountering suspicions of her credentials and possible accusations of spreading misinformation despite the fact that she was confident about the credibility of the information that she shared with the abovementioned small group such selfcensorship or selective dissemination of knowledge indicated her existing awareness of how information from her a chinese national could be interpreted in a less than objective way and her decision to share the information with those whom she thought would welcome it however what she encountered from such a trusted small group was polite deflection or even overt dismissal and erasure within that group white females in general thanked xu for the important and valuable information while older white males in general pretended her message did not exist by subtly directing members of the fourteenmember group message to look at apparently more credible sources for example after a few grateful messages from older white female members of the group she received this one good morning name of the team team his name here useful source of coronavirus information go to google homepage below the search bar click on coronavirus information and resources covid19 that will take you to a page that has lots of information good luck indeed this member of the group provided a good source of information to others during a public health crisis and likely in his mind it was more civil to dismiss rather than overtly point out that a chinese source was less trustworthy his underlying message was plainly that the information she shared was not authentic or reliable while his recommendation of google was if he had reservations about dr zhangs presentation he could have pointed out which specific part he deemed problematic inquiries about sampling strategy study design or analytical models would have been welcome to foster an open environment for knowledge exchange which was exactly what happened when another colleague of hers of south asian descent questioned the validity of the information about the lack of community spread in china after reading the same message sent via email when she recommended the webinar to older white male friends who do not work in academia and sent them the link to the files again the response was silence in contrast to this response friends and coworkers originally from other developing countries who practice scholarship in the west especially females welcomed and appreciated the information for example im so glad that there are experts like prof zhang who are explaining the method to address the madness and confusion the slides looked really interesting from a colleague of south asian origin xus experience is likely to resonate with many overseas chinese before authorities in western europe and the us and their science advisors decided to take more active and stringent measures of social distancing and lockdowns to contain the pandemic it had been a challenging and frustrating conversation to convince our colleagues and friends in our adopted home countries that the covid19 is not a flu everyone is vulnerable and avoiding nonessential social events is a must a gentle warning would often be perceived if not ridiculed as an overreaction convincing colleagues and friends to put on masks in crowded public places was probably the most difficult because medical experts from western europe and the us had repeatedly emphasised that masks were useless and wearing them was more a cultural thing in east asia for example the cdc in the united states did not recommend its usage until 3 april in its report citing recent studies published by highranking medical journals regarding virus transmission from asymptomatic patients the earliest publications of which are from chinese scholars in late february centers for disease control and prevention 2020 although xus recent correspondents are a small group too small and haphazard for generalisation these experiences alerted us to consider orientalism present among fellow academics even when the evidence presented are credited by peerreviewed medical journals to understand the contrast it is useful to point out that dr zhang wenhong is a medical doctor trained and practising in china with good but accented english and xu is a relatively young and female academic not in the field of medicine furthermore the abovementioned incident took place when the reliability of statistics coming out of china was questioned literature on how the production of knowledge intersects with racism and sexism is abundant in the current case of covid19 when initial cases and knowledge of diagnosing and treating the disease were in china authority and power associated with the creation and possession of knowledge unavoidably intertwined with political ideology and orientalism extrapolating from the domination of imperialist great britain over egypt to the orientals a category broadly including chinese in the twentieth century said 1979 p32 points out how knowledge and knowledge production are closely associated with power and authority knowledge means rising above immediacy beyond self into the foreign and distant  to have such knowledge of such a thing is to dominate it to have authority over it in the current case we can see how knowledge possessed by the other and the authority obtained through such possession can be interpreted in two dimensions first knowledge about the virus and its spread and second the chinese experience or lessons learned from treating infected persons if the power of knowledge is demonstrated by abstracting it from local contexts and applying it to the foreign and distant then objections to and dismissal of that knowledge is the reassertion of power domination and western primacy to bridge said and proctor selective inattention as a form of ignorance production is exemplified by the silence or dismissal of dr zhangs presentation about his teams experience treating covid19 in shanghai such response from xus small group of correspondents demonstrates the clear intention to downplay the importance of the expert knowledge generated in the orient by an oriental and promoted by yet another oriental the other form of ignorance this commentary engages with strategic plays is simultaneously evident in the incident both forms of ignorance were expressed in implicit nonconfrontational ways given the nature of the associations between the correspondents and xu however the silence and dismissal explicitly communicated the purpose of their responses to her which was to discredit the power and authority embedded in the knowledge produced by dr zhang and the power and credentials embodied by her after all it was she who learned of the existence of the webinar recognised the significance of the knowledge it contained recorded it and vouched for its credibility when sharing it with the small group furthermore knowledge and power works in a dialectic way more power over the subject race requires more knowledge about them which thus facilitates the management and control of them all on the basis that the power in the west knows better about the subject race in the east better than they know themselves said 1979 2004 in the case of knowledge produced in the east recognition and authority have been granted in recent years for china and chinese scholars as well but the knowledge produced about covid19 and its reception demonstrates how illusory such recognition is this knowledge though produced to suggest global generalisability predominantly uses a territorially bound sample which is located in the east and concerns primarily a single ethnicity han chinese is now experiencing ignorance and dismissal in the west additional studies have been done and likely published based on data in other east asian countries with more democratic political systems such as south korea or japan but these are beyond the scope of this writing from the perspective of orientalism the oriental is irrational depraved fallen childlike different thus the european is rational virtuous mature normal said 1979 2004 p 40 what calls for more rationality maturity and coolheadedness in times of crisis than scientific research in this case how reliable could knowledge produced by the chinese about a virus be especially when authority figures in the united states  though heavily criticised for it  call it a chinese virus as said 1979 2004 p 46 points out it is impossible to untangle knowledge from power or to avoid the regrettable binary between the west and the east and the tendency of any knowledge based on such hardandfast distinction since this tendency is right at the centre of orientalist theory practice and values found in the west the sense of western power over the orient is taken for granted as having the status of scientific truth what scientific truth implies is its universality and rationality the pushback and ignorance we observed here was that knowledge produced by the oriental and disseminated by another oriental was fighting an uphill battle to be recognised as universal truth and credible scientific knowledge the strategic downplay and intentional inattention to produce ignorance can be understood as based on political ideology fearing the triumph of authoritarianism based on cultural prejudice and racist bigotry fearing a new round of yellow peril or based on sexism fearing the challenge to male authority which is exemplified by xus dismissed voice in promoting the webinar in promoting the webinar and the medical knowledge produced by dr zhang xu presented herself not only as a gatekeeper but also a credible source vouching for the authority of dr zhang however her credentials were not recognised by the white males in her small group which further resulted in the inattention paid to dr zhang in lakoffs 1973 work about how gender is associated with ways of speaking she examines how the social discrepancy in the positions of men and women in our society is reflected in linguistic disparities and deborah camerons 2007 work in dialogue with lakoff points out that since males are still associated with power and authority assertive tones are commonly associated with them instead of with females despite decades of feminist movements for gender equality in dialogue settings such as the anecdote xu encountered the domination of the male respondent was clearly communicated through dismissal of the medical research information she shared  most of which are published by peerreviewed medical journals in the west the gender element played a role in the incident was evidenced by the fact that in the responses that she has collected the majority of women regardless of race or profession responded with gratitude while males either ignored the shared information or scrutinised it closely though the latter is welcomed for the progress of scientific knowledge in this case her voice is ignored in in two senses due to being both chinese and female it appears these two visible characteristics are more salient than her scholarly credentials that allow her to recognise the authority and credibility of peerreviewed medical journals our analysis and reflection have attempted to dissect the production and entanglement of different types of ignorance proctor 2008 2008 ignorance exists everywhere and can never be completely eradicated given how complex the world is and how little we know a native state of ignorance about the world will always exist and it takes both time and will to overcome it although not always necessary this process is shaped by practices and politics of ignoring raising questions as to relations of power and interest in the production of ignorance in the case of the ongoing pandemic there are knowledge gaps about the sarscov2 virus and scientists worldwide are racing to accumulate more knowledge about it so as to better inform public policies nationally or globally as we have sought to show ideological and political differences can frequently stay on the way of overcoming this native state of ignorance by saying this we are not implying that ignorance is always intentionally created with a bad faith conceptual frames that we subscribe to may sensitivise us to some aspects of sociopolitical lives while ignoring others although it may not be intentional it does remind us of the importance of reflexive exercise to question how our imaginations training and passions affect the politics we advocate for and write about in other instances as we have discussed ignorance is created andor maintained intentionally to serve political agendas this may negatively affect the process of accumulating and disseminating knowledge about the disease and measures to contain the pandemic in reviewing the discussions about chinas response we are intrigued by the emphasis on the china aspect in many accounts this is understandable given that the outbreak was first reported in china but if we are allowed to indulge in a thought experiment for a moment here had free and fair election  the commonly used definition of democracy  existed in china how would representations about chinas response look like would knowledge accumulated in china about the virus and precautionary measures still put under the same credibility test by democratic countries or will a more nuanced vocabulary also emerge to talk about china as well iek 2020 in raising these questions as we have attempted to bring out in this paper attention has been disproportionately placed on china  a threatening backward and untrustworthy other the legacy of orientalism and sinophobia reinforced by state phobia influences knowledge exchange from china it is one thing to claim that knowledge from china is to be taken with caution because more knowledge is needed given the novelty of this virus it is another to dismiss or discredit this knowledge altogether as we are revising this paper many european governments and us health authorities have reversed their earlier recommendations and finally called for maskwearing in public spaces it is a measure widely adopted in east asia since shortly after the outbreak began in wuhan in late january but ignored and even ridiculed in the west until recently this is yet another example of ignorance rooted in the struggles for and the fear of losing power and authority which unfortunately and unnecessarily complicates the global fight against covid19 as the saying goes a virus does not recognise national borders if the knowledge to fight it is itself subject to essentialism and exclusiveness this sets barriers that result in unnecessary loss and human suffering in saids 1994 p 31 words they give rise to polarizations that absolve and forgive ignorance and demagogy more than they enable knowledge our discussion here also raises several interrelated conceptual questions for further research first the pandemic alerts us to the role of the state in coordinating resources and protecting public health it invites critical reflections upon the state its roles in socioeconomic management and statecentred political struggles in existing theories it has long been argued that the state is not a monolithic and coherent entity yet more attention is still paid to the repressive side of the state an undifferentiated attack on the state and statecentric struggles overlooks and will undermine its potential as an important scale and institution to create and defend conditions for individual and collective wellbeing hannah 2016 second it calls for reconceptualisation of authoritarianism and democracy in political studies to associate authoritarianism and democracy only with the national scale is a mistake of methodological nationalism denying their coexistence in any polity and at any scale it is perhaps also necessary to go back to the fundamental question of good government whereas authoritarianism and democracy are practices to achieve this end third comparing responses of different countries whether they are classified as democracies or authoritarian countries are pointless in an unevenly developed world hit by the pandemic asynchronously these attempts to abstract a chinese model a south korean model or a german model and to advocate their export or use as a benchmark are of little value given the differences in health care infrastructures and available resources as well as knowledge this is not a claim against drawing useful lessons from other countries experiences however if we must engage in comparative studies it is perhaps a more useful endeavour to investigate how preexisting inequalities in power wealth and knowledge have contributed to or been exacerbated by the spread of the pandemic over time both authors contributed equally to this article we thank the encouragement and detailed constructive comments from the reviewers the editors and the colleagues of the refcom research group  herd immunity understanding covid-19 haley randolph e luis barreiro b   acquired immunity is established at the level of the individual either through natural infection with a pathogen or through immunization with a vaccine herd immunity box 1
 stems from the effects of individual immunity scaled to the level of the population it refers to the indirect protection from infection conferred to susceptible individuals when a sufficiently large proportion of immune individuals exist in a population this population-level effect is often considered in the context of vaccination programs which aim to establish herd immunity so that those who cannot be vaccinated including the very young and immunocompromised are still protected against disease depending on the prevalence of existing immunity to a pathogen in a population the introduction of an infected individual will lead to different outcomes figure 1
 in a completely naive population a pathogen will propagate through susceptible hosts in an unchecked manner following effective exposure of susceptible hosts to infected individuals however if a fraction of the population has immunity to that same pathogen the likelihood of an effective contact between infected and susceptible hosts is reduced since many hosts are immune and therefore cannot transmit the pathogen if the fraction of susceptible individuals in a population is too few then the pathogen cannot successfully spread and its prevalence will decline the point at which the proportion of susceptible individuals falls below the threshold needed for transmission is known as the herd immunity threshold anderson and may 1985 above this level of immunity herd immunity begins to take effect and susceptible individuals benefit from indirect protection from infection figure 1bbox 1glossary
herd immunity the indirect protection from infection conferred to susceptible individuals when a sufficiently large proportion of immune individuals exist in a population
herd immunity threshold the point at which the proportion of susceptible individuals in a population falls below the threshold needed for transmission
r
0 the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual introduced into a completely susceptible population
r
e the average number of secondary infections generated by a single infectious individual over an infectious period in a partially immune population
onward transmission the effective transmission of a pathogen from an infected individual to susceptible hosts
case fatality rate cfr proportion of deaths attributed to a certain disease among all individuals diagnosed with that disease
infection fatality rate cfr proportion of deaths attributed to a certain disease among all infected individuals under the simplest model the herd immunity threshold depends on a single parameter known as r0 or the basic reproduction number figure 2
a r0 refers to the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual introduced into a completely susceptible population anderson and may 1985 if we consider a hypothetical pathogen with an r0 of 4 this means that on average one infected host will infect four others during the infectious period assuming no immunity exists in the population mathematically the herd immunity threshold is defined by 1  1r0 eg if r0  4 the corresponding herd immunity threshold is 075 anderson and may 1985 therefore the more communicable a pathogen the greater its associated r0 and the greater the proportion of the population that must be immune to block sustained transmission figure 2b a similar parameter important for understanding population-level immunity is the effective reproduction number re or rt re is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single index case over an infectious period in a partially immune population delamater et al 2019 unlike r0 re does not assume a completely susceptible population and consequently will vary depending on a populations current immune state which will change dynamically as an outbreak event or vaccination campaign unfolds ultimately the goal of vaccination programs is to bring the value of re below 1 this occurs when the proportion of the population with immunity exceeds the herd immunity threshold at this point pathogen spread cannot be maintained so there is a decline in the number of infected individuals within the population the above interpretation of r0 and its relation to the herd immunity threshold is the simplest understanding of these terms it relies on several key assumptions including homogeneous mixing of individuals within a population and that all individuals develop sterilizing immunityimmunity that confers lifelong protection against reinfectionupon vaccination or natural infection in real-world situations these epidemiological and immunological assumptions are often not met and the magnitude of indirect protection attributed to herd immunity will depend on variations in these assumptions r0 is defined by both the pathogen and the particular population in which it circulates thus a single pathogen will have multiple r0 values depending on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of the population experiencing the outbreak delamater et al 2019 this inherently implies that the herd immunity threshold will vary between populations which is a well-documented occurrence delamater et al 2019 for any infectious disease communicability depends on many factors that impact transmission dynamics including population density population structure and differences in contact rates across demographic groups among others anderson and may 1985 all of these factors will directly or indirectly impact r0 and consequently the herd immunity threshold to establish herd immunity the immunity generated by vaccination or natural infection must prevent onward transmission not just clinical disease for certain pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 clinical manifestations are a poor indicator of transmissibility as asymptomatic hosts can be highly infectious and contribute to the spread of an epidemic once the herd immunity threshold is reached the efficacy of herd immunity largely depends on the strength and duration of the immunity acquired for pathogens in which lifelong immunity is induced as is the case for measles vaccination or infection herd immunity is highly effective and can prevent pathogen spread within a population however this situation is relatively rare as immunity for many other infectious diseases such as pertussis and rotavirus wanes over time as a consequence herd immunity is less effective and periodic outbreaks can still occur finally if immunity is unevenly distributed within a population clusters of susceptible hosts that frequently contact one another may remain even if the proportion of immunized individuals in the population as a whole surpasses the herd immunity threshold these pockets of susceptible individuals are still at risk for local outbreaks the ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic has caused over 35 million clinically confirmed cases of covid-19 and has claimed more than 250000 lives worldwide as of may 4 2020 numerous clinical trials to evaluate novel vaccine candidates and drug repurposing strategies for the prevention and treatment of sars-cov-2 infection are currently ongoing however it is unknown whether these trials will produce effective interventions and it is unclear how long these studies will take to establish efficacy and safety although an optimistic estimate for any vaccine trial is at least 1218 months in the absence of a vaccine building up sars-cov-2 herd immunity through natural infection is theoretically possible however there is no straightforward ethical path to reach this goal as the societal consequences of achieving it are devastating since the onset of sars-cov-2 spread various studies have estimated the basic reproductive number r0 of the virus to be in the range of 2 to 6 from an initial cohort of 425 confirmed cases in wuhan china an r0 of approximately 22 was estimated meaning that on average each infected individual gives rise to 22 other infections li et al 2020 more recent estimates place the r0 higher at 57 although many estimates fall within this range sanche et al 2020 this variation reflects the difficulty of obtaining accurate r0 estimates in an ongoing pandemic and the current estimated sars-cov-2 r0 values likely do not indicate a complete picture of the transmission dynamics across all countries assuming an r0 estimate of 3 for sars-cov-2 the herd immunity threshold is approximately 67 this means that the incidence of infection will start to decline once the proportion of individuals with acquired immunity to sars-cov-2 in the population exceeds 067 as discussed above this model relies on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneous population mixing and uniform sterilizing immunity in recovered individuals across demographic groups which are unlikely to hold true nevertheless this basic model can give us a rough idea of the number of individuals that would need to be infected to achieve herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine given an approximate herd immunity threshold and a countrys population one important measure to evaluate the impact of sars-cov-2 spread is the overall case fatality rate cfr the cfr is the proportion of deaths attributed to a certain disease among all individuals diagnosed with that disease ie cases over a specified period of time it is worth noting that there is still significant uncertainty in the cfr for covid-19 due to variation in the testing capacity per country selection bias for which individuals receive testing and differences in how deaths are officially attributed to covid-19 further cfr is also sensitive to variation in the underlying age structure and distribution of comorbidities among populations consequently cfrs may differ considerably over time and between countries in the case of covid-19 the initial estimate of the cfr in a small cohort of 41 individuals with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection was high 15 huang et al 2020 however this number has markedly decreased as more data have become available using data from all laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland china verity et al obtained an estimated overall cfr of 138 adjusted for censoring under-ascertainment and the underlying demography in china and similar estimates have been obtained from other groups verity et al 2020 wu et al 2020a like many other infectious diseases a non-uniform covid-19 cfr has been reported across age groups with the vast majority of deaths occurring among individuals 60 years old or greater the most relevant measure to evaluate the societal cost of achieving global sars-cov-2 herd immunity is the overall infection fatality rate ifr the ifr is defined as the proportion of deaths caused by a certain disease among all infected individuals because some cases will not be reported especially among asymptomatic hosts or individuals with mild symptoms the ifr will inherently be lower than the cfr if we combine infection fatality data with an estimate of the number of individuals that need to develop immunity to reach the herd immunity threshold we can project the expected number of deaths as a consequence of meeting this threshold because of the uncertainty in the covid-19 ifr we use three different point estimates in our analysis 1 an ifr of 02 2 an ifr of 06 that is in line with the ifr determined by verity et al and 3 an ifr of 1 figure 2c assuming a uniform herd immunity threshold of 67 r0  3 and an ifr of 06 the absolute number of expected deaths across the globe would exceed 30 million people figure 2c notably this analysis assumes that ifrs do not vary across countries and it does not consider factors that lead to heterogeneity in ifrs including differences in access to healthcare resources and variation in the prevalence of comorbidities in reality cfrs and ifrs vary dramatically across countries as highlighted by the current estimates of unadjusted cfrs across the globe italy 137 united states 577 south korea 233 the centre for evidence-based medicine 2020 although testing biases and differences in age demographics across countries account in part for these elevated regional cfrs additional factors likely play a role most notably a strain on local healthcare systems in italy a sudden influx of covid-19 patients in march led to a shortage of intensive care unit beds and other essential medical resources causing a substantial burden on hospitals this outbreak underscores the importance of taking into account the limits of local healthcare infrastructure and how exceeding these limits can exacerbate negative outcomes of covid-19 particularly in the context of attaining herd immunity to sars-cov-2 a regard for finite healthcare resources cannot be overstated as this policy inherently relies on allowing a large fraction of the population to become infected unchecked the spread of sars-cov-2 will rapidly overwhelm healthcare systems a depletion in healthcare resources will lead not only to elevated covid-19 mortality but also to increased all-cause mortality this effect will be especially devastating for countries in which hospitals have limited surge capacity where minimal public health infrastructure exists and among vulnerable communities including prison and homeless populations because sars-cov-2 is a novel pathogen many features of its transmission and infection dynamics are not well characterized thus our above analysis provides only a sense of the potential ramifications given a scenario in which we attain herd immunity via natural infection we do not consider numerous complexities of viral spread and infectivity including variation in r0 across time and populations heterogeneity in the attack and contact rates across demographic groups and inter-individual variation in communicability and disease severity although these aspects are essential to understand the full picture of sars-cov-2 community spread while these epidemiological factors have important implications in the context of herd immunity currently they are difficult to estimate given the limited data available differences in population density cultural behaviors population age structure underlying comorbidity rates and contact rates across groups influence transmission dynamics within communities so the assumption of a uniform r0 across populations is not realistic further variation in transmissibility between individuals may play a major role in sars-cov-2 spread superspreading events occur when circumstances favorable for high rates of transmission arise these events involve a single index case infecting a large number of secondary contacts and are known to be important in driving outbreaks of infectious diseases including sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and measles lloyd-smith et al 2005 reports of sars-cov-2 superspreading events have been documented suggesting that heterogeneity in infectivity may significantly impact the dynamics of its transmission liu et al 2020 finally the factors that influence inter-individual heterogeneity in covid-19 susceptibility clinical pathology and disease outcome are not well understood reported differences in sex- and ethnicity-specific cfrs suggest that genetic environmental and social determinants likely underlie variation in susceptibility to covid-19 and the severity of covid-19 complications although future studies are needed to explore this further nasiri et al 2020 the ability to establish herd immunity against sars-cov-2 hinges on the assumption that infection with the virus generates sufficient protective immunity at present the extent to which humans are able to generate sterilizing immunity to sars-cov-2 is unclear a recent study assessing the possibility of sars-cov-2 reinfection in a small cohort of rhesus macaques found that reinfection was not able to occur 1 month after the first viral challenge suggesting at least short-term sterilizing immunity in these animals bao et al 2020 in a cohort of 175 recovered covid-19 patients sars-cov-2-specific serum neutralizing antibodies nabs were detected at considerable albeit variable titers in most n  165 individuals wu et al 2020b indicating that the production of nab against sars-cov-2 is relatively common whereas these findings are promising other important questions to consider are whether nab titers will wane over time and how long acquired immunity will last previous studies in confirmed sars patients have demonstrated that nab responses against sars-cov persisted for several months to 2 years although all individuals displayed low titers after about 15 months mo et al 2006 further elevated concentrations of specific antibodies to coronavirus 229e one of the viruses responsible for the common cold were found 1 year after infection although these titers were not sufficient to prevent reinfection in all individuals callow et al 1990 together these studies suggest that protection against reinfection with coronavirus species tends to diminish given sufficient time although longitudinal serological studies are needed to assess the duration of sars-cov-2 immunity if this proves to also be true for sars-cov-2 persistent herd immunity may never be attained in the absence of recurrent vaccination indeed modeling of the transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2 predicts that short-term immunity 10 months would give rise to annual outbreaks while longer-term immunity 2 years would lead to biennial outbreaks kissler et al 2020 mass serological testing is now needed to determine how many individuals have been infected how many individuals are immune and how far we are from reaching the herd immunity threshold that said even if reinfection can occur after sterilizing immunity wanes enduring memory cells of the adaptive immune system would likely facilitate immune control of the virus and limit disease pathology which would hopefully decrease the clinical severity of subsequent infections in a sufficiently immune population herd immunity provides indirect protection to susceptible individuals by minimizing the probability of an effective contact between a susceptible individual and an infected host in its simplest form herd immunity will begin to take effect when a population reaches the herd immunity threshold namely when the proportion of individuals who are immune to the pathogen crosses 1  1r0 at this point sustained transmission cannot occur so the outbreak will decline however in real-world populations the situation is often much more complex epidemiological and immunological factors such as population structure variation in transmission dynamics between populations and waning immunity will lead to variation in the extent of indirect protection conferred by herd immunity consequently these aspects must be taken into account when discussing the establishment of herd immunity within populations there are two possible approaches to build widespread sars-cov-2 immunity 1 a mass vaccination campaign which requires the development of an effective and safe vaccine or 2 natural immunization of global populations with the virus over time however the consequences of the latter are serious and far-reachinga large fraction of the human population would need to become infected with the virus and millions would succumb to it thus in the absence of a vaccination program establishing herd immunity should not be the ultimate goal instead an emphasis should be placed on policies that protect the most vulnerable groups in the hopes that herd immunity will eventually be achieved as a byproduct of such measures although not the primary objective itself  murine coronavirus neuropathogenesis determinants of virulence timothy cowley j susan weiss r  murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv causes various diseases depending on the strain and route of inoculation both the jhm and a59 strains when inoculated intracranially or intranasally are neurovirulent comparison of the highly virulent jhm isolate jhmsd with less virulent jhm isolates and with a59 has been used to determine the mechanisms and genes responsible for high neuropathogenicity of mhv the focus of this review is on the contributions of viral spread replication and innate and adaptive immunity to mhv neuropathogenesis jhmsd spreads more quickly among neurons than less neurovirulent mhvs and is able to spread in the absence of the canonical mhv receptor ceacam1a the observation that jhmsd infects more cells and expresses more antigen but produces less infectious virus per cell than a59 implies that efficient replication is not always a correlate of high neurovirulence this is likely due to the unstable nature of the jhmsd spike protein s jhmsd induces a generally protective innate immune response however the strong neutrophil response may be more pathogenic than protective in addition jhmsd induces only a minimal t cell response while the strong t cell response and the concomitant ifn induced by the less neurovirulent a59 is protective differences in the s and nucleocapsid n proteins between a59 and jhmsd contribute to jhmsd neuropathogenicity the hemmagglutinin-esterase he protein may enhance neuropathogenicity of some mhv isolates but is unlikely a major contributor to the high neuroviruence of jhmsd further data suggests that neither the internal i protein nor nonstructural proteins ns4 and ns2 are significant contributors to neurovirulence  murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv is a large enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus figure 1  mhv can cause a wide range of illness depending on the strain and the route of infection these include respiratory gastrointestinal hepatic and central nervous system cns diseases these infections provide models for the study of encephalitis and demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis ms hepatitis weiss and navas-martin 2005  and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars de albuquerque et al 2006  neurotropic strains of mhv cause disease in the cns when inoculated intracranially or intranasally virus generally does not reach the brain of immunocompetent mice if inoculated intrahepatically or intraperitoneally after intranasal inoculation the virus travels transneuronally up the olfactory nerves to the olfactory bulbs where it spreads into the brain parenchyma and eventually into the spinal cord barnett and perlman 1993 perlman et al 1989 perlman et al 1995 sun and perlman 1995  mhv is thought to also spread through the cerebrospinal fluid wang et al 1992  cns infection leads to viremia and spread of virus to other susceptible organs such as the liver lavi et al 1988 lavi et al 1986  two neurotropic strains that are commonly studied are a59 and jhm a59 is a tissue culture adapted dualtropic strain that infects the liver as well as the brain a59 causes moderate to severe hepatitis and in the brain mild encephalitis and demyelination lavi et al 1984 phillips et al 1999  mhv induced demyelination provides a model for multiple sclerosis infectious a59 is generally cleared by ten days post intracranial inoculation after which mice develop demyelination peaking at three to four weeks post infection houtman and fleming 1996b matthews et al 2001 sutherland et al 1997  jhm was isolated from a paralyzed mouse cheever et al 1949 and subsequently serially passaged in mouse brains after which various clones were isolated the use of multiple jhm clones with different levels of neurovirulence by various labs has necessitated the use of additional nomenclature to distinguish among these isolates jhmsd formerly designated as mhv-4 ontiveros et al 2003  the focus of this review is among the most neurovirulent isolates fazakerley et al 1992 gallagher et al 1990  causing lethal encephalitis an intracranial inoculation with only a few plaque forming units pfu of jhmsd kills nearly all the infected mice within about one week like a59 jhm induces demyelinating disease in the surviving mice lampert et al 1973 perlman et al 1987 weiner 1973  because a59 and jhmsd display vastly different levels of neurovirulence we have used them to investigate the viral determinants of high mhv induced neuropathogenesis jhmsd has a fifty percent lethal dose ld 50  of less than 10 pfu after intracranial inoculation of 4 week old c57bl6 b6 mice while a59 is approximately 1000 fold less virulent with a ld 50 of 3000-5000 pfu iacono et al 2006 macnamara et al 2005  both a59 and jhmsd infect all major cns cell types including neurons astrocytes and microglia viral antigen is found throughout the brain after infection with either virus but jhmsd produces more widespread infection with larger foci of viral antigen expression fishman et al 1985 lavi et al 1988 matsubara et al 1991 parham et al 1986  several factors contribute to enhanced lethality of highly encephalitic jhm isolates such as jhmsd these include spread replication and adaptive and innate immunity the kinetics of viral replication and antigen expression as well as host response are diagrammed in figure 2  several viral proteins have been investigated as to their role in strain-specific differences in mhv neurovirulence a diagram of the mhv virion with structural proteins indicated as well as a schematic showing the locations of genes encoding both structural and nonstructural viral proteins is shown in figure 1  the expression of either the spike or nucleocapsid protein of jhm within the a59 background confers a decrease in ld 50 to less than 10 pfu after intracranial inoculation cowley et al 2010 iacono et al 2006 navas and weiss 2003 phillips et al 1999  the virulence factors and well as the mechanisms by which viral proteins enhance neurovirulence are discussed below in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures jhmsd spreads more extensively than a59 suggesting that there is an inherent difference in spread among neurons in the absence of host factors such as the immune response in these in vitro cultures both a59 and jhmsd produce foci of infection that increase in size over time without increasing in number this occurs more rapidly in jhmsd infected cultures as compared with a59 infected jhmsd produces very low levels of infectious virus in the medium as compared with a59  suggesting that jhmsd spread is primarily neuron to neuron phillips et al 2002  in rat hippocamapal neurons and in the neuronal cell line obl-21 a jhm isolate used by s dales et al was observed to move transneuronaly in a primarily retrograde movement with some anterograde movement as well pasick et al 1994  the availability of reverse genetics systems has promoted the mapping of pathogenic properties to viral genes analysis of a59jhm chimeric viruses demonstrated that the spike protein is largely responsible for the rapid spread of jhm replacement of the spike gene of a59 with that of jhm ra59s jhm  confers increased spread in the brain and in primary hippocampal neurons and conversely replacement of the jhm spike gene with that of a59 rjhms a59  results in reduced spread in the brain iacono et al 2006 phillips et al 2002  some mhvs such as jhm 22-v-1 are less neuron-tropic and more glial-tropic wang et al 1992  this is associated with mutations within the spike gene and confers decreased virulence in the context of jhma59 chimeric viruses the nucleocapsid protein of jhm also confers increases in the extent of viral antigen expressed in the brain however the mechanism is uncertain and nucleocapsid protein does not enhance neuron-to-neuron spread in primary hippocampal neuron cultures cowley et al 2010  another factor that contributes to high neurovirulence is the ability of some jhm variants such as jhmsd and jhm cl-2 taguchi et al 1985 to spread in the absence of the canonical mhv receptor ceacam1a this was originally demonstrated in tissue culture gallagher et al 1992 taguchi et al 1999 and more recently in primary hippocampal neuron cultures  a very small number of cells in primary neuronal cultures derived from ceacam1a  mice were infected by a59 or jhmsd however a59 failed to spread beyond the initially infected neurons while jhmsd spread robustly furthermore when ceacam1a  mice were inoculated with sufficiently high titers of jhmsd but not a59 they developed lethal cns disease miura et al 2008  thus the ability to spread in the absence of ceacam1a may allow jhmsd to spread more rapidly than a59 andor infect different neuronal subsets the expression of ceacam1a protein by neurons has never been demonstrated when measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-pcr qrt-pcr expression was barely above background and may have been due to contamination of other ceacam1a expressing cell types  it was suggested that jhm cl-2 may first infect microglia which had been demonstrated to express ceacam1a ramakrishna et al 2004  and then spread into neurons nakagaki and taguchi 2005  however the observations that there are very few foci of infected ceacam1a  neurons compared to wild type neurons and that a59 fails to spread from initially infected ceacam1a  neurons suggest that neurons express ceacam1a which is essential for spread of a59 but not jhm it is not clear how either strain enters ceacam1a  neurons most jhm isolates are not capable of ceacam1a independent spread one such isolate jhmia like jhmsd is highly neurovirulent and both viruses spread rapidly in the cns and are uniformly fatal in 4 to 6 week old mice haspel et al 1978 knobler et al 1981 macnamara et al 2005 ontiveros et al 2001 perlman et al 1987  however jhmsd is significantly more virulent than jhmia when assessed in a different model system in which suckling mice are inoculated intranasally and nursed on dams previously immunized with jhmia ontiveros et al 2003  thus the inability of jhmia to carry out ceacam1a-independent spread may contribute to subtle differences in virulence but the fact that jhmia is similarly virulent to jhmsd in adult b6 mice suggests that ceacam1a-independent spread is likely not the only reason for enhanced virulence of jhmsd in adult mice furthermore it is quite possible that ceacam1a-independent spread is mechanistically different in primary neurons as compared with cell lines the role of hemagglutinin-esterase he in neurovirulence and spread has been a subject of much speculation with evidence both for and against a role for he in neurovirulence lamonica et al 1991 yokomori et al 1995 yokomori et al 1992 yokomori et al 1993  however it was demonstrated that a recombinant a59 expressing the hemagglutininesterase of the mhv-s strain and the spike protein of jhmsd was more neurovirulent than an isogenic virus that does not express he kazi et al 2005  however abrogation of the expression of he within a recombinant jhmsd genome had no affect on neurovirulence unpublished data this implies that he can enhance neurovirulence for some strains but either does not modulate jhmsd neurovirulence or the effect of he expression during jhm infection is not detectable due to the very high neurovirulence of jhm infectious viral titers in the brains of mice infected with mhv do not always correlate with the severity of the infection when inoculated at equivalent pfu a59 and jhmsd replicate to similar titers in the brain even though jhmsd is more lethal and expresses more intracellular antigen in the cns cowley et al 2010 macnamara et al 2005 phillips et al 1999  in addition recombinant a59 expressing the jhmsd spike gene ra59s jhm  replicates to lower final titers than a59 even though like jhmsd it has an ld 50 of less than 10 pfu and spreads more efficiently in the cns than a59 phillips et al 1999  this may be due to the unstable nature of the jhmsd spike protein which can lead to receptor independent conformational changes and premature inactivation gallagher and buchmeier 2001 krueger et al 2001  consistent with this the jhmsd spike is more sensitive to heat and low ph treatments tsai et al 2003  perhaps as a consequence jhmsd produces more virus particles per pfu than a59 unpublished data and replicates to significantly 100-1000 fold lower titers in tissue culture cowley et al 2010 phillips et al 1999  however titer is indicative of disease severity in some cases when comparing two viruses expressing the same spike protein for example recombinant a59 expressing the jhm nucleocapsid ra59n jhm  is more lethal and infects more cells in the cns than a59 and this is associated with greater replication in the brain cowley et al 2010  infections with a59 or jhmsd generate different cytokinechemokine profiles infections with either virus induces macrophage inhibitory factor mif and tumor necrosis factor- tnf- which remain elevated throughout infection a59 induces a strong protective ifn response rempel et al 2004a scott et al 2008  jhmsd on the other hand induces a weaker ifn- response rempel et al 2004a scott et al 2008 and there is one report of a stronger ifn- response early in jhmsd infection rempel et al 2004a  additionally jhmsd induces more macrophage chemoattractants such as macrophage inflammatory protein 1- and - mip-1 and mip-1 and mip-2 consistent with the greater number of macrophages recruited into the cns during jhmsd infection iacono et al 2006 rempel et al 2004b  the robust macrophage infiltration induced by jhmsd partially maps to the jhmsd spike gene as evidenced by the greater level of macrophage recruitment in the cns of ra59s jhm infected mice as compared with a59 infected animals rempel et al 2004b scott et al 2008  shortly after mhv infection neutrophils traffic to the brain and release matrix metalloproteinases mmps the combination of cytokines and mmps causes disruption of the blood brain barrier which facilitates the entry of mononuclear cells zhou et al 2002  jhmsd infection leads to the recruitment of greater numbers of neutrophils than a59 infection likely a result of the increased level of mip-2 during jhm infection iacono et al 2006 rempel et al 2004a scott et al 2008  depletion of neutrorophils during infection with the more attenuated dm variant of jhm resulted in a reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration increased viral replication and increased lethality leading to the conclusion that neutrophils were protective against mhv infection  however while neutrophils are important in early control of virus they can be pathogenic in generating toxic reactive oxygen species indeed the greater recruitment of neutrophils during jhmsd infection compared to a59 was demonstrated to be more destructive than protective iacono et al 2006  natural killer cells also enter the brain early in infection they secrete ifn- which may assist in clearing virus early in infection before the adaptive immune response develops iacono et al 2006 rempel et al 2004a  the adaptive immune response both b cell and t cell is important in restricting mhv infection b cell deficient mice can clear virus with normal kinetics but in the absence of neutralizing antibodies virus reappears in the cns but not the liver about two weeks post infection matthews et al 2001  scid and nude mice fail to clear virus indicating that t cells are important for clearance fazakerley et al 1992 houtman and fleming 1996a  cd8 t cells are primarily responsible for viral clearance while cd4 t cells are required for cd8 t cell recruitment and maintenance stohlman et al 1998  adoptive transfer of cd4 t cells alone does not restrict virus replication but depletion of cd4 t cells prevents cd8 t cell mediated protection sussman et al 1989  consistent with the role for cd8 t cells in viral clearance beta-2 microglobulin deficient mice which are deficient in mhc class i expression are significantly more susceptible to a59 infection gombold et al 1995  viral strain-dependent differences in t cell response make significant contributions to virulence jhmsd induces a weak t cell response while the less virulent jhm 22-v-1 and a59 induce robust responses iacono et al 2006 marten et al 2003 rempel et al 2004a  quantification of virus specific t cells after jhm 22-v-1 infection showed that priming and the initiation of t cell expansion occurs in the cervical lymph nodes cln dendritic cells dcs carrying virus or viral antigen migrate from the brain to the cln where antigenspecific t cell priming is believed to occur dorries 2001 stevenson et al 1997  treatment of dcs with pertussis toxin prevents them from migrating from the cln and in turn prevents t cell trafficking into the brain karman et al 2004  after initial expansion in the cln t cells expand further in the spleen before trafficking to the brain  infectious jhmsd is barely detectable in cln while a59 viral titers are much higher macnamara et al 2008  the induction of a robust t cell response does not map to spike as ra59s jhm induces a strong t cell response and infectious viral titers similar to a59 are detected in cln cowley et al 2010 iacono et al 2006 macnamara et al 2008 rempel et al 2004b  the cytolytic activity as well as the production of ifn- by cd8 t cells are crucial for the ability to clear infection from the cns marten et al 2001 parra et al 1999  while perforin is important for clearance from astrocytes lin et al 1997 parra et al 2001  ifn- facilitates cytolytic killing by upregulating mhc expression on infected cells and mediates clearance from oligodendrocytes parra et al 1999  the mechanism of viral clearance from neurons is not yet known as discussed above spike and nucleocapsid proteins have been implicated in strain differences in virulence several other mhv proteins have been investigated as candidate virulence determinants two mhv nonstructural proteins ns2 and ns5a have been implicated in type i interferon antagonism koetzner et al 2010unpublished  ns2 is predicted to have cyclic phosphodiesterase cdp activity mutations in either of two predicted catalytic histidines of ns2 of a59 confer the loss of the ability to replicate in the liver but have no affect on neurovirulence or in vitro replication roth-cross et al 2009  similarly a deletion of the ns2 gene of jhm had no affect on replication in vitro schwarz et al 1990  and had no detectable effect on virulence after intracranial inoculation personal communication j leibowitz and s perlman these data suggests that either the ability to resist interferon signaling is not as important in the cns as in the liver or that resistance to interferon signaling by mhv is mediated through a different mechanism in the cns ns5a like ns2 is nonessential for replication in vitro yokomori and lai 1991  but its role in neurovirulence has not been reported there are data indicating that the adenosine diphosphate ribose phosphatase adrp x or macro domain of nsp3 encoded by orf1a gorbalenya et al 1991 putics et al 2005 putics et al 2006  internal protein and ns4 are not likely to be important to the neurovirulence of jhm or a59 mutation of the predicted catalytic residue in the adrp domain of nsp3 of a59 does not alter the ability of virus to replicate in vitro or the cns unpublished data however interestingly such mutations confer reduced replication in the liver eriksson et al 2008  abrogation of the internal protein i expression in the a59 genome had no affect on replication in the cns fischer et al 1997 or lethality after intracranial inoculation unpublished data and jhm ablated for ns4 expression was similar in lethality and cns replication as wild type virus ontiveros et al 2001  there is still much to learn about the mechanisms responsible for the high neurovirulence of jhmsd these include defining the roles if any that the envelope proteins membrane m and small membrane e play in neurovirulence and determining the possible impact of the many nonstructural proteins encoded in the replicase locus and ns5a play in neurovirulence in addition it is not fully understood how viral strain differences in the innate immune response may affect pathogenesis it is also not well understood why jhmsd fails to spread to andor replicate in the cln and whether this is responsible for the weak t cell response to jhmsd infection of the cns and the ensuing high neurovirulence shown are schematic drawings of the kinetics of replication viral antigen t cells neutrophils and macrophages in the brains of c57bl6 mice infected intracranially with a59 compared with jhmsd during the first two weeks of infection note that the graph is cropped and macrophage titers by day 7 in jhmsd infected mice are approximately 4 times that of a59 jhm infected mice typically die by day 7 at a low dose 10-50 pfu of virus  fundamental protective mechanisms of face masks against droplet infections christian khler j rainer hain   at present humanity is threatened by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic the risk of severe infection with the virus depends heavily on physical factors of the infected persons and the quality of the medical system according to a recent study the estimated infection fatality ratio ifr averaged over all age-groups including those who dont have symptoms is between 02 and 16 with an average of 066 verity et al 2020 these numbers look small and the fatality risk may seem acceptable and therefore the danger is often marginalized this is surprising considering that the apollo crew the space shuttle astronauts and the allied soldiers during the 2003 iraq war took a deadly risk of this magnitude only very few people take such risks voluntarily and with full consciousness for comparison the lethal risk of a fatal accident with a commercial aircraft was 17700000 in 2008 and even such a small risk is not taken by some people considering that the ifr of the seasonal flu is about 00401 centers for disease 2010 or even much lower wong et al 2013 the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 appears to be significantly higher than for influenza flu although the numbers for sars-cov-2 are quite preliminary and the estimates may drop over time verity et al 2020 faust et al 2020 it is quite clear that the strategy of herd immunization of the population is not an option as the number of victims would be far too high great hopes for coping with the pandemic currently rest on the development of a vaccine unfortunately it is completely uncertain when an effective and well-tolerated vaccine will be generally available to contain the pandemic drugs such as chloroquine remdesivir lopinavir and ritonavir are also considered to be great sources of hope in the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 grein at al 2020 however even if one of the drugs should prove to be effective there is no guarantee that the drug can be made available to the world population in sufficient quantities in addition it is possible that despite the use of drugs going through a severe course of disease can lead to lifelong neuropsychiatric sequelae troyer et al 2020 zandifar  badrfam 2020 or cause other diseases ackermann et al 2020 varga et al 2020 containing the pandemic is therefore the only viable way to quench the spread of the virus but containing the pandemic is a difficult task as about 44 of sars-cov-2 infections are caused by people with a presymptomatic and asymptomatic course of infection he et al 2020 therefore due to the absence of symptoms many people do not know that they are infected and are spreading the virus and these people make it very difficult to trace the transmission chains furthermore about 10 of infected people are responsible for 80 of infections kupferschmidt 2020 lloyd-smith et al 2005 people who have many social contacts at work or in their private lives and who do not protect themselves and others sufficiently by observing the rules of distance and hygiene or who consider the risk of the virus to be low appear to be a serious problem in the actual pandemic for these reasons the government must act at various levels to avert great harm to the population the effectiveness of the containment strategy depends on1how societies are able to protect themselves personally against infection through hygiene social distance and technical aids such as protective masks glasses gloves2how well the infrastructure is in place to identify the infection chains and effectively contain the spread eg through mobile data collection isolation or a lockdown3how well the seriously ill can be treated in hospitals
 in view of these prospects it seems necessary for the time being to prevent the spread of the virus and to treat those infected as well as possible in order to ensure the latter the capacities of the health system must not be overloaded but it is clear that this condition means that the pandemic will last for years without a vaccine to not overload the medical system governments are pursuing the concept of containment by means of a lockdown because it proved successful in st louis during the spanish flu of 1918 this approach is quite effective when the population obeys the rules but the impact on the state economy and society is devastating when the lockdown lasts longer than a few weeks therefore this concept is not a viable way to contain the pandemic in the long term consequently it is necessary to fight the infection where it occurs understanding the transmission pathways is the key to finding effective measures to block the infection and to reliably protect healthcare workers and the population contact infection were initially assumed to be the main transmission route of sars-cov-2 today hygiene measures and the avoidance of shaking hands effectively prevent this path of infection droplet infection is currently assumed to be the main transmission route over short distances wang et al 2020 since this path of infection is via the air the rules of distance are effective soper 1919 and wells et al 1936 but it is also known that sars-cov-2 can remain infectious in aerosols for more than 3 h at least under laboratory conditions at high humidity van doremalen et al 2020 and pyankov et al 2018 it is therefore conceivable that infections can also occur under special conditions over long distances provided that the local virus concentration reaches the minimum infection dose due to poor air exchange in rooms a significant proportion of the aerosol exhaled by humans has a diameter of less than 10 m johnson et al 2011 when breathing speaking singing and coughing it is also known that the size and number of droplets increases with the volume of the voice asadi et al 2019 loudon  roberts 1968 and it is known that upper respiratory tract diseases increase the production of aerosol particles lee et al 2019 water droplets of this size evaporate within a few seconds at normal humidity liu et al 2019 and rensink 2004 droplets with a diameter of 10 m for instance are evaporated after about 1 s at 50 relative humidity and larger droplets sink quickly to the ground and evaporate marin et al 2016 2019 rossi et al 2019 if the viruses are released as naked viruses together with the salt after the droplets have evaporated the spatial concentration decreases rapidly over time as the viruses no longer move in a correlated manner but quickly separate due to the chaotic turbulent flow motion the viral load thus decreases rapidly in time and space making infections over long distances or long periods of time increasingly unlikely for this reason it is most important to understand the transmission of the virus over short distances hygiene regulations and social distancing are very effective in blocking short distance infections during the lockdown the distance rules can usually be adhered to but what happens when the actual lockdown is over and the people meet again in a confined space then additional effective and efficient protection is essential to stabilise infection rates since the viruses are spread by contact and droplet infection technical devices are required that effectively intervene in the chain of infection and effectively block infection an effective protection is the respiratory mask as known since 100 years soper 1919 the sars outbreak in hong kong suggested that the use of simple face masks may have contributed to an overall reduction in the incidence of viral respiratory infections leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 another study has shown that even a simple surgical mask can effectively reduce sars infection seto et al 2003 these results are supported by recent articles chu et al 2020 howard et al 2020 leung et al 2020b zhang et al 2020 it was surprizing that for months who the cdc and many public health professionals in europe advised against wearing face masks unless someone has covid-19 or cares for someone who has covid-19 feng et al 2020 leung et al 2020a this recommendation was based on three allegations first it was said that there is no scientific evidence that face masks can protect against dropletaerosol infections second it was argued that the population will not be able to wear the masks properly third the statement that people will feel safe when wearing masks and then become careless and take risks was frequently made at the same time these experts have stressed that health professionals urgently need face masks to protect themselves effectively this contradiction has created uncertainty among the population and called into question the credibility of the experts it is a fact that particle filtration masks are recognized as legal occupational safety equipment and that the wearing of these masks in contaminated areas is required by labor law there is therefore no doubt that these masks when used correctly provide effective protection within the specification range the effectiveness of simple mouth-and-nose covers and surgical masks is less well accepted the international council of nurses icn estimates that on average 7 of all confirmed cases of covid-19 are among healthcare workers icn 2020 this illustrates that surgical masks may not provide the reliable protection against droplet infection as anticipated it is therefore very important to distinguish clearly between the different mask types when talking about their protective function unfortunately this was not done sufficiently by the virologists and politically responsible persons in the initial phase of the pandemic also the second argument is questionable why should the people of western societies not be able to protect themselves as many people in east asian countries have long been doing many people in east asian countries have already recognized through numerous pandemics that proper masks work effectively it does not seem right to regard the western population as unteachable or even incapable the third argument is also false because the opposite is true according to scientific studies kimberly et al 2020 scott et al 2007 and ruedl et al 2012 if people protect themselves personally they have dealt with the danger and therefore they benefit from the protection of the safety device and from the less risky behaviour due to insight the reason why these facts were not appreciated by the experts is due to the attempt to prevent competition for protective masks between medical personnel and the public in the meantime the general perception of the protective effect of face masks has become generally accepted in the usa the cdc has changed its guidelines and recommended that the public wear fabric face masks in other countries too it is now recommended to protect themselves with suitable masks however it is recommended by governments and professionals to wear only simple mouse-and-nose covers that can be manufactured by the people themselves or surgical masks to avoid distribution battles with medical staff for certified and comfortable particle filtration masks but the big question is how effectively these homemade mouth-and-nose covers and surgical masks can protect against droplet infection the answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour leung et al 2020 one study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with covid-19 bae et al 2020 another study suggests that any mask no matter how efficiently it filters or how well it is sealed has minimal effect unless used in conjunction with other preventive measures such as isolation of infected cases immunization good respiratory etiquette and regular hand hygiene kwok et al 2015 these findings contradict the results in leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 seto et al 2003 due to the contradiction it is understandable that experts in the media have expressed the opinion that there is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of masks and therefore the wearing of masks in public was not recommended for a long time the fallacy of politicians and virologists however was to generalize the results obtained with simple mouth-and-nose covers to all masks without differentiation in order to clarify whether or to what extent these masks offer effective protection against droplet infection and to understand why research results differ on this simple scientific question we have carried out these tests first we analyse the flow blockage caused by surgical masks when coughing as this is essential for the protection of others and because coughing is a typical symptom of covid-19 second we qualify the effectiveness of different filter materials and masks to determine the protection ability against droplets finally we prove the effect of gap flows at the edge of surgical and particle filtrating respiratory masks in contrast to the medical studies cited we apply engineering research methods of fluid mechanics the use of this research approach has several reasons firstly the detachment of droplets in the lungs and throat and their convective transport through the mouth into the atmosphere until inhalation as well as the deposit and evaporation of droplets is a purely fluid mechanical process secondly the effective blocking of the flow with suitable masks is a research subject of fluid mechanics thirdly the filtering of particles from an air stream with the aid of suitable materials is also a purely fluid mechanical problem as well as the gap flow finally this approach also has the advantage that the results are reproducible in a statistical sense since the boundary conditions are well defined we are not studying whether an infection really occurs in a special case but whether an infection is physically possible in general in the first sets of the experiments outlined in section 31 the flow field generated by coughing without and with a surgical mask is examined as coughing sets the air strongly in motion and because coughing is a typical symptom of covid-19 to measure the flow field quantitatively in space and time we use particle image velocimetry piv raffel et al 2018 for the measurements a 8 m long testing room with a cross section of 2 m  2 m was seeded with dehs di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacat tracer particles with a mean diameter of 1 m khler et al 2002 dehs was used as these droplets do not evaporate as quickly as water droplets the tracer particles provided by a seeding generator pivtec gmbh germany were illuminated in a light-sheet generated with a frequency doubled ndyag laser spitlight piv 100015 innolas laser gmbh germany the light-sheet was oriented normal to the mouth opening and parallel to the symmetry axis of the body and the longitudinal axis of the room the light scattered by the tracer particles were recorded with back illuminated scientific cmos cameras pcoedge 55 pco ag germany equipped with zeiss distagon t lens with a focal length of 35 mm and 50 mm the triggering of the system components was achieved with a programmable timing unit lavision gmbh germany the recorded series of images were evaluated with a commercial computer program davis lavision gmbh germany these quantitative piv measurements allow to determine the area that can be contaminated due to the exhaled air the velocity of the exhaled droplets and the turbulence properties of the flow in the second set of experiments discussed in section 32 common household materials currently used by the population and some medical staff to make simple masks at home were tested but also a surgical mask and a ffp3 mask to visualize their filtering properties the tested materials are given in table 1
 for the investigation a test set-up was installed which largely fulfilled the officially prescribed test conditions in europe din en 149 2009 the materials were installed one after the other in a fixed position in front of the inlet of a rectangular flow channel with a cross-section of 01 m  01 m as shown in fig 1
 the material was held in place with a special clamping device that seals tightly to the duct to avoid leakage flows to explore the filtering performance of the different materials the movement of small aerosol droplets passing through the media was observed visually in front of and behind the filter material with a digital camera we only use droplets whose diameter is less than 2 m since the removal of the smallest droplets in an air stream is the greatest challenge in mask development if these droplets can be effectively filtered out effectively then all droplets larger than 2 m can also be filtered the droplets were generated from dehs with an aerosol generator agf 20 palas gmbh dehs was used again as these droplets are long lasting consequently bias errors due to evaporation effects can be neglected a ndyag double-pulse laser evergreen 200 quantel france was used to illuminate the droplets the output beam was fanned out with a few lenses to form a 1 mm thin light-sheet the light-sheet was located in the middle of the flow channel parallel to the flow direction as indicated in fig 1 the scattered light emitted by the illuminated aerosol in the light-sheet plane was recorded with a highly sensitive pco edge 55 scmos camera equipped with a zeiss distagon t lens with a focal length of 50 mm the triggering of the system components and the data recording was realized again with the software davis from lavision the flow velocity was driven by the pressure difference between the atmosphere and the flow box the flow rate through the filter material was adjusted approximately according to the din en 149 2009 test standard 90 lmin the volume flow rate and the movement of the droplets through the filter material was measured optically with high spatial and temporal resolution using piv to calculate the volume flow rate the average flow velocity within the light-sheet plane in the flow channel was measured and it was assumed that this velocity is homogeneous over the cross section of the channel this assumption is justified as the filtering materials are homogeneous and the inflow condition is constant across the filtering material with the know size of the cross section the volume flow rate can be calculated the pressure drops provided in table 1 are calculated from the measured pressure drops and the volume flow rate it is assumed that the pressure loss is proportional to the square of the volume flow rate the pressure drop across the filter material was measured with a testo 480 testo se  co kg germany pressure transducer with an uncertainty of about 3 pa for the third set of experiments analysed in section 33 simple flow visualizations using smoke were performed in order to demonstrate the effect of the gap around the mask edge a person exhaled air seeded with tracer particles while wearing surgical and ffp2 masks in the first series of experiments one person performed a single severe cough while the piv system was measuring the flow field data the video in the supplementary material shows the temporal evolution of the process the results displayed in this subsection show instantaneous velocity fields of various independent time-resolved flow field measurements color-coded is the magnitude of the local flow velocity and the vectors indicate the direction of the flow movement at a given time step in areas where the flow movement remains close to zero over the whole recording time blue color no droplets can penetrate as only the flow can move the particles to other areas large droplets with a diameter of 1 mm or more such as those produced when sneezing lok 2016 can fly ballistic over long distances and occasionally ballistic flying droplets are produced when certain sounds are spoken but sneezing is not a typical covid-10 symptom so that this will not we considered here the small droplets that are normally produced when breathing speaking singing and coughing are immediately slowed down and then move with the flow velocity of the ambient air it is therefore important to study the air set in motion by exhalation furthermore the small droplets are particularly dangerous because they can be inhaled deep into the lungs 
fig 2
a shows that the spread of the exhaled air forms a cone like shape similar to a free turbulent jet see video the flow velocity is reaching values up to 1 ms near the mouth but due to the widening of the cone caused by the turbulent mixing and entrainment reuther  khler 2020 the flow velocity decreases in streamwise direction the widening of the area in motion reduces the viral load significantly with distance a single strong cough sets the air in motion over a distance of less than 15 m in the experiments distances of more than 15 m can be considered safe according to these results since no droplets can reach such large distances when accelerated by a single cough however if the cough lasts longer greater distances can be achieved as shown in fig 2b for this reason it is important to dynamically increase the distance to a person if the coughing stimulus is about to last longer the results in fig 2c illustrate how the spread of the airflow from the mouth during coughing is very effectively inhibited by a surgical mask physically the mask ensures that the directional jet like air movement with high exit velocity from the mouth is converted into an undirected air movement with low velocity behind the mask this is because the exhaled air increases the pressure inside the mask compared to the atmosphere outside and the pressure difference creates a flow movement in all directions this effect is of utmost importance for limiting the virus load in the environment the results show that even a simple mouth-and-nose cover or a surgical mask can effectively protect other people in the vicinity because the mask prevents the droplets from spreading over a wide area a simple mask with sufficient flow resistance therefore provides very effective protection for people in the surrounding area when infected and wearing the mask wearing a mask is therefore absolutely useful to protect others according to our quantitative measurements 
fig 2d shows the spread of exhaled air when speaking it can be clearly seen that a greater spread of the exhaled air appears than when coughing with a mask consequently wearing a mask during normal face-to-face conversations and of course also when talking on the smartphone in a human environment is extremely useful to stop the transmission of the sars-cov-2 infection via droplets it must also be taken into account that persons with a presymptomatic or asymptomatic course of infection will infect other persons most likely during face-to-face conversations a mask will therefore make an effective contribution to suppressing this significant path of infection in this section we want to find out if the material of simple mouth-and-nose covers surgical masks and ffp3 masks can protect the user from droplet infection if the surrounding air is contaminated with sars-cov-2 in this case the mask material must have good filtering properties to stop small droplets that typically occur when speaking singing and coughing since large droplets are easily filtered out by simple materials we focus on small droplets in the range between 03 and 2 m because they are produced in large fractions when speaking singing and coughing and they can penetrate deep into the lungs the droplets were distributed approx 400 mm in front of the filter materials in order to make the motion of the droplets and the filtering ability of the materials clearly visible an inhomogeneous droplet distribution was generated the flow direction is from left to right and the flow state of the incoming air is laminar if the intensity of the scattered light emanating from the droplets is large in front of the filter material left image and close to zero behind the filter material right image the droplets are almost completely filtered out through the material if on the other hand no significant reduction in intensity can be detected behind the filter material the filter effect is negligible the area of the filter mount and the channel edges are not shown in the following images since no relevant flow and droplet information is visible in these areas the results presented are qualitative but intended to be this way to provide readers with visual evidence of the particle penetration through different candidate filter media a better impression of the filter efficiency is obtained by viewing the second video in the supplementary material the comparison of the two pictures in fig 3
left shows that almost all droplets pass the tested surgical face mask unhindered consequently this mask does not provide serious self protection against droplet infection only a mixing of the droplet distribution takes place due to the porosity of the filter material it is fatal that medical personnel are often so poorly protected by these masks but it is also fatal for patients if clinical staff with a presymptomatic or asymptomatic course of infection uses these masks even worse than the surgical face masks is the hygiene mask see fig 3 right this mask is designed for catching larger objects such as hair and spook but tiny droplets such as those produced when talking singing and coughing cannot be filtered out of the air stream by the hygiene mask it should also be noted that the flow resistance of the hygiene mask is so low that even the protective mechanism described in subsection 31 does not function effectively fig 4
reveals the effectiveness of particle filtering with toilet paper with 4 layers paper towel coffee filters and microfibre cloth which also offer no serious protection against droplets in this size range only very large droplets are retained by these materials and therefore these materials are suitable for their intended use but not as filter material for small droplets it is therefore strongly discouraged to make masks from these materials with the aim of protecting oneself from infection furthermore a very strong fleece was tested which serves as a protective coating on ironing boards the material is 4 mm thick completely opaque and has a pressure drop of about 35 pa however a filter effect is not visible as indicated in fig 5
left the droplet clouds flow almost unfiltered through the fleece even several layers of a dense fabric do not have a proper filtering effect on the considered droplet sizes which escape mainly when breathing speaking singing and coughing good results could only be achieved with the material of a vacuum cleaner bag with fine dust filter properties see fig 5 right despite the small droplets used in these tests almost all droplets are reliably filtered out consequently also no larger droplets will be able to pass through the material according to the manufacturer swirl the material filters 999 of fine dust down to 03 m diameter this vacuum cleaner bag with fine dust filter therefore has better filtering properties than all tested materials and masks and even an ffp2 protective mask has poorer filtering properties as it only has to filter out 94 of the fine dust down to 06 m to meet the specifications uvex 2020 the material of vacuum cleaner bags with fine dust protection is therefore very well suited as a self-protecting mask if only the filter effect is considered however because vacuum cleaner bags are not certified clinical products they may contain unhealthy ingredients that kill bacteria and harmful fibers that may leak from the bag material it is therefore uncertain whether this material is suitable in practice as a material for a respirator mask 
fig 6
left illustrates the filtering capabilities of an ffp3 mask under the test conditions nearly all droplets are filtered out as expected therefore this mask type is very well suited to protect people from an infection by means of aerosols even when the environment is strongly contaminated with infectious droplets recently some hospitals in the usa make use of halyard h600 material to protect their employers from aerosol infection the test result of the material is displayed in fig 6 right it is clearly visible that the filtering capacity of the material is not sufficient to protect people from infection by aerosols if the environment is contaminated with the sars-cov-2 fig 7
shows with different resolution microscopic images of the halyard h600 material it is composed to fibers but the density might not be sufficient to filter the particles used in our investigation there are also tiny holes in the pockets visible which could be the reason why the aerosol passes through the material as the flow resistance at the holes is low compared to the other parts of the material the flow tests clearly show that apart from the vacuum cleaner bag and the ffp3 mask the filter effect of the tested materials is not sufficient to protect against droplet infection reliably if the environment is contaminated with sars-cov-2 even masks routinely used by medical staff in hospitals and doctors offices have almost no significant filtering effect on the droplet sizes typically produced when breathing speaking singing and coughing the results are therefore in good agreement with the results from leung et al 2020 and davies et al 2013 and kwok et al 2015 but why has wearing these masks been shown to provide effective protection against infection with the virus in the sars epidemic as shown in leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 and seto et al 2003 because a mask is important not only because of its filtering ability but to limit the droplet propagation as discussed in section 31 so in combination with distances these mask can protect if only a few people are infected in the surrounding the results in bae et al 2020 leung et al 2020 are correct but they do not consider the full performance of masks but only a partial aspect therefore the conclusions in the articles are not universal the findings in leung et al 2003 lo et al 2005 seto et al 2003 are understandable when the full performance of masks in blocking infections is considered unfortunately wearing a simple mouth-and-nose cover may be less comfortable than wearing a particle filtering face mask in effect this can promote a smear infection since all these transmissions of infection are possible in daily life wearing a comfortable mask is essential to block human-to-human transmission by smear and droplet infection to ensure the best possible protection a particle filtering mask should be used if the number of infected persons in the environment and the viral load in the room is unknown at present social distancing practices and universal masking wearing seem to be the best methods of containing viral pandemic without stricter lockdown policies and without vaccines some recent studies show that even the simple materials we have tested have some filtering ability davies et al 2013 drewnick 2020 konda et al 2020 and van der sande et al 2008 we do not question these results although the pressure drops in one study is anomalously low see supporting information in konda et al 2020 but we state explicitly that a material that does not have an adequate filtering ability equivalent to an ffp2n95kn95 mask cannot be recommended as a filter material for self-protection against droplet infection statistically speaking every loss of performance leads to an increase in the number of infected people and thus to an increase in the number of death it is therefore very dangerous to recommend materials with some filtering properties as possible materials for self-protection masks but there is another important aspect that will be discussed next according to the previous section one might argue that a mouth-and-nose cover or surgical mask made of a good filter material would provide good protection against infection when infected people are in the vicinity or the room is contaminated with viruses but that will not usually be the case air takes the path of least resistance as these masks do not seal tightly enough with the face droplets can flow unhindered past the edge of the mask when inhaled and exhaled and reach the lungs or the environment if the mask does not fit properly this will even be the rule this is illustrated in fig 8
were a person is exhaling air during an easy exhalation without physical exertion left strong breathing during physical exertion middle and when coughing right the first video in the supplementary material shows the animated sequences the analysis shows that it is very important do differentiate between mouth-and-nose cover surgical mask and particle filtering respirator mask because they differ substantial in their fundamental protection properties face masks can offer three fundamental different kind of protection1they effectively prevents a smear infection as the wearers of the masks no longer perform their habitual grip on the face and thus no longer bring the virus from the hand into the mouth or nose howard et al 20202the flow resistance of the mask greatly limits the spread of viruses in the room this significantly reduces the risk of infection in the vicinity of an infected person protection of third parties3the inhalation of droplets containing viruses can be prevented by using a tight-fitting mask with particle filtering properties self-protection
 the first fundamental protection mechanism can be reached by all face masks if they fit well and sit comfortably if not the user will touch the face even more than usual to correct the fit of the mask as this can increase the risk of smear infection a good fit of the mask is very important the first and second fundamental protection mechanisms are fulfilled by all masks that have sufficient flow resistance if the mask is worn and a candle can easily be blown out despite the mask the mask does not fulfil this function and should not be used all three fundamental protection mechanisms can be only achieved with ffp2n95kn95 or better particle filtering respirator mask typical materials currently used by the public to build masks reduce the risk of smear infection and effectively prevent the widespread spread of viruses in the environment therefore the use of these mouse-and-nose covers and surgical masks are very important to prevent smear infection and droplet infection to others if the distance is not too close as these masks do not have a significant particle-filtering protective effect against droplets that are typically produced when breathing speaking singing coughing and sneezing they should not be used if the environment is contaminated like in hospitals even when the distance rules are followed to achieve effective self-protection in a virus-contaminated environment masks with particle filtering properties ffp2n95kn95 are absolutely necessary from our point of view if a large number of infected persons are present and distance rules cannot be achieved a very good particle filtration mask ffp3 or better is strongly recommended if these general rules are followed and all people use suitable particle-filtering respirators correctly the transmission of viruses via dropletsaerosols can be effectively prevented otherwise these types of masks would never have received certification nor would they be a core component of the personal protective equipment in hospitals and other environments therefore proper face masks can save lives while maintaining social life and securing the economy and the state but universal masking alone is not enough for two reasons first many people are not very good at following rules consistently therefore it is advisable to observe the rules of hygiene and distance and to be careful even when wearing a mask in the event of a car accident the occupants are also protected by various devices bumpers crumple zone safety belts airbags head and legroom autonomous assistance systems  second some people are extremely bad at following rules either because they do not want to or because they simply cannot these people can become super spreaders therefore the early detection of sources of infection and their isolation remains important beside universal masking and the rules of hygiene and distance  covid-19 surface persistence a recent data summary and its importance for medical and dental settings luca

marco cicci   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 belonging to the coronavirus family an infected person may experience symptoms after an incubation period that could vary from about 2 to 14 days there have rarely been cases of incubation periods of 29 days during which time the person could still be contagious to limit transmission precautions should be taken such as adopting careful personal hygiene washing hands frequently and wearing masks coronavirus mainly affects the lower respiratory tract and causes a number of symptoms described as flu-like including fever cough shortness of breath muscle pain tiredness and gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea in severe cases pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis and septic shock could occur up to the death of the patient among the collective preventive measures it should be noted that in 2003 during the sars epidemic the major collective catering companies in china and hong kong adopted the obligation to wear surgical masks for their service personnel to protect both the workers of companies and the public this professional category is particularly exposed to potentially infectious contacts both active and passive in the same way a person in charge of equipment who is not equipped with the appropriate personal protective equipment ppe will find themselves exposed to contact with the dirty dishes and recent food remains of a large number of customers further interventions in the restaurant sector may include a prohibition on the distribution of buffets for both food and dishes 1234 in recent weeks there has been about a great deal of discussion about the contamination and decontamination of inanimate surfaces in fact the duration before inactivation of the covid-19 virus on surfaces liquid solid or gaseous is still debated in most cases the spread between people occurs through the respiratory droplets emitted by an infected individual through coughing or sneezing which are subsequently inhaled by a healthy person who is nearby this also caused an initial diffidence on the part of people in purchasing products of any kind coming including by post from the areas affected by the epidemic leading to economic damage it is possible to become infected by touching surfaces or objects where the virus is present and then bringing your hands towards your mouth nose or eyes 5678910 in ideal conditions the virus can in fact persist on different surfaces for hours or days the surfaces most exposed to this type of transmission include for exampledoor handleslift or light buttonsmobile phonespublic transport handholds 11121314 the viral titration viral assay or viral count is the count made in the laboratory of the number of viral particles of a given virus under examination present in a biological sample it is used in microbiological research diagnostics and in the production of antiviral vaccinesall situations that require knowledge of the amount of virus being analyzed or used we used tissue-culture infectious dose tcid per milliliter for covid-19 persistence evaluation 1516171819 the aim of this article is to evaluate through the analysis of the current literature how long this virus can remain active on different surfaces it is too early to be able to carry out a review with meta-analysis of the literature given the incredible relevance of this topic but it is certainly a step to clarify this pandemic the following questions were used to develop the study framework according to the pico populationinterventioncomparisonoutcomes guidelineswhat is the persistence of sars-cov-2 on surfaceswhat is the mean persistence of coronaviruses compared to sars-cov-2 an investigation methods protocol was used according to the prisma statement the aim of the prisma statement is to help authors improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses it can be used as a basis for reporting reviews of other types of research the use of checklists like prisma is likely to improve the reporting quality of a systematic review and provides substantial transparency in the selection process of papers in a systematic review furthermore pico guidelines have been used to prepare summary questions 202122 the full texts of all studies

analysis in table 1 the aim of this table is to summarize coronaviruses persistence time van doremalen et al 26 evaluated the stability of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 in aerosols and different surfaces they evaluated these viruses decay rates using bayesian linear regression they conducted their experiment using aerosols  5 m containing sars-cov-2 10525 50 tissue-culture infectious dose tcid50 per

are shown in table 1 the data were expressed as 50 tissue-culture infectious dose tcid50 it is important to specify that the limit of detection for this experiment was 333  1005 tcid50 per liter of air for aerosols 1005 tcid50 per milliliter of medium for plastic steel and cardboard and 1015 tcid50 per milliliter of medium for copper kampf et al 27 showed how different coronaviruses could persist on different types of inanimate surfaces they also evaluated some environmental characteristics such as temperature or humidity they showed how human coronavirus could be influenced by temperature as 30 or 40 c reduced the duration of persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces however at the temperature of 4 c the persistence could be greater than or equal to 28 days another important result is that the persistence was longer with higher inocula warnes et al 28 evaluated coronaviruses persistence on metal and non-metal samples they inoculated 103 plaque forming units pfu on different materials polyfluorotetraethylene teflon ptfe polyvinyl chloride pvc ceramic tiles glass and stainless steel coronaviruses persistence was at least 5 days and 3 days for silicon rubber at 21 c despite this it could be rapidly inactivated by brass and copper nickel surfaces in less than 60 min copper nickel surfaces were effective but less than brass copper in these cases the inactivation time was up to 5 min in the fingertip contamination model warnes et al demonstrated how a higher percentage of copper could lead to superior antiviral properties another important factor reported in this study was that the release of ions from copper and the formation of reactive oxygen species ros take part in the deactivation of the virus furthermore the authors report that following an analysis carried out with a transmission electron microscope tem the virus was normally present on common surfaces such as stainless steel but on copper surfaces it appeared to be damaged and intact particles were few it was not possible to conduct a bias risk analysis according to the prisma statement as specified in the previous section unfortunately the limited number of articles obtained does not allow for the realization of a systematic review the individual studies were analyzed and the experiments leading to the results shown in table 1 were rigorously conducted and are repeatable analyses 29 the literature concerning the characteristics of these viruses is still scarce especially if one considers only covid-19 the aspects related to the persistence of the virus on surfaces not only represent an environmental and public health problem concerning schools roads offices it is a much bigger problem if hospitals operating theaters and sanitary waiting rooms are considered especially in the new and continuously increasing covid departments knowing how the virus behaves in contact with surfaces and with different disinfectants could be important for the sanitization of medical environments in particular some authors deal with the optimization of infection control in operating rooms some devices are used in hospital operating rooms for single use only but other devices surfaces handles and cords could be transmission vehicles 30 ong et al 2020 31 evaluated the presence of coronavirus in a hospital room of covid-19 patients some surfaces such as the toilet bowl and the sink were positive room air samples and samples collected after cleaning were negative the time span varied according to the characteristics of the type of surface the less-porous ones like plastic and steel were the worst because they absorb droplets less easily preserving the active virus additionally the different environmental conditions could affect the amount of ventilation of the rooms and the humidity 26 according to van doremalen et al 26 aerosol and surface virus transmission is plausible since it can remain viable and infectious for hours or days kampf et al 27 showed how human coronaviruses can remain infectious on surfaces for up to 9 days at room temperature this is an important factor about coronaviruses spread from this it is easy to see that if someone tends to touch the environment oftenespecially if not properly disinfectedthe possibility of becoming infected increases furthermore the droplets present in the form of an aerosol of an infected patient can not only easily spread but also easily settle and last for several hours on a surface kampf et al 27 investigated different biocidal agents on coronaviruses they demonstrated how ethanol 7895 2-propanol 70100 the combination of 45 2-propanol with 30 1-propanol glutardialdehyde 0525 formaldehyde 071 and povidone iodine 02375 readily inactivated coronavirus infectivity by approximately 4 log10 or more sodium hypochlorite required a minimal concentration of at least 021 to be effective hydrogen peroxide was effective with a concentration of 05 and an incubation time of 1 min an important finding is the ineffectiveness of chlorhexidine within 10 min a concentration of 02 revealed no efficacy against coronavirus it is a result that does not support some guidelines for dentistry 32 kampf et al 27 concluded that these viruses can remain on surfaces up to 9 days and that surface disinfection could be performed with 01 sodium hypochlorite or 6271 ethanol for 1 minute according to warnes et al 26 coronavirus persists in an infectious state on surfaces for several days warnes et al 26 demonstrated the survival of coronaviruses on different surfaces for up to 5 days concerning the persistence of the virus on different surfaces and in particular on metals containing copper these findings are interesting and could lead to the development of new surfaces with viricidal or bactericidal properties in confined environments especially if poorly ventilated viral particles of less than 01 m in size may remain in the environment as a secondary aerosol studies on the topic indicate that a sneeze could release up to 2 million droplets into the air less than a million from a cough and about 3000 from speaking out loud the droplets eliminated from the airways if larger than 100 m from a height of 2 m settle on flat surfaces in 36 s and reach horizontally about 15 m away then evaporate rapidly dry and become solid material this material reaches a size of 23 m studies on tuberculosis have shown that this material maintaining its infectious capacity could be inhaled and thanks to its size reach the most peripheral parts of the lungs becoming a secondary biological aerosol 26 there has not been much discussion about the importance of ventilating environments to prevent sars-cov-2 infection and although the viral particles have not been studied sufficiently for their ability to achieve dangerous concentrations from a distance in confined environments increased ventilation in an environment is believed to reduce the cross-infection of airborne diseases therefore existing recommendations could be amended to include ventilating public spaces including means of transport with suitable means it is essential to focus on preventing infection by using ventilation suitable to reduce the infectious capacity of the coronavirus it has been widely demonstrated that natural ventilation causes better air exchange compared to mechanical ventilationup to 69 changes per hour of rooms when the windows are completely open 33 most international guidelines recommend about 12 changes per hour for isolation rooms in case of infections medical and dental staff will have to work safely and this is complicated by the fact that there are still no official guidelines that tell them how to behave moreover as suggested by spagnuolo et al dentists should avoid the scheduling of any patient only such urgent dental diseases can be considered during the covid-19 outbreak the waiting time of patients in dental offices could highly predispose patients to be infected when dentists treat patients they should intercept potentially infected persons before they reach the operating areas for example identifying those with a fever measuring 375 c and posing a few questions about the patients general health status in the last 7 days and about the risk of having been in contact with other infected persons dentists as well as medical office employees should always be covered by facial masks and they should remind patients to maintain the 1-m distance with each other during their waiting time 3435 disinfecting surfaces is one of the aspects to which to give greater attention being done with the detergents already in use today along with the washing of hands and the use of suitable ppe in regards to ppe surgical masks must be used by those who could transmit the virus but those who work in contact with the patients aerosol must use ffp2 and ffp3 filtering facepiece particles masks there should only be one patient in waiting rooms this is also true in clinical areas in the case of minors who need an escort the escort must be at a distance from operators and must wear a surgical mask at the end of each session the surfaces will then have to be cleaned and the air exchanged the same procedures should be adopted in the waiting room and in other areas where the patient might pass or touch objects certainly some tools such as quick tests once validated can become useful in the hands of the doctordentist to understand if the patient or some member of their team is potentially infected we are aware of the limitations of this article it is not possible to make a review of the literature due to the lack of data so this is only a summary of the available information further studies are needed in order to verify the persistence times of coronavirus on surfaces more precisely however we have considered proceeding with the creation of this summary while respecting the guidelines of systematic reviews and also not having sufficient numbers the reason for this choice lies in the incredible topicality and reliability of the data obtained with the hope that this work could be widely and immediately used to contain the pandemic the purpose of this summary is to draw a line and clarify the characteristics of sars-cov-2 with regard to its persistence on surfaces this article is of great interest and could be used to write new guidelines by epidemiologists having a clear summary of the current situation from our analysis it is possible to deduce some aspects the virus can reach surfaces in the form of an aerosol therefore following nebulization through people sneezing or coughing or electromedical machinery infection via surfaces should be considered since the latter could remain viable and infectious for hours or days on average the different coronaviruses persist in an infectious state on surfaces for several days even up to nine surface disinfection could be performed with 01 sodium hypochlorite or 6271 ethanol for 1 minute copper has shown antiviral propertiesso much so that the virus appears damaged or altered on copper surfaces other experiments are certainly needed on different surfaces or even on biological surfaces to better understand the persistence times of this virus and promote adequate standards  comparison of sars-cov-2 exit strategies building blocks elad barkan smadar shilo yeela talmor-barkan  we consider and compare various exit strategy building blocks and key measures to mitigate the current sars-cov-2 pandemic some already proposed as well as improvements we suggest our comparison is based on a computerized simulation integrating accumulated sars-cov-2 epidemiological knowledge our results stress the importance of immediate on-symptom isolation of suspected cases and household members and the beneficial effects of prompt testing capacity our findings expose significant epidemic-suppression differences among strategies with seemingly similar economic cost stressing the importance of not just the portion of population and business that is released but also the pattern the most effective building blocks are the ones that integrate several base strategies -they allow to release large portions of the population while still achieving diminishing viral spread however it may come with a price on somewhat more complex schemes for example our simulations indicate that dividing the population into two groups completely released except for taking turns on a long weekend fri-tue self-isolation once every two weeks while protecting the 5 most sensitive population would reduce r below 1 even if ten percent of the population does not follow it we further simulate the contrasting approach of a stratified population release in a hope to achieve herd immunity which for the time being seems inferior to other suggested building blocks knowing the tradeoff between building blocks could help optimize exit strategies to be more effective and suitable for a particular area or country while maximizing human life as well as economic value given our results we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable socio-economic burden  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was declared as a pandemic by the world health organization 1  unfortunately no vaccine is available at this time therefore mitigation actions are being taken to minimize both the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy and the spread of the virus currently taken measures are mostly social distancing isolation of cases and suspected cases contact tracing higher levels of hygiene facial masks wearing and mass population quarantines which cause vast socio-economical damage 2-6  going forward theres a need to easen some of the measures to allow economic activity while minimizing viral health damage one extreme approach is a stratified release of population lower risk first the idea is that lower risk individuals would contract the virus recover and gain immunity thus slowing the epidemic rate for future uninfected individuals the hope is that by the time higher risk individuals are released the infection probability is greatly reduced and thus infection of the higher risk group is largely reduced hence the term  herd immunity  care is taken to release at a rate that would not overload the healthcare system in the other extreme there are mitigation building blocks based on social distancing these are deliberate measures taken to restrict slow and limit the spread of the virus such that only a very small number of individuals will end up infected until the disease is eradicated or a vaccination is available social distancing measures could reduce the probability of contracting the virus given a contact for example using facial masks or reducing the rate of contacts of infected and susceptible individuals -thus reducing the spread of the virus 4 5 6 7  these measures typically include keeping a large portion of the population at home either constantly or intermittently the challenge is how to reduce the economic and social cost of such measures to an acceptable level while controlling for viral spread the mid-term goal is keeping r t 1 through social distancing measures where r t indicates at every time t how many secondary infections are caused on average by a single infected case r t 1 means the disease is spreading at an exponential growth rate as each case causes more than a new single case and r t 1 means the disease is diminishing as each case causes less than a new single case the special case of r t 1 or very close to one is not so theoretic and suggests the disease continues at a fixed rate of new daily cases in such a case a short intervention can reduce the number of daily cases and then we can continue with the same measures but in a lower rate of new daily cases reduction of new daily cases could also assist in contact tracing if done manually -which further slows the epidemic r t at time zero is called the basic reproduction number r 0  for sars-cov-2 the exact number is under active research and it could change from one country to another or given different environmental conditions 8-10  with many estimated values in the range of 22-32 which means each case causes 22-32 new cases unless people have already been infected and cannot get infected twice when social distancing measures are taken the reproduction rate changes and it is then denoted by r instead of r 0  social distancing measures have a potentially high price tag attached to them both economically and socially therefore once the rate of new infections is low enough we want to keep r t 1 but close to 1 with measures that cost the least the situation is constantly changing and keeping r t 1 but close to 1 is a moving target -for example there are constant changes in human behaviour public attention and public resilience weather 1112 changes local outbreaks and so on and all could affect r t  we need to dynamically try different measures so we keep r t 1 but close to 1 while probing and estimating the current situation therefore we could occasionally cross the line to r t 1 which means growing infection rates until we take actions to reduce r t  the price paid for social distancing interventions is also in the difficulty of implementing them complex measures could mean less compliance and less success in implementation and eventual effectiveness as the current goal is to keep r t around 1 and the situation is constantly changing information and response speed are the key the consequences of quick feedback are priceless compared with alternatives if the feedback loop for an action taken is 14-21 days and during this time the virus could be back propagating at doubling the number of cases every 3-4 days we could be expecting 3-7 sequential multiplications ie 8-128 fold increase 2 3 to 2 7  in the number of new infections and following a similar increase in icu beds therefore lack of prompt feedback typically through mass-testing leads to a need to maintain a large spare capacity maintaining spare capacity has a large cost associated with it both monetary and possibly in human life we propose how to promptly estimate the number of new infections and thus gain a short response time to actions taken in the first part of the paper key mitigation measures are suggested the second part of the paper focuses on comparison between building blocks in terms of their effectiveness in controlling r t 1 and effectiveness in terms of percent of population business-day that is released surprisingly there is a large difference in epidemic-control effectiveness of strategies while having similar economic costs by releasing the population to a similar extent the key is not just the portion of the population that is released but also the release pattern this finding suggests that exit strategies could be optimized for both viral spread and economic value the more successful strategies were the more complex ones integrating several ideas gaining understanding of the tradeoff is important as it could assist in building an exit strategy suited for a specific area in a way that is cost effective and communicable to the public so compliance would be high for each building block we give the resulting reduction in r as indicated by our simulation for example dividing the population into two groups which take turns on a long weekend fri-tue self-isolation once every two weeks while protecting the 5 most sensitive population would reduce r below 1 even if ten percent of the population does not follow it the division to groups can be made on a personal rather than on a household basis we give special consideration to the herd immunity approach given the knowledge that has already accumulated our results indicate that for now social distancing is expected to be a significantly more effective approach than herd immunity with significantly less casualties across all age groups a word of caution our results are based on a seir agent-based simulator which we built based on israeli population structure of nine million people and based on existing knowledge on sars-cov-2 epidemiological behavior the simulations are performed in a 1-day iteration cycle simulating a period of one year we distinguish between infection within a household and outside as existing literature shows the virus spreads significantly in familial infection clusters 13  various exit-strategy building blocks are fed into the simulator so their outcome can be assessed given the existing knowledge the simulation is executed 10 times over each set of parameters but with different random choices standard deviation of the results in these runs are given in time-based figures when a point value is given it corresponds to the mean result the exact structure and full list of assumptions is given in the supplementary at the end of this paper we propose that the single most cost-effective epidemic control is immediate self-isolation of the entire household upon the first symptom 14 suspected as related to coronavirus of someone in the household release from isolation is only after a negative laboratory result of the first person in the household to have shown a symptom and provided that the other members of the household do not show any symptoms related to coronavirus in our simulations after this measure is taken r dropped from r 0 303 to r154 this is a dramatic drop by a factor of 154303  0508 this drop is compared to the second-best epidemic control measure immediate self-isolation on the first symptom of a person without other household members which results in r22 a 223030726 factor drop if the symptomatic person self-isolates on symptoms but we wait with household isolation until the virus test for the symptomatic person returns positive and assuming a 5-day delay we get a much inferior situation with r165 the effect size in this case between an immediate household isolation to a delayed one 154165  093 is comparable to the effect of facial masks with protection factor of 10 283303093 see figure 2  these few days post symptoms and before diagnosis could be critical for reducing further infections directly or through other household members 15  see figure  1  if vast and prompt tests are in place the difference between household isolation and personal isolation upon symptoms diminishes as household members are assumed to enter isolation upon a positive test for one household member and get checked themselves immediate self-isolation of the entire household achieves an immediate stop to further spreading of the virus of both possibly affected but asymptomatic members and possibly other affected but presymptomatic household members without fast and prompt testing it would probably not be enough to isolate just the symptomatic person as research based on experience in china shows that a large proportion of the infections occur within households 13 16  see particular example 17  patients are pre-symptomatic in the first few days after infection while still being possibly infecting furthermore its estimated that a vast portion of the infections are made by pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic 18-23  social distancing measures taken outside the household reduces non-household infections the declining infection rate between households means that relatively more infection occurs within a household it is also interesting to notice that areas with larger households are likely to suffer from a higher r even if all other parameters are the same our simulations show that a self household isolation even on the basis of fever alone of one of the members has a dramatic effect in preventing the spread of the epidemic and should be used together with any other measures taken 24  four options no isolation self-isolation of a person upon the first symptom self isolation of a person upon the first symptom together -household members join after a test returns positive 5 days later self-isolation of the entire household upon the first symptom self-isolation upon symptoms dramatically shortens the spreading period a study on chinese experience in shenzhen shows it took an average of 46 days after symptoms onset to isolate an infected person which was reduced to 27 days if the person was isolated due to contact tracing and not symptoms 13  one implementation option is that every person of a household shall self-test for fever every day with possible daily online compulsory reporting of body temperature as well as onset of other symptoms body temperature could also be checked in key public locations or entry points we estimate the daily number of new people with fever by assuming 03 percent of the adult population shows fever signs of above 38 celsius at any given day 25  and dividing by an average conservative duration of a non-covid-19 fever disease of 1-4 days 26-28  therefore an order of 7500 to 30000 isolations shall occur daily and thus this number of daily tests for this purpose would be needed for a country the size of israel about 9 million people only if the first symptomatic household member is found to be infected a test would be carried out to the other family members -so the extra tests due to infected household members is expected to be insignificant compared to the background symptomatic non-sars-cov-2 cases an improvement to reduce the amount of tests would be using machine learning algorithms utilizing additional external data to release a household from self-isolation without the need for a laboratory test for the virus such external data can include the prevalence of coronavirus in the surrounding area prevalence of other infectious diseases in the area workplace or by information on personal location voluntarily collected and stored on household members mobile phones 29 etc proposal 2 focus testing capacity on self-isolated households focus testing capacity on quickly testing self-isolated households this approach simultaneously serves three important purposes in parallel 1 quick and accurate measure of actual coronavirus spread -as on average symptoms onset about 52 days after infection 30  and households enter immediate self-isolation immediate testing gives an accurate and near real-time measure of virus spread in the community and could prevent the need for population survey-testing for the virus 2 effective contact tracing -given self-isolated households contain the population with the highest risk of being infected that could have already continued unidentified infection chains theres importance in locating those that are really infected and trace their contacts to isolate them when testing is done quickly enough we have better chances of isolating the non-household individuals that got infected by the detected cases before they infect others we note that we did not include contact tracing effects in our simulations so the total combined effect of isolation and quick testing could be even stronger than we report 3 public compliance and fast reporting -when the logic behind self-household isolation is shared with the public and the public knows that they would be released in a short time from self-isolation if they didnt contract coronavirus the public is more likely to comply with the instructions and with compliance the virus spread would reduce as symptoms might be mild to begin with people might delay the request for a test in the simulations we assume this delay would be half a day on average as we conservatively assumed people would only comply when having fever symptoms and fever can be tested when entering the workplace schools and in a variety of other public places if testing is fast enough it suffices to isolate only the symptomatic person until results arrive in the unfortunate scenario that there is not enough testing capacity to cover all the new symptomatic candidates the importance of the proposed self-household isolation is even greater as effective contact tracing would not be possible and infection has a significant familial base 13  in such a case sample testing of the isolated households might still provide a good proxy for the spread of the infection it should be noted that not testing all the isolated population could lead to increasing public in-acceptance perhaps when the number of new infections is high and its likely the symptoms are due to sars-cov-2 infection people would accept a delay in testing probably less when the number of new infections shall drop to a few a day and the chances of justified isolation shall be minimal yet crucial in preventing relapse many countries regularly recommend the entire population unless contraindicated to vaccinate against seasonal influenza towards the winter 31  we suggest strengthening this recommendation towards the winter this year seasonal influenza could cause coronavirus-like initial symptoms 32  and vaccination shall reduce the background noise of seasonal influenza symptoms which could reduce the number of needed tests in addition reduction in influenza reduces pressure on the healthcare system and keeps the population in a healthier starting point in short reduction in influenza allows to focus scarce resources on the coronavirus front likewise the standard vaccination schedule should be kept and its importance communicated to the public as the cost of facial masks is low and absent information counties are tempted to instruct the population to wear facial masks in addition to increased hygiene 4-6  the hope is that these measures could reduce random infection by sars-cov-2 23  whether these alone could stop the epidemic and what their contribution would be if any is unknown at this time nevertheless in figure 2  we provide three simulations assuming facial masks and hygiene measures reduce infection outside home by 10 30 and 50 respectively note we assume the measures are taken only while outside home so household infection remains the same see further analysis in the supplementary  we compare the efficiency of several key exit strategies building blocks comparing how much they are efficient in stopping the epidemic in terms of r while in relation to how effective they are the amount of average released business days they allow for the population we summarize results of the partial release options in figure 3  exit strategies building blocks we considered  discussed above 1 do nothing -let the virus swipe the population dn 2 immediate self-isolation upon symptoms isi 3 immediate self-household-isolation upon symptoms ishi 4 dn  wearing facial masks when outside home dnmasks 5 ishi  wearing facial masks when outside home ishimasks 6 intermittent release intermittent release of population see 33 7 release certain percent of the population quarantine the rest the released group does not change across days 8 release 95 of the population with 1-week quarantines as needed release 95 healthiest by households then a week quarantine is entered if virus spread causes above 2e -5 2 in 100000 true positive new household isolations daily averaged for a week 9 improved two-group intermittent release suggested below 10 improved two-group intermittent with fixed 10 release suggested below a special category of its own of deliberate exposure while controlling exposure order 11 herd immunity -described below in all strategies except dn isi and herd immunity we isolated households upon the first symptom for all simulations we assumed leakage of infection from the released population to the quarantined population such that being quarantined reduces the probability of infection from outside sources by a factor of 100 compared to the released population while we cannot justify the exact factor the need to model leakage is undoubted as theres always some level of incompliance special needs that require going outside need to buy supplies human mistakes etc personal risk prediction was based on a mocked personal coronavirus mortality prediction -see supplementary and for a household as the average risk for the household members alternatively risk can be evaluated by age based on sars-cov-2 estimated infection fatality rate in all simulations except dn isi ishidnmasks and ishimasks we kept the top 5 highest-risk household in isolation to protect them in practice other protection measures for sensitive populations are required together with sensitive locations -these are outside

preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted april 28 2020   in this family of strategies we greatly improve an earlier proposed family of strategy 33  in these strategies we release the population based on 14-day cycles for a varying number of consecutive days depending on the particular variant in the remainder of the days in the cycle the previously released population is set on quarantine which we refer to as washout period  during the washout period some of those who contracted the virus in the preceding release days would become symptomatic hence they will be washed out from further infecting others before the next cycle begins another advantage of this family of strategies is that during the washout days r t is smaller due to the reduction in interactions we suggest three improvements that together with ishi make a big difference 1 dynamic and gradual number of release days  vs quarantine days the object is to add as many release days while keeping r t below 1 based on measured near real-time r t discussed above if r t is below 1 and the load on the healthcare system is reasonable and the number of new true-positive daily household isolations is below desired threshold we add a release day on expense of a quarantine day in a cycle if r is growing above 1 we deduct a release day on the expense of a quarantine day in each 14-days cycle we manage to significantly increase the number of release days in a cycle from 4 suggested in the original idea 33 to 9 thanks to our ishi isolation procedure and despite that we assumed r 0 303 additional measures could further increase the number of release days while keeping r t  1 we suggest to divide the population into two groups a and b whose quarantine days are disjoint but their release days can be joined the population can be divided household-wise the strength of this improvement is that while it keeps the washout periods in place it further reduces infection on days that only one group is released on each day that only one group is released the number of interactions decrease and limit further infection in the group thus r is effectively reduced of the possible day-divisions between the groups we suggest divisions which maximizes the number of business days in an equal manner between the groups we give several examples in the tables below and note that with this adaptation we can improve to 10 workdays out of a 14 days cycle while keeping r below 1 12 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer

weekend fri-mon once every two weeks suffices to reduce r below 1 under our model assumptions one of the possible difficulties in implementing a two-group approach is dividing into two groups based on households rather than on a person by person basis surprisingly our simulations show that the difference in the basis of division is not significant in respect to r while it could make a big difference in the ease of implementation therefore we suggest this improvement of dividing to groups based on a personal basis this basis can also be set by the workplace as long as it makes sure the division is such that it lowers in-workplace physical interaction although effective a two-group approach can be difficult to implement mainly as some employees are essential and are needed at their workplace more than their group designates them or the group division is violated due to poor compliance therefore we present an option allowing a fixed release rate in parallel to the two groups for example a fixed 10 of the population could be released all the time regardless of the group division this improvement makes the scheme more real at the cost of somewhat elevated r -see figure 4 for 80 business days as we see while the cost in terms of r is significant rising from r098 for two groups 10-4 days division on personal based group-division to r103 with additional 10 fixed population release -its still very close to 1 even with just the addition of facial masks or hygiene at 10 protection it would bring us to r093 this improvement allows for a long weekend fri-mon once every two weeks with division on a personal basis with 10 of the people in complete noncompliance -a dramatic improvement in implementability while still keeping r below 1 13 all rights reserved no reuse

perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted april 28 2020  httpsdoiorg1011012020042320072850 doi medrxiv preprint we discuss herd immunity separately from other strategy building blocks as it is the only strategy that aims at increasing infection rates -even if only in certain age groups in an attempt to protect the rest and perhaps the economy all other strategies are focused on preventing further infection as such herd immunity has one big advantage over all other strategies -immunity from relapse under the assumption that a person cannot get infected twice this advantage is believed to be only a temporary one as the general belief is that if we wait long enough -there will be a vaccine that will provide immunity without the need to get large portions of the population sick or that global efforts of social distancing and testing will eventually eradicate the disease the logic behind the herd immunity approach is that the lowest risk households are released first and as they are low-risk they shall have a reduced demand rate of healthcare resources and reduced casualties rate the low-risk groups shall then be first to contract the virus recover and gain immunity thus the virus transmission is reduced as those that recover do not infect others and cannot get sick again further groups of increasing risk are then released too in a measured rate as not to exceed healthcare capacity the extremely high-risk groups shall be released last once the epidemic is over therefore we release the lowest-risk 25 immediately and release further 5 of the population every two weeks until icu is at 1 capacity as a result icu utilization peaks and slightly overshoots and we continue releasing higher risk groups every two weeks once icu capacity is back to at least 50 capacity again the herd immunity approach tries to infect as many of the released population as fast as possible in the beginning so we did not isolate symptomatic households at start we employ the ishi procedure to slow virus transmission only after 60 of the population has been released we depict simulation results for herd immunity in figure 5 vs a two group 10-4 strategy with division into two groups on personal basis allowing up to 10 complete noncompliance and using facial masks outside hume assuming 10 protection the later strategy allows more release business days on average in a 1-year period -778 vs 71 for herd immunity 1 too many need to get infected herd immunity is by far an outlier strategy with the largest amount of infections from what we currently know we dont expect herd immunity to appear before over 60 of the population contracts the virus while its reasonable to assume that a person shall not contract the virus twice in a short period its still an unknown risk even for a small country the size of israel of about 9 million people it means about 5400000 million people need to get infected -and just for israel infecting that many people could result in mistakes being multiplied in very large numbers and almost definite leakage of infection to more sensitive populations that cannot be really protected in 100 of total isolation for months -resulting in many casualties 2 closes the door to potential luck we might get lucky and have the summer eliminate the epidemic as happened with some other viral infections -or other measure being successful we might have an effective medicine that will allow people to get infected without serious consequences with herd immunity at this point -we wont enjoy this luck or enjoy it in a limited way 3 inefficient costly for the economy and inhumane as it will take too long to implement we take for example israel which has a relatively young and healthy population structure it is expected to take many months of quarantine given the limited capacity of the healthcare system keeping a large portion of the population under quarantine for a prolonged period of time -which can be considered inhumane we simulate a year ahead and give the herd immunity approach the advantage that we ignore death after a 1-year period as can be seen in figure 3 and figure 5  we have other strategies that can at least potentially hold the situation with minimal number of infections and casualties for for a relatively low cost until we have a vaccine for example 4 too many will die and die young while mortality rate is becoming clearer and much lower than initial estimates its still relatively high 34  herd immunity approach could lead not only to higher mortality than alternatives but out of the casualties a high proportion would be young at this time we dont have medical knowledge that hints that the young people who get to critical condition have some a priori hidden condition that is expected to shorten their life anyhow so we have to assume at this point that we would be losing many life-years under this strategy see figure 5 for distribution of mortality across age groups 5 healthcare system strain will kill even more a herd immunity approach will strain the healthcare systems to its limits for many months healthcare personnel and resources will find themself recruited to care for the critical coronavirus patients inevitably neglecting regular care many health situations that would normally end in recovery will end in otherwise avoidable death due to lack of care 6 long term health damage it could well be that some portion of surviving patients would suffer long-term or permanent health consequences post recovery with mid-term damage almost certain for those mechanically ventilated waiting for a vaccine could prevent it in light of the above and given there appear to be other effective and relatively low-economical-damage containment strategies it appears that sticking to containment strategies is more efficient at this stage our results show that seemingly similar strategies in terms of the amount of population-business-days they allow can have a very different epidemic supression outcome based on the pattern the population is released the more effective building blocks are a combination of both partial planned intermittent quaranties and partial population release such as a two-group intermittent release as such two-group intermittent approaches are better performing and are reasonable to implement given they can be relaxed to allow some fixed population noncompliance -10 percent in our example -in parallel to the two groups and division into groups can be made on a personal rather than on a household basis it should be noted however that partial release schemes are sensitive to a special division into two groups that does not reduce interaction for example the resulting r of dividing the population into two groups on a city basis would resemble the resulting r of a single-group and less the r of two groups in other words if the division is not made in a way that shall reduce interaction we will get an r closer to that of a single group intermittent schemes without partial release of population seem less effective at reducing r compared to mixed schemes though they are probably somewhat easier to enforce constant release of a fixed certain percent of population while keeping the rest quarantined also seems less effective too compared to mixed schemes where the population that is being released changes releasing the population and then quarantining as the epidemic relapses seems less effective compared to planned intermittent release schemes that achieve better results the decision on using one building-block or the other is not just a numerical one but should take into consideration other measures and factors including population compliance effectiveness of economy etc the factors and their weight could change by population and region actual decisions are outside the scope of this paper 20 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the

schools unfortunately there is just no data available 35 to make a truly informed decision mostly because schools closed up very quickly globally with the appearance of the pandemic with the exception of sweden for the lower age-groups 36  children are less symptomatic than adults 37  furthermore there is conflicting information on whether asymptomatic are less infectious 38 than symptomatic based on experience in china korea and israel it seems children contracted the virus less 39  according to israeli ministry of health data 40  the percent of positive tests for children aged 0-9 years old is lower compared to adults and in the range of adults for ages 10-19 suggesting this phenomena of lower contraction in children is not merely an ascertainment bias due to milder symptoms it could be argued the latter phenomena can be attributed to the fact the main importers of the virus were travelling adults and schools closed up relatively fast in sweden the infection rates of children are also very low 41 -though testing was limited in household secondary infection in china children were less likely to get infected 16 39  in the municipality of vo italy almost the entire municipality was tested twice as part of a survey in the early outbreak in italy 42  while the infection prevalence was about 26 none of the 234 children aged 0-10 were infected despite some of them sharing a household with a case according to israeli ministry of health information the education system accounted for only 3-11 percent of virus contraction on top of things and perhaps the bottom line -there is no real and reasonable solution for parents to go to work if their children cannot go to their school -so opening of schools seems unavoidable limited mitigation can be partially achieved by noticing symptoms at school and bi-daily measurements of body temperature for early detection of symptoms as children tend to be less symptomatic we assume the epidemic shall last many months and that schools will reopen before its eradicated therefore we will have to accomodate for the school effect anyhow whatever it is so that r1 despite schools being open however it could be that r would be very close to 1 after schools reopen and so there could be benefits from reducing the number of new daily infections to a smaller level which would stay there after schools are reopened as r would be close to 1  we compare key mitigation measures of sars-cov-2 spread and compare various exit strategies building blocks our results stress the importance of not just the amount of population that is released but also the pattern our findings demonstrate the importance of mixed strategies as each strategy is effective through somewhat other means some of our mixed schemes can allow relatively convenient life while controlling for the epidemic spread therefore and given our results we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable

detailed assumptions we did not take into account actual icu resources in the simulation but counted the needed resources and assumed they are available it is up to the strategy to avoid a situation of exhausting resources at initialization each subject receives concrete values of their personal disease course relative to infection if they get infected to that end we draw random variables of the relevant distribution detailed above for each person we also hold a boolean flag indicating if they are infected and a counter to count the relative number of days since each persons infection we also keep a flag to note if a person is in quarantine isolation or released we assumed isolation is at home and with household members people in icu are considered removed and stop infecting others there are three types of infections modelled infection of family members infection of released population and leakage infection to those in quarantine the infection of each group is performed in complete mix ie the probabilities to get infected by an infector are identical within a group and the population within a group is uniformly infected based on that probability daily infection of the released population is based on r 0released and the relative infectiousness for that day for an infector whose product we denote as  i d  thus  i d denotes the number of expected infectious interactions an infector i makes on day d  assuming no-one else is infected and all population is released we define infectious interactions as the number of people that would be infected if no one else was infected

infection period for this person ie cdfdcdf 921dl where l is the personal length of infectiousness the various strategies that are evaluated were fed separately into the simulator a strategy can set for each person if they are quarantined or released based on all prior information age sex probabilities -but not actual random choices and can measure actual icu usage and perform viral tests require to put masks when out of home etc the strategy is invoked each day and has a chance to intervene prior to the infections taking course for that day if two people are wearing masks it reduces droplets and aerosol that contain the virus averaging the numbers in 7  we assume it reduces droplets and aerosol by about 291 to 182 without change in the viral load ie a mask on an affected individual reduces spread by a factor of 0625 in a period of 30 minutes 7  numbers are small so we assume about 30 spread both aerosols and droplets we cannot make an accurate assumption on how much surgical masks shall reduce infection to a wearer of the mask though based on 49 it would be about a six-fold protection factor if we follow these numbers we expect infection to drop by a factor of 06256 to 0625 ie from 01 to 0625 another cause of inclarity is the possibility that droplets or aerosol are infecting through unprotected eyes or other transmission from hands to the eyes 5051  which are not protected by a surgical mask and later accidental transfer from hands to mouth or eyes the inclarity is further extended as good mask usage requires careful fitting of the masks replacing them frequently enough smart disposal together with additional protective measures 52  its difficult to model long-exposure of several 30 minutes units as we cannot tell if the percent of droplets are per-person due to mask-face fitting for example although participants were corrected if they mis-wore the mask or due to properties of the mask itself if its mask properties then an hour worth exposure would still be infecting eg even if we assume the extreme value for mask protection factor of 01 then for 5 hours the protection is only 1-1-01 2x5 0651 ie the protection is just 30 reduction in possibility of infection so if surgical masks are useful its probably protective for short and random exposure patterns to provide a conservative yet useful estimate we gace simulation results for

hulme j alexander billig j vladimir litvak cathy price j rosalyn moran j christian lambert  we recently described a dynamic causal model of a covid-19 outbreak within a single region here we combine several of these epidemic models to create a pandemic model of viral spread among regions our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunity-and the exchange of people between regions-and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses in particular we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national federal or regional state estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population the modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the united states to estimate the parameters of a factorial compartmental epidemiological model of each state and crucially coupling between states using bayesian model reduction we identify the effective connectivity between states that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the united states using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care the provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium  this technical report describes a dynamic causal model of how covid-19 spreads among regions by combining multiple models of an epidemic within a single region this epidemic model was introduced recently to showcase the potential of variational bayesian procedures in fitting mechanistic or generative models of an epidemic to measurable outcomes  mechanistic or generative models enable forecasting based upon epidemiological parameters estimated from empirical data  eg serial interval estimates nishiura et al 2020 yang et al 2020  models of this sort have been applied to the initial outbreak in wuhan china wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020c to predict new cases or clinical resources and the effects of various interventions prem et al 2020 wells et al 2020  such models are invaluable when predicting the demand for critical care ferguson et al 2020 moghadas et al 2020  the particular contribution of this report is to illustrate the use of variational procedures to compare different models of the same data-and the inherent latitude for building large multifactorial models that can handle different kinds of outcomes the dynamic causal model dcm used in this report has a degree of predictive validity and bayesian model comparison suggests that it provides a simpler and more accurate account than equivalent single factor eg seir models  however the dcm only considered a single outbreak in a single region and therefore precluded epidemiological trajectories that feature things like second waves in this technical report 1  we build upon this epidemic model to create a pandemic model that comprises multiple epidemic single region models in what follows we apply this model to explain regional timeseries from the united states treating each state as a region and modelling the exchange of people-who may or may not be infected-among states our focus is on the interplay between regional outbreaks in the evolution of the pandemic and how this evolution informs strategic responses such as social distancing models of the international spread of covid-19-such as the global epidemic and mobility model gleam-usually partition the world into regions centred on major transportation hubs eg airports these regions are then connected by the flux of people travelling daily among them chinazzi et al 2020  see also steven et al 2020 wu et al 2020  in what follows we apply the same idea to daily travel between the united states of america equipping each state with its own epidemiology that becomes coupled through reciprocal exchange of their denizens this creates a loosely coupled nonlinear oscillator model of the sort that is used widely in other settings eg jafri et al 2016 kaluza and meyer-ortmanns 2010 ladenbauer and obermayer 2019 lizarazu et al 2019 schumacher et al 2015  often the first wave of a pandemic so-called herald waves simonsen et al 2018  are followed some months later by a second or third waves of infection see figure 1  that may in some instances be more severe than the first such as those seen in the influenza pandemics of 1918 h1h1 1957 h2h2 1968 h3n2 and 2009 h1n1 if one commits to the idea that a generative model of measurable outcomes is necessary to properly predict systemic dynamics then the natural question is what causes a second wave one answer is that a regional population is re-exposed to infection by an influx of infected people from another-that may itself have been caused by the first clearly the degree to which an outbreak in another region induces a second wave in the first will depend sensitively on the level of herd immunity inherited from the first wave it is therefore important to consider the degree to which herd immunity is lost following the first wave either through an endogenous loss of immunity within the first population or a renewal of that population with people who are not immune for example about 05 of the american population move between states every day 2  this movement mixes the total population with consequent loss of herd immunity heuristically the picture that emerges can be likened to a californian or australian wildfire with embers seeded throughout a large territory one ember may gain a sufficient hold to cause the first flareup and become the epicentre of a bushfire as the fire rages through the locale consuming combustible material it will eventually burn itself out however if the right conditions prevail-and embers are carried to another locale-a second fire will start and thereby elicit a chain of fires in this analogy the second wave corresponds to a reignition of the first by embers from the second however there is a natural fire retardant in the first locale ie herd immunity that offers some protection ie there is nothing left to burn provides the technical details that allow people to reproduce the modelling at home alternatively it could complement epidemiological modelling with approximate bayesian computation although the authors of the current report are involved in the clinical management of covid-19 patients-and are experts in biological timeseries modelling-they are not virologists or epidemiologists as such the validity of the model described in this report may or may not be endorsed by experts in the appropriate fields crucially this protection will decline over time as new growth furnishes more combustible material ie a loss of immunity so what causes a second wave-is it the recursive spread of the fire ie pandemic or is it susceptibility to reignition ie herd immunity these considerations highlight the importance of herd immunity and the factors that underwrite resistance to infection after the first wave immunity in any given population may be lost for several reasons these include a natural loss of immunity of the sort seen in seasonal influenza-mediated by viral mutation or the prevalence of different viral serotypes for covid-19 this is an area of active research that has yet to provide definitive answers however empirical evidence suggests that neutralising antibodies to covid-19 can be raised fairly quickly bao et al 2020 bendavid et al 2020 chan et al 2013  furthermore instances of reinfection are sufficiently low to suggest that immunity to covid-19 may be long lasting at least over a period of months furthermore studies in nonhuman primates suggest it is difficult to elicit the symptoms of covid-19 after an initial infection bao et al 2020 3  however this does not necessarily guarantee an enduring herd immunity the transmission of sars-cov-2 depends on many factors including seasonal variation in transmission strength the duration of immunity and cross-immunity with other coronaviruses sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus which includes the sars mers and two other human coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 kissler et al 2020 su et al 2016  hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 infections may be asymptomatic or produce mild to moderate upper respiratory tract symptoms namely a common cold kissler et al 2020  accumulating evidence suggests that primary sars-cov-2 infection causes a mild illness in the majority of cases with a minority progressing to severe lower respiratory infection interstitial pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure the primary infections may also be further complicated by additional insults such as secondary bacterial infections or thromboembolic events 4  immunity to hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 appears to be lost over a few months however betacoronaviruses can induce immune responses against each another for example sars can generate neutralizing antibodies against hcov-oc43 that can endure for years chan et al 2013  while hcov-oc43 infection can generate cross-reactive antibodies against sars chan et al 2013  now the question is does sars-cov-2 behave like sars conveying long-lasting immunity or does it behave like hcov-oc43 conferring immunity for just a few months in what follows we will consider both scenarios and the implications for how we live with covid-19-or not this report tries to characterise the interplay between population fluxes and the waning of immunity using a compartmental model of ensemble dynamics typically these kinds of models employ a sparse coupling 3 after seroconversion asymptomatic monkeys were challenged with a second dose of sars-cov-2 neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs nor viral replication in primary tissue compartments was evident in reexposed monkeys on the basis of follow-up virologic radiological and pathological assessment monkeys with reexposure showed no recurrence of covid-19 bao l deng w gao h xiao c liu j xue j lv q liu j yu p xu y

biorxiv 2013 between nonlinear systems here a compartmental model of a regional outbreak in the present setting the sparse coupling is a small exchange of people between states that can be parameterised in terms of the daily probability that i will leave one state for another clearly this will depend upon whether i can leave home which depends upon any social distancing currently in play this brings us to the second focus of the current modelling namely how does social distancing mitigate interregional influences to answer this question one has to have a formal model of social distancing there are two attributes of any social distancing-its functional form and its argument ie what is social distancing a function of in what follows we consider functional forms based on dual criteria namely the prevalence of measurable infection and demand upon critical care in brief these functions can be regarded as adaptive strategies in other words they are social distancing responses to changes in measurable quantities these responses may be mediated via governmental advice social media behavioural dispositions and other affordances 5 that we can lump together in terms of a propensity to avoid interpersonal contact-or not we will consider two threshold-based responses to the prevalence of infection in the population this prevalence is fairly straightforward to estimate on the basis of currently available tests for the presence of the virus on mucosa this does not require exhaustive or comprehensive testing provided these measures are modelled appropriately eg using a generative model of the sort considered below although offering a straightforward model of social distancing there remains an outstanding issue do i or the government base my social distancing on the prevalence of infection in my region or is it driven by the experience of other regions in my country in other words should social distancing be based upon regional or national criteria and therefore enacted at a regional or national level in what follows we fit a pandemic model to regional data from the united states and ask what would happen if a national ie federal social distancing strategy was adopted as opposed to a regional ie state approach this report comprises three sections the first rehearses the dynamic causal model presented previously with an emphasis on the extension to multiple regions-and implicit coupling among regions the second section presents the results of model fitting to timeseries from states in america 6  this section considers the sensitivity of cumulative deaths to various model parameters with a focus on the connectivity among states that shapes the overall progression of the pandemic the final section considers social distancing strategies by simulating what would happen under regional and national approaches with hard eg lockdown and soft eg partial social distancing the lines correspond to the predicted incidences under a single region model described in  these data are presented to illustrate a resurgence of new cases orange arrow several weeks after the first wave that is not accompanied by a marked increase in death rates we will see a similar phenomenology in predictions of new cases and deaths for the united states in subsequent figures the dynamic causal model used in this report is an extension of a compartmental model of a regional outbreak detailed in  this epidemic model is a factorial extension of a conventional seir susceptible exposed infected and recovered model in which the four states 7 of the seir model are unpacked into four factors location infection symptoms and testing each with four states this furnishes a 4 4  256-compartmental model that allows for different combinations of states to generate data for example being infected does not necessarily mean that one has to manifest symptoms conversely one can be severely ill without having a viral infection 8  similarly including a testing factor allows for people 7 we will use state to indicate a state of the united states and state to denote a level of a factor in the generative model to be contagious but not reported as testing positive for sars-cov-2 9  the factorial structure of this model exploits conditional independencies among the factors to provide a relatively straightforward parameterisation technically it uses a mean field approximation to certain dependencies for example the probability of developing symptoms depends on and only on whether i have an infection however the probability of becoming infected does not depend on whether i am symptomatic or not the four factors in question are shown schematically in figure 2 in the form of a compartmental model the accompanying parameters of this compartmental model that mediate the conditional dependencies are listed in table 1  this model is described in detail in and used subsequently to look at herd immunity and lockdown cycles in  here the model is equipped with two further features namely a loss of immunity over time and a distinction between susceptible and non-susceptible members of the population we equipped the model with a loss of immunity with the following parameter this controls a slow flux from a state of immunity to a state of susceptibility under the infection factor we made the provisional assumption that immunity to sars-cov-2 resembles the immunity to sars-cov-1 operationally we modelled this as a period of immunity with a time constant of 32 months cf kissler et al 2020  this parameter was included to repeat simulations under more pessimistic conditions in which immunity could be lost within a few four months cf a common cold human coronavirus hcov-oc43 the distinction between susceptible and non-susceptible was modelled by assigning people to a susceptible or resistant state such that they did not participate in the spread of the virus if they were resistant we assumed a priori that half of the total population would be susceptible to infection and estimated the proportion of resistant cases under the model 10  this can be regarded as a crude approximation to varying levels of susceptibility in the population at large and could be further refined as more is learnt about the susceptibility to covid-19 infection for example by leveraging regional demographic data numerous viral-evasion mechanisms are known for example mutations in the resistome cause susceptibility to infection and other yet to be identified mutations cause resistance to infection beutler et al 2007  though age and comorbidity contribute substantially to fatality rates the host factors that influence resistance or susceptibility to infection with pathogenic human coronaviruses covs are largely unknown but might involve several mechanisms for example innate immune responses to covs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded rna and induction of interferon which turns on gene expression programs that inhibit viral replication heer et al 2020  furthermore epidemiological evidence suggests that sars-cov-2 infection in children is less frequent and severe than in adults agerelated ace2 receptor expression might be a relevant host factor cristiani et al 2020  including a distinction between susceptible and resistant enables the model to explain data from the total population as opposed to a susceptible population this is important when considering models of how the virus is spread among regions by movement of people who may or may not be susceptible and therefore capable of infecting-and being infected by-others figure 2 the dynamic causal list model this schematic summarises the dynamic causal model that is used to explain timeseries data in a single region in brief it comprises four factors each with four states listed in the key on the left giving 256 states or compartments regional factors include location infection symptom and testing status the infection state of resistance has been omitted from the schematic for simplicity the small arrows denote transitions among states that are parameterised in terms of the probability of moving from one state to another every day black or unlabelled arrows denote a unit probability coloured arrows designate transitions that are determined by the model parameters -please see table 1  to suppress visual clutter the expressions for transition probabilities are colour-coded within each factor the quantities p i are marginal probabilities over the states of the ith factor crucially transitions among the states of one factor depend upon other factors these conditional dependencies highlighted by broken arrows are illustrated by showing the transition probabilities among the states of one factor under the levels of another for example the probability that i will move from a state of being asymptomatic sa to being symptomatic ss depends upon whether i am infected ii and ic or not is and im furthermore the probability that i will move from ards sr to being deceased sd depends upon whether i am located in a critical care unit lc or at home lh-and so on the parameters of the implicit transition probabilities are listed in table 1 and are described in detail in  a particularly important transition is the probability that i will leave home ie expose myself to more potentially contagious contacts on any given day namely social distancing this is denoted by 12 corresponding to equation 13 in the main text figure 3 illustrates how a single-region epidemic model can be used to construct a pandemic model that encompasses several regions the key aspect of this factorial extension ie including a region factor rests upon the coupling among regions here people who are not confined in self-isolation ie at home are available to travel with a certain daily probability from one state to another a priori this probability is based upon the probability that any american citizen will fly from one state to another every day this can be written down as the following transition probability  here ni corresponds to the number of people in the i-th state and n  corresponds to the relative number of people that are exchanged between states i and k this construction ensures that the total number of people in each state does not change over time in turn this constraint means that the flux of people between any two states can be parameterised with a single coupling or connectivity parameter ik   figure 3 a multi-region model this schematic summarises the dynamic causal model used to explain timeseries data from multiple regions this pandemic model is composed of several regional epidemic models in brief the model for a single region comprises four factors each with four states giving 4 4  256 states or compartments per region these regional models are then assembled to model the coupling among eight regions giving 256 8 compartments however due to conditional independencies this can be treated as a collection of 256 compartmental models providing one links the states of one region to the states of another carefully here this linking or connectivity is parameterised in terms of a probability flux or exchange of people among regional populations the probability that i will move from one region to another depends upon whether i am at work ie not at home lh and do not consider myself to be ill ie i am asymptomatic sa in short the exchange between different regional populations is limited to the people who are not at home and are consequently in a position to travel this is illustrated by the arrows in the figure that connect the appropriate states the parameters of interregional coupling correspond to rate constants or effective connectivity that ensure the conservation of total numbers in each region for example the probability of moving to new york from new jersey is the same as a probability of moving from new jersey to new york however the number of people commuting in either direction will depend on the respective population sizes of new jersey and new york usually in these kinds of connectivity models one considers different sparsity constraints on the coupling architecture one could use bayesian model comparison based upon the variational free energy aka evidence lower bound to test for different connectivity structures friston et al 2015  eg full connectivity a serial connectivity based upon spatial distance between states the time of onset and so on however for simplicity we elected to use a model with full connectivity and eliminate redundant connections post hoc using bayesian model reduction  the second important extension to the epidemic model was the inclusion of a dual criteria social distancing process parameterised as follows the first equality parameterises the probability of going to work in the morning as a function of the marginal probabilities of certain states for the region in question p while the second has the same functional form but takes the marginal probability from all regions q these can be regarded as a regional state and national federal social distancing responses respectively it would also be possible to respond based on a linear combination of these two formulations however we limit the simulations presented here to one or other of the extremes the states in question are the probability that any member of the population is currently infected or requires critical care the form of the decreasing threshold sigmoid functions that constitute this model of social distancing is illustrated in figure 4  intuitively this models social distancing as the probability of leaving home which only attains normal levels when two criteria are met first the proportion of the population infected with coronavirus must be below some threshold and second the number of people in critical care must be less than some fraction of maximum capacity equation 13 lumps the thresholds together so that there is a single social distancing threshold that is applied to both criteria when the threshold is low say 132 we effectively have a lockdown policy that will remain in place until less than 132 of the population are deemed to be infected and the occupancy of critical care facilities has fallen below 832   of total capacity a more liberal threshold could be interpreted as a softer social distancing strategy where certain non-vulnerable people are allowed to return to school or work and some degree of social distancing is maintained when commuting or at work eg wearing face masks note that social distancing is modelled as a part of the epidemiological dynamics generating data in other words it is not an exogenous input or strategic response that enters the model rather it is installed as a reactive and adaptive process that best explains the observed data an interesting twist here is that the optimisation of the parameters that shape social distancing are those that best explain the data namely the social distancing that has been achieved they are not optimised to minimise some cost function eg mortality rates-they are a measure of what a population actually does when confronted with a pandemic later we will simulate different levels of social distancing-by increasing or decreasing the estimated threshold-to see what mitigates morbidity either in terms of cumulative deaths or economic morbidity as measured in terms of lost working days under the location factor finally we included a back-to-work parameter that allowed people who were immune to be exempt from social distancing and return to work this is a fictive aspect of the model in the sense that it would rest upon knowing whether somebody was immune or not this enabled us to model the potential benefits of being able to measure seroconversion and allow people back to work if they had detectable and hopefully neutralising antibodies to sars-cov-2 with this pandemic model in place we modelled the eight states in america with the greatest number of cases of covid-19 using standard variational laplace bayesian methods  we chose to analyse eight states because the key information in the accompanying timeseries lies in the form of the transients or fluctuations in new cases and deaths this form is better evinced by larger numbers put simply including states that have yet to experience an epidemic provides no useful information that would inform the parameters that are shared between states one advantage of modelling data from the united states of america is that one can a priori assume that many factors are conserved from state to state given the homogeneity of the medical infrastructure within america unlike the epidemic model the population size of each state serves as an informative prior on the susceptible population size in other words previously we estimated the number of people affected by an epidemic as an unknown quantity here we try to explain the data in terms of all the population who are caught up in the pandemic-an unknown proportion of which may be resistant to infection technically this involves placing very precise shrinkage priors on the population size corresponding to the population of each state finally because each state is likely to have been seeded with one or two infected individuals at different times we modelled the pandemic as ensuing from the epicentre namely new york state 11  this involves estimating the number of people in new york who were infected eight days after records began to expedite model inversion we used a further mean field approximation by assuming conditional independence between the between-region ie connectivity parameters in table 1a and the within-region parameters in table 1b  this allowed us to estimate the parameters for each region ie state separately and then use the ensuing state-specific estimates to infer the connectivity parameters and initial case load at the epicentre this greatly finesses the numerics however it comes at the price of ignoring conditional dependencies between the two sorts of parameters this completes our description of the model the next section turns to the results of fitting multivariate timeseries of new cases and deaths under this model secondary sources huang et al 2020 kissler et al 2020 mizumoto and chowell 2020 russell et al 2020 verity et al 2020 wang et al 2020b and  httpswwwstatistacomchart21105number-of-critical-care-beds-per-100000-inhabitants  httpswwwgovukguidancecoronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public  httpwwwimperialacukmrc-global-infectious-disease-analysiscovid-19 these prior expectations should be read as the effective rates and time constants as they manifest in a real-world setting for example a four-day period of contagion is shorter than the period that someone might be infectious wlfel et al 2020 12  on the prior assumption that they will self-isolate when they realise they could be contagious although the scale parameters are implemented as probabilities or rates they are estimated as log parameters denoted by ln    12 shedding of covid-19 viral rna from sputum can outlast the end of symptoms seroconversion occurs after 6-12 days but is not necessarily followed by a rapid decline of viral load this section reviews the within and between-state parameters following model inversion under a regional social distancing response we then use these parameters to predict outcomes that have yet to be observed in the final section we will repeat these predictions under different social distancing strategies our focus in this section is on how the second wave if any is shaped by social distancing responses and the acquisition-and subsequent loss-of immunity figure 5 reports the differences among states in terms of selected parameters for each state ranging from the population size through to the probability of testing its denizens the blue bars report the posterior expectations while the pink bars are 90 bayesian credible intervals notice that there is no uncertainty about the population sizes because these are known quantities from the current perspective the interesting thing to note here is the social distancing threshold that varies among states around 003 in other words each state is behaving as if lockdown is invoked when either 3 of the population become infected or critical care occupancy approaches 8  3  24 of total capacity interestingly california appears to have the most stringent social distancing response so far with the lowest threshold this may be relevant later when trying to explain differential mortality rates the key thing to take from this analysis is that nearly all the connections among states have been removed following bayesian model reduction leaving only reciprocal exchange with new york clearly this is not what is happening in the field however it is the simplest account of the data at hand in other words it is sufficient to describe the current data in terms of one epicentre new york exchanging infected individuals with the remaining states in this analysis the greatest flux of people appears to be between new york and california the question now is whether these fluxes have a material impact on cumulative deaths or mortality rates this sort of question can be addressed using a sensitivity analysis the elements of this matrix quantify the rate or probability that a state in each column will deliver a proportion of its out-of-home population to a state in the rows for example the greatest flux of people is between new york and california the lower right panel shows the posterior probability of a model with and without each of these parameters based upon bayesian model comparison for the connectivity parameters involving new york we can be nearly 100 certain that the model that includes this coupling parameter has greater evidence than a model that does not the insert on the lower left provides a schematic representation of the connectivity based upon these estimates the heavier connectors correspond to a greater probability of moving between states a sensitivity analysis involves changing each of the parameters by a small value and measuring the consequent change in cumulative deaths while holding all the other parameters constant figure 7 shows the results of this analysis for the connectivity parameters of the model that survived bayesian model reduction interestingly the effects of movement between states does not appear to have a consistent effect on cumulative deaths sometimes increasing commuter traffic decreases overall mortality and sometimes it is increased having said this the flux that has the greatest mitigating effect on overall mortality is the exchange between new york and california in other words mixing the populations in new york and california would under this model save lives the explanation for these complicated effects rests upon the intricate dynamics of latent states that constitute the underlying causes of the pandemic order taylor expansion about the maximum a posteriori values shown in the lower panel the blue bars correspond to the most likely estimate and the pink bars report the 90 credible intervals interestingly the effects of connectivity or coupling among states are mixed in some instances increasing the exchange between one state and another will increase or decrease overall death rates presumably based upon the respective capacity of different states to respond to pressure on their clinical care capacities figure 8 provides a prediction of the future course of the pandemic in each of the eight states the picture that emerges here is what one might expect from a loosely coupled oscillator model here a factorial compartmental model of ensemble dynamics notable aspects of these predictions are that new york experiences a marked peak in death rates early in the epidemic whereas other states follow after a week or so in terms of the epidemiology an interesting feature of these predictions is a second peak in death rates at around 38 weeks ie 28 weeks after the first peak another aspect of these predictions is the large variability in death rates between states much of this variability can be accounted for by differences in populations however as shown in the lower right panel mortality rates as estimated by the expected number of deaths in one year divided by the population of each state still show a substantial variation for example the mortality rate in new york is estimated to be just over 01 while it is much smaller in california recall that these predictions are entirely conditioned upon the model and available data having said this the currently available peak death rates in new york and california testify to some difference that cannot be explained in terms of population sizes eg climactic effects on transmission strength that mediate seasonal influences kissler et al 2020  alternatively the differential social distancing estimates in new york and california see figure 5  may speak to regional or cultural differences eg the prevalence of high density low-cost housing or ethnic differences in communal activities the cumulative deaths under this particular model are consistent with predictions based upon other modelling work for example at 20 weeks the cumulative deaths in the united states has-on some conservative estimates-been reported in the media to be around 60000 13  the eight states here constitute 119 million people about a third of the population the cumulative deaths within these states are estimated to be about 48000 under the current model one potentially reassuring aspect of these results is that predicted annual mortality rates in most states is overall less than that attributable to seasonal influenza 01 paget et al 2019  indeed typical mortality rates appear to be in the order of 005 or less this is in line with projections based upon global data and countries who experienced an early epidemic such as italy figure 8 predicted mortality rates this figure reports the predicted trajectory of death rates for each state the upper panels show the predicted time course of death rates per day under a social distancing strategy based upon regional estimates of prevalence the expected rates are shown as blue lines while the shaded blue areas correspond to 90 bayesian credible intervals the dots report empirical data observed to date the same data are shown in the upper right panel after scaling the y axis this enables the second wave of deaths-predicted under this model-to be seen more clearly about 28 weeks following the first wave the lower left panel shows the cumulative deaths in each state based upon these predictions in terms of the total expectation blue bars and accompanying 90 credible intervals pink bars these projections reflect differences among the states in terms of their population-and their response to the influx and subsequent explosion of infected cases the middle right panel adjusts for differences in the population by expressing mortality rates per year as a percentage of the population of each state the broken horizontal line corresponds roughly to the mortality rate of seasonal influenza the lower panel shows the cumulative deaths over all states in terms of the posterior expectation blue line and confidence intervals shaded area the black dots correspond to empirical data the confidence intervals in these figures should not be overinterpreted they were approximated under large-number assumptions by a poisson distribution this approximation was used purely for computational expediency and was not used during model inversion the underlying causes of the predicted outcomes in figure 8 are shown in figure 9  the predicted outcomes are reproduced in the upper panels in terms of rates per day upper left panel and cumulative cases and deaths upper right panel in addition the model has generated the occupancy of critical care unit beds that accompanies these state-specific predictions the lines correspond to the predicted numbers under a model with a regional social distancing strategy the dots correspond to the data observed so far these trajectories are generated by fluctuations in the probability of being away from home ie denoted by the state work lw whether one is infectious or not the clinical expression of the infection and the probability that one tests negative or positive a key aspect of these results is the rapid acquisition of herd immunity to levels of about 30 at the peak of the first wave see yellow lines in the middle right panel of figure 9  this rise is most pronounced during the early phase of the pandemic that shows subsequent fluctuations due to movement between states and a mild loss of immunity one can see two sorts of second wave in terms of new cases and deaths in the upper left panel the first is an early secondary peak about four weeks after the first peak orange arrow this is particularly evident in the new cases predicted for new york this coincides with a relaxation of social distancing and a concomitant influx of people from other states compare this with the second wave of new cases in figure  1  however there is a more protracted and pronounced second wave after 28 weeks blue arrow that induces a fluctuation in social distancing behaviour again most evident in new york the mechanism for this second peak is due to the endogenous loss of immunity increasing the period of immunity from 32 months to 8 years delays this peak by about 20 weeks data not shown as we will see next decreasing the period of immunity to 4 months accelerates the second peak so that it encroaches on the first finally note that social distancing never disappears ie the blue lines reporting the probability of leaving home left middle panel never quite return to their pre-pandemic levels in other words there is a persistent failure to return to levels of work prior to the pandemic this persistent change in social distancing behaviour is an integral part of the endemic equilibrium simulated in these analyses put simply there is an equilibrium that constitutes the endpoint of any exit strategy-and this equilibrium will be attained at about 40 weeks ie 10 months following the onset of the pandemic however this will not be a return to normal life it will be a way of living with covid-19 this way of living is comfortably within the resources of our ability to provide critical care for those people who need it furthermore as noted above this endemic equilibrium entails mortality rates due to covid-19 that are less than half those due to seasonal influenza it should be reiterated that these are just model predictions and should not be taken literally they should be read as the kind of predictions that can be made with suitable modelling 14  a key aspect of the simulation results is that new cases in the second wave are not necessarily accompanied by marked increases in daily death rates furthermore the amplitude of the second wave under this model is much less than that of the first this reflects the immunity acquired during the first wave in other words the context in which the second wave emerges is contextualised by the immunological memory of the first exposure to the virus in these simulations herd immunity is between 40 and 70 these simulations can be compared with the predictions of seasonal re-emergencies of covid-19 based upon models that factor in seasonal variations in transmission of the kind associated with seasonal influenza for example short term immunity on the order of 10 months similar to hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 would engender annual sars-cov-2 outbreaks while longer-term immunity 24 months favours biennial outbreaks kissler et al 2020  the simulations above should be compared with the corresponding simulations in figure 10 under short term immunity here we repeated the analysis but changed the period of immunity from 32 months to 4 months in this scenario herd immunity declines rapidly and endemic equilibrium is reached almost as soon as the first wave subsides this endemic equilibrium is probably not sustainable although the demand for critical care does not exceed total capacity this demand is mitigated by persistent social distancing in turn this social distancing precludes any meaningful return to work in the majority of states simulated only 8 or less of the population returns to work on the assumption that the ensuing damage to social and economic infrastructure is untenable the scenario of losing immunity within months is difficult to countenance figure 9 the pandemic under long-term immunity 32 months this figure reports the predicted outcomes and underlying latent states generating those outcomes over a one-year period under a regional social distancing strategy the upper panels show some key outcomes some of which are measurable here daily death rates are shown in blue new cases in red and ccu occupancy in orange the lines correspond to the predictions of the model while the dots are empirical data available at the time of writing 18th of april 2020 the dotted line in the upper left panel corresponds to the typical critical care capacity of a large city the same results are shown on the upper right panel in terms of cumulative new cases red and deaths blue the underlying or latent causes of this mortality are shown in the lower panels these are organised according to the four factors of the generative model in each panel the latent states are plotted for the eight states considered in this analysis the location factor shows that under this strategy the number of people away from the home or equivalent location decreases sharply at the onset of the outbreak and then recovers slowly over the ensuing weeks in terms of infection there is a rapid acquisition of immunity to varying levels between 40 and 80 over the first months of the pandemic at any one time about 18 or less of the population is either infected or infectious in terms of the clinical expression of these infections 8 percent or less of people will experience symptoms and a small minority will progress to acute respiratory distress from which they may recover or die under this model positive test results for the virus based on buccal swabs accumulate over time as more and more people are tested in the initial phases of the outbreak most people are negative however during the onset of the pandemic about a half to a third of people tested are positive this proportion declines over the ensuing months the only difference here is that we decreased the period of immunity from 32 months to 4 months the emerging picture is that two things are crucially important in shaping the long-term trajectory of the pandemic first the acquisition of herd immunity and second the rate at which immunity is lost at present the second factor is difficult to assess empirically which is why cases of reinfection would be so telling 15  documented cases of reinfection speak to a short-term immunity at the time of writing there is little evidence to suggest reinfection is a characteristic of covid-19 indeed the evidence points in the other direction bao et al 2020  so is there any evidence for a rapid acquisition of herd immunity at the time of writing there are no published reports however preprints and local media have identified apposite studies in california these studies are in a position to provide important data that will endorse or constrain the modelling of immunity figure 11 shows the predicted immunity for people in california shown in figure 9  these predictions are not inconsistent with early reports of antibody testing in california based upon preprints bendavid et al 2020 16 and local media reports 17  shown as confidence intervals vertical bars and point estimates red dot respectively although the consilience should not be overinterpreted these provisional findings are in line with the model predictions although the santa clara prevalence of antibodies is about half what would have been predicted on the basis of the current model as noted in the la times these results suggest he fatality rate may be much lower than previously thought but although the virus may be more widespread the infection rate still falls far short of herd immunity that absent a vaccine would be key to return to normal life httpswwwlatimescomcaliforniastory2020-04-20coronavirus-serologytesting-la-county in fact on the current reading of the model predictions this prevalence of seropositive cases in california is consistent with the acquisition of herd immunity over the next few weeks clearly it would be reassuring-if not imperative-to have more definitive data from other states or countries to track herd immunity as it develops 16 the authors measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to sars-cov-2 in santa clara county on the third and fourth of april 2020 using a lateral flow immunoassay under three scenarios for their test performance the population prevalence of covid-19 in santa clara ranged from 249 95ci 180-317 to 416 258-570 17 initial results from the first large-scale study tracking the spread of the coronavirus in la county found that 41 of adults have antibodies this translates to roughly 221000 to 442000 adults who have recovered from an infection la county had reported fewer than 8000 cases at that time our thanks to virginia webber for forwarding this material figure 9  with a focus on the states of the infection factor the blue line reports the expected percentage of the population who are infected in california up until the date of writing the red line shows the prevalence of contagious or infectious people that follows a few days later the yellow line reports the acquisition of immunity namely the number of people who have moved from a contagious state to an immune state the two bars represent the 90 confidence intervals from an early report from santa clara the red dot corresponds to the estimated prevalence of immunity according to a local media report please see main text for details in summary the acquiring and maintaining critical levels of immunity are crucial factors in determining the course of the pandemic over the next few months put simply the rate at which we move to a potentially catastrophic endemic equilibrium will be much faster if immunity is lost quickly via antigenic drift or mixing of the immune pool-sufficiently quickly to preclude a second wave this concludes our summary of the results under models of regional social distancing in the next section we turn to other aspects of strategic responses and ask what are the best mitigation strategies under the current model in this section we use the parameter estimates from the dcm to integrate 18 months into the future and record various outcomes under distinct social distancing strategies the parameters of these strategies are estimated from empirical data however their functional form is a question of model selection having said this given that there is only data from the initial phase of the pandemic model comparison may be best left until after the epidemic has run its course in the interim we can examine the effect of strategic responses on metrics of interest here the total number of deaths the total number of working days and the peak occupancy of critical care facilities we will consider mitigation strategies that are driven by the prevalence of infection in any given state or whether national ie federal measures of prevalence inform our behaviour first we look at the effect of relaxing social distancing by increasing the social distancing threshold and then repeat the analysis under a federal policy figure 12 shows the results of simulations under 16 levels of social distancing based upon regional prevalence the different levels were simulated by scaling the social distancing threshold of about 3 in figure 5 from very small values around 005 to very large values around 100 figure 12 uses the same format as previous figures to quantify the rate of new cases and deaths per day upper left panel cumulated cases upper right panel and the underlying or latent causes lower four panels here the lines report the average rates and probabilities over states for different levels of social distancing with stringent social distancing ie a low threshold the initial relaxing of the lockdown after the first wave is quickly reversed as new cases start to accumulate the probability of returning to work peaks at about 20 and then falls to negligible levels as the months pass in this scenario the second wave is delayed until about 60 weeks following the first wave as social distancing is relaxed by increasing the threshold to its posterior estimate from the original model estimation the return to work approaches endemic equilibria at successively higher levels until at low levels of social distancing high thresholds there is hardly any fluctuation in the probability of being found at work at the same time a second peak at around 40 weeks 30 weeks after the first peak emerges and cumulative cases and deaths rise more quickly over the months this spectrum of long-term trajectories is summarised by the green and blue arrows illustrating the suppression of a second wave at 70 weeks and the emergence of an earlier wave at 40 weeks the key aspect of these simulations is that there is a balance between an overzealous lockdown that precludes any meaningful return to work and a capricious social distancing strategy that releases a second wave a few months after the first this effect of social distancing is illustrated more explicitly in figure 13 figure 13 plots the cumulative deaths working days and lost weeks as a function of the logarithmic deviation from an estimated social distancing threshold of about 3 as one might intuit increasing the threshold monotonically increases the number of working days at the expense of cumulative deaths ranging across the eight states from about 48000 to 62000 over a period of 18 months changing the threshold for social distancing has a nonlinear aspect this can be evinced more clearly by plotting the weeks lost due to lockdown as a function of the logarithmic changes in threshold weeks lost was quantified in terms of the number of weeks over 18 months during which the probability of being at work was less than 8 the lower left panel of figure 13 highlights the switch from lockdown strategies-which preclude a long-term return to work-to those that permit near-normal social distancing in the long term interestingly the empirical posterior expectation estimate of social distancing based upon the data is characterised by a threshold that is close to the transition between the two kind of strategies again as one might intuit these simulations speak to a trade-off between lives and weeks lost due to the pandemic-and our adaptive response see lower right panel figure 13 lost lives and weeks this figure summarises the key effects of social distancing on cumulative deaths and working days lost due to the virus the upper panels plot the cumulative deaths and days at work under different levels of social distancing as in the previous figure social distancing was evaluated over 16 levels by scaling the threshold estimated for each state in terms of log parameters this corresponds to adding or subtracting a change between -4 and 4 natural units in this figure social distancing is expressed in terms of these changes where zero corresponds to no change from the posterior estimates of the previous section the lower panel provides another perspective on working days lost by calculating the number of lost weeks-defined operationally as the number of weeks during which the probability of going to work was less than 8 the final lower right panel plots cumulative deaths against weeks lost this illustrates the trade-off between the loss of life and working weeks-reflected in the decreasing monotonic relationship between these two outcomes finally we repeated the above analysis under regional and national strategies using high 14 and low 132 social distancing thresholds figure 14 upper row shows the effects of the four kinds of strategy on cumulative deaths total number of working days and peak ccu occupancy it is apparent that a hard low threshold strategy reduces deaths and frees up working days to a greater extent than soft high threshold strategies interestingly a regional response strategy based on local prevalence rates incurs fewer deaths with a slight increase in ccu occupancy there is no discernible difference between a regional and national strategy on working days the middle row shows the same results but when immunity is lost over four months as opposed to 32 months as one might intuit increasing the rate at which immunity is lost substantially increases death rates and other costs in this scenario the impact of a hard low threshold lockdown strategy on cumulative deaths is more marked and the relative benefit of a regional versus national policy is more pronounced this is at the expense of damage to the economy in terms of the relative number of days lost total ccu occupancy is largely unaffected with short-term immunity because the loss of immunity only affects the epidemiology after it is acquired during the first peak the lower row reproduces the upper row with the inclusion of a back-to-work policy in which people who were seropositive are allowed to leave the home the point made by these simulations is that a back-towork policy has limited effects on mortality rates 18 or peak ccu occupancy but greatly ameliorates the economic damage entailed by the lost working days figure 14 different strategies evaluated these bar charts report the effects of different strategies on cumulative deaths left column total number of working days middle column and peak occupancy of ccu right column the top row shows simulation results based upon the parameters used in the previous figures one can see that a low threshold lockdown strategy generally reduces cumulative deaths and working days lost to the economy while augmenting peak ccu occupancy the middle row reproduces the same analysis but under more pessimistic assumptions about the retention of immunity specifically we reduced the time constant for retaining immunity from 32 months to 4 months under this scenario death rates increase dramatically approximately doubling with an accompanying loss of working days peak ccu is largely unaffected because this parameter determines long-term outcomes or trajectories as opposed to initial responses the lower row shows the equivalent results when including a back-to-work policy based upon serological testing the only effect of this under the current model is to exacerbate the effect of a hard versus relaxed social distancing strategy on the number of working days lost this follows because returning people who are immune to the community has no effect on morbidity or for critical care however it does take the pressure off the economy this report describes an extension of a single region epidemic model that furnishes a pandemic model of regions that collectively participate in a pandemic our focus has been on the genesis of a second wave of new cases-and potential deaths-due to the loss of immunity within a regional population and the influx of people from other regions we have showcased this model by applying it to statistics from the united states treating each state as a separable region when using the optimised model parameters one can simulate the impact of various strategies or non-pharmaceutical responses if one subscribes to the modelling in this report then there are several narratives one could entertain these depend sensitively on the rate at which the immunity is lost if sars-cov-2 confers immunity that lasts for years the following narrative might be appropriate however this relaxation will not return to pre-pandemic levels of interpersonal contact in other words there will be an enduring pressure to reduce interpersonal contact which will reduce the time spent in the company of others by 5 or less the road to equilibrium will be relatively smooth with a slight bump second wave at about seven months following the initial outbreak ie november this will not require lockdown but there will be an appreciable increase in the number of cases and critical care uptake this second wave should last for about five weeks and may be confounded by the onset of a flu season under this narrative social distancing will become a way of living with covid-19 and reflect changing attitudes to prosocial behaviour very much like our attitudes to recycling smoking or outdated and dangerous practices such as the use of laudanum or mercury in the victorian age for example unnecessary commuting and international meetings may be seen as antisocial and unhygienic similarly shaking hands may become as socially sanctioned as frotteurism in short changing attitudes affordances and dispositions may be sufficient social distancing mechanisms to guarantee an endemic equilibrium note that the above narrative makes no mention of exit strategies vaccination or anti-viral therapy this is because strategic responses are modelled as an inherent part of the epidemiology in other words they are treated as part of the process as a reactive strategy as opposed to a proactive strategy this does not mean that governments are under no pressure to declare their exit strategies rather this declaration is part of the process of changing attitudes to social behaviour as in  this narrative is not a prediction it is a concrete example of the kind of prediction on offer with a suitably formulated and informed epidemiological model that installs social behaviour into the dynamics this particular narrative depends on long-lasting immunity a different story would be told if immunity to sars-cov-2 is lost within months this speaks to two pressing issues first has the first wave induced a substantive herd immunity predicted by the dcm second if this immunity has been induced how long will it last the answer to the first question should be available within the next few weeks as studies assessing community levels of seroconversion appear the answer to the second question is more vexed because-from a purely epidemiological perspective-one might have to wait and see given the many factors that determine the loss of immunity and potential variation within different cohorts in the final report of this series we will estimate the period of immunity by comparing models over a range of short-term immunity in terms of their model evidence at some point over the next month or so there should be sufficient data to render this model comparison sufficiently definitive to estimate the effective period of immunity one can expect as with all dynamic causal modelling studies everything is entirely conditioned upon the models that have been evaluated in terms of their evidence in this report the aim of the modelling is not to provide predictions or guidance per se-it is to show that such predictions are possible under a suitably configured model using state-of-the-art variational bayesian model inversion and reduction in other words one can reproduce these analyses under different models or prior assumptions in a few minutes on a personal computer this allows one to explore different models in an efficient fashion thereby treating the modelling as hypotheses testing as more data becomes available being able to identify the best hypothesis or modelin terms of its parameterisation of structure-is potentially important this is because the model and maximum a posteriori parameters can then form the basis of a prediction about data that has not yet been observed ie the future in this light we will not list the shortcomings of this particular model any shortcoming is just a statement of an alternative model that can be included in the model comparison procedure to optimise the model in and of itself perhaps the most important aspect of this modelling is its focus on herd immunity and the notion of an adaptive or reactive strategy as in our provisional modelling of a single outbreak in a single region the passage from the onset of an outbreak to endemic equilibrium depends on establishing herd immunity to a greater or lesser extent this underwrites the repeated call for a greater understanding of the virology and immunology of covid-19 not only will this speak to therapeutic interventions but simply being able to measure the proportion of individuals in a population who are immune would provide informative constraints on modelling-and subsequent projections the second aspect-of adaptive social distancingcan be contrasted with other formulations that prescribe a fixed pattern of social distancing for example a sawtooth or intermittent social distancing that enables the acquisition of herd immunity without overwhelming critical care capacity ferguson et al 2006  both adaptive and proactive schedules eg encouraging the use of facemasks have their merits and could be evaluated using the procedures outlined above adaptive strategies provide a quantitative and formal guideline for personal and governmental responses as the pandemic develops in other words the response becomes part of the ensemble dynamics that determine the eventual outcome a pragmatic advantage of adaptive strategies see figure 4  is that they can be operationalised given available estimates of the prevalence for a threshold strategy one can simply revert to one mode of social distancing or another whenever a particular threshold is passed an interesting perspective on adaptive strategies follows from the fact that-in the model-they are an integral part of the process in other fields this corresponds to the notion of chaos control eg rose 2014 and may yield to an optimal control theoretic treatment fleming and sheu 2002 kappen 2005 todorov and jordan 2002  in other words the optimal policy can be treated very much like an engineering problem or indeed an active inference problem this brings us to our last point in closing there is one perspective on applications of generative models to pandemics that touches on unrelated work in theoretical neurobiology this work tries to understand the behaviour of sentient systems such as ourselves in terms of active inference and the optimisation of variational free energy associated with our internal world models  on this view using a generative model of a pandemic to inform policies becomes formally identical to the imperatives that underwrite active inference clark 2016 hohwy 2013  in brief these imperatives are to bring about those situations that we find the least surprising namely that we all elude death and return to normal the figures in this report can be reproduced using annotated matlaboctave code that is available as part of the free and open source

behavior analysis behavior under the control of direct environmental contingencies is distinguished from behavior under the control of rules hayes barnes-holmes  roche 2001 relational frame theory rft can offer important insights into rule-governed behavior allowing researchers to develop functional-analytic interpretations of how rules are understood ohora  barnes-holmes 2004 rule-governed behavior in accordance with rft is an increasingly popular research avenue kissi et al 2017 ruiz surez-falcn barbero-rubio  flrez 2019 stapleton  mchugh 2020 that is of particular interest during the current coronavirus covid-19 pandemic as authorities implement new public health measures to reduce the spread of covid-19 it is extremely important to understand how individuals respond to these new rules particularly whether they are likely to followbreak them this paper describes why an individual may understand the rules and restrictions in place during the covid-19 pandemic but still choose not to comply determining why a rule may be understood but not followed is important if we are to influence behavior i will begin by presenting a brief overview of rule-following in accordance with rft illustrated using a covid-19 specific example next drawing from rft research cognitive neuroscience social psychology and health literature i will present reasons why a rule may be understood but not followed with suggestions for reducing the probability of rule-breaking in the context of pandemic restrictions presented throughout it is important to note that this paper adopts the rft perspective of rule-governed behavior wherein rules include verbal antecedents hayes gifford  hayes 1998 i use the term rule as a general means to orient readers towards a particular behavioral class i use speaker to refer to the rule-giver and listener to refer to the rule-recipient although these can be the same person adherence and compliance are treated as translational concepts tied to rule-following consider the following scenario an individual hears a representative from the world health organization advise that if we are to reduce the spread of covid-19 we must maintain at least 1 meter of distance between ourselves and others the individual listens and understands this rule as i must engage in social distancing in order to reduce the spread of covid-19 consequently because the individual wants to reduce the spread of covid-19 they avoid crowds and getting too close to others in this instance the individual is both understanding and following a rule delivered by the world health organization the account of rule-governed behavior in accordance with rft provides insight into how this rule was understood specifically via relational frames organized into a network word classes eg covid-19 are framed in coordination ie the same as with some event classes eg the actual covid-19 virus and distinction with others ie the actual act of social distancing reducing covid-19 is framed conditionally ie if-then with engaging in social distancing this rule alters the functions of getting close to others with transformations of stimulus function connecting the act of social distancing to the consequence of reducing the spread of covid-19 when the individual is in close proximity with others if the individual accurately discriminates their behavior in that moment then it is no longer the same experience its function has been transformed due to its participation in a relational network the individual has built based on the rule that the world health organisation delivered see figure 1
 in this example the individual understood the rule and the required response was already established in their behavioral repertoire ie the individual knew how to engage in social distancing however a rule may be understood the required response may be established in the listeners repertoire and yet the listener may choose to not follow the rule hayes et al 1998 barnes-holmes et al 2001 list ways to approach an individuals decision to not follow a rule despite having the relevant behaviors available in their repertoire similarly based on the literature underpinning the cognitive neuroscience of habits vahey bennett and whelan 2017 describe features of instrumental behavior which make it particularly likely to become habitual given that this bank of habit research is compatible with rft vahey et al 2017 offer important insights into why a listener may not adhere to guidelines aiming to reduce the spread of covid-19 drawing on barnes-holmes et al 2001 and vahey et al 2017 i will now present a brief overview of why an individual may understand the rules and restrictions in place during the covid-19 pandemic but opt to not follow the rules despite their importance a rule is less likely to be followed if it is provided by someone that the listener perceives as having little credibility barnes-holmes et al 2001 trneke et al 2008 credibility may be acquired directly or verbally with formal or relational means of generalization from one speaker to another barnes-holmes et al 2001 for example if a listener perceives a speaker as knowledgeable then they are more likely to follow rules delivered by this speaker because being knowledgeable is perceived as an apparent predictor of rule accuracy the influence of speaker credibility on rule-following has been observed in the literature on compliance and obedience for example milgram 1974 observed that when a uniformed experimenter was replaced by an ordinary member of the public confederate obedience drastically decreased one of many interpretations for this finding is that participants likely perceived the ordinary member of the public as less credible ie participants perceived rules delivered by ordinary members of the public as less accurate than rules delivered by a uniformed expert beyond the compliance literature recent research has shown health information source credibility significantly impacts the way individuals receive the message with greater perceived credibility associated with greater intention to act on the advice lin hwang  lai 2017 wang walther pingree  hawkins 2008 there is some preliminary rft evidence supporting the existence of variability in rule-following in accordance with speaker credibility specifically despite employing a similar methodology baruch kanter busch richardson and barnes-holmes 2007 and mcauliffe hughes and barnes-holmes 2014 observed different patterns in rule-governed behavior in the former study rules were delivered by a graduate student whereas in the latter rules were delivered by a catholic priest and teacher at the participants school while baruch et al 2007 and mcauliffe et al 2014 differed in other important ways eg the use of raffle ticket reinforcers versus guaranteed reinforcers speaker credibility would appear to impact rule-governed behavior ie students likely perceived the teacher as highly credible based on their learning histories and therefore adhered to their rules in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic if an individual does not perceive the speaker delivering health advice as credible then they are less likely to adhere to the recommendations why should i do as they say what would they know for example you may be more likely to adhere to regulations presented by a representative from the world health organization than your aunt on your facebook timeline therefore in order to promote adherence to rules speakers must be established as credible it is important to note that overemphasizing credibility can promote rigid rule-following villatte villatte  hayes 2016 in an ideal world a speaker would be established as credible by encouraging the listener to track whether their rules are accurate luciano valdivia-salas  ruiz 2012 a rule is less likely to be followed if the listener believes the speaker has limited capacity to mediate consequences barnes-holmes et al 2001 specifically rule deviations can stem from listeners perception of limited speaker ability and willingness to mediate consequences andor their verbally ascribed powers of authority trneke et al 2008 for example in the context of ability to mediate consequences a child may follow rules delivered by their parent but not their sibling because reinforcers are delivered by the former trneke et al 2008 in the context of authority a child may not adhere to rules delivered by their stepdad i dont have to do as you say youre not my real dad although linked to speaker credibility this approach to understanding why listeners may not follow rules differs in that it is not the apparent accuracy of the rule but perceived availability of consequences that is of interest returning to the compliance literature authority and perceived ability to mediate consequences do appear to impact rule-following an alternative interpretation of the aforementioned milgram 1974 uniform variation study is that participants believed the ordinary member of the public was less able to enforce consequences for rule compliancenon-compliance therefore the participant is less likely to comply with rules delivered by the confederate than those delivered by the experimenter similarly bickman 1974 reported that individuals were more likely to comply with rules delivered by a guard than a civilian or milkman this could be due to participants perceiving guards as having a greater capacity to enforce consequences eg enforcing a fine for non-compliance in the context of authority both the milgram 1974 and bickman 1974 examples could be interpreted as participants believing they must do as experimentersguards say within the rft literature authority does appear to impact rule-following donadeli and strapasson 2015 found that monitoring increased the probability that the participants would follow rules with participants exposed to verbal reprimands maintaining rule-following even when it was no longer advantageous to do so in this study the presence of an authoritative figure ie the experimenter who knew whether rules were being followed and would reprimand participants increased rule-following in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic if a speaker does not have the authoritydoes not appear to be able to mediate consequences for following the rule then a listener will be less likely to adhere to their rules what right have you to enforce these rules what will you do if i dont follow these rules for example an armed guard telling you to wear personal protective equipment will likely be more effective in producing rule-following than your younger sibling telling you the same thing ie the guard has authority and an ability to deliver consequences that your younger sibling does not therefore in order to promote adherence to rules speakers should ensure the listener believes they have authority and can deliver consequences for non-compliance for example a government official presenting restrictions for social distancing in line with recommendations from the world health organisation ie they have authority may refer to guards patrolling the streets to monitor individuals rule-following ie they can enforce consequences a rule is less likely to be followed if the listener perceives it as implausible barnes-holmes et al 2001 simply put if a rules relational network is contradictory or incoherent with the listeners learning history it is less likely to be followed trneke et al 2008 for example consider the rule if you want to predict and influence behavior then you must adopt a mechanistic approach and focus on describing behavior for functional contextualists this rule would be incoherent with their existing relational networks and thus is unlikely to be followed related to rule plausibility is perceived self-efficacy wherein the extent to which the listener believes they can follow the rule impacts whether it is followed barnes-holmes et al 2001 simply put if an individual believes they are incapable of successfully engaging in the behaviors specified in the rule then they are less likely to follow the rule the influence of rule plausibility has been addressed in treatment adherence literature for example if a physician wants to improve an individuals adherence to a regimentreatment plan then the physician must acquire an understanding of the individuals knowledge and perception of the proposed treatment martin williams haskard  dimatteo 2005 patient involvement and participatory decision making can increase rule-following by allowing physicians to address perceived incoherencies martin et al 2005 similarly this approach allows the individual to examine perceived self-efficacy and work with their physician to tailor regimens as required moreover individuals with higher levels of health literacy report greater adherence than those with lower health literacy miller 2016 one interpretation of this finding is that rules regarding treatment are more coherent ie plausible for individuals with high health literacy meaning they are more likely to be followed within the rft literature there is tentative support for the influence of rule plausibility on rule-following consider experimental work on pliance and tracking involving contingency insensitivity eg oconnor byrne ruiz  mchugh 2019 during these experiments reward and punishment contingencies are systematically modified ie responses that were previously reinforced are no longer reinforced while responses that were previously not reinforced are now reinforced during contingency shifting phases participants may begin to form new rules about what will maximize their access to reinforcers however these new rules are incoherent with the previous rules and therefore are less likely to be followed right away in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic if a rule is contradictory or incoherent with the listeners learning history then it is unlikely to be followed for example even if an authoritative figure tells you that injecting disinfectant may kill the virus you are unlikely to attempt this if your learning history allows you to frame ingesting disinfectant in opposition to staying alive therefore in order to promote adherence to evidence-based rules to reduce the spread of covid-19 speakers must ensure their rules are sensical within listeners learning histories extending listeners relational networks as required this will be particularly important when professionals are communicating with the public about covid-19 immunity eg covid-19 is not the same as the chickenpox so claims about immunity may be incoherent for some regarding perceived self-efficacy a listener must believe they can follow the rule this could be achieved by reassuring listeners of their capabilities modifying the rule based on listener feedback or even teaching the listener how to follow the rule a rule is less likely to be followed if it does not feature adequate motivative augmentals barnes-holmes et al 2001 motivative augmentals change the reinforcing value of consequences specified in the rule temporarily altering the degree to which established consequences serve as reinforcers or punishers ju  hayes 2008 trneke et al 2008 simply put motivative augmentals alter our interest in existing consequences villatte et al 2016 this is often achieved by bringing distant consequences to the present via language or encouraging clients to contact natural and social reinforcers barnes-holmes et al 2001 ju  hayes 2008 villatte et al 2016 connecting a rule to an individuals valueswhat matters to them makes it more likely to be followed the influence of motivation on rule-following has been addressed in treatment adherence literature with greater motivation linked to greater adherence to rules varming hansen andrsdttir husted  willaing 2015 vermeire hearnshaw van royen  denekens 2001 in the context of health when appropriate physicians can establish motivative augmentals by ensuring patients perceive their medical conditions to be serious and understand that they are at risk if they do not change atreja bellam  levy 2005 consider the following example of an individual aged 65 who has chronic lung disease in the context of the covid-19 pandemic when first advised to cocoon ie stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact they did not comply due to low perceived self-efficacy i cant cope with being cooped up for that long however after speaking to their physician they were informed that unless they cocoon they are in immediate danger following this the individual began cocooning despite previous failed attempts to do so in this example the individual evaluates the immediate effects of following the rule less negatively by valuing the consequences of following the rule more highly ie coping with being cooped up is less aversive than being in immediate danger in line with this within the rft literature researchers have demonstrated that consequences may be altered in accordance with comparative framing whelan barnes-holmes  dymond 2006 in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic a rule is less likely to be followed if it is not linked to what the listener cares about why should i stay at home im not going to die if i get sick for example individuals may break lockdown restrictions to meet up with friends if they do not believe they are at risk to reconnect rules to what matters to listeners speakers should set up appropriate motivative augmentals for example imagine now that the individuals breaking lockdown are reminded that they are putting their family members at risk you may not get sick and die but you could infect your family and they could get sick if this reminder changes the probability of these individuals breaking lockdown then it is functioning as an adequate motivative augmental it is important to note that listeners likely endorse different values which means that the motivative augmentals that function for one group will not necessarily work with another eg reminders that family members are at risk if you break lockdown are only likely to reduce rule-breaking if you care about your family members a rule is less likely to be followed if the behavior specified in the rule is not habitual for example if i want to reduce my risk of contracting covid-19 i must avoid touching my face from a cognitive neuroscience perspective habitual behavior is emitted regardless of shifts in the contingencies that originally influenced it bouton winterbauer  todd 2012 with habits arising from an overall history of reinforcement for emitting the particular response vahey et al 2017 wood  rnger 2016 simply put habits are cognitively efficient automatic and inflexible vahey et al 2017 therefore if the behaviors specified in the rule directly conflict with the listeners habits then the listener may be less likely to follow the rule in favor of cognitive efficiency particularly if performing a secondary task ruh cooper  mareschal 2010 drawing on cognitive neuroscience literature vahey et al 2017 describe features of habit behavior that elucidate how habits may interfere with rule-following specifically cognitive neuroscience data suggest that instrumental behaviors are particularly likely to become habitual when they are relatively straightforward and reinforced consistently in a stable environment where intensive reinforcement is delivered for a prolonged time period ostlund  balleine 2008 vahey et al 2017 wood  rnger 2016 these features appear to relate to plausibility and reinforcer availability in addition vahey et al 2017 suggest that instrumental behavior is particularly likely to become habitual when subject to variable interval schedules of reinforcement and the individual is disinclined to deliberate about the behavior the latter of these could relate to authority one of the most successful strategies for reducing interference from habits in daily life and experimental tasks involved attending to slip-ups and thinking dont do it quinn pascoe wood  neal 2010 this worked not by decreasing habit strength but by enhancing cognitive control ie the ability to focus on task-relevant information while inhibiting non-task-relevant information quinn et al 2010 another successful strategy involved tying inhibitory plans to cues that activate habits adriaanse et al 2010 conscious self-monitoring is central to reducing interference from habits in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic a listener may struggle to follow a rule which requires behavior that conflicts with their habits for example consider the rule if i want to reduce the spread of covid-19 then i must not shake hands at work meetings if shaking hands had become habitual for the listener they may need to consciously replace that action with a response that opposes the muscle movements required to shake hands eg waving instead providing people with suggestions for alternative opposing actions to replace habits will reduce habit interference and likely increase rule-following counterpliance is typically defined as rule-governed behavior under the control of socially-mediated consequences that are contacted by behaving in opposition to the behavior specified in the rule barnes-holmes et al 2001 hayes zettle  rosenfarb 1989 trneke et al 2008 functionally counterpliance is a form of pliance that can become problematic when generalized villatte et al 2016 simply put compliance and rebellion are two sides of the same coin but how socially mediated consequences are delivered may differ hayes et al 1989 it is important to note that while counterpliance often involves a listener behaving in direct opposition to the given rule this need not be the case an individual can not do as they are told without behaving in opposition per se for example consider the im not touching you game that is popular among siblings in this game the individual avoids touching their sibling but intentionally comes close to doing so this typically annoys their sibling who asks them to stop touching the individual is technically not touching their sibling and is technically adhering to their siblings request however the individual is aware that their sibling meant for them to stop almost touching them in a similar vein counterpliance may be understood as rule-governed behavior under the control of a history of socially-mediated reinforcement for a lack of correspondence between the rule and relevant behavior simply put counterpliance occurs when a listener intentionally does not follow the rule they believe the speaker intended while there has been a dearth of rft research on counterpliance it is highly relevant to rule-following and rule-breaking in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic a listener may not adhere to rules based on a history of peer support for behavior that explicitly deviates from established rules for example an adolescent may intentionally break rules around personal protective equipment removing their mask in public and fake coughing in order to receive negative attention the social psychology literature provides important insights into ways to manage counterpliance referred to as reactance in this body of literature from this perspective reactance serves to reestablish an individuals sense of freedom steindl jonas sittenthaler traut-mattausch  greenberg 2015 and is extremely similar to counterpliance reactance is less likely to occur when rule-following is monitored and the contingencies for rule-following are stronger than those for rule-breaking hayes et al 1989 steindl et al 2015 this appears to relate to authority and reinforcer availability in the context of rule-following during the covid-19 pandemic reynolds-tylus 2019 is particularly useful reynolds-tylus 2019 presents features of persuasive health communications that are likely to impact reactance freedom-threatening language message sensation and other-referencing messages are of particular importance in the pandemic context regarding freedom-threatening language while messages with the objective of enacting behavior change must be direct in advocating for specific actions explicit messages are more likely to incite reactance due to their freedom threatening nature reynolds-tylus 2019 regarding message sensation messages that are high in sensation value ie are dramatic exciting and novel are perceived as more persuasive with high sensation and low controlling language perceived as most effective xu 2015 regarding other-referencing messages ie messages that emphasize the influence of individuals choices on others relative to self-referencing messages other-referencing messages incited less reactance with participants responding more favorably to both the message and advocated health behaviors gardner  leshner 2016 therefore when attempting to reduce counterpliance while communicating rules to reduce the spread of covid-19 speakers should ensure messages have a high sensation value and are other-referencing in nature speakers should also ensure to balance freedom-threatening language with the need to explicitly advocate for specific behaviors as authorities establish rules and restrictions to reduce the spread of covid-19 it is important to understand what makes adherence more probabilistic rft allows us to understand how listeners interpret and respond to rules barnes-holmes et al 2001 drawing on work from barnes-holmes et al 2001 vahey et al 2017 cognitive neuroscience social psychology and health literature this paper identified important considerations for implementing public health measures to reduce the spread of covid-19 specifically speakers should attend to their credibility authority and ability to mediate consequences rule plausibility establishing adequate motivative augmental control whether the behavior specified in the rule opposes habits and whether the message incites counterpliance these guidelines may be of use to applied researchers developing public health interventions to promote rule-following while strict rule-following in every single context is undoubtedly problematic in the context of a global pandemic we must be able to promote adherence to rules based on guidelines and evidence from appropriate organizations none this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors   markus luczak-roesch  profiling the genetic evolution and dynamic spreading of viruses is a crucial task when responding to epidemic outbreaks we aim to devise novel ways to model visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak our approach relies on the application of transcendental information cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-ncov coronavirus we assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and identify touching points and temporal pathways that are candidates for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists  how far a virus will eventually spread at local regional national and international levels is of central concern during an epidemic outbreak due to the severe consequences large-scale epidemics have on human well-being 5  the stability and coherence of social systems 11  and the global economy 23  a thorough understanding of the genetic characteristics of a virus is crucial to understand the way it is or may be transmitted eg human-to-human transmissibility in order to be able to anticipate the potential reach of an outbreak and develop effective countermeasures the recent outbreak of a new type of coronavirus -2019-ncov -provides plenty of examples of the way researchers seek to quickly approach the aforementioned problems of genetic decomposition of the virus 2 8 and modelling of its transmission dynamics 15  here we present a novel approach to gain insights into the transmission dynamics of an epidemic outbreak our method is based on transcendental information cascades 16 17 and combines gene sequence analysis with temporal data mining to uncover potential relationships between a virus genetic evolution and distinct occurrences of infections we apply this new approach to publicly available genomic sequence data from the currently ongoing outbreak of the 2019-ncov coronavirus our results show pathways of similarity between certain clusters of 2019-ncov virus samples taken in different geographical locations and indicate coronavirus cases that are candidates for further investigation into the human touch points of these patients in order to derive a detailed understanding of how the virus may have spread and how and why it has genetically evolved our analysis provides a unique view to the dynamics of the 2019-ncov coronavirus outbreak that complements knowledge obtained using other state-of-the-art methods such as bayesian evolutionary analysis 9  we obtained a total of 87 genomic sequences from human subjects that were available via the gisaid epiflu database 1 as of monday february 10th 2020 these data were preprocessed using the r programming language first we derived a metadata object that allows to store the sequence identifier the collection location the collection date and the raw nucleotide sequence the metadata object was then filtered to keep only those sequences for which the collection date was not empty and which featured a length that fell within a margin of 1 000 of the estimated 30 000 nucleotides that are currently assumed to make up the genomic code of the 2019-ncov coronavirus ie we cover the range of nucleotide sequences from 29 000 to 31 000 in length this left us with a total of 82 genomic sequences we then exported a single csv file containing only the raw nucleotide sequences in ascending order by the collection date of the sample this structure is the standard input format for the genes-codon-samplesequence tokeniser featured in the transcendental information cascades r toolchain that is available as free and open scientific software 2  transcendental information cascades tics are a method that first transforms any kind of sequential data into a network of recurring information tokens to then exploit this network as a kind of analytical middle ground between views to the source data that would otherwise only be accessible individually through distinct analytical frameworks 16 17  the approach falls into the category of contemporary approaches that make use of network theory for the study of dynamical complex systems 4 19 21  in the field of phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis our approach can be compared to haplotype networks for example 1 18 but with the benefit that the resulting network preserves access to temporal patterns at both macroscopic eg whole generation time periods and microscopic eg short time period bursts resolution at an abstract level a transcendental information cascade is constructed from some figure 1  example of the unique codon tokenisation used in this study the example sequence comprises three window steps and shows how the 1 marked in blue 2 marked in orange and 3 marked in black reading frames lead to seven unique codon tokens extracted from the nucleotide sequence sequentially ordered source data in the following way at first the data from each distinct sequence step is processed to extract unique information tokens these tokens form the identifier set for that particular sequence step then a directed network is generated with one vertex for each sequence step and edges between any two vertices that have a particular token from their identifier set in common and that does not occur in any identifier set of vertices that represent sequence steps between these two in other words identifier sets represent information token co-occurrences and edges represent information token recurrences as the information tokens of interest in this study we encode unique codon identifiers as a their position when sliding a window of size 3 in steps of size 3 over the nucleotide sequence eg pos1 pos2  b a flag that indicates the reading frame 1 2 or 3 that captures the respective triplet in the current window and c the actual matched nucleotide triplet that constitutes the matched codon the use of this tokenisation is motivated by previous work on phylogenetic profiling and gene sequencing 6 13 that suggested that codons suit well for assessing similarities and dissimilarities at the gene chromosome or genome levels 6 14 22  an example of the particular encoding we use is visualised in figure 1  it is this tokenisation of the original nucleotide sequences that we use in the tic approach to construct the information token recurrence network from this means in our tic instantiation the nodes represent distinct nucleotide sequences of the virus obtained from patient samples ordered by the date of their collection by researchers random order in case of same date collections the edges are unique codon identifier recurrences matched between different nucleotide sequences the tic network we derive in the way described before can be analysed in a variety of ways information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures have been introduced as the base framework to start the analysis from 16  in particular we perform 1 an analysis of the information token entropy and evenness over time 2 an analysis of network clusters of sequences that can be detected in the tic network and 3 an analysis of the intra-cluster and inter-cluster nucleotide similarity of the original sequences we perform an analysis of information token entropy and information token evenness in order to understand whether the virus evolution can be considered an open or a closed system therefore we assess both measures in an accumulated fashion for each progression step through the ordered nucleotide sequences in a closed system the information token entropy should strive towards an equilibrium of maximum entropy and not feature any wave-like up and down patterns if we observe wave-like patterns it means nucleotide sequences at later progression stages feature codon identifiers that have not been observed in earlier nucleotide sequences so to measure information token entropy we assess which unique codon identifiers were seen up to a progression step and how often these were seen this allows to compute the probability for every codon identifier which then can be used to determine the information token entropy up to that point following the definition of shannon entropy given as follows network analysis the transcendental information cascade network we constructed can be mathematically and visually analysed in order to find structures that are of particular significance for a single epidemic outbreak or to compare different outbreaks structurally in this study we focus on the former due to the lack of comparative data about other epidemic outbreaks we first perform a cluster analysis using the random walk apporach by blondel et al 3 on the weighted network that we can construct from our original tic network by collapsing all edges between the same vertices to unique edges weighted by the sum of the collapsed edges see figure 2 for a schematic example and figure 4 for the actual networks we construct following this approach afterwards we analyse visually the network using the open source software gephi in gephi we scale vertices by their degree and edges by their weight furthermore we colour vertices by their cluster membership we then run the yifan hu 12 layout algorithm optimal distance 10000 relative strength 02 initial step size 20 step ratio 095 quadtree max level 50 theta 08 convergence threshold 1  10 4  adaptive cooling enabled to visualise the network we repeat the exact same process to construct and visualise three further networks cf cluster evaluation in order to evaluate the meaningfulness of the tic network against some baseline we computer the intra-cluster and inter-cluster similarity of the raw nucleotide sequences this is done by computing all pairwise comparisons of sequences within individual clusters intra-cluster similarity and comparison between all sequences from a cluster with all sequences that are not within that cluster inter-cluster similarity using the comparestrings function provided by the biostrings r package 20  the similarity of two sequences is then simply defined as follows number of dif f erent nucleotides length of compared nucleotide sequence it is important to note that not all sequences we obtained had the exact same length mean length of nucleotide sequences 2986195 standard deviation 2840705 hence we performed this comparison only on the sub-sequence from the first nucleotide position to the maximum nucleotide position of the shorter of the two sequences a and b information-theoretic analysis figure 3 shows the graphs for the information token entropy and information token informationtheoretic assessment both entropy and evenness graphs feature wave-like patterns indicating that the set of observed unique codon identifiers grows with increasing progression stages while the distribution of all observed unique codon identifiers remains rather even evenness as one can see these feature the aforementioned wave-like patterns which means the system can be regarded open in the sense that over time the number of unique codon identifiers grows it is important to note that the evenness of the distribution of codon identifiers is relatively high converging around a value of 095 this means that those codon identifiers that have been observed are quite evenly distributed these results allow the interpretation that a there is evolving variation in the genomic sequences we studied but b there is no indication for the dominance of a particular variance the weighted network derived from the original tic network features a modularity of 0762 and a diameter of 7 which mainly reflects its small size and its particular structure that results from preserving temporal order in the sense that edges can only ever direct forward in time ie to vertices that represent a later stage however with an average degree of 8671 we find that there is certainly structure that differs from just simple step-by-step forward paths that lead to the consecutively next node this latter result suggests that some codon paths branch and merge emphasising that there is an evolving variation in the studied genomic sequences from the cluster analysis in combination with a visual inspection of the resulting graph please refer to figure 6 as well as table 11 in the appendix we find the following patterns that are noteworthy  at the center of the network one cluster emerges dark red cluster 0 that has only few stronger connections within the cluster but features connections to all other clusters and within itself through lower weighted edges this cluster has no temporal focus it comprises samples that were collected early as well as later during the outbreak while the genome sequences that represent the beginning of the progression stage path in this cluster are from china it then transitions geographically to australia japan korea germany taiwan and singapore  the light red cluster cluster 1 comprises a coherent sequence of samples taken from patients in the original outbreak region wuhan and is temporally focused on the early progression stages  the orange cluster starting from the bottom center of the network cluster 2 is again first a sequence of samples from the original outbreak region in wuhan transitioning to thailand nonthaburi then back to china guangdong before finishing in france  cluster 4 light green is one of the smallest clusters but is spread fairly wide temporally it features 4 samples taken in china and then transitions geographically to singapore and france  in dark green cluster 5 we can identify a cluster of genome data that was collected in chonggqing the usa and singapore  the light blue cluster cluster 6 is a temporally quite coherent sequence that links samples taken in guangdong guangzhou and foshan  a kind of international cluster samples from australia the usa england finland and belgium is represented by the dark blue cluster cluster 7 figure 4  weighted tic network from the original tic network we generate a weighted network by collapsing all edges between the same vertices to unique edges weighted by the sum of the collapsed edges the colours represent the nine identified network clusters node size represents the degree and edge thickness represents edge weight in the sense that higher edge weight indicates a higher amount of codon identifiers shared by two vertices numeric indices before the genome identifiers represent the progression stage index of the particular vertex in the sequence of all ordered nucleotide sequences we analysed we suggest that while there are some obvious pathways of high similarity due to temporal order of the samples taken there are still good indications for geographicaldependencies and transition phases that deserve further investigation transition points into and out of cluster 0 are particularly interesting in this regard especially when the clusters linking in our out feature samples taken outside of china we suggest that it may be worth to qualitatively assess the human-to-human connections the respective subjects had from which these samples were taken and the places they have visited if there are no known links between the samples so far triangulating the full tic network with the networks that focus on individual reading frame similarity only please refer to figures 6 7 and 8 as well as tables 13 15 and 17 in the appendix shows that the macroscopic structure is mostly consistent but much sparser in terms of low-weighted edges inter-and intra-cluster similarity from our measurement of the intra-cluster similarity see table 1  we find that the genomic similarity at the level of nucleotides is low in the central cluster 0 which is expected because this is the largest of all clusters with low temporal coherence however cluster 5 also features a slightly lower average similarity with comparably high standard deviation which indicates that this cluster may be slightly less coherent the barchart of the inter-cluster analysis results shown in figure 5 reveals that there are some cluster pairs with high inter-cluster similarity that the inter-cluster similarity is different between the 3 reading frame network and the other two reading frame networks and that the pattern of the 3 reading frame network inter-cluster similarity is similar to the one for the entire tic network in particular we find that in the 1 and 2 reading frame networks the clusters 1 4 6 and 7 are quite similar at the nucleotide level compared to all other clusters that are pairwise distinct for the entire tic network and the 3 reading frame network instead we find that clusters 1 3 5 and 7 show this kind of similarity altogether these results indicate that a in some instances the clustering based on structural characteristics of the tic network overrides actual genomic similarity and b the choice of the reading frames during tic construction has an impact on the resulting network that needs to be further investigated in this paper we presented a novel way to model visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of an epidemic outbreak we applied transcendental information cascades to capture the recurrence and co-occurrence of unique codon identifiers over distinct and temporally ordered nucleotide sequences derived from genetic samples taken from different human subjects our case study was focused on the recent outbreak of the novel 2019-ncov coronavirus we find clusters and evolution pathways of virus genomes in the constructed transcendental information cascade that are candidates to be investigated further for potential human-to-human transmission paths and genetic evolution of the 2019-ncov coronavirus our study was performed as a snapshot case study on a limited sample of virus data while this was at the time of this study all data that was available we will need to re-execute this analysis continuously as more data becomes available to check whether any of our results change furthermore our results indicate that

spread in natural host populations k king c c lively m   it seems to be conventional wisdom that genetically homogeneous populations suffer from more severe pathogen outbreaks than diverse populations elton 1958 sherman et al 1988 schmid-hempel 1998 altizer et al 2003 infection is more likely to be transmitted between genetically similar hosts anderson and may 1986 and upon encountering resistant hosts parasites would likely die fail to successfully reproduce anderson and may 1986 or otherwise be removed from the population keesing et al 2006 as such the risk of infection especially by virulent pathogens may select for outcrossing over uniparental forms reproduction such as self-fertilization or parthenogenesis jokela et al 2009 king et al 2009 morran et al 2011 resulting in an overall increase in genetic diversity king et al 2011 there may not seem to be an escape from disease but genetic diversity in host populations may reduce the risk of infection the empirical link between disease spread and genetic diversity has its origin in agricultural research agricultural fields represent environments in which plants are selected for high yield and may therefore exhibit less genetic polymorphism than those in the wild it is well known that disease epidemics have devastated agricultural monocultures for example rice blast zhu et al 2000 and that monocultures are typically more susceptible to outbreaks than diverse mixtures of crops mundt 2002 this association between low diversity and high disease incidence is called the monoculture effect for example elton 1958 leonard 1969 garrett and mundt 1999 zhu et al 2000 pilet et al 2006 here we examine how genetic diversity affects the spread of disease in natural populations we also consider the theoretical basis for the monoculture effect in host populations and suggest that there may be a diversity threshold for disease spread the most notable examples of the monoculture effect in natural populations come from the dramatic epidemics in small populations of endangered species particularly mammals for example obrien et al 1985 thorne and williams 1988 genetic bottlenecks have reduced the genetic variability in cheetahs particularly at the major histocompatibility complex and endangered populations of these animals have been decimated by coronavirus epizootics obrien et al 1985 similarly the endangered black-footed ferret may have been extirpated from its natural habitat because low genetic diversity aided the spread of a virulent canine distemper epizootic thorne and williams 1988 range expansion and habitat isolation caused by human activities can also generate small founder populations with low genetic diversity newly-colonised western populations of italian agile frogs rana latastei are genetically depauperate and they have an increased susceptibility to a novel emerging ranavirus pearman and garner 2005 similarly dam construction in the senegal river basin likely permitted the rapid expansion of snails biomphalaria pfeifferi  which serve as the first-intermediate host for the human disease schistosomiasis campbell et al 2010 recently established biomphalaria snail populations are genetically homogenous compared with those in natural habitats in zimbabwe they are also more susceptible to infection and this increases the opportunity for parasite transmission to humans campbell et al 2010 by reducing individual-level and population-level genetic heterozygosity inbreeding can increase host susceptibility to infectious parasites dwyer et al 1997 acevedo-whitehouse et al 2003 spielman et al 2004 ellison et al 2011 in wild populations acevedo-whitehouse et al 2003 found that heavily inbred california sea lions were more infected and consequently may act as pathogen reservoirs spreading parasites in sea lion populations but is increased susceptibility directly due to reduced diversity or does inbreeding depression have an effect by compromising host condition by manipulating the levels of inbreeding in drosophila melanogaster in laboratory experiments spielman et al 2004 confirmed that the increase in disease susceptibility resulted from a lower frequency of resistance alleles in the population and not by generalized inbreeding effects inbreeding effects were similarly excluded as a reason for why offspring from inbred populations of daphnia a freshwater crustacean were more susceptible to a vertically-transmitted parasite than those from outbred populations ebert et al 2007 finally kerstes and wagner 2012 found that inbreeding increased parasite-induced mortality in the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum by prolonging development time but it did not increase susceptibility to infection founder populations provide the opportunity to examine the effects of inbreeding and small population size on the link between genetic diversity and parasite resistance for example in a comparison of founder versus ancestral mainland populations of deer mice meagher 1999 found that inbred island populations in lake michigan had higher infection levels and lower genetic diversity the link between diversity and parasite spread has even been revealed when comparing large and small founder populations hawks colonizing smaller galpagos islands possessed lower genetic diversity produced low antibody titer and had a higher abundance of parasites than more outbred populations on larger islands whiteman et al 2006 uniparental forms of reproduction such as self-fertilization or parthenogenesis should have similar consequences for parasite resistance as biparental inbreeding along these lines self-fertilizing populations and inbred sexual populations were both found to have higher infection rates by a trematode parasite compared with outbred sexual populations of topminnows poeciliopsis monacha lively et al 1990 in another species of partially-selfing fish kryptolebias marmoratus ellison et al 2011 found that outcrossing increased the genetic diversity of wild populations and decreased their susceptibility to multiple parasites mating systems can also directly affect genetic diversity and parasite resistance busch et al 2004 williams et al 2011 for example in eusocial insect colonies queens can mate with a single male or with multiple males polyandry which determines the level of relatedness among individuals within a colony high relatedness among individuals in a population can enhance the evolution of cooperation hamilton 1964a 1964b 1987 but the genetic similarity between individuals may also facilitate the spread of parasites shykoff and schmid-hempel 1991 schmid-hempel 1998 as such multiple mating has been suggested as an evolutionary response to parasite pressure hamilton 1987 sherman et al 1988 which may counteract the high risk of parasite transmission and increase the overall productivity of the colony schmid-hempel 1994 schmid-hempel and crozier 1999 brown and schmid-hempel 2003 numerous studies on ants and bees have indeed found that multiply mated queens form more resistant colonies baer and schmid-hempel 1999 2001 tarpy 2003 hughes and boomsma 2004 tarpy and seeley 2006 seeley and tarpy 2007 and that offspring fathered by different males do vary in susceptibility to infection baer and schmid-hempel 2003 ultimately the balance between the costs for example within-colony conflict reduced offspring output and benefits for example resistance to a range of parasites associated with heterogeneity in colonies may determine the optimal level of polyandry baer and schmid-hempel 2001 van baalen and beekman 2006 polygyny the presence of multiple queens within a single colony can also decrease the relatedness among individuals and increase the variety of resistance alleles in the colony studies in which the number of founding queens was experimentally manipulated have confirmed that colonies founded by multiple queens have lower parasite loads liersch and schmid-hempel 1998 reber et al 2008 in addition workers from polygynous colonies of an ant cardiocondyla obscurior were better at detecting disease and removing infected individuals from the nest than workers from nests having a single queen ugelvig et al 2010 increases in infection prevalence in the wild is associated with genetic bottlenecking and inbreeding induced by founder effects or mating systems thus host population genetic diversity seems to have an important role in buffering populations against epidemics but how exactly does genetic diversity reduce disease spread an association between genetic diversity and disease spread might be detected by categorizing populations as being either genetically homogenous or diverse this comparative method can tell us that diversity matters but does not indicate the amount of genetic diversity required for a population to be resistant or the diversity threshold recently two insightful empirical studies have quantified the effect of genetic diversity on resistance in host populations altermatt and ebert 2008 and ganz and ebert 2010 conducted semi-natural mesocosm and lab experiments respectively whereby monoclonal and polyclonal daphnia populations were exposed to microparasites parasites spread significantly faster altermatt and ebert 2008 and infection rates are higher ganz and ebert 2010 in host monocultures compared with polycultures of several genotypes with higher allelic diversity these studies suggest that the relationship between host diversity and infection may not be complex and that a handful of host genotypes in the population can be enough to hamper parasite transmission the benefits of host genetic diversity however may also depend on the genetic diversity of the parasite population boomsma and ratnieks 1996 van baalen and beekman 2006 ganz and ebert 2010 if the parasite population is genetically homogenous increases in host population genetic diversity might boost the opportunity for parasites to encounter a susceptible host boomsma and ratnieks 1996 van baalen and beekman 2006 alternatively in a diverse parasite population there is a high probability that one of a diverse set of parasite genotypes can infect a homogeneous host population van baalen and beekman 2006 and genetically diverse host populations are at an advantage consistent with these ideas ganz and ebert 2010 found no difference in infection levels among experimental daphnia monocultures and polycultures when populations were exposed to a single-parasite genotype however polycultures were more resistant when populations were exposed to multiple parasite genotypes there has been surprisingly little theoretical work on the effect of genetic diversity on disease spread two models suggest that genetic variation in host susceptibility would not affect infectious disease spread springbett et al 2003 yates et al 2006 but it might reduce the severity of infection springbett et al 2003 in these models hosts varied in susceptibility to a single pathogen strain but no host genotype was completely resistant to infection in contrast lively 2010a found that host genetic diversity could reduce the risk of disease spread assuming that each host genotype was susceptible to a different parasite genotype this assumption is consistent with the matching-alleles model for infection frank 1993 otto and michalakis 1998 the matching-alleles model is a useful framework for studying selfnon-self-recognition systems in animals and it is supported by studies on invertebrate immunity grosberg and hart 2000 carius et al 2001 dybdahl et al 2008 duneau et al 2011 luijckx et al 2011 in addition the framework seems robust to the assumption of single-genotype specificity agrawal and lively 2002 engelstaedter and bonhoeffer 2009 the more recent model suggests that increases in the genetic diversity of host populations could have a large effect on disease spread and prevalence at equilibrium lively 2010a the model assumes that there are no co-infections and that each parasite genotype can only infect one genetically determined resistance phenotype in the host population which is the standard assumption of the matching-alleles model for infection the results suggest that r0 for each parasite genotype i depends on total host density as well as the frequency of the matching host genotype where matches between host and parasite genotypes yield an infection thus disease transmission is both density and frequency dependent the effect of host density on r0 is asymptotic on bgi where gi is the frequency of the matching host genotype and b is the number of parasite propagules produced by each infection that make contact with a host lively 2010a thus b is equal to the total number of propagules produced by an infection multiplied by the frequency of propagules that contact a host for large host populations n200 the effect of further increasing the host population size has little effect but increasing the number of host genotypes has a large effect because increasing the number of host genotypes decreases the frequency gi of each genotype under parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection the frequency of each host genotype would be expected on average to be approximately 1g where g is the total number of host genotypes in the population under these conditions r0 for large populations is approximately bg this result suggests that experimentally doubling the number of host genotypes in the population would reduce r0 by one half and that this would be roughly true even if the experiment increased the total number of hosts in the population assuming the population is already large the analytical results also suggest that the parasite would die out following the addition of genetic diversity to the host population provided that the frequency of each host genotype declines to less than 1b we used computer simulations to examine the gist of these ideas the simulations assumed a haploid host with two loci coding for resistance each locus could have up to three alleles for a total of nine different genotypes each of the host genotypes could be infected by one of nine different parasite genotypes consistent with the matching-alleles model for infection in these simulations birth rates of the host were density dependent and infection reduced the intrinsic birth rate by 30 the parameters where chosen for illustrative purposes the details of the simulation are given in lively 2010b we began the simulation with two alleles at one locus and three alleles at the other locus giving six possible host genotypes an uninfected host population was initiated at carrying capacity k40 000 where the number of hosts of each genotype was determined by randomly assigning allele frequencies at the two loci at generation 1 one host of each genotype was introduced as infected thereafter the infected hosts of each genotype were introduced into the population with a probability of 002 per generation to simulate immigration of infected individuals we started by assuming b9 meaning each infection produced nine propagules that contacted a host from the analytical results we would expect under that the average value for r0 would be bg9615 where g is the number of genotypes as such the pathogen would be expected to spread in the population as was indeed the case figure 1a after an initial oscillatory period the gene frequency dynamics stabilized figure 1a and the prevalence of infection also stabilized for the parameter values considered here figure 1b r0 converged on the predicted value of 15 figure 1c we then introduced a third allele at the second locus at generation 100 which increased the number of possible genotypes from six to nine the allele quickly spread as it conferred resistance on three of the nine possible genotypes for which there was no matching parasite genotype figure 1a average r0 quickly dropped to below 1 as the allele spread in the population figure 1c and the frequency of infection declined sharply figure 1b matching parasite genotypes were introduced into the population by migration at a rate of 002 per genotype per generation which lead to selection against the new allele after it became common as well as to a slight increase in r0 figure 1c this resulted in sufficient selection to equalize allele frequencies so that the frequency of each genotype approximated 1g at this point r0 was equal to one bg991 and parasite prevalence fell close to zero but was maintained at a low level by immigration figure 1b the point is that introducing a single novel allele in the host population increased the number of possible genotypes by 50 this lead to virtual elimination of the parasite as the prevalence of infection plummeted from about 60 to near zero a reduction in prevalence occurred despite the fact that matching parasite genotypes were also introduced into the population and that the host population size remained large that is close to 40 000 individuals results not shown clearly under the assumptions of the present model small increases in allelic diversity can cause dramatic reductions in parasitism even in very large host populations in addition elimination of the pathogen is not necessarily followed by a loss of genetic diversity in the host population as the different host genotypes are selectively neutral in the absence of parasite pressure figure 1a the available data and the model are consistent with the idea that genetic diversity in host populations can reduce the spread of disease however a practical question arises would the beneficial effect of adding hosts with novel genotypes in order to increase local genetic diversity outweigh the positive effect of increasing population size on r0 a possible answer is also suggested by the model which suggests that the effect of increasing population size on r0 shows diminishing returns with host density such that r0 is asymptotic on bg figure 2 as such while increasing host population size does strongly affect r0 in small host populations it has a small effect in large host populations figure 2 this suggests that increasing genetic diversity can still reduce parasite prevalence even though host population size is also increased the results in figure 2 suggest that boosting genetic diversity could overcome the effect of increasing host population size even when the latter is increased by fourfold critically the diversity threshold does not work by simply reducing the population size of the individual genotypes the threshold in fact was calculated by assuming an infinite host population size rather it works by reducing the probability of successful infection by reducing the frequency of matching host genotypes for each parasite genotype consistent with results from agricultural populations the existing literature suggests that high genetic diversity could buffer host populations against disease spread although observational studies from natural populations of vertebrates for example cheetahs sea lions fish and frogs may have limitations they strongly suggest that diversity matters and their results are consistent with experimental studies on freshwater crustaceans and social insects however several questions remain
does a diversity threshold exist in other words can parasites be eliminated by increasing host genetic diversity above some threshold valuewhat are the relative effects of host density and host genetic diversity on disease spreadwhat are the effects of genetic diversity in the parasite population versus that of the host populationwhat is the heritability of parasite resistance in natural populations very little is known about the heritability for resistance in natural populations it should be high in populations where genetic diversity is maintained by parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection these issues would be best addressed by data from natural populations if parasites take hold or die out depending on how much host genetic diversity exists relative to the threshold determining whether diversity thresholds exist in natural populations may have great value this may be particularly helpful for conserving endangered species and mediating

gunther eysenbach sherif badawy jodie guest l carlos del rio travis sanchez   the world is experiencing the expansive spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in a global pandemic that was first reported on december 31 2019 in wuhan china what began as cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology was identified as a novel coronavirus on january 7 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the illness that comes from sars-cov-2 was named a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 1 by that time it had ravaged much of china the epidemic is accelerating the time from the first reported case to the first 100000 cases was 67 days it took 11 days for the next 100000 cases 4 days for the following 100000 cases and 3 days for the subsequent 100000 cases as of march 31 2020 there are 858669 cases and 42151 deaths in the world attributed directly to covid-19 188530 cases and 3889 deaths in the united states a 503 and 685 increase respectively in 2 days we should remember that 1 month ago on march 1 there were only 30 cases in the united states 2 every region of the globe is currently impacted by covid-19 3 the enormous strain this pandemic is placing on health care systems across the world is palpable from testing capacity to supply chains for personal protective equipment ppe specimen collection swabs and supplies and equipment including ventilators for those requiring hospital care new approaches are needed to scale up testing for covid-19 to reduce the needs for ppe and specimen collection swabs and to allow testing for sars-cov2 outside of health care facilities new cases of covid-19 infection and casualties continue to multiply and mixed messages abound as the public health world has urgently recommended covid-19 prevention measures they are being questioned as being too vast hard to follow invasive to our lifestyle and damaging to the economy public health experts have either been sidelined in the covid-19 response decisions or have found themselves at odds with much of the information being presented by political leadership in the united states the country currently with the largest number of covid-19 cases president trump extended the initial 15-day national slow down and called for social distancing until april 30 2020 in an attempt to reduce the spread of the virus 45 states like california illinois and new york have implemented state-wide stay-at-home ordinances while other states have implemented less restrictive measures or no statewide measures at all 6-8 determining the proper scale and timing of these measures is critical to controlling the spread of covid-19 and the numbers of lives lost we believe that the best public health evidence must inform activities in three priority areas to stop this pandemic 1 coordinated and consistent stay-at-home orders across multiple jurisdictions including potential nationwide mandates 2 rapid scale-up of sars-cov-2 testing and 3 improved health care capacity to respond there is public health consensus that limiting the number of contacts between persons can slow covid-19 transmission in a community and give time for health care systems to respond the most substantial of these approaches is a government order to stay at home except for food and medical needs although there are now multiple theoretical and practical models about how stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions could slow covid-19 transmission it is clear from all of them that consistency in implementation and communication is key these policies will only be effective if they are implemented in a coordinated manner across large geographic regions where people commonly move but there remain multiple examples of these public health interventions not being uniformly implemented for instance our city atlanta georgia quickly implemented several local variations of stay-at-home recommendations from multiple city and county levels that comprise our metropolitan area yet the state-wide recommendation was only implemented several weeks later this meant that people who are told not to come to work in one atlanta county had no such order where they lived and continued to congregate in public places this patchwork response is not unique to the united states and illustrates an underlying lack of understanding about how to use these public health measures to slow the transmission of infectious diseases this inconsistency in implementing public health measures has also created substantial amounts of public confusion and fodder for social media conspiracy theories hyperpartisanship and distrust of experts covid-19 is the first true global pandemic of the social media era offering new opportunities for rapid distribution of accurate public health information to millions of people unfortunately these critical public health communications about actions to take to protect oneself from covid-19 are not easy to differentiate from inaccurate or even dangerously wrong information having correct information that is well reasoned and delivered through consistent messaging are all pillars of behavior change including changing peoples transmission-related behaviors in response to covid-19 9 social media is now one of the most predominant ways that people get information and public health must find better ways to communicate about mitigation plans through these forums decisions about covid-19 mitigation policies must be informed by the best epidemiologic information which requires rapid scale-up of covid-19 testing this will require rapid development of new diagnostic tests laboratory capacity testing supply chains and health care personnel to collect the specimens novel testing strategies under development including the use of rapid diagnostic tests serological tests and self-collected specimens will improve our ability to screen a large number of people quickly and give us a new understanding of the extent of exposure disease and recovery this information will be vital to epidemiologic modeling to support information-driven decision making on the appropriate timing and scope of the response there are also a rapidly growing number of examples of innovative approaches to implementing covid-19 testing including some examples of successful large-scale screening programs like drive-up testing in south korea where thousands of tests were delivered each day 10 changing the course of covid-19 disease in heavily impacted countries such as the united states will require a massive scale-up of testing compared to what has been conducted to date for instance in the united states the rate of total covid-19 testing up to this point is just under 3000 tests per 1 million people or 964865 overall since january 10 2020 11 that has been an admittedly dismal response to testing with a focus mainly on those who are most severely ill this rate of testing does not meet the needs of the health care sector response much less the needs to better understand covid-19 epidemiology in a way that will make control measures most effective we should be testing at least 1 million us residents every week 03 of the population during this phase of the pandemic additionally there is a need for shorter time from test to results to better guide care and isolation decisions and we must find new ways of reaching more people with testing without overburdening our already taxed health care systems the control of movement and scale-up of covid-19 testing will only be successful in truncating the covid-19 pandemic and reducing lives lost if there is an immediate commitment of resources to improve the capacity of the health care sector to respond reports from multiple countries already impacted by covid-19 predict that health care capacity will be rapidly exceeded as transmission grows under the current predictions of covid-19 transmission the ability of the health care sector to respond will certainly require coordination of efforts to increase the capacity of hospital beds ventilators protective equipment and the clinicians who use them protecting the health and safety of health care workers is vital to the health of each of us and to the workings of our health care system there needs to be a high level of commitment to the safety of health care professionals by providing them with the tools to prevent nosocomial covid-19 infections although this implicitly means making sure all health care workers have appropriate ppes this can also come in the form of telemedicine and other virtual care trends such has chatbots that capitalize on advances in technology to provide care for patients outside of a hospital setting until the time hospitalization is needed this form of care protects our health care workforce and maximizes the scope of care that can be provided with less impact on the hospital setting our global public health response to covid-19 will only be successful if we rapidly generate the best data to inform decisions from our political leaders regarding resources and policies to slow transmission and improve our response this is an unprecedented global public health crisis that will require not only strong political commitment and courage but also innovation on a capacity and timing scale that was inconceivable 3 months ago what we do right now and how quickly we do it will directly change how long covid-19 is with us and how many people will die it is critical that science-based information guide our public health strategies and that leaders listen to our best information much of public health is about making changes to improve human life but without much announcement it is impossible to determine the number of lives saved due to epidemiologic research yet it is unquestionable that our discipline has saved millions of lives through the implementation of interventions and preventative programs our training to understand and use data to protect our communities has not been needed more it is also our responsibility to use our skills wisely and in a steadfast way that does not bend to the whim of politics but instead affirms what we know loudly if needed and highlights what we still need to determine as quickly and accurately as possible to protect our world  global surveillance travel and trade during a pandemic ceren etn ate kara   pandemic is defined as an epidemic occurring worldwide or over a very wide area that crosses international borders and affects a great number of people 1 according to the world health organization who a pandemic is considered to have begun once a disease not encountered before in a population emerges and once the agent of the disease spreads easily and constantly among people and causes a virulent disease 2 the fact that a disease is prevalent and leads to the loss of a large number of people does not make it sufficient to be defined as a pandemic it should also be transmissible 2 a pandemic increases morbidity and mortality in a very large geographic area and provokes social and political deterioration it has a vital position throughout human history and in the development of civilizations due to profound socioeconomic problems caused by pandemics they have resulted in changes in the agenda of countries and put forward issues most particularly sanitation rules that people should pay attention to while coexisting  throughout history there have been many epidemics like variola and tuberculosis one of the most destructive pandemics was the plague that killed an estimated 75200 million people in the 14th century considering that the world population was approximately 475 million in that century the fatal effect of the pandemic can be comprehended more easily 3  the plague had begun in china and central asia and spread to the whole world the transmission of plague to europe became possible by the chinese merchandise sold to europe by asian traders 4 it is known that the fleas and mice on the ship were effective in the spread of the disease in the meantime crimean tatars had invaded genoese harbor and thrown their dead bodies carrying the plague using catapults into the city and transmitted the disease to the italians 4 the first italian cities to encounter the plague were genoa messina and venice afterwards the plague arrived to paris in 1348 and affected london in 1349 and after having penetrated into scotland and scandinavia it reached to its origin the land of the tatars it caused death of one-thirds of people living in europe shortly after the spread of the pandemic people experienced psychological destruction nonetheless the aftermath of the plague saw a rise in the lack of confidence towards administrations cutback in social activities and communication and led people to distance themselves from one another and caused an increase in product and labor an economic collapse was seen in the world mainly in europe that had just started to recover from famine 4  millions of people were killed due to cholera pandemic in the 19th century 5 there were four influenza pandemics in the 20th and 21st centuries in 1918 the spanish flu led to the death of 2050 million people worldwide world population was approximately 18 billion during that time and estimated case-fatality rate was determined as 23 6 the 195758 pandemic known as the asian flu resulted in the death of 14 million people worldwide and the 1968-69 pandemic referred to as the hong kong flu caused the death of 14 million people worldwide estimated case-fatality rate of the 20092010 influenza a h1n1 pandemic was established as 002 the age group the pandemic affected the most was children and young adults it resulted in the death of 100400 thousand people worldwide 6  last year around the end of 2019 a novel coronavirus pneumonia case group was identified in the wuhan city of the province of hubei in china rapidly spreading around the country an epidemic arose and increasing number of cases started to be seen in other countries in february 2020 the world health organization defined covid-19 which meant 2019 coronavirus disease the virus causing covid-19 was referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 an interim guideline was published by the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 78 covid-19 was announced as a pandemic by the world health organization in 11 march 2020 and the pandemic is still continuing  during a pandemic steps include controlling and surveilling the outbreak finding the center bringing the source under control preventing human-to-human transmission ensuring social distancing and determining vaccination and treatment agents 9  in a model based on the 1918 flu pandemic analysis it is assumed that one-third of the transmissions occurred in houses one-third occurred in schools and workplaces and the other one-third among the general public in the united states of america thus an important control strategy would target the closing of schools and workplaces 10 it should be seriously questioned whether hospitals would have the extreme capacity to treat a large number of patients or not if not at sufficient capacity necessary planning should be made by local supporters and public health officials in order to meet the deficit other measures include planning healthcare services in alternative settings other than hospitals taking necessary infection control measures and drawing up clear guidelines in favor of public health for patient consent 11 it is necessary to form appropriate infrastructure and credible communication systems to coordinate public health intervention and plan and appoint leaders at national and local levels 12  the world health organization who recommends countries to make their own pandemic risk evaluations since incidence of human and animal cases in different countries in the world and the procedures to be done thereafter would differ who updated its pandemic influenza risk management guideline in 2017 this guideline can be used to inform and conform national and international pandemic preparations and interventions countries should review andor update their national flu preparation and intervention plans in order to reflect the approach taken in this guideline moreover roles and responsibilities of who regarding pandemic preparations were also stated in terms of supporting member countries in line with the crisis and risk management policies this guideline does not intend to replace national plans that should be developed by each country national pandemic influenza risk evaluation aims at determining the probability and outcomes of events affecting public health at a global national and local level it constitutes the basis to act against and decrease the negative consequences of public health risks 13 it is attempted to make predictions with statistical models on when the agent would penetrate into the country or cities in the event of a pandemic 14  pandemic influenza phases reflect risk assessment of the global status concerning each and every influenza virus with a potential to be pandemic and to infect people initially these assessments are carried out when these types of viruses are defined and afterwards updated according to virologic epidemiologic and clinical data obtained  global phase represents the spread of the novel flu subtype to the world taking the disease it causes into consideration and separating it into interpandemic alarm pandemic and transition phases global phases are used by who to convey global status pandemic phase is the period of global spreading transitions between interpandemic alarm and pandemic phases can be rapid and gradual 13  as pandemic viruses emerge countries and regions face different risks at different times therefore it is strongly recommended for countries to develop their own national risk assessments by considering information provided by who hence decisions for national risk management of any country are expected to be based on local risk assessments but also to be informed by global risk assessments 13 who should be able to follow the development process of the pandemic and guide countries with appropriate methods like strengthened surveillance and active monitorization who should make suggestions in medical and nonmedical issues for this purpose who should announce data independently and in a transparent manner thus who requires accurate and rapid data flow from every government in order to fulfill its obligation 15 united nations un on the other hand is a much larger system un aids in countries to adapt themselves to necessary arrangements strengthening technical capacities of the countries during pandemics through the peacekeeping commission united nations development program and united nations childrens fund 16  risk assessment regarding pandemic influenza includes defining influenza viruses reviewing significant virologic and clinical information on each and every influenza virus and classifying these as regards pandemic potency and probable outcomes evaluation of exposure aims at identifying exposure to an upsetting flu virus individual groups with a probability to become ill and defining the sensitivity of these groups in terms of immunity and disease severity this process contains epidemiologic and sensitivity factors such as travel history incubation period and estimated transmission potential following risk and exposure assessments these two assessments are finalized with a content evaluation content evaluation is the assessment of the setting the event has taken or is taking place content evaluation includes social technological scientific economic ethical and political factors exposure and content evaluations are made and risk is characterized risk characterization seeks to regulate the probability and impact of every risk risk characterization uses these evaluations in order to assess if a specific flu virus has the potential to become pandemic and to what extent the society will be affected by such event and thus to judge the urgency and scope of risk management activities risk assessment is a constant process during risk management continuity for the evaluation of pandemic severity to be beneficial it should be performed when public health decisions are required 13 to that end surplus information should be provided in order to answer all critical questions regarding the pandemic that has emerged questions on new cases and their progression and those regarding the type of diseases and complications encountered which group of patients would be severely ill and die ie age groups and groups at risk for severe outcomes whether or not the virus is susceptible to antiviral agents the number of people that would become ill and the impact of the cases on the use of healthcare services and workforce should be answered these questions will be of help in directing decisions on vaccination production and utilization strategy antiviral use mobilization of healthcare sources school closings and social distancing strategies  data responding to each critical question will be addressed in the context of three indicators each of these indicators will contain information obtained from various data types including virologic epidemiologic and clinical data data will be grouped so that they would be more accessible and comprehensible by the public and policy-makers national action plans have been charted according to six categories of principal components of emergency risk management for health these include policy and resource management planning and coordination information and information management health infrastructure and logistics healthcare and related services and community emergency situation risk management capacities 13 research projects their budget and the number of researchers to work on these projects should also be carefully constructed cooperation with the government for these plans is crucial 17  pandemics require globally compatible actions pandemics are extremely destructive events that can cause serious social economic and political stress preparation demands the approach of all communities in order to enable the world to respond quickly and effectively to decrease morbidity and mortality in the next pandemic not only the healthcare sector but also all other sectors individuals families and communities play a role in lightening the effects of a pandemic nonpharmaceutical interventions can be the only effective measure in many countries during the onset of a pandemic there would probably be no pandemic vaccination that would be effective against the novel virus non-pharmaceutical interventions in the early stage of the pandemic should be implemented in order to slow down transmission and decrease its effect these interventions include social distancing staying home when ill coughing etiquette covering the mouth with a handkerchief while coughing or sneezing and hygiene rules such as washing the hands and cleaning the surfaces and objects touched extreme measures can be taken and implemented during severe pandemics including patients wearing masks surgical masks school closings and diminishing contact between people nonpharmaceutical interventions will help decrease the number of people exposed to and afterwards infected by the virus 6  since pandemics necessitate an approach for the whole community individuals and communities should be cared about listened to and relieved of anxieties people should be informed on how to protect themselves and stop the spreading of the virus 18  at the present time airports harbors and ports road transportation and entry points to the country may have a critical role in the international transmission the diseases via persons goods and vehicles therefore countries should be ready to detect and respond to any healthcare event that would cause international concern by bringing healthcare-based restrictions in international travel and trade thus developing necessary public health capacities in entry points of the country will limit the spread of public health hazards 6 particularly frequent travelers may have a part in accelerating the international spread of the virus during the early period of the pandemic hence in the event of the onset of the pandemic being at a countryside where international travel is scarce the transmission of the agent to frequent travelers will be much late and the spread of the pandemic will be much slower 19  international health regulations 2005 try to limit public health measures preventing unnecessary intervention to international travel and trade in order to reach this goal who regularly makes recommendations on trade and travel measures regarding public health events along with not interfering with measures related to specific trade and travel international health regulations 2005 mandate countries to inform who on the justifications of the time of interventions and important measures taken by the administration of the countries this is defined as the cause of a more than 24-h delay in the movement of international passengers luggage cargos containers vehicles and items by the international health regulations 2005 apart from providing information to countries on these measures who may demand from the implementing country to reevaluate these applications 13  world health organization continues to make recommendations against travel and trade restrictions for countries fighting with the covid-19 pandemic travel measures interfering significantly with international traffic can only be justified at the onset of a pandemic since countries may be allowed to rapidly implement preliminary measures even for a few days these kinds of restrictions should be based on meticulous risk assessment be proportional to public health risk not last long and be reevaluated regularly as the event advances travel ban to affected regions or rejection of entry of passengers traveling from affected regions is not effective in preventing case imports but may have important economic and social impact temperature scan at entry and exit points is not an efficient way to stop international spread since infected people may be within the incubation period and not show early symptoms during the disease for an adequate risk assessment and a follow of a probable case the patients should be provided with disease-preventing messages health statements should be collected upon entry and contact information of the passengers should be obtained which would be much more efficient 18  it is necessary to delay or prevent travel to affected regions for elderly patients and for those with underlying chronic diseases personal hygiene coughing etiquette and putting an at least one-meter distance between yourself and those showing symptoms are important for all passengers frequent hand hygiene after contact with particularly respiratory fluids is mandatory hand hygiene includes washing the hand with soap and water or cleaning the hand with alcohol-based liquids the mouth and nose of the person coughing or sneezing should be closed with a handkerchief or using the inner part of the elbow touching the mouth and nose should be avoided 18  unless a person shows symptoms she does not need to wear a medical mask since there is no evidence on any kind of masks protecting the noninfected person from the virus besides masks can be commonly worn in some cultures it is important to follow the best practice on how to wear remove and dispose of the mask and ensure hand hygiene if medical masks are to be worn 18  passengers returning from the affected regions should monitor the symptoms for 14 days on their own and also follow the national protocols of the receiving countries some countries may demand the returning passengers to be put in quarantine should symptoms such as fever cough and difficulty in breathing manifest it is recommended to the passengers to contact local healthcare providers preferably over the phone and inform them of their symptoms and travel history 18  it is suggested to follow the recommendations of who for designated passengers in entry points the management of ill passengers in the context of present covid-19 disease pandemic in international airports harbors and motorwayroad gates should include measures to be implemented according to the priorities and capacities of each country in order to detect ill passengers and determine the symptoms of covid-19 disease and the possibility of virus exposure interviewing with ill passengers reporting cases with suspected covid-19 infection isolation of those with suspected covid-19 infection and initial case management and referral are necessary 20  airport operators aircraftairplane operators airline and airport crew and ground personnel should be informed on how to recognize covid-19 signs and symptoms crew and ground personnel should be informed on and frequently reminded of measures preventing the spread of covid-19 including social distancing hand hygiene respiratory etiquette environmental cleaning waste disposal when and how to wear masks and avoiding contact with people showing respiratory symptoms medical face mask should be reserved for individuals with respiratory symptoms to prevent contamination with others the personnel should be trained for hand hygiene and how to wear and remove protective equipment personnel in close contact with symptomatic individuals should wear medical mask eye protection face shield or goggles gloves and gown 21  a number of factors should be taken into account to prevent the spread of covid-19 for countries that have decided to bring back citizens from affected regions these include scanning right before flight risk communication with the passengers and crew infection control resources for the flightjourney preparation of the crew for a possible infected passenger entry scan upon arrival and close-monitoring for 14 days after arrival 18  countries should intensify surveillance for severe pneumonia and uncommon flu-like disease pandemics and attentively monitor the development of covid-19 pandemics by strengthening epidemiologic surveillance countries should continue raising awareness in the public opinion healthcare specialists and policy-makers through effective risk communication regarding covid-19 and should refrain from actions of stigmatization and discrimination countries should share all related information on covid-19 for its timely evaluation and management as necessitated by the international health regulations 2005 18  countries implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic need to share related scientific data for the implementation of these measures and public health justification with who within the first 48 h after the implementation who will share this information with other countries significant intervention generally means a more than 24-h delay in or rejection of international passengers luggage cargos containers vehicles goods and similar items 18 airline travel has the most important role in spreading pandemics in a study considering airline network in the prediction of the spread of pandemics rate and density of transmission have been detected with high accuracy 22 therefore making predictions in early periods of pandemics using these modellings can be effective in rapidly taking necessary measures 23  if a country decides to quarantine arriving passengers who do not show symptoms some factors should be taken into consideration there is no universal guideline regarding the infrastructure of the quarantine facility however an area that will not increase the potential contamination and those put in quarantine should be recorded to be followed in the event of potential disease accommodation and supplies sufficient food and water to passengers sleep arrangements and clothing protection of luggage and other items appropriate medical treatment necessary communication devices should be adequately provided for in a language they can understand medical mask is not required for those put in quarantine if masks are used the best practice should be followed quarantine period which lasts 14 days according to the currently known incubation period of the virus can be extended due to delayed exposure 24  social and economic life continues during pandemics a pandemic has the potential to affect all sectors in the event of declaration of disaster as regards the severity of the pandemic there is legislation oriented at covering fiscal charges however regulation should be made for pandemics that do not necessitate declaration of disaster in order to meet unexpectedunanticipated needs and additional financial needs should be met during a rapidly spreading pandemic vital setbacks can be seen in the transfer of goods and services the need for social support programs due to economic problems arising from the shutdown of businesses and interim unemployment 25  it is predicted that covid-19 pandemic will cost the world economy as much as an approximate 1 trillion dollars which is a much deeper and worse global crisis compared to that of 2007-2008 institutions like the un are run with the aid of developed countries in particular it is feared that a serious crisis will be felt in un resources as part of the effect of this pandemic and lead to weakness in the function of the un 26  pandemic diseases may result in acute short-term fiscal shocks and long-term damage in economic growth early period public health efforts such as monitoring contact implementing quarantine isolating contagious cases in order to cover or limit pandemics require significant human resources and personnel cost as a pandemic expands new facilities may be needed to be constructed to manage additional contagious cases and health system expenses will tremendously increase as a result of demand in medical supplies personal protective equipment and medicine decreasing tax revenue may deepen the fiscal stress caused by increasing expenses in low- and middle-income countries that have weak tax systems and severe fiscal restrictions this dynamic was seen in the western africa ebola pandemic in liberia in 2014 as costs increased economic activity slowed down and quarantines and curfews decreased the governments capacity to collect revenues during a mild-to-moderate pandemic high income countries that are not affected can balance fiscal crises in low income countries by providing official recovery support including direct budget support meanwhile high income countries may be faced with the same fiscal stresses and be unwilling to provide help during a severe pandemic low- and middle-income countries may cut back in government expenses negative economic crises are derived from workforce reduction due to disease and deaths and behavior change out of fear fear manifests itself with many behavioral changes the analysis of the economic effects of the 2014 western africa ebola pandemic has shown decrease in workforce shutdown in businesses delay in transportation closing of land borders by some governments restrictions implemented on citizens arriving from affected regions in entry to the country cancellation of commercial flights decrease in shipment and prevention in travel and trade these effects decrease the participation of the pandemic to workforce and constrict local and regional trade preventive behavior such as prevention of travel restaurant and public spaces and workplace discontinuity as prophylactics also has economic outcomes during a severe pandemic all sectors of the economy agriculture manufacture services encounter shortages rapid price elevation is basic necessities deterioration that causes economic stress for the household private firms and governments a severe pandemic may result in a significant and permanent economic damage 27  in order to take a pandemic under control coordination should be established flow of information should be regulated necessary health interventions case management algorithms vector control should be determined health systems hospitals healthcare personnel medicine should be strengthened the society should be informed and the community should be included in pandemic surveillance and control  what does putin promise russians russias authoritarian social policy sarah sokhey wilson  in his 20 years in power vladimir putin has employed a savvy use of social policy to bolster his popularity but it is a set of policies not well designed to address russias chronic underprovision of healthcare education and other social services-particularly in rural areas the covid-19 global pandemic will only exacerbate russias social policy challenges and could pose a threat to putins political survival his year is a challenging time for vladimir putin and the russian government  putinomics 2 much of the social policy decision-making has been elite-driven and characterized by competing bureaucratic proposals with limited public input 3 benefits have been assured for certain groups like pensioners at strategic times right before elections but there is a lack of long-term planning and accountability in delivering better services particularly in rural areas 4 while in principle this persistent underperformance of basic government promises in healthcare education and other areas could threaten putins popularity no serious political alternative exists for whom to vote or support perhaps this situation could change with the current global pandemic the covid-19 pandemic is seriously exacerbating long-standing deficiencies and challenges that the russian government faces the dual socioeconomic and fiscal challenges pose threats for the putin administration but there is little room for opposition to organize effectively and nor is there an alternate narrative that could lead to a political transition 5 the question then is when russian citizens might be frustrated enough with failures in public policy provision for a real political transition to happen it is a difficult question to answer a lot rests on russians expectations of what actually will be provided as unsatisfying as it is to admit we are not likely to know whether a social crisis will lead putin to lose political power until it happens in the meantime however social policy provision throughout the 2000s lends insight into russias current political situation and the countrys response to the covid-19 crisis putin became popular in large part for ushering in an era of greater stability and growth in the early 2000s when he first came to power putin was hailed as someone who might be able to address the problems of a weak state and rampant corruption from the 1990s as part of this challenge he reorganized the russian bureaucracy and introduced reforms to some areas of social policy social policies in the areas of pensions healthcare education family benefits and unemployment support have been central to putins strategy for staying in power vladimir putin taking the presidential oath may 7 2000 by 2018 when putin was elected to his fourth term as president he was still making the same promises to improve social services as he did when he first ran in 2000 after this election however things changed shortly after his election in 2018 the russian government announced and quickly pushed through an unpopular increase in the retirement age putin and the russian government were taking advantage of his recent re-election-and the distraction of the world cup in summer 2018-to implement a change that had long been hailed as necessary but which putin and united russia had long promised would not happen in early 2020 at his annual address to the nation putin announced proposed major constitutional changes 6 amidst these changes the russian press extensively reported on the social policy promises that were included putin proposed for instance including in the constitution provisions addressing the minimum pension and a minimum wage for workers the inclusion of these particular measures was very intentional the constitutional referendum was scheduled for april 22 but has been postponed-most likely until june at the earliest-due to concerns about the pandemic 7 over the course of the 2000s we can see the different ways that an authoritarian regime makes and uses social policies that critically affect the daily quality 6 andrew higgins russian premier abruptly quits amid swirl of speculation on putin new york times jan 15 of life for their citizens we can also envision how this system might be difficult to sustain amidst a pandemic crisis putin used social policy to build his base of popular support but the bar for functioning social policy was quite low he somehow managed to get regional governments to start fulfilling their obligations to pay pension benefits which are already and the books and which they have not been paying out this is no small accomplishment the bigger issue is that the general economy does much better so that the burden to have better functioning social support immediately is arguably a little less critical there were some remarkably liberal and market-oriented policy reforms including ones like pension privatization putin also managed to reform the tax system and improve tax collection this was an enormous and very necessary achievement in the early 2000s healthcare was another policy area where major changes were adopted although their implementation is spotty russia adopted a mandatory universal health insurance model somewhat akin to the german system yet the reformed system was not set up as intended in many regions of russia and even at present the russian healthcare system struggles to provide adequate care elites often prefer to be treated abroad domestic observers note 8 while some improvements were undertaken in areas like education too many problems remained most significantly when general economic conditions improve there is political stability employment and wages improved russians had access to credit and more consumer goods and russia in general seemed to be on the rise given the socioeconomic and political developments of the early 2000s it is not hard to see why putin was so popular many observers still emphasize the comparison of russia in the 2000s with the damned 90s to explain why putin is so popular 9 while this explanation is true it is not the whole story given that by many metrics conditions have been stagnating since the financial crisis of 2009 the last decade has seen a financial crisis and recovery period during this time we have begun to see dissatisfaction and the possibility that the russian public will not accept continued stagnation in areas like healthcare and education servicesespecially when general economic conditions are weak there are some protests opposition candidates and parties look poised to do better ultimately though putin and his government maintain power with skillful strategies from the authoritarian toolkit the quality of social policies did not fare well the improved conditions in the early 2000s levelled off and we see significant stagnation in social spending and a lack of real improvement in the quality of education and healthcare it was during this period that the russian government reversed pension privatization russias spending on healthcare and education as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp was already well below the european average and has not increased in the 2000s figure 1 above shows all education and healthcare spending data available from the world bank at the time of writing throughout the 2000s spending on healthcare as a percentage of gdp has hovered around five percent and spending on education has remained between three and four percent healthcare conditions have not improved in recent years 10 although the official statistics are not good even those probably gloss over major deficiencies a recent report found that a third of medical facilities in russia lack running water 52 percent do not have hot water and a shocking 40 percent are without central heating nearly half lack access for citizens who are disabled 11 in the run-up to putins 2018 presidential election vedomosti published a critical account of what putin and united russia had promised and their failure to deliver on many of those promises they had promised a specific number of schools 10 jake cordell and evan gershkovich we dont have enough intensive care beds coronavirus will test russias creaking healthcare system moscow times march 19 2020 11 1 in 3 russian hospitals lack water supply-audit chamber moscow times feb 7 2020 and more slots in kindergartens but chronic shortages persisted 12 since putins reelection in march 2018 the government implemented a widely unpopular measure to raise the retirement age which current prime minister mikhail mishustin has promised to keep in place through all of this putins approval rating remains above 60 percent with a high of nearly a 90 percent 13 russia in the modern period is an excellent example of how and why authoritarian regimes do care about public opinion and also why the nature of their political institutions do not produce better outcomes in the first three months of 2020 the entire russian government including the long-standing prime minister dmitry medvedev resigned this turmoil was followed by the proposal of major constitutional amendments including proposals to allow putin to run for a fifth term as president in 2024 remarkably these constitutional amendments include several specific promises regarding social policy benefits much of the speculation about putins proposed constitutional amendments has focused on the institutional changes which alter the role of the presidency parliament and security council most observers including policy analysts and academics have focused on what this means for putins future after 2024 when his current presidential term would officially end konstantin sonin university of chicago professor however noted that speculating about what the constitutional amendment means for putin and his strategy to stay in power is premature while the current maneuvering could be the sign of putins strategy sonin and others have observed rightly that the current proposals for constitutional amendments leave a variety of options for what putin could do moreover the importance of the other big issue mentioned in the proposed constitutional amendments-social policy spending with a specific focus on pension policy-has received much less attention nonetheless a few savvy observers have written that the social policy and welfare aspects of the proposed amendments may prove to be the most important in a recent edition of the russian analytical digest several contributors noted the importance of social policy promises and rising dissatisfaction among russian citizens 14 regina smyth a professor at indiana university sums up the situation well in the longer term these changes in the definition of state-society relations are potentially more significant than the formal amendments or the reinforcement of existing informal practices to maintain oligarchy they are also risky the regimes advertisement for improved quality of life will raise social expectations about state performance and the quality of services in the context of a geriatric system that has been in power for 20 years if the government fails to meet expectations the short-term project to insulate the ruler and his cronies is vulnerable to political unrest and medium-term state development will be complicated 15 other commentators agree indicating that the mishustin government will be expected to fulfill the social policy promises that putin made in january 2020 16 still others write however that the replacement of other positions-like the minister of health-appear to be merely window dressing lacking in any real substantive change 17 in any case short-term goals related to improving the economy and the quality of life will determine whether other big institutional changes can happen 18 in a late 2019 poll conducted by the levada survey organization 51 percent of respondents indicated that they want to live a better life up for a response rate of 42 percent in 2007 19 social policy and its relation to basic living standards are at the heart of current russian politics and the kremlin is taking notice the constitutional amendments proposed in early 2020 included several specific mentions of social policy among them a remarkable promise to increase pensions and other social benefits annually 20 if mishustin and his new government fail to improve conditions in keeping with these new constitutional promises then many of our current questions about what happens in 2024 may be moot and at this point who knows how long mishustin will stay as prime minister when yeltsin was in the last year of his second term he quickly cycled through prime ministers in rapid succession when financial crises and problems in chechnya arose putin still has four years to try out different prime ministers who could play a variety of roles in a post-2024 system with a new constitution the russian media has further emphasized these social policy promises some with a more positive tone and others with a surprising amount of cynicism one headline ridiculed the current promises saying pensioners are waiting for gifts from mishustin-2 pirozhkis donuts with jam alongside a photo of dejected looking pensioners mishustin has denied emphatically that the government will go back on its 2018 decision to raise the retirement age nonetheless there appears to be a strong expectation that the government should and will provide pension benefits and make some efforts to improve healthcare it is worth noting that the russian public is largely though not entirely aware of the proposed constitutional amendments but it has expressed skepticism about what the new government can actually accomplish herein lies the current russian governments challenge the government must address current concerns set realistic expectations and at least somewhat follow through but russian governments in the 1990s and the later 2000s especially from 2009 and beyond have something important in common 10 years of stagnating economic conditions make these promises both vital for political support and potentially less credible citizens in authoritarian regimes lack regular competitive elections in which to voice their discontent this infrequency makes it difficult to predict where their breaking point is in russia today expectations are low for government performance especially in the area of social policy there are no good alternatives to putin and united russia at present the new government appointed in early 2020 may fail to get much done and that may be acceptable to the russian public if anything improves in the arena of social policy and welfare then it may be enough to keep a majority russians happy in other words the promise of better things and just minimal follow through could be enough there is significant speculation about what putins role in the government will be after 2024 in one scenario he may find a way to stay in power but in a different role if this scenario happens we might be less optimistic about seeing an improvement in russias social policy the best hope for improving social policy would be to have competing groups of elites pitted against each other in a race to provide better more credible promises and policies at the moment this scenario seems unlikely pension policy is a prime example of how social policy in russia is the domain of elites with limited public input when the financial crisis hit in 2009 the russian government quickly spent down the stabilization fund created from revenue from state-owned oil companies the government needed funds quickly this demand became even more intense after the russian government invaded crimea and eastern ukraine in 2013 as such one means of gaining short-term funds was to suspend or freeze contributions to individual pension accounts and instead return this money into general government coffers this is precisely the move that the russian government made after first freezing contributions in principle temporarily in 2012 the russian government has yet to reopen contributions to the privatized accumulative portion of pensions the 2001 reform has been killed effectively furthermore the government made this move with virtually no public input putin reversed his pension policy again when he chose to support the very unpopular measure of increasing the retirement age in spring 2018 shortly after what is likely putins final election as president then-prime minister dmitry medvedev announced an increase in the russian retirement age 22 by the summer putin announced that he did not like raising the retirement age but it was necessary 23 increasing the retirement age has long been considered by economists and policy analysts to be an economic and fiscal necessity in russia where the retirement age was relatively low 55 for women and 60 for men in addition the state struggled to support an aging and shrinking population with the next duma elections not until 2021 and presidential elections not until 2024 putin and united russia have plenty of time to recover from a public backlash furthermore the announcement was made shortly before the world cup which was being hosted in russia that summer to allow for maximum distraction 24 despite some protests and objections the legislation to increase the retirement age went through quickly in fall 2018 25 as in other areas of social policy the russian government cared about a public backlash but not about true public input pension politics provides an important lesson about russias authoritarian politics the government cares about buying off enough of the population at the right times with short-term promises of benefits like one-time payments right before elections yet it is less concerned about long-term planning additionally russian political institutions currently do not create good incentives for long-term accountability for elected officials or political parties to produce better outcomes as robert orttung a professor at george washington university notes institutions matter in putins russia in that they regularly change but russian institutions put few effective constraints on a top leader willing to shape the institutions to serve his personal interest rather than those of the country 26 russia like most other countries around the world is facing the unprecedented challenge of addressing the covid-19 global pandemic russias response to the pandemic can be understood in terms of its larger social policy and public policy strategies the russian response to the covid-19 pandemic is also consistent with putins authoritarian strategies for staying in power marlene laruelle george washington university professor and madeline mccann program coordinator for ponars eurasia and george washington university argue that russias response is emblematic of a post-soviet response to the pandemic in which political leaders understate the extent of the crisis and the potentially catastrophic consequences for public health 27 schools and universities in russian cities were closed down in march with a transition to online and remote learning seen in many countries around the world russia closed its borders to most foreign nationals until at the earliest may 1 2020 in late march 2020 putin announced a week-long holiday and a subsequent three weeks of quarantine measures muscovites in particular faced strict restrictions including a mandatory propusk pass system in which residents have been required to register for passes in order to leave their home on may 22 mayor sobianin announced that many of these measures would continue including the propusk system 28 putin initially maintained that russia has the situation under control but other events suggested that the government was woefully underprepared in march of 2020 a spike in severe pneumonia cases in moscow prompted concerns that the official covid-19 infection numbers were vastly understated 29 the understating of numbers is an issue in many countries and it is almost certainly the case in russia where only limited testing is taking place moscow mayor sergey sobyanin has indicated that the coronavirus is a major crisis and that the stay at home order will remain in place indefinitely the russian government has already started building a new hospital in the moscow region but many regions of russia are doing little to reduce the spread of coronavirus and are already incapable of providing healthcare for existing needs consistent with this anecdotal evidence suggests that mid-size russian cities like ulyanovsk may end up being hot spots for the virus 30 this does not bode well for containing the virus spread furthermore many russians are skeptical about what the government can do in a poll conducted in late march 2020 48 percent of russians responded definitely not or for the most part no in response to a question asking whether the healthcare system in russia would be ready if a coronavirus epidemic started nearly a quarter of russians answered that they did not trust the official information on the coronavirus situation in russia being reported by the media 31 on april 10 2020 moscow mayor sobyanin announced that there was no choice but to institute a propusk or pass system moscow residents will need to print or download to their phones passes for all excursions outside of their homes with the exception of visiting the closest grocery store to their home 32 in short russia faces a very serious crisis with the spread of coronavirus putin has acknowledged that the situation is getting worse and mayor sobyanin has announced that russia is nowhere near its peak of infections and deaths 33 the russian government has grossly underfunded the countrys healthcare infrastructure resulting in a healthcare system that is underprepared to deal with this kind of pandemic crisis even countries with advanced well-functioning healthcare systems are struggling to deal with the rapid spread of the virus social policy is important on its own as one of the central functions of modern governments and among most governments largest areas of spending a bellwether of other political changes and an important part of the authoritarian toolkit social policy is also the most directly relevant aspect of russian politics for many average citizens we would do well to pay attention to the domestic promises made and received by the russian government it tells us a lot about how the country is working and where it is going amidst the covid-19 pandemic social policy is moved to the very forefront of politics this article has highlighted three periods of social policy under putin first the early 2000s when rising oil prices helped promote rapid economic growth and putin introduced a stability that was unknown in the 1990s second the financial crisis of 2009 and the subsequent stagnation that russia has still not managed to overcome and third what looks like-at least at present-the consolidation of authoritarianism and the possible creation of a new social contract or at least promises to actually provide for the existing social contract the recently proposed constitutional amendments highlight the central importance of social policy support and pension policy to the russian public a great deal depends on what the russian public is really expecting the government to do and whether the government does it the former-what the public really wants and expects-is the crucial question that no one can currently answer what is critical moving forward is to conduct more extensive survey work making more clear the distinction between what russian citizens want in principle and what russian citizens actually expect the state to provide one of the most persistent communist-era beliefs-among all generationsis that the state should provide a range of welfare benefits including state-provided and state-guaranteed pensions 34 the beliefs are pervasive strong and related to the communist-era systems which were not overly generous but were universal and allowed for a guaranteed basic level of services but what do citizens of post-communist states think the state will actually provide this is the key outstanding question russians display a remarkable amount of cynicism about their own social services and for very good reasons if the government can exceed very low expectations then this may be enough to allow for regime stability but russians have faced more than a decade of stagnation raising the very real question of how much longer the leadership can get away with failing to improve living conditions for millions of russians ultimately whether president putin prime minister mishustin and united russia can convince russians that they are improving or can improve their lives will determine the future of russia  analysing recovery from pandemics by learning theory the case of covid-19 romney b duffey1 and enrico zio2 1idaho falls idaho usa 2centre de recherche sur les risques et les crises crc mines paristechpsl universite paris sophia antipolis france   we present a method for predicting the recovery time from infectious diseases outbreaks such as the recent covid-19 virus the approach is based on the theory of learning from errors specifically adapted to the control of the virus spread by reducing infection rates using countermeasures such as medical treatment isolation social distancing etc when these are effective the infection rate after reaching a peak declines following a given recovery rate curve we use presently available data from china south korea and others to make actual predictions of the time needed for securing minimum infection rates in the future all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity  we develop a new way to predict the recovery rate of infections following a pandemic outbreak using the basic postulates of learning theory this theory has been previously applied to outcome accident and event data from multiple socio-technological systems like transportation medicine military power grids aviation mining and manufacturing learning theory simply postulates that humans learn from experience in correcting their mistakes and errors sometimes even just by trial and error as they gain knowledge on the problem and skill for addressing it the theory is consistent with the models and data in cognitive psychology of how humans behave and the brain operates ohlsson 1996 fiondella and duffey 2015 anderson 1990 duffey 2017b  the importance of this theory stands in that human errors and incorrect decisions are the dominant contributors to accidents crashes system failures errors and operational incidents the theory is based on the fact that human learning demonstrably reduces error rates ohlsson 1996  wisdom is gained after an accident evidence on this relates to even highly hazardous industries like the nuclear one a good example is that the safe operation of nuclear power plants has been and continuous to be improved from lessons learned from nuclear accidents and incidents these accidents and incidents in addition to highlighting the role of human errors in their occurrence and progression have helped identifying various critical technical elements and contributed to the safer operation of nuclear power plants similarly the observation is applicable to outbreaks of infectious diseases improving health systems following epidemic outbreaks and enhancing reliability and safety measures following nuclear power plant accidents have to be handled with objective data and accurate calculations however whereas nuclear power plant operation has done this by a world-accepted high standard of procedures the protection system against pandemics is not there yet the key is how to design evaluate and implement the procedures for reaching a high standard learning theory has been successfully applied to quantify error and learning rates in technical systems casualties in large land battles everyday accident and event data and to human software and hardware reliability duffey and saull 2008 duffey  ha 2010 fiondella  duffey 2015 duffey 2017a  the novel feature is to replace calendar time or test interval which has always been used before with a measure for the accumulated experience andor risk exposure thus defining rate trends and quantifying effectiveness of responses to errors and accidents and allowing totally different systems to be directly intercompared additionally the trend is governed by two parameters that are physically based the learning rate constant and the minimum achievable error rate this is in contrast with statistical analysis where fitting to learning data is typically done on three empirical parameters bush and mosteller 1955   and with the inverse power laws extensively fitted in cognitive psychology data  eg anderson 1990 and the references therein the theory shows the learning hypothesis that humans learn from their mistakes and reduce outcomes in such a way that the rate of decrease of the outcome in the present case of interest the infection rate r with the rate of accumulated experience  in the present case the advancement in the knowledge of the virus the contagion spreading dynamics the effects of the countermeasures is proportional to the rate r itself thus very simply the differential equation that describes the accident and outcome data with learning or forgetting describes the proportionality between the rate of change of the learning rate r and the learning rate itself duffey and saull 2008 duffey 2017b  where  is the measure of the risk exposure learning opportunity or experienceknowledge gained k is the learning rate positive for a learningimproving situation and negative for no learningimproving eg because of no effectiveness countermeasures and rm is the lowest or minimum achievable error rate which is never zero as the process of error-making and cognitive rule revision always continues physically k is related to the non-detection or error rate in unconscious memory scanning for recall and recognition manifesting itself in the conscious external actions decisions and judgments the error rate solution obtained from integration of this minimum error rate equation mere is where 0 is the initial rate at the beginning or start of the problem when the level of experienceknowledge on it is  0 different data sets are characterized by different values of the learning constant it is clear in equation 2 that for practical applications a suitable measure of the experienceknowledge or risk exposure accumulated with respect to the initial one -0 is needed and that the original or starting one 0 is a suitable arbitrary or convenient reference dependent on the problem at hand in other words the measure for the accumulated experienceknowledge or risk exposure is technologysystem specific then for data inter-comparisons it is useful to render non-dimensional the quantities of interest which results in the universal learning curve ulc for the non-dimensional error rate e r-rmr0-rm as a function of the non-dimensional experienceknowledge or risk exposure    t where t is the maximum accumulated experience or risk exposure thanks to which the error is recovered the problem is considered under control its rate having reached the lowest or minimum achievable value rm from 2   with k 3 is the fitted learning rate universal constant this expression has already been shown to represent the learning trends for outcome rate data from industrial surgical transportation mining manufacturing chemical maintenance software and a multitude of other systems duffey and saull 2008 ha 2013 fiondella and duffey 2015  for skill acquisition tasks in cognitive psychological testing this same trend exists and is called the universal law of practice ulp illnesses are still around in the world many of them deadly in the past there have been pandemics1 killing many millions of people like the black death or bubonic plague disease of the middle ages and the influenza epidemic in 1918 in addition to these sudden attacks other equally deadly pestilences have been and are still around for centuriesyellow fever cholera small pox typhus measles malaria as modern medical practice eliminated or reduced these hazards using better procedures and new vaccines other exotic variants and viruses have recently emerged like sars hiv ebola and covid19 infecting and endangering the ever-increasing and interconnected world population as we evolve and learn so do the things that like to kill us but they usually kill relatively few people compared to say automobile accidents or the yearly seasonal influenza to determine risk from these instances we can and must turn to data as a fine example we have the official data from the world health organization the who gave the death rates for all causes and for infectious like cholera and parasitic like malaria diseases for some 194 countries in the mid 1990s the data cover the full global spectrum from developed to developing nations from vast urban conglomerates with very crowded living conditions to scattered rural communities from jungles to deserts and all continents the data cover and include the effects of modern epidemics and of course local wars and regional conflicts in figure 1  the data are plotted not against the usual arbitrary calendar year but-as we now know we should -against the risk exposure measure in this case the population size this number is the direct indicator of how many people are at risk and the country-bycountry populations come from the world bank indicators the data are plotted in the figure with the lozenges being the overall death rate data and the squares representing the death rate data due to infections from these data we can know the risk of death from any health cause it is about 1000 deaths for every 100000 people or one in a hundred and does not depend much on where you live to verify this overall number locally we can analyze the data for new york as given in the graph the conquest of pestilence in new york city from 1800 onwards published by the board of health and the health department this is a typical modern city that had grown in population from 120000 to about 8 million people and includes characteristics of immigration high-density living mass transportation high-rise apartments modern health care national and international trade and a large flow of inbound-outbound travel in other words globalization the biggest improvement in health has come from introducing effective hygiene and anti-infection measures and from improved health prevention and treatment not from wonder drugs we have learned how to treat sick people cure problems and reduce the spread of bad diseases it is an expensive investment and it is hard work that requires devoted and trained professionals as a result after curing and containing many pestilences during the 19th century the average death rate in new york over the last hundred years has fallen to 10 to 11 per 1000 people or almost exactly the same one-in-a-hundred rate as the world rate so modern cities behave pretty much like whole countries as far as average or overall death rates are concerned infectious and parasitic diseases are responsible for 5 to 15 deaths in 100000 people so average about one in ten thousand or 1 to 5 of all deaths worldwide the other 95 to 99 or so being deaths from normal causes so the normal death risk is still about twenty to a hundred times of what it might be if a new pestilence emerges spreads and takes hold without effective countermeasures another way to view this risk contribution is to say that the chance of death might be increased by a maximum of about 5 if a new global pandemic infection occurs where it has not been prevalent before this is always the fear that in todays highly interconnected high-speed global world a possible rapid spread of new or variant diseases can occur all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer-reviewed is the  and that is exactly what recently happened as the 2019-2020 coronavirus labeled covid-19 or sars-cov2 rapidly spread across the four corners of the globe there was extensive reporting of nearly every new case occurring and great worldwide information available eg at johns hopkins university website coronavirusjhuedumap by late march 2020 the world had over 1000000 cases and still growing at the time of writing and many thousands of deaths with the infection having spread quickly across borders imported from nation-to-nation mainly via travellers visitors and tourists and spread internally from just social and day-to-day human contact looking at the available numbers the individual infection risk today is comparatively negligible with a few hundred thousand cases in a world population of several billion it is an individual random infection probability pi of about one in twenty thousand this risk is many times less than the chance of being hospitalized with influenza let alone catching it reflecting the existing fraction of world deaths due to infections but the high speed at which this virus has spread makes it legitimate to feel worried and unease and correspondingly legitimate questions arise how does this novel pandemic compare to the normal or accepted risk of infectious death what is the worst case scenario should we panic and shun other people who may be carrying what might kill us how long will it take to recover this calls for the need to try to objectively evaluate the risk based on the current experience knowledge we normally can treat the spread of disease as a diffusion or multiple contact process where it steadily expands outward from some central source or origin or as a highly mobile source that is potentially spread everywhere due to rapid multiple global personal and social interactions the excellent us centers for disease control simply states the obvious risk depends on characteristics of the virus including how well it spreads between people source wwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovsummary the data from china on covid-19 infections suggest that there is or was a 50-90 chance of the initial infections spreading between cities depending on location and size du et al  2020  using simple doubling rates the news media carried projections that a worst case in the usa could infect over 200 million ie most people in the usa and cause nearly 2 million or so deaths and experts were hard at work estimating global country and age-dependent risks including of death we certainly need to estimate or know the risk of infection as a simple guess and knowing nothing else let us assume infections are randomly transmitted anywhere and everywhere from person to person the spread is instantaneous and guaranteed if a source exists and the probability of being successfully infected is also random and equally possible this is really a worst case scenario or model as obviously not everyone is exposed to everyone and not everyone is equally vulnerable the worst case scenario is then that there is no preventative measures no immunity and no vaccine and for whatever reason the source is not quarantined or isolated and any such infected person or mobile source can and does transmit the virus or disease randomly to others somewhere in the world independent of the transmission mechanism given contact the probability of crossinfection then depends solely on the total numbers of the possibly equally risk-or infection-exposed recipient population and the probability of infection is also random in this model anyone can get it by interacting with someone that has it2 to help see this more clearly the black balls the unknowns emerging from the jar of life is one way to view what might happen based on what we have already seen or been exposed to here the one black ball n1 is an known unknown infected person or infection opportunity among those ten m10 non-infected known knowns white balls m10 so a chance of 10 or one over ten the probability of interest is then of infection for more people exposed and infected or n unknown unknowns and some not exposed or not successfully infected m unknown knowns  out of a total of all exposed people nm these numbers n and m vary by city country cruise ship passengers soccer matches or rock concert arena and can systematically vary up to the total of about six billions or so in the global world we can also think of it as our possible exposure experience the formula for the probability p of the event of an individual i becoming infected takes the form pi  number infected n  total number exposed nm if there is a gathering limit of ten or so people as in the case of the white and black balls of the jar of life shown in the picture the observed chance of being infected pi is assumed to be about one infection black ball in some ten non-infections white balls or 10 this we know but the sample is limited to 10 and so we could also be exposed to one in a hundred or one in a thousand or more how many more infection cases would we then expect out there hidden in the jar the method used to estimate this probability is random sampling based on the so-called hypergeometric formula3 for possible gathering numbers of 10100 300 and 1000 with one infection source known or observed the chance of observing or finding say 100000 new cases of infection pi in a bigger group rises to a maximum or peak of about 37  about one in three4 the estimate that comes out in this worst case scenario seemingly agrees with the estimates publicly available on the internet and social media of the awful possibility risk of perhaps even a 40-70 chance of being at risk of infection if nothing is done to prevent it or reduce it5 that is a significant and very high risk of infection and has been used to justify quarantining limiting social gatherings and extensive travel restrictions this inevitably brings fear to the individuals of the global population and the only way to address fear is by using scientific knowledge and data to inform any theory behind estimates and predictions during the early onset of the covid-19 pandemic many gloomy scenarios were made and analyzed but they generally assumed no effective countermeasures to the spread of infections the infection numbers grew quickly at first before countermeasures such as isolation distancing restrictions and curfews were implemented to reduce infection rates and flatten the curve of numbers versus time sad to say deaths distressing as they are are also not the right measure-infections are the measure for the spread and control of infectious diseases a logical question is whether the infection or death data show any signs that we are learning how to reduce risk just like for any accident-the number killed or dying is highly variable depending on who and how many risk-exposed happens to be there so it is random in this viral case the number of deaths also just depends on too many uncontrolled variables and factors age pre-existing health conditions health care system propensity etc  so the average death percentage per infection also varies in magnitude location and time as the data clearly show the correct measure is infection numbers and rates not the number of deaths say the number per day the infections numbers also depend on which countryregion they refer to and at what infectious stage early onset spread extent countermeasures employed  etc we already know that if uncontrolled the increase in infections will rise exponentially as the rate of infections is proportional to the number infected as usual the most representative case can be based on actual infection data from where containment of contagion has already been successfully applied namely in china where it originated using data reported by the john hopkins center for system science and engineering by march 2020 there were n 81000 infections and some 3200 deaths in china with a falling to near-zero rate so with a national population of nm 1400000000 the overall probable risk of infection is about 000006 or one in 17000 or about six in 1000006 locally in some citiesregions it is ten times higher but although comparable to infectious death rates the overall covid-19 death rate in china was on average one in nearly half a million people much lower than deaths from other infectious diseases that is a significant reduction in the risk of infection countermeasures have worked so far we have these scenarios the scary or worst with no measures at least one in three people infected the real or best control and mitigation only one in 17000 people infected the probable future is the past modified by the likelihood so the possible probability reduction  or likelihood must be considered in a future estimate based on projections using past data this simple-minded upper and lower limit comparison suggests the individual likelihood is about 00002 or very low societal countermeasures reduced the risk by a factor of 500 to 5000 over the inevitable worst case random spread of infection or survival-of-only-the-fittest scenarios the approach based on learning theory illustrated in this section uses the fact that humans learn how to control the covid-19 outbreak spread and reduce infection rates using countermeasures treatments isolation social distancing etc if these are effective the rate therefore must reach a peak and then decline to look at pandemic recovery we really need to look at the rate of infections not just deaths since these depend on too many social and personal health factors as already stated these include propensity age profile medical system effectiveness treatment options early detection etc the risk of an infectious disease is not controlled unless the infection rate slows down so-called flattening the curve once the rate peaks the rate then should decrease due to successful countermeasures whatever they are so the next question is what happens next and how do we know how effective the control measures are and how long before they can be relaxed or maintained in china the actual infection rates increase per day rose to a peak of nearly 4000 a day in about 17 to 20 days and then fell away steadily to about 50 or so a day by another 30 days as a further consideration for a different country s korea had a different peak rate of about 1000 per day in ten days falling to a low rate in another 10 or so days in italy after some delay in implementing countermeasures the infection rate seemingly peaked at about 6000 per day in about 30 or so days as can be seen in the graph of figure  3  as of writing early april this rate has decreased to nearly 4000 per day see graph in the figure  the results for all countries that show some form of recovery

pulmonary disease death rate per day for 1870 -1970 source human nature tmckeown april 1978 as given in horwitz and ferleger statistics for social change we can simply think of this overall world data over the years and its reduction trend as resulting from many pandemics and multiple outbreaks of influenzas and differing virus strains that have been more and more successfully treated as we have learned to better controlreduce infections and improved effect recovery thus steadily reducing the rate despite the huge differences in timescales the recovery rate curve is simply the exponential universal learning curve of equation 3 the covid -19 pandemic and pulmonary disease recovery rate data all fit with the universal learning curve trend which is known to fit millions of events with learning the infection rate e normalized to the initial peak value as a function of the time elapsed the key point is that all the data follow almost exactly the same decreasing trajectory and furthermore the learning curve is nearly the same k3 as previously found for any learning experience on outcomes accidents events of any other modern technological system operated by humans indeed the results surprisingly follow the curve developed some ten years after it was first discovered while working on completely different data we can claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction also in this case of the pandemic and call it the universal recovery curve to further confirm the urc general theoretical correlation we next compare to the latest projections for medical resource loads made by complex computer modeling of infections and deaths in the usa  ihme 2020  as a reasonable surrogate measure the number of required hospital beds

other countriessystemspeople have to do to predict the infection rate evolution is to follow the same trend after first reaching their rate peak this type of analysis allows countries and systems to compare the effectiveness of their countermeasures implemented to control the pandemics and the related timescales a word of caution is necessary however these numbers cannot be exact and are not meant to be exact these are just calculated risk estimates which are subject to uncertainty related to all the many endogenous factors related to the virus spreading and the actuation and respect of the measures implemented the numbers provide guidance to thinking about the absolute risk and the best approach to take given the risk is constant unless we do nothing to reduce it the strong message here is that the rational and logical approach to dealing with the risk of the occurring pandemic as with any other risk for that matter is to limit own personal and potential exposure and to minimize both the size and scale of the potentially exposed population this is precisely what governments and contagious disease experts have been saying all along-but is also what any individual should be doing anyway while exposed to the risks of normal life a sort of ethics of resilience b rajaonah and e zio 2020 in the above graph of figure 4  the infection reductionrecovery rate for italy was

infection rate to get down to a minimum achievable level of say 50 per day as for china infection rates should be below 10 of the peak ie about 600 per day in about 3 weeks from the peak but this prediction can be effectively monitored and should be updated as more data arises in fact at present only very few days have elapsed since the seemingly reached peak rate so it is useful to look at a future trajectory this can be done as in figure 6  by plotting the data simply changing the denominator of the non-dimensional elapsed time after the peak rate n from the 30 days 27 march to 27 april assumed in analogy to china to say 20 days 27 march to 6 april or 40 days 27 march to 6 may for estimated reduction to the non-zero minimum ie 50-100 per day this sensitivity analysis allows to verify based on objective data whether or not any change or improvement in countermeasures is warranted and by how much the calculations can assume the infection rate peaked either on about 24 march or march 29 the latter being shown as giving the fewest data points see figure 6 above in this paper we have originally proposed to adapt learning theory for describing the reduction of pandemic infections like that of covid-19 a key point is to look at infection rate as a measure of error outcome and time as a measure of experienceknowledge or risk exposure which allows learning the analyses of the currently available data show that the covid-19 infection rate data follow after peaking almost exactly the universal learning curve describing the decreasing trajectory of many other instances where humans learn to apply effective countermeasures more specifically the learning curve is nearly the same with universal constant k3 as for any learning experience reducing outcomes accidents and events for other modern technological system operated by humans we claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction also in this case of the pandemic and call it the universal recovery curve it can be used to predict the expected time at which the pandemic will be under control in terms of minimum achievable infection rate and to test and demonstrate the

m   alessandro vespignani although there are inherent limitations to predictions in complex socio-technical systems in recent years mathematical and computational models have successfully forecasted the size of epidemics and have been used to communicate the risks of uncurbed infectious disease outbreaks mathematical and computational models are ideal as forecasting tools and can also provide situational awareness when we lack good data or define counterfactual scenarios that help disentangle the impact of pharmaceutical interventions and public health policies peculiar to the field of computational epidemiology is the distinction between two different kinds of work peace time research when there are no health emergencies or threats and what we call war time when there are emergencies like the covid-19 epidemic during war time we have to work with limited data a constantly changing landscape and a lot of assumptions the work must often be tactical and what has been produced the day before often must be completely revised the day after because a new piece of information has arrived at the same time the challenges faced during infectious disease threats set the questions and problems for the rigorous and foundational research that allows the field to advance after the emergency is gone huaiyu tian and christopher dye as the covid-19 epidemic spread across china from wuhan city in early 2020 it was vital to find out how to slow or stop it we could not investigate the effectiveness of control measures in a controlled experiment or a clinical trial and instead had to rely on statistical and mathematical modelling however precise evaluation of particular interventions requires substantial data or assumptions not only accurate characterization of the epidemic process itself but also government actions and even human behaviours such as the three billion trips taken over the chinese new year holiday we therefore constructed models in conjunction with a growing geocoded database on coronavirus epidemiology human movement and public health interventions we took two approaches to the analysis the first exploited natural variation in the distribution of covid-19 cases and in the type and timing of interventions on the basis of statistical tests of association carried out with general linear models we found that the unprecedented wuhan city travel ban affecting 11 million people slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by 3 days1 delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in china we found too that chinese cities that pre-emptively implemented control measures  such as suspending intra-city public transport closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings  reported in the first week of their outbreaks one-third fewer cases than cities that started control later our second approach to analysis built these findings into a dynamic mathematical model from which we calculated that chinas national emergency response prevented hundreds of thousands of cases that we otherwise expected to see during the first 50 days of the epidemic james o lloyd-smith as with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers before it the epidemiology of covid-19 has been punctuated by conspicuous superspreading events in which an infected person transmits the virus to many more people than average the average transmissibility of a pathogen is quantified by its basic reproduction number r0 which is a bedrock concept in infectious disease dynamics yet biological social and environmental factors  aided by a good dose of happenstance  give rise to significant individual variation around this average this holds true for all pathogens to varying degrees but evidence suggests that the emerging coronaviruses causing sars mers and covid-19 are systematically prone to superspreading23 why do we care mathematically for a given r0 a pathogen with more superspreaders must also have more infected individuals who do not contribute to onward spread such individual variation makes transmission chains more likely to die out and outbreaks rarer but more explosive than if every case was an average transmitter2 this variation matters most when case numbers are small early in the pandemic or after successful outbreak suppression if the population remains susceptible as countries try to prevent establishment of community transmission health officials must guard against complacency recognizing that many importations will fade out by chance but a minority will ignite outbreaks that expand with shocking speed physicists can help by working to learn the causes of superspreading events many involve alternative modes of spread such as airborne transmission but inferring such mechanisms from imperfect data in complex environments raises many technical challenges there are also unsolved mathematical and statistical problems in untangling the influences of individual biological variation and dynamic social contact networks that govern transmission opportunities by understanding these causes we can better target interventions to decelerate the spread of covid-19 rosalind m eggo sars-cov-2 is a new pathogen with some key characteristics that many mathematical modellers were concerned could emerge together quite high mortality and efficient transmission between people as the virus has made its way around the world transmission models are proving invaluable to the response effort some models aim to provide answers that public health decision-makers need in real time how effective possible interventions are likely to be our group recently modelled a classical intervention against infectious diseases contact tracing and isolation4 in which the contacts of known cases are found and if they show symptoms are isolated quickly doing so therefore decreases the average number of new infections that each infected person creates a quantity modellers call the reproduction number by developing a model for this system we were able to determine what fraction of a cases contacts must be found and isolated to control a new outbreak based on the best-possible information on transmission and disease available at that time however for some parameters such as for how much transmission occurs before the onset of symptoms there was little information for these parameters we provided scenarios of a range of values so that decision-makers could see the effect under different regimes and so that if that information became available in the future the model would still be informative munik shrestha and samuel v scarpino while firefighters in australia were bringing the devastating 20192020 bushfires under control a novel coronavirus was spreading rapidly through china transitioning from a local outbreak into a global pandemic remarkably the mathematical models scientists use to study the spreading of both fires and pathogens share many features an important similarity is that in both cases models and data show that the economic and health costs do not increase linearly with the number of people infected or hectares burned instead they explode going from imperceptibly small to unimaginably large in what seems an instant herein lies the central challenge of studying such systems both involve random multiplicative processes characterized by exponential growth and discontinuous phase transitions where the equilibrium number of cases can go from nearly zero to infinitely many in actually an instant accordingly their mathematical properties depend on rare exponentially costly and hard-to-study events however there is at least one crucial difference between fires and epidemics how readily the two systems can be monitored and measured whereas the effects of fires can often be seen with the naked eye public health records contain information on only the largest outbreaks as a result although ecologists can study the past effects of numerous fires both large and small epidemiologists rely primarily on data from rare population-spanning events why does this matter at the phase transition between local outbreak and global pandemic the proportion infected can be scale free meaning measuring only the large outbreaks leads to immeasurably large bias mathematical epidemiologists have developed models that can inform policy that saves lives but the need remains for more refined instruments to gather empirical observations and test those models bernardo gutierrez and moritz u g kraemer making accurate assessments about the spread of infectious diseases relies on the availability of robust epidemiological data a scarce commodity during growing epidemics and when resources are scarce official statistics are usually presented as aggregated data for instance newly reported confirmed cases by day and tend to be shared on a limited basis restricting access to the data by the scientific community at large although such information is important in tracking outbreaks it does not include the tremendous detail of epidemiological information that is available across different platforms such as news outlets social media and official government health reports furthermore epidemiological reporting standards vary considerably across these platforms and contain varying degrees of detail making automated data collection challenging as an alternative approach on the basis of experiences from past outbreaks the open covid-19 data working group opted for a crowdsourcing approach an international team of volunteers curate data sources by hand and compile the data in a standardized format this format presents epidemiological data at an individual case level which allows the extraction of remarkably detailed information on case demographics travel histories and high-resolution geographical distributions5 more importantly the constant screening of various information sources in real time adds value to this approach and makes it an important tool for disease surveillance a key aspect to guarantee its utility is the focus on data sharing through google sheets and the software development platform github data are openly accessible and updated daily6 and can be viewed here joseph wu kathy leung and gabriel m leung rapid and reliable assessment of the clinical severity of pandemic pathogens such as sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 is a top priority in pandemic response in particular characterization of the infectionfatality risk the probability of dying among infected individuals and symptomatic casefatality risk the probability of dying among those who develop symptoms relies on accurate estimates of the true epidemic size reported case counts are inevitably biased by the proportion of infections that are symptomatic care-seeking behaviour and the availability of tests although these biases could be partially addressed by developing transmission models to analyse all available epidemiological and clinical data a synergistic and complementary solution is to use seroepidemiological studies these use measurements of antibody response across a population to infer infective exposure to and by extension immunity against the pandemic pathogen and provide the most direct and reliable data for estimating true epidemic size integrating seroepidemiological data into transmission models can greatly reduce the uncertainty in the parameter estimates of clinical severity and transmission dynamics at the time of writing serological tests for covid-19 are being developed and validated long-term longitudinal serological follow-up of recovered individuals is crucial for characterizing the underlying immunodynamics for instance it can reveal the strength and duration of protective immunity and thus the probability of reinfection as such large-scale serosurveys should be conducted regularly and prospectively planned over the course of the different waves of the pandemic and beyond to provide serological data from different age groups  sars epidemiology clinical presentation management and infection control measures priya sampathkumar zelalem

 it is important to understand the meaning of close contact it is defined as having cared for or lived with a person known to have sars or unprotected contact with body secretions from such a person this includes kissing embracing sharing utensils or bedding performing a physical examination or other direct physical contact between persons it does not include sitting across a waiting room for a brief period walking by a person with sars or other casual contact chest radiographs of patients with sars show patchy focal infiltrates or consolidation often with a peripheral distribution which may progress to diffuse infiltrates pleural effusions have not been reported early findings may be subtle and initial findings on chest radiographs may be normal in up to 25 of patients6 computed tomography ct may be more sensitive than plain films highresolution ct scans have shown abnormalities in patients with suspected sars who have normal findings on plain films10 the characteristic ct finding is bilateral peripheral airspaceground-glass consolidation mimicking that seen in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia laboratory findings in patients with sars include thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in particular lymphopenia elevated creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase and transaminase levels have been noted a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level and an initial elevated white blood cell count may carry a poor prognosis7
 the etiologic link of a coronavirus with the sars epidemic was established by peiris et al11 in hong kong several diagnostic laboratory methods were used to initially recover and then characterize coronavirus infection in various specimens obtained from patients with sars these included inoculation and recovery of the virus in cell cultures characterization of morphologic features by electron microscopy serologic antibody determination and molecular amplification and sequencing of the target rna of the agent overall 45 of the 50 patients these investigators studied had 1 or more laboratory tests serology 32 rt-pcr 22 culture 2 that supported a coronavirus etiology the results of this initial report were quickly confirmed and expanded by collaborative studies in several major public health centers and medical institutions throughout the world coordinated by the world health organization12 13 molecular sequencing analyses have indicated that the virus is only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses based on serologic studies it appears that this virus has not previously circulated in humans and is now referred to as sars-cov14 15
 coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses that cause disease in humans and animals the previously known human coronaviruses are a major cause of the common cold and can occasionally cause pneumonia research teams in hong kong and shenzhen china recently detected several coronaviruses closely related genetically to the sars-cov in 2 animal species masked palm civet and raccoon-dog and antibodies against the sars-cov in 1 additional species chinese ferret badger these and other wild animals are traditionally considered delicacies and are sold for human consumption in markets throughout southern china this study provides the first indication that the sars-cov exists outside a human host studies are needed to determine how widespread the sars virus might be in animals in guangdong and elsewhere and if these animals can excrete the virus in an amount sufficient to infect humans and through what route such transmission occurs the sars-cov appears to be transmitted primarily by large droplet spread although surface contamination and possibly airborne spread may play a role recent data suggest that the virus may remain viable for considerable periods on a dry surface up to 24 hours hence transmission through fomites may occur the outbreak in an apartment complex in hong kong that accounted for more than 300 cases has been attributed to fecal spread a patient with sars who had diarrhea stayed with his brother in this building it is thought that infection spread from him to other residents in the building through a leaking sewage drain which allowed aerosolization of virus-containing material sewage also backed into bathroom floor drains in some apartments and may have accounted for some of the transmission the sars-cov is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least 1 to 2 days the virus is more stable up to 4 days in stool from patients with diarrhea which has a higher ph than normal stool16
 it is presently unclear at what stage of the disease viral shedding occurs or whether someone who is infected but asymptomatic can infect others as our knowledge of sars and the etiologic coronavirus evolves we will be able to address these important issues some close contacts have reported a mild febrile illness without respiratory signs or symptoms suggesting the illness might not always progress to the respiratory phase others have not become ill at all in contrast super spreaders have been described who have infected 10 or more contacts including hcws family and social contacts or visitors to the health care facilities where patients were hospitalized a similar phenomenon has been described with some other diseases such as rubella laryngeal tuberculosis and ebola virus and might be the result of a combination of host environment and virus interactions in singapore 5 super spreaders were responsible for a total of 170 suspect and probable cases of sars17 additional data on the natural history of infection are needed to understand factors that might be associated with this phenomenon regardless of whether it is the result of other transmission routes inadequate infection-control measures or more viral shedding by certain patients the fact remains that transmission of the sars virus is highly efficient in some circumstances the initial diagnosis of sars is one of exclusion hence common causes of respiratory illnesses should be sought initial diagnostic testing for patients with suspected sars should include chest radiography pulse oximetry blood cultures sputum gram stain and culture and testing for other respiratory pathogens notably influenza a and b respiratory syncytial virus and legionella table 2
 clinicians should save any available clinical specimens respiratory blood serum and stool for additional testing until a specific diagnosis is made acute and convalescent 21 days after onset of symptoms serum samples should be collected from each patient who meets the sars case definition paired sera and other clinical specimens can be forwarded through state and local health departments for testing at the cdc specific instructions for collecting specimens from suspected sars patients are available from the cdc18 laboratory diagnostic tests used at the cdc to test clinical specimens for evidence of sars-cov include serology pcr testing and viral cultures serologic testing for coronavirus antibody consists of indirect fluorescent antibody testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that are specific for antibody produced after infection patients seem to seroconvert at a mean of 10 days after onset of symptoms the cdc has made reagents for sars antibody testing available to state public health laboratories an rt-pcr test specific for rna from the sars-cov has been positive within the first 10 days after fever onset in respiratory specimens from most patients considered probable cases of sars who have been tested and in stool samples in the second week of illness the duration of detectable viremia or viral shedding needs further study12 13
 despite the fact that several thousand specimens from patients with sars have been processed in laboratories worldwide to date there have been no reported clusters of illness in laboratory workers nevertheless reasonable precautions should be taken in handling these specimens the cdc recommends that specimens from patients with sars be labeled accordingly and that the laboratory be alerted before the samples are sent laboratory workers who handle these specimens should use standard precautions in a biosafety level 2 laboratory any procedure with the potential to generate fine particulate aerosols should be performed in a biological safety cabinet19
 there is no specific treatment currently available for sars management consists of supportive care and appropriate infection control measures to prevent spread because the diagnosis is uncertain empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia should be administered by using antibiotics with activity against both typical and atypical respiratory pathogens including influenza when appropriate in all series of sars cases described to date therapy has involved broad-spectrum antibiotics including a fluoroquinolone or macrolide the antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in most patients treated in hong kong and in toronto without evidence of efficacy7 10 the adverse effects of ribavirin are significant particularly hemolytic anemia and electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia hence empirical therapy with ribavirin is not warranted anecdotal evidence suggests that corticosteroids may be beneficial particularly in patients with progressive pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia various regimens have been used in different centers with dosages of methylpred-nisolone ranging from 40 mg twice daily similar to therapy for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to 2 mgkg per day similar to late-phase therapy for ards to pulse doses of 500 mg intravenously per day20 because corticosteroids have potential adverse effects clinicians should carefully assess the risk vs the benefit on a case-by-case basis early identification of patients with sars in health care facilities and appropriate isolation are essential in preventing large outbreaks the cdc has recommended that in health care settings patients should be screened with targeted questions as soon as possible after arrival or while the patient is on the telephone making an appointment we have been using a simple screening tool figure 2
 to screen all patients in our facility patients who have positive findings on the initial screen are given a mask separated from other patients placed in an examination room a negative-air room if available and evaluated further by a physician with airborne n-95 respirator and contact gown gloves precautions if during this evaluation the patient fits the cdc case definition for sars and needs admission the patient is admitted to a negative-air room if admission is unnecessary but further testing is required the patient is escorted to appropriate areas for laboratory tests radiological studies etc and testing expedited so that exposure of other patients is minimized diagnosis of sars does not automatically necessitate admission patients who do not otherwise need to be admitted to a hospital should be managed as outpatients as long as they can limit interactions outside the home persons being managed as outpatients should be instructed to wear a surgical mask when in the presence of household members and they should contain respiratory secretions in facial tissue and place these in lined containers for disposal with household waste they should wash their hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer especially after touching respiratory secretions and other body fluids sharing of eating utensils towels and bedding between patients with sars and others should be avoided until these items have been washed with soap and hot water such patients should stay away from work school or other activities in a public place for 10 days after the resolution of fever provided that cough and other respiratory symptoms have resolved or have improved a plan will need to be formulated to decide how these outpatients will obtain food and other supplies such as surgical masks during the period of isolation and how arrangements will be made for travel to and from necessary medical appointments household members or other close contacts of patients with sars should be advised to wear disposable gloves for any direct contact with body fluids from the patient and to practice good hand hygiene such people should be vigilant for the development of fever or respiratory symptoms and if these occur they should seek health care evaluation they should inform their health care provider in advance of arriving for the evaluation that they have had close contact with a patient with sars so that arrangements can be made as necessary to prevent transmission to others in the health care setting in the absence of fever or respiratory symptoms they need not limit their activities outside the home patients who require hospitalization should be admitted to a negative pressure specially ventilated room visitors should be discouraged the number of hcws involved in the patients care should be limited all hcws should use personal protective equipment appropriate for standard contact and airborne precautions ie hand hygiene gown gloves and n-95 respirator in addition to eye protection while caring for these patients procedures that result in coughing and aerosolization of respiratory secretions should be avoided if bronchoscopy is considered essential for patient care it should be performed by experienced personnel using maximum infection control precautions table 3
 an important feature of the sars outbreaks in canada singapore and hong kong has been the fact that several hcws have developed sars after caring for patients with sars transmission to hcws appears to have occurred after close unprotected contact with symptomatic individuals this has placed additional strain on health care systems that have already been stressed by outbreaks of sars active surveillance for fever and respiratory symptoms eg daily screening should be conducted in hcws with unprotected exposure for 10 days after the exposure including checking the temperature when the employee reports to work and taking a history of respiratory symptoms workers with unprotected exposure who develop fever andor respiratory symptoms should not come to work they should stay home and report symptoms to infection control or the employee health service immediately health care workers with unprotected exposure during aerosolgenerating procedures intubation suctioning bronchos-copy etc should be quarantined for a 10-day period at home because these procedures pose a higher risk of disease transmission case definitions of sars are currently based on the presence of epidemiological risk factors close contact with patients with sars or travel to sars-affected areas and a combination of fever and respiratory symptoms with or without chest radiographic changes however if sars spreads into the general population our ability to distinguish it from other community-acquired pneumonias based on such epidemiological linkages will fail if this happens sars will need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of any community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia a typical history suggestive laboratory values and failure to respond to conventional antibiotics should raise suspicion diagnostic tests will be crucial in the future both to ensure that patients are isolated rapidly and to provide appropriate therapy sars has resulted in important challenges for the medical community in affected areas policies are changing daily as more information about the virus and the disease is obtained the resurgence of cases in toronto in early may 2003 shows the difficulty of maintaining control over a new disease characterized by many puzzling epidemiological and clinical features the continued alertness of singapore which most recently broke the chain of sars transmission shows the importance of maintaining a high level of vigilance and preparedness to ensure that a single imported case does not reignite an outbreak currently control depends on prompt detection and isolation of cases good infection control in hospitals and the tracing and quarantine of contacts  corona games masks social distance and mechanism design balzs pej gergely biczk crysys lab  pandemic response is a complex affair most governments employ a set of quasi-standard measures to fight covid-19 including wearing masks social distancing virus testing and contact tracing we argue that some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these measures are selfish decision-making and the differing national implementations of the response mechanism in this paper through simple games we show the effect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to wearing masks and social distancing and how these may result in a sub-optimal outcome we also demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games properly regarding the chosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome we promote a mechanism design approach it is in the best interest of every government to carefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their respective pandemic response mechanism  although in the same institute authors have collaborated remotely  the current coronavirus pandemic is pushing individuals businesses and governments to the limit people suffer owing to restricted mobility social life and income complete business sectors face an almost 100 drop in revenue and governments are scrambling to find out when and how to impose and remove restrictions in fact covid-19 has turned the whole planet into a living lab for human and social behavior where feedback on response measures employed is only delayed by two weeks the incubation period from the 247 media coverage all of us have seen a set of quasistandard measures introduced by national and local authorities including wearing masks social distancing virus testing contact tracing and so on it is also clear that different countries have had different levels of success employing these measures as evidenced by the varying normalized death tolls and confirmed cases 1  we believe that apart from the intuitive eg genetic differences medical infrastructure availability hesitancy etc there are two factors that have not received enough attention first the individual incentives of citizens eg is it worth more for me to stay home than to meet my friend have a significant say in every decision situation while some of those incentives can be inherent to personality type clearly there is a non-negligible rational aspect to it where individuals are looking to maximize their own utility second countries have differed in the specific implementation of response measures eg whether they have been distributing free masks affecting the efficacy of mask wearing in case of equipment shortage or providing extra unemployment benefits affecting the likelihood of proper self-imposed social distancing framing pandemic response as a mechanism design problem ie architecting a complex response mechanism with a preferred outcome in mind can shed light on these factors whats more it has the potential to help authorities mechanism designers fight the pandemic efficiently in this paper we model decision situations during a pandemic with game theory where participants are rational and the proper design of the games could be the difference between life and death our main contribution is two-fold first regarding decisions on wearing a mask we show that i the equilibrium outcome is not socially optimal under full information ii when the status of the players are unknown the equilibrium is not to wear a mask for a wide range of parameters and iii when facing an infectious player it is almost always optimal to wear a mask even with low protection efficiency furthermore for social distancing using current covid-19 statistics we showed that i going out is only rational when it corresponds to either a huge benefit or staying home results in a significant loss and ii we determined the optimal duration and meeting size of such an out-of-home activity second we take a look at pandemic response from a mechanism design perspective and demonstrate that i different government policies influence the outcome of these games profoundly and ii individual response measures sub-mechanisms are interdependent specifically we discuss how contact tracing enables targeted testing which in turn reduces the uncertainty in individual decision making regarding both social distancing and wearing masks we recommend governments treat pandemic response as a mechanism design problem when weighing response costs vs the social good the remaining of the paper is structured as follows section 2 briefly describes related work section 3 develops and analyzes the mask game adding uncertainty mask efficiency and multiple players to the basic model section 4 develops and analyzes the distancing game including the effect of meeting duration and size section 5 frames pandemic response as a mechanism design problem using the design of the two games previously introduced as examples finally section 6 outlines future work and concludes the paper here we briefly review some related research efforts for a more complete survey we refer the reader to 3  13 modeled the behavioral changes of people to a pandemic using evolutionary game theory and showed that slightly reducing the number of people an individual is in contact with can make a difference to the spread of disease moreover both an earlier warning and when accurate information about the infection is disseminated quickly peoples responses to the information can limit the spread of disease 17 focused on the traveling habits of people between areas affected differently by the disease and found conflict between the nash equilibrium individually optimal strategy and the social optimum optimal group strategy only under specific changes in economic and epidemiological conditions in line with our mask game 6 studied how individuals change their behavior during an epidemic in response to whether they and those they interact with are susceptible or infected the authors show that there is a critical level of concern ie empathy by the infected individuals above which the disease is eradicated rapidly furthermore risk-averse behavior by susceptible individuals cannot eradicate the disease without the preemptive measures of infected individuals in line with our social distancing game 14 studied how individuals would best use social distancing and related self-protective behaviors during an epidemic the study found that in the absence of vaccination or other intervention measures optimal social distancing can delay the epidemic until a vaccine becomes widely available 2 studied the vaccination behavior of people the designed model exhibits a wait and see nash equilibrium strategy with vaccine delayers relying on herd immunity and vaccine safety information generated by early vaccinators as a consequence the epidemic peaks timing is strongly conserved across a broad range of plausible transmission rates besides any effect of risk communication at the start of a pandemic outbreak is amplified finally the game-theoretic model in 15 focuses on the various level of drug stockpiles in different countries and find controversial results sometimes there is an optimal solution of a central planner such as the who which improves the decentralized equilibrium but other times the central planners solution minimizing the number of infected persons globally requires some countries to sacrifice part of their population to improve readability we summarize all the parameters and variables used for the mask and the distancing game in table 1  probably the most visible consequence of covid-19 are the masks before their usage was mostly limited to some asian countries hospitals banks in case of a robbery and some other places due to the coronavirus pandemic an unprecedented spreading of mask-wearing can be seen around the globe policies have been implemented to enforce their usage in some places but in general it has been up to the individuals to decide whether to wear a mask or not based on their own risk assessment in this section we model this via game theory we assume there are several mask types giving different level of protection  no mask this corresponds to the behavior of using no masks during the covid-19 or any pandemic its cost is consequently 0 however it does not offer any protection against the virus  out mask this is the most widely used mask eg cloth mask or surgical mask they are meant to protect the environment of the individual using it they work by filtering out droplets when coughing sneezing or simply talking therefore hinders the spreading of the virus they do not protect the wearer itself against an airborne virus the cost corresponding to this protection type is noted as c out  0  in mask this is the most protective prevention gear designed for medical professionals eg ffp2 or ffp3 mask with valves valves make it easier to wear the mask for a sustained period of time and prevent condensation inside the mask they filter out airborne viruses while breathing in however the valved design means it does not filter air breathed out note that cdc guidelines 2 recommend using a clothsurgical mask for the general public while valved masks are only recommended for medical personnel in direct contact with infected individuals the cost of this protection is c in  c out  besides which mask they use ie the available strategies the players are either susceptible or infected 3  the latter has some undesired consequence hence we model it by adding a cost c i to these players utility which is magnitudes higher than c in and c out  using these states and masks we can present the basic games payoffs where two players with known status meet and decide which mask to use on the left of table 2  the payoff matrix corresponds to the case when both players are susceptible note that in case both players are infected the payoff matrix would be the same with an additional constant c i  on the right of table 2 corresponds to the case when one player is infected while the other is susceptible on the left side of table 2 it is visible that both players cost is minimal when they do not use any masks ie the nash equilibrium of the game when both players are susceptible is no no this is also the social optimum meaning that the players aggregated cost is minimal the same holds in case both players are infected as this only adds a constant c i to the payoff matrix this changes when only one of the players is susceptible ie right side of table 2  the infected player using no mask is a dominant strategy for her 4  since it is her best response independently of the susceptible players action consequently the best option for the susceptible player is in ie the ne is in no on the other hand the social optimum is different noout would incur the least burden on the society since c out  c in  in social optimum susceptible players would benefit through a positive externality from an action that would impose a cost on infected players therefore it is not a likely outcome in fact such a setting is common in man-made distributed systems especially in the context of cybersecurity a well-fitting parallel is defense against ddos attacks 9  although it would be much more efficient to filter malicious traffic at the source ie out internet service providers rather filter at the target ie in owing to a rational fear of free-riding by others since in the basic game no player plays out we simplify the choice of the players to either use a mask or no hence we note the cost of a mask with c use  to represent the situation better we introduce ambiguity about the status of the players we denote the probability of being infected as  we know from the basic game that if both players are infected with probability  2  or susceptible with probability 1 2  they play nono while if only one of them is infected with probability 2    1   the infected player plays no while the susceptible plays use in this bayesian game the players play no most of the cases eg with probability 1    1   this chain of thought is too simplistic as we assumed case-wise that the players know their status consequently with uncertainty we must minimize the costs of the players if both players are infected with equal probability the payoff for player 2 is equation 1 where p n is the probability that player n plays use otherwise she plays no the payoff for the other player is similar since the game is symmetric in more detail the first two lines correspond to the case when player 2 is not infected hence the multiplication with 1   at the beginning while the last line captures when she is infected either way she plays use with probability p 2  which costs c use  otherwise she plays no which has no cost except when player 1 is infected and she plays no as well end of the second line since this formula is linear in p 2  its extreme point within 01 is at the edge we take its derivative to uncover the function steepness the condition for the function to be decreasing ie higher probability for using a mask corresponds to lower cost is seen below consequently the only scenario which might admit wearing a mask with non-zero probability corresponds to the availability of sufficiently cheap masks in the basic game we assumed in provides perfect protection from infected players while out protects the other player fully however in real life these strategies only mitigate the virus by decreasing the infection probability ie  to some extent for this reason we define a b  0 1 in a way that the smaller value of the parameter corresponds to better protection a measures the protection efficiency of the protection strategy while b captures the efficiency of eliminating the further spread of the disease consequently a and b was set in the previous cases to a out  0 a in  1 both in prevents further spread fully while out does not prevent it at all b out  1 out has no effect on protecting the player b in  0 in fully protects the player we simplify the action space of the players as we did in the bayesian game in and out is merged into use with efficiency parameters a and b we set b  2 3  as surgical masks on the infectious person reduce cold  flu viruses in aerosols by 70 according to 12  while a home-made mask achieves 23 of this efficiency 4  parameter a is much harder to measure it should be a  b since any mask keeps the virus inside the players is more efficiently than stopping the wearer from getting infected for the sake of the analysis we set a  b 2  1 3  we are interested in the mask-wearing probability of a susceptible player when the other player is infected 5 the utility in such a situation is shown in equation 3 where for simplification we defined p  p 1  p 2  ie both players play a specific strategy with the same probability with such a constraint we restrict ourselves from finding all the solutions however since the game is symmetric an equilibrium of this reduced game is also an equilibrium when the players could use a different strategy distribution from this we easily deduce that use corresponds to a smaller cost that no if cuse c i  7 9  which holds by default as c use c i even for more inefficient masks moreover use ie p  1 is the best response most of the time because of the following 1 the utility is a second order polynomial hence it has one extreme point 2 this extreme point is a minimum due to u  4 9  c i  0 3 the utility ie cost is decreasing on the left and increasing on the right of this minimum point 5 the minimum point is expected to be above 1 due to c use c i  6 p  0 1 is on the left of the minimum point hence a higher p corresponds to a smaller cost this game can be further extended by allowing more players to participate in this extension if there exists an infected player who plays no as we showed already all the susceptible players should play in this ne is the so as well if the ratio of the infected which is identical to the probability  of being infected is sufficiently high the accumulated cost when the susceptible players play in and the infected play no is less than the accumulated cost when the infected players play out and the susceptible play although it is mathematically possible that the infected plays no in the so but it is doubtful both the cost of in is significantly higher than out and the infection ratio  is low at least at the beginning of the pandemic another thing most people has experienced during the current covid-19 pandemic is social distancing here we introduce a simple distancing game it is to be played in sequence with the previously introduced mask game once a player decided to meet up with friends via the distancing game she can decide whether to wear a mask for the meeting using the mask game a summary of the used parameters are enlisted in table 1  we represent the cost of getting infected with m  l ie the mortality rate of the disease multiplied with the players evaluation about her own life 6 we set m  01 as this value is approximately in the middle of the possible interval 7  006  dead all cases  m  dead closed cases  014 besides the risk of getting infected going out or attending a meeting could benefit the player denoted as b on the other hand staying home or missing a meeting could have some additional costs denoted as c the probability of getting infected is denoted as  with these notations the utility of the distancing game is captured on the left of equation 4 where p is the probability of going out since this is linear in p its maximum is either at p  0 stay home or p  1 go out precisely the player prefers to stay home if the right side of equation 4 holds example for instance a rational american citizen should go out only if she values her life less than 2941 1 0003401  times the benefit of going out and the loss of staying home together if we approximate the infection ratio with active cases population  00034 as of 20th of may 2020 according to 16  the value of a statistical life in the us was 92 million usd in 2013 which is equivalent to 113 million usd in 2020 with 03 interest rate this means a rational average american should only meet someone if the benefit of the meeting and the cost of missing it would amount to more than 3842 usd  113m 2941  one way to improve the above model is by introducing meeting duration and size leaving our disinfected home during a pandemic is risky and this risk grows with the time we spend outside similarly a meeting is riskier when there are multiple participants involved in the original model we captured the infection probability with   1  1   this ratio increases to 1  1   gt when there are g possible infectious sources for t time since g and t are interchangeable we merge this two together under a common notation z  g  t this extended model can be used to determine the optimal duration and size of a meeting once the player decided to go out according to the basic distancing game we define 0  z  100 as no player has infinite time or meeting partners moreover the benefit and the loss of attending and missing a meeting should depend on this new parameter for instance staying home in isolation for a longer period might cause anxiety which could get worst over time ie increasing the cost or attending a meeting with many friends at the same time could significantly boost the experience ie increase the benefit consequently a rational person should leave her home only if equation 5 holds which is the extension of the right side of equation 4  in figure 1  we present three use-cases of the formula inside the maximization above the left one represents the case when both the benefit and the cost are constant the right one corresponds to the case when both of them are linear in the middle is a mixture of these two note that we needed to restrict z to be under a certain amount otherwise the formula goes to infinity as z   in some cases let us assume a bus tank is leaking the owner is loosing 1 usd of petrol every t time ie cz  1  t as the owner must visit a mechanic and meet one person in the meantime the benefit of leaving the house is constant eg bz  1 the middle of figure 1 corresponds to this setting it is visible that going out for a short or long period eg z  5 and z  100 is only rational for someone who values her life below 3553 and 3499 usd respectively figure 1 a few examples for various benefit and cost functions of the lower limit on the life value which would ensure that a rational american would stay home ie the formula inside max in equation 5 x axis represents z while y axis represents the utility pandemic response is a complex affair the two games described above model only parts of the bigger picture we refer to the collection and interplay of measures implemented by a specific government fighting the epidemic in their respective country as mechanism consequently decisions made with regard to this mechanism constitutes mechanism design 10  in its broader interpretation mechanism design theory seeks to study mechanisms achieving a particular preferred outcome desirable outcomes are usually optimal either from a social aspect or maximizing a different objective function of the designer in the context of the corona pandemic the immediate response mechanism is composed of eg wearing a mask social distancing testing and contact tracing among others note that this is not an exhaustive list financial aid creating extra jobs to accommodate people who have just lost their jobs declaring a national emergency and many other conceptual vessels can be utilized as sub-mechanisms by the mechanism designer ie usually the government we do not discuss all of these in detail due to the lack of space instead we shed light on how government policy can affect the sub-mechanisms how sub-mechanisms can affect each other and finally the outcome of the mechanism itself we illustrate the importance of mechanism design applying different policies to our two games and adding testing and contact tracing to the mix here we analyze the impact of commonly seen policies compulsory mask wearing distributing free masks limiting the amount of people gathering and total lock-down compulsory mask wearing and free masks if the government declares that wearing a simple mask is mandatory in public spaces such as shops mass transit etc it can enforce an outcome outout that is indeed socially better than the ne the resulting strategy profile is still not so but it i allocates costs equally among citizens ii works well under the uncertainty of ones health status and iii may decrease the first-order need for large-scale testing which in turn reduces the response cost of the government by distributing free masks the government can reduce the effect of selfishness and potentially help citizens who cannot buy or afford masks owing to supply shortage or unemployment limiting the amount of people gathering and total lock-down if the government imposes an upper limit l for the size of congregations this will put a strict upper bound on the optimal meeting size g   and the resulting group size will be minl g   note that if l  g  then it creates an opportunity for longer meetings larger t as equation 5 with appropriately designed and administered coronavirus tests medical personnel can determine two distinct features of the tested individual i whether she is actively infected spreading the virus and ii whether she has already had the virus even if there were no or weak symptoms note that detecting these two features require different types of tests able to show the presence of either the virus rna or specific antibodies respectively in general testing enables both the tested person and the authorities to make more informed decisions putting this into the context of our games testing i reduces the uncertainty in bayesian decision making and ii enables the government to impose mandatory quarantine thereby removing infected players even more impactful mandatory testing as in wuhan completely eliminates the bayesian aspect rendering the situation to a full information game it serves as an exogenous health oracle imposing no monetary cost on the players to sum it up the testing sub-mechanism outputs results that serve as inputs to both the distancing and the mask game naturally a health oracle does not exist someone has to bear the costs of testing from the governments perspective mandatory mass testing is extremely expensive similarly from the concerned individuals perspective a single test could be unaffordable contact tracing whether traditional or mobile app-based serves as an important input sub-mechanism to testing 7  it identifies the individuals who are likely affected and inform both figure 2  pandemic response mechanism as influenced by government policy dotted lines and the interplay of sub-mechanisms solid lines them and the authorities about this fact in game-theoretic terms for such players the benefit of testing outweigh the cost per capita with high probability from the mechanism designers point of view contact tracing reduces the overall testing cost by enabling targeted testing potentially by orders of magnitude without sacrificing proper control of the pandemic note that mobile os manufacturers are working on integrating contact tracing into their platform to eliminate adoption costs for installing an app 1  the big picture as far as pandemic response goes the mechanism designer has the power to design and parametrize the games that citizens are playing taking into account that sub-mechanisms affect each other after games have been played and outcomes have been determined the cost for the mechanism designer itself are realized see figure 2  this cost function is very complex incorporating factors from icu beds through civil unrest to a drop in gdp over multiple time scales 11  therefore governments have to carefully balance the -very directly interpreted -social optimum and their own costs this requires a mechanism design mindset in this paper we have made a case for treating pandemic response as a mechanism design problem through simple games modeling interacting selfish individuals we have shown that it is necessary to take incentives into account during a pandemic we have also demonstrated that specific government policies significantly influence the outcome of these games and how different response measures sub-mechanisms are interdependent as an example we have discussed how contact tracing enables targeted testing which in turn reduces the uncertainty from individual decision making regarding social distancing and wearing masks governments have significantly more power than traditional mechanism designers in distributed systems therefore it is crucial for them to carefully study the tradeoff between social optimality and the cost of the designer when implementing their pandemic response mechanism limitations and future work clearly we have just scratched the sur-face of pandemic mechanism design the models presented are simple and are mostly used for demonstrative purposes also the mechanism design considerations are only quasi-quantitative without proper formal mathematical treatment in turn this gives us plenty of opportunity for future work a potential avenue is extending our models to capture the temporal aspect combine them with epidemic models as games played on social graphs and parametrize them with real data from the ongoing pandemic policy changes mobility data price fluctuations etc relaxing the rational decision-making aspect is another prominent direction behavioral modeling with respect to obedience other-regarding preferences and risktaking could be incorporated into the games finally a formal treatment of the mechanism design problem constitutes important future work incorporating hierarchical designers who eu nations municipality household an elaborate cost model and analyzing optimal policies for different time horizons if done with care these steps would help create an extensible mechanism design framework that can aid decision makers in pandemic response  how and when to end the covid-19 lockdown an optimization approach thomas rawson tom brewer dessislava veltcheva chris huntingford michael bonsall b   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus that has provoked the global pandemic of covid-19 first reported in the city of wuhan china its emergence quickly triggered a lockdown within wuhan and the surrounding cities 1 requiring people to remain at home only leaving for essential journeys since then the virus has spread rapidly worldwide leading the world health organization to declare a global pandemic on the 11th of march globally the outbreak has spread to 210 countries and territories with 3007194 confirmed cases 207265 deaths and 883298 recovered individuals as of the 27th of april viewed on april 27 2020 1042 gmt 2 3 containment of the virus has proven challenging although some patients will require intensive care others have unreported mild symptoms with as many as 179 of infected individuals possibly being asymptomatic 4 those with compromised immunities underlying health conditions and of old age are most at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and subsequent respiratory failure necessitating the use of mechanical ventilators in a dedicated intensive care unit icu 5 this mass spread of infection and increasing pressure on hospital capacity has led the uk to follow the example of neighboring european countries by officially implementing a lockdown as of march 23rd while this appears to have slowed the spread of infection the cost to the economy of such measures is considerable with the first 15 months of lockdown estimated to have cost the uk 34 of its gdp 6 with a viable vaccine still several months or years away lockdown measures will eventually need to be lifted but this must be done without risk of overwhelming the health service if all restrictions are lifted universally this could trigger a rapid resurgence of infections and cause further death here we consider a two-way balance which aims to i maximize the number of people able to work outside of lockdown while ii ensuring that the number of people with covid-19 requiring medical help at no point crosses a threshold beyond which hospitals are unable to cope as an immediate termination of lockdown for all is likely to trigger a surge in infections a graded easing of lockdown restrictions is likely required the focus of our analysis is to understand the optimal pathway by which to release people as safely as possible back into a general and growing non-quarantined set of workers to understand how to restart the economy yet avoid the saturation of health services we present decision-making as a problem in optimal control to determine an optimal solution requires two definitions the first is a system of process-based differential equations whose boundary conditions or other attributes can be varied by policy decisions the second definition is an objective function metric which depends on the balance and extent to which our two conditions are fulfilled the aim is to solve the differential equations and find decisions affecting their boundary conditions that are optimal and maximize the objective function our equation set is based on a standard susceptible exposed infected recovered seir model framework 7 each of the four compartments has a modeled population and as time evolves people move through each class toward recovery or death the novel part of our analysis is that the seir equations are solved for two groups ie communities the first community is a non-quarantined group and during the full lockdown this represents the essential workers required to maintain health provision or essential services the second community is those in quarantine the main distinction between the non-quarantine and quarantine groups is that in the latter lockdown causes a much lower rate of virus transmission seir-based equations are solved for non-quarantine and quarantine groups connected by modeled release strategies from lockdown that is we allow different fractions of the quarantined group to move into the non-quarantined group and at different times for each potential strategy of movement between the two groups an objective function is calculatedsome metric describing the desirability of such a strategy this is high when many people are removed from quarantine as they are available to worka desirable outcome however its value switches to a near-infinite negative should the health service threshold be crossed due to high infection numbers our model calculates the highest possible objective function the optimal strategy and returns the number of release dates their time of occurrence and the number of people at each time for comparison we perform parallel simulations where we release all in quarantine to the non-quarantine pool but allow the return to quarantine later if necessary should infections risk exceeding the capacity of the health services we herein refer to this as a lockdown on-off release strategy and again find optimal timings and number of releases no mathematical model especially for something as complicated as virus transmission and human behaviors can make predictions accurate to within a small margin of error however models are especially useful in two circumstances and that we exploit first although simulations may lack absolute precision predictions will have some level of robustness such predictions give strong indications of expected responses to a range of different boundary conditions ie alternative release scenarios numerical model flexibility and speed of operation enables what if questions to be asked of alternative forms of graded lockdown release second by repeated operation of a model it is possible to scan across ranges of parameter values after governments start to release people changes to infection levels can be compared against ensembles of simulations with perturbed parameters data-model comparison allows selection of the most appropriate parameter value an approach sometimes referred to as adaptive learning the trajectory for that value becomes a more reliable forecast for the days and weeks beyond the available data evidence this approach is feasible is illustrated in data of infections in countries before and during a lockdown although there is substantial geographic variation all curves have similar forms amenable to parameterization indeed politicians have frequently described a mathematical functional form with the expression flattening the curve used to explain why lockdown is essential to avoid overwhelming health services our aim is to generate dynamical predictions and help inform the debate as to future lockdown release options each simulation can be readily understood in terms of policy decisions and mathematically this implies careful parameterization our model is parameter sparse yet sufficiently complex to capture a broad range of options critically each parameter is related to understandable quantities characterizing infection levels or lockdown decisions a central part of our analysis in the absence of much knowledge of the sars-cov-2 virus is to vary our fundamental parameters to determine their effect on the optimal strategy this identification of sensitivity aids understanding and can identify research priorities crucial to enhancing our understanding and ability to manage the covid-19 pandemic our model considers two parallel seir susceptible exposed infected recovered systems one describing the spread of disease in the quarantined lockdown population and the other capturing the spread amongst those at work the key difference between our two seir pools those in lockdown and those who are not is that transmission of the disease is assumed to be lower for those in a state of lockdown due to the self-isolation measures in place this means that the susceptible population sq are still able to become infected moving to eq as they leave their homes for essential trips or from people they share homes with albeit at a greatly reduced rate relative to those not in a state of lockdown s under full lockdown the latter pool contains only front-line workers who are unable to adopt social-distancing measures this is captured by the following system of ordinary differential equations where nt  stetitrt and nqt  sqteqtiqt  rqt and the subscript q denotes that an individual is currently under lockdown conditions our equations describe the movement of individuals through four stages from being initially susceptible to the disease s sq contracting the disease but not yet being infectious e eq becoming infectious i iq and finally recovering from the disease r rq at which point we assume an individual becomes immune to future infections figure 1 the function ut describes the release strategy employed controlling the movement of individuals between the quarantined and released groups the lowercase greek letters in equations 18 represent our rate parameters firstly  represents the transmission rate of the disease significant work early in the pandemic used available data to quantify the rate of sars-cov-2 transmission and a range of estimates have already been reported in the literature kucharski et al 8 calculated an r0 of 115477 when fitting to data from the initial outbreak in wuhan this corresponds in our case to a  ranging from roughly 025106 similarly when fitting to data from the initial outbreak in italy giordano et al 9 estimated a total transmission rate of 1048 split between the four different infected classes they considered these data-fit estimations risk failing to capture the impact of asymptomatic or unrecorded individuals especially for the wider-ranging classes of our model with a vision toward informing policy for this reason our sensitivity analyses below also consider transmission rates up to twice as high as these values note that we consider the population of both i and iq to impact the spread of disease as the quarantined group are still assumed to mix occasionally with the population for instance when leaving their homes to shop for essential items the parameter c is a scalar between 0 and 1 that captures how effective the self-isolation ie lockdown measures enforced are in reducing the rate of sars-cov-2 transmission  represents the natural background death rate of the population regardless of the impact of covid-19 and can have important implications for the strength of herd-immunity effects on disease dynamics as this is the only mechanism in our model through which the recovered population is reduced the parameter  represents the rate of death directly attributed to sars-cov-2 while the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 has been demonstrated to vary substantially between age classes 1012 in its current form our model does not incorporate age-structure and we therefore adopt an age-invariant mortality rate the parameter  represents the incubation rate the exposed population classes e eq capture the effect of the lag between people becoming infected and incubating the disease for several days and becoming infectious understanding the size of this effect is of great importance when assessing strategies in which a second lockdown may be enforced because efforts to monitor the subsequent spread of infection must consider the upcoming but lagged threat posed by the exposed class lastly  represents the recovery rate and describes how long individuals remain infectious in the present work we used the population of the united kingdom as an example to inform our initial proportion of the population in quarantine using labor force survey data from 201819 the institute for fiscal studies estimate that 71 million adults across the uk are in the set of key-worker guidelines set out by the uk government 13 we define this 1042 of the population as not currently being in lockdown and initiate the model with the remaining population in lockdown initial numbers of individuals in each class were calculated using estimates presented by flaxman et al 14 with the assumed values valid as of the 28th of march 2020 all model variables parameters and the values used for these are presented in table 1 the full set of parameter estimates obtained with links to the original sources have been collated and made available in appendix 1 to aid the modeling efforts of other research groups firstly the extent and longevity of immunity to sars-cov-2 and its effect on the dynamics of the pandemic remain open high priority research questions 22 23 recent modeling efforts have however thus far shown little difference when incorporating the impact of waning immunity 9 we therefore assume that once developed immunity provides complete and indefinite protection against sars-cov-2 the parsimonious nature of our model was chosen to enhance the ease of interpretation of our results and most importantly to enable the model to be quickly adapted to non-uk populations different countries currently provide varying levels of epidemiological detail in their reporting of covid-19 cases by reducing the number of classes and parameters considered our model is amenable to a wider range of countries and scenarios than the more specific model structures currently published 9 24 the result of this modeling choice is that our system captures the broad-scale dynamics of the disease resulting from different lockdown exit-strategies rather than making accurate predictions of the number of infected individuals which will require continuous data-driven adaptations applied to our framework while the model parameters are obtained from current research estimates see table 1 these values will continue to evolve as the scientific community updates and improves these estimates in light of new data and understanding as such our model code was designed with usability in mind such that all simulations can be quickly re-calculated to reflect any new research in light of this present uncertainty our current results are shown as a series of sensitivity analyses so that the underlying infection dynamics in response to each release strategy and parameter-dependence are clear a gradual release strategy aims to end the lockdown of the public from quarantine through multiple staggered releases expressed mathematically we seek to release m1 people at time t1 while ensuring that i  iq  ithresh at all times we iterate across a large mesh of potential values for m1 and t1 and for each trial we calculate the objective functional c1  m1  t1  ji iq where ji iq is a penalty function that heavily penalizes any iteration that results in it  iqt  ithresh for any t formally therefore the optimum choice of m1 and t1 are those which maximize c1 in short this approach calculates how to release as many individuals as possible as early as possible without breaking the infection carrying capacity after this optimum solution is found a second release of m2 people at time t2 can be similarly calculated after the first release if people still remain in quarantine to calculate these outputs we used ode45 a fourth-order runge-kutta solver in matlab to solve the system of equations 18 using the initial conditions in table 1 for t from 0 to t1 at this point we subtracted m1 individuals proportionally from sq eq iq and rq and added these to s e i and r the system was then solved again from these new points for t from t1 to 400 days to allow understanding of the effect of different values of some of the parameters presented in table 1 we operate our model for a range of parameter values specifically this was performed for a range of different transmission rates  infection thresholds ithresh and transmission reduction c figure 2 depicts an illustrative example of a gradual release scenario the on-off release strategy considers releasing the quarantined population all at once with the aim to then return everyone to lockdown when required should the number of infected exceed a threshold which threatens to overwhelm medical services formally we seek i pairs of tioff and tion a time at which to end quarantine and a time to re-instate it respectively consistent with the gradual release strategy we iteratively trial multiple potential values of tioff and tion where tiontioff for each choice of tioff and tion we calculate an objective functional cition-tioff-tioff-jiiq where ji iq is as defined above the optimum choice of tioff and tion is the pair that maximizes c in short we seek the longest possible duration out of quarantine as soon as possible without breaking the infection carrying capacity we plot an example of an on-off release scenario in figure 3 below the number of people to be released from quarantine m1 was divided into a mesh of 1000 equally-spaced points ranging from 0 to the total quarantined population nq0 each one of these trial values for m1 was simulated against a mesh of 1000 equally-spaced points ranging from 0 to 400 for an associated release time t1 once an optimum solution was found a second optimum release pair m2 individuals released at time t2 was also found unless specified otherwise the base values used are ithresh4106 c  005   235 180365   01961   000657 and   02222 these values are the same as presented in table 1 the optimum solution was found for a range of values of  c and ithresh to observe how these uncertainties affect the optimum solution these solutions are presented in figure 4 where the top row plots ac display the total quarantined population nq under the optimum release strategy and the second row displays the associated total infected population i  iq from figure 4 we see that varying the infection threshold ithresh or the lockdown effectiveness c has the greatest impact on mi the number of people released while the time of initial release ti remains mostly unchanged this suggests that an increase of 1000000 to ithresh can allow 4000000 more people to be released from quarantine changes to transmission  instead primarily adjusts the time at which releases are made with the number of people released remaining relatively consistent figure 4b shows that for each trialed transmission value 50 of the quarantined population can be released once the current infected population reaches a sufficiently low level in each case there is approximately a 2-weeks period between when the peak in infected individuals has ended and when individuals are released from quarantine figure 4c shows that for less-effective lockdown measures more individuals are able to be released from quarantine once the initial peak has ended this seemingly counter-intuitive result is due to the reduced lockdown effectiveness meaning that a greater proportion of the quarantined population have been infected while in quarantine and have since entered the recovered class this means they can be re-added to the working pool without substantial risk of further infections this result however clearly depends on the strength of any acquired immunity additional to the graphical sensitivity analysis presented in figure 4 a quantitative sensitivity analysis was also conducted on each model parameter for each parameter we calculated the total sensitivity index 25 sti a variance-based sensitivity metric that shows how important a model parameter is in affecting a certain model outcome in this study the model outcome considered is the objective function c for our optimum strategy defined formally the total sensitivity index for parameter i is sti1-veyxivy where y is the model outcome monitored and xi is the parameter considered xi here represents fixing all parameters except for parameter i the total sensitivity index is equal to 1 minus the variance in the expected outcome when all parameters except the one in question are fixed divided by the variance if no parameters are fixed in essence for each model parameter a value between 0 and 1 is calculated that describes how sensitive the optimum release strategy is to that parameter with a value nearer unity being more sensitive total sensitivity indexes were calculated for     c and ithresh in descending order these were estimated through monte carlo sampling to be   04978   03928 ithresh  01994   00958 c  00018   00006 we therefore find that our optimum release strategy is not strongly dependent on the values of the disease-induced death rate the lockdown effectiveness or the incubation rate  c or  and that in monitoring the effectiveness and outcome of a release strategy the recovery rate and transmission rate of the disease should be most closely studied to determine the optimal timings for an on-off lockdown release strategy both the times at which quarantine was ended tioff and the times at which it was reinstated tion were iterated on a mesh of 500 evenly spaced points across a timespan of 0400 once one optimum release pair was found the process was repeated up to two further times to identify subsequent optimum releases as necessary unless otherwise stated the base values used were ithresh4106 c  005   15 180365   01961   000657 and   02222 which are again the same values listed in table 1 a lower base value of  was used as it was considered unlikely that the population would be released from quarantine without certain social-distancing policies being implemented the optimum solution was found for a range of different values of  c and ithresh these solutions are presented in figure 5 from figure 5 we see that in all scenarios it is never optimal to leave the entire population out of quarantine for long notably we see in every instance that the optimum solution results in quarantine only being lifted for periods of 12 weeks this presents a very narrow window of time to be able to monitor the rise in infections there was no distinguishable change in dynamic behavior between the different parameters sampled we see in figure 5b that increasing the transmission of the disease required the initial quarantine to be ended later and for subsequent quarantines to be enforced for a longer duration all optimum solutions do however result in rapidly increasing herd immunity by moving a large number of individuals to the recovered class this difference can be seen by noting the difference in timescale on the horizontal axes of figures 4 5 just as with the gradual release strategy total sensitivity indices were calculated via the same method for our optimum on-off strategy in descending order and for the on-off strategy these now become   06371 ithresh  03775   02973   02821 c  00478   00045 we see that the order of sensitivity is roughly the same as for the gradual release strategy however all values except for  show increased sensitivity on the optimal result the impact of the incubation period is the most substantially different and this is due to the shorter durations of time people are out of quarantine in the optimum solution meaning small changes to the incubation period may have large unexpected impacts on the surge in infected individuals here we have investigated the optimal release of individuals from a state of lockdown the primary conclusion of our work is that a gradual release strategy is preferable to an on-off release strategy we conclude this from the finding that a population-wide instantaneous release would cause the number of infected individuals to rise dramatically in a short period of time any decision to begin easing lockdown measures will require constant monitoring and a high-level of population testing to track the likely rise toward a second-peak of infections we show that employing a gradual release strategy where groups of the population are slowly released from quarantine sequentially will slow the arrival of any subsequent infection peaks compared to an on-off strategy where lockdown is ended for all individuals imminently and reinstated when subsequent infections begin to increase in all considered instances ie parameter variations it will not be possible to end lockdown for the entire population for any longer than 2 weeks as the number of infected individuals is then expected to quickly overwhelm the health service following such a release by ensuring that the increase in the number of infected individuals is as slow as possible this will enable health officials to monitor more accurately the evolving situation and provide more time to respond to unexpected increases in the number of infected individuals we note that our approach does not consider the ethical responsibilities that will also impact any policy decision if enough hospital provision was available many more people can return to employment but we recognize this will result in increased risk of further mortalities as many governments state however a functioning economy is more able to provide health provision to those with life-threatening illnesses unrelated to covid-19 for a gradual release strategy our simulations broadly suggest that a large section of the population should be released from lockdown initially after the first peak of infections has fully passed the rest of the population may then be released 34 months later following a likely second peak in infections again in a general context it is optimal to wait for 12 weeks after the end of an infection peak before releasing any of the population from lockdown while it is desirable to return the population to work as early as possible our optimal calculation states that this 12 weeks wait period is crucial in ensuring that the number of infected individuals is as low as possible when ending any lockdown measures to reduce the growth of new cases after this sufficient cautious wait period has ended people should then be released from quarantine with the knowledge that as many as 1 in 100 of them under the worst-case scenario may require critical care 10 in the coming months it is expected that a second peak in infections may be observed 12 months after this release date and that the remaining population in quarantine should remain so until once again several weeks of low newly infected cases daily have been observed what we have not undertaken here is to investigate or advocate any particular forms of changed behaviors that might be needed by those released although understanding them can allow parameters such as transmission rates to be adjusted in our framework additional measures proposed include reopening local connections before connecting cities further apart 26 differential release times based on age 2729 on-going social distancing 9 30 31 contact tracing using mobile applications 32 and behavior monitoring 33 case-finding 34 and cyclic schedules eg short working weeks 35 36 placing our analysis in the context of other studies mulheirn et al 34 provide a particularly broad and qualitative assessment of ranges of possible exit strategies from lockdown these include release times potentially dependent on age sector or geographical region and the latter including metrics of local health capacity such measures can be in tandem with strong policies to shield the most vulnerable the authors note that with varied approaches to lockdown release by differing countries there is an opportunity to learn from this by intercomparison undoubtedly all countries leaving lockdown however implemented will heavily scrutinize data for any evidence of an emerging second wave of infections noted is the potential for raised levels of testing in tandem with contact tracing for anyone found to be infected to slow the spread of covid-19 while at least a partial restarting of society occurs for all of the options considered by mulheirn et al 34 if the related parameters can be estimated with at least some certainty then we believe our flexible model structure can adopt these hence our simulation framework provides a mechanism to place any suggested lockdown plans on a quantitative basis furthermore where flexibility exists in release times then for a given strategy calculation of an optimal solution is possible the nearest analysis to ours found in the literature based on both a seir framework and applied to covid-19 is by german et al 28 their version of the seir equations place more complexity into the infection component differentiating between alternative levels of seriousness with which a person has the illness ie from asymptomatic through to requiring intensive care they also allow for uncertainty as to whether people who recover are immunean issue likely to be resolved once antibody tests become routinely available hence people post-infection can in the model be returned to the susceptible pool german et al 28 conclude that without retaining some constraints on the population after the termination of lockdown then there would be an overwhelming increase in infections such constraints include social distancing isolation of infectious people and contact tracing they further stress the importance of a considerable increase in the testing of individuals to best inform any release decisions their conclusions align with many of our findings however rather than assessing constraints applied to the entire population as released simultaneously our primary focus is to consider additional flexibility to constrain infection levels by a gradual release from lockdown whilst we believe that our model framework does have predictive capability we do raise a couple of caveats we recommend exploring our findings within a variety of other model frameworks stochastic frameworks may be better suited to model the exact time periods when populations are first reintroduced so as to better calculate the range of time frames until a second wave of infections in a probabilistic setting likewise compartmental infection models such as those presented by giordano et al 9 will be able to provide more accurate estimations on any expected hospital intake our model is broad enough to allow it to be applied to countries outside of the uk simply by initializing at the alternate initial conditions and setting some parameters that will be country-specific this however must be supported by an agreed uniform definition of our basic model parameters and case confirmation definition to ensure that model validation is compatible with the respective country in preparing to monitor the situation upon easing lockdown measures our sensitivity analysis highlights that the recovery rate of the disease  above is the most critical parameter in understanding the magnitude of any subsequent peaks in infection our calculations can be trusted further if that value is well-understood for example if new hospitalized patients of covid-19 appeared to be remaining symptomatic and infectious for longer than previously estimated it is plausible to assume within the general community that the disease is therefore being transmitted faster than previously expected this knowledge could trigger preparations for a potential need to reinstate lockdown measures hence further research efforts into the infectious period should also therefore be prioritized in a similar vein the parameter to which results are second-most sensitive is transmission rate  and so also worthy of precise research a potential benefit of the on-off release strategy is that it greatly increases the number of people subsequently moved to the recovered class rapidly bolstering the acquisition of herd-immunity this in theory would enable the full re-opening of the economy at an earlier date however it makes the critical assumption that recovered individuals would remain immune to the disease the nature of immunity to sars-cov-2 is an open question and efforts are being made to understand its strength and longevity but currently the who advises that there is no evidence yet to suggest that recovered covid-19 patients have ongoing immunity to a second infection 37 in light of this the more cautious gradual release strategy remains even more preferable as the scientific community continues its efforts to develop a viable vaccine in conclusion using an optimal control methodology we have shown that a gradual staggered release of individuals out of lockdown is recommended to ensure that health systems are not overwhelmed by a surge in infected individuals it has been well-observed that older individuals are more likely to require critical care as a result of covid-19 10 although our analysis does not as yet differentiate by age who should be in any partial lockdown releases this does indicate that potentially the younger population could be the first to be released from lockdown this would further ease any subsequent strain on the health system and potentially further bolster a herd-immunity effect we stress however that any decision to gradually release a proportion of the population by demographic criteria must be supported by periodical biomolecular investigation into the infectivity of such a group as any sector released from quarantine will immediately be at increased risk and may infect others ongoing population testing following a release from lockdown will be critical in ascertaining whether the infected population is growing in accordance with model projections if large differences are observed early re-initializations of the model should be performed similarly our analysis does not model the capability of businesses and individuals who have the infrastructure and availability to continue to work remotely the ongoing threat of covid-19 will require continual monitoring and study in the coming months it is important to ensure that infections are kept to a minimum and that the government and relevant services are given enough time to prepare for increases in infections the findings of this study stress that gradual and cautious action must be taken when easing lockdown measures to save resources and lives

already abundant information on the new coronavirus and its spread worldwide 1 2 3  as well as the risks it poses to the population the person infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 4 may develop the disease called covid-19 which manifests with mild to severe symptoms of fever cough shortness of breath and other signs 5  in the most severe cases the infection can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards causing respiratory failure septic shock or multiorgan failure and even death 6  there is yet a lot about this new coronavirus that is still unknown studies suggest that the case fatality rate of the virus is of about 35 in mainland china but the authors suggest considering the range 02-30 7  however this value seems to be much higher in italy 8  suggesting its strong dependence on demographics in fact the chinese center for disease control released an analysis that showed that the case fatality rate ranged from 0 in children aged 0-9 years old to 148 in those over 80 9  which implies that countries with a high number of elderly citizens as is the case of italy and portugal are more prone to having higher death rates the quick spread of the virus in europe has led the who to declare europe as the new epicentre of the disease on the 13th of march of 2020 10  the rapid growth of the number of active cases presenting severe symptoms has saturated the health services in most countries in the continent especially in italy 11  it is yet unknown when the epidemic will reach an end but governments throughout europe have implemented harsh measures to prevent and mitigate the spread of the virus yet as of today there are as many as 77394 confirmed cases on the european continent in 46 territories resulting in 3457 deaths and rising 2 3  in portugal the two first confirmed cases in the portuguese territory were announced on the 2nd of march which puts the country slightly behind the curve in the outbreak in the european continent as of today there are 642 confirmed cases 2 deaths and 3 recovered 12  also the country is on lockdown since the 13th of march 2020 and the portuguese parliament declared a state of emergency today 18th of march 2020 one of the questions many policy makers and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time a timely idea of the amount of cases that will exist in a near future can allow governments and policy makers to act accordingly in this study i adapted a model of the sir type used in south-korea to model the evolution of the active cases of the mers outbreak in the country back in 2015 13  although there are other models being used 14 15  this model seemed most appropriate given that the mers and the sars-cov-2 are related illnesses both provoked by a coronavirus strand and with similar symptoms although mers was much deadlier in order to fit the parameters and given that there is still very little data in the case of portugal i used the data of italy instead this allowed me to fit the curve of current active cases in portugal with a model which i then use by implementing the control measure parameters predicted in the model to predict the future number of cases in three different scenarios the outof-control scenario a scenario in which the government is successful in applying control measures and citizens mildly adhere to self-protection measures and a scenario in which the government fails to completely apply control measures yet citizens still adhere to some measure of self-protection the model used is the model described in xia et al 13  which can be understood by the flow diagram shown in figure 1 which was taken from the paper page 4 in this model s corresponds to the number of susceptible individuals e the number of exposed individuals a the number of asymptomatic infected cases i the total number of mild-to-severe infected patients h the number of hospitalized cases r the number of removed cases and finally n the total population of portugal 1 is the transmission coefficient of the asymptomatic infected cases 2 is the transmission coefficient of the symptomatic infected cases mild infected person and severe patients to the susceptible 3 is the transmission coefficient of the hospitalized cases to the susceptible 1 is the mean incubation period 1 is the mean time between symptom onset to hospitalization 1k1 is the mean infectious period of asymptomatic infected person for survivors 1k2 is the mean duration for hospitalized cases for survivors 1 is the mean time from hospitalization to death  is the clinical outbreak rate in all the infected cases the time unit is 1 day figure 1  flow chart of the sir-type model used in this work taken from 13 the set of differential equations can then be written as 1 given that the available data for covid-19 is still very preliminary the model was further adapted the only parameters that were considered known were the mean incubation time which was taken as 1 51 days from the literature here using the median as equal to the mean 16  and the mean infectious period of asymptomatic people where a conservative estimate of 1k114 days was used all other parameters were taken to be unknown furthermore and because the fitting of the model was difficult to achieve i took 1 2  3 as a first approximation meaning that the mean transmission coefficient is the same independently of type and setting of the transmission finally unlike xia et al 13  i consider that the epidemic starts with only one person infected i01 being the rest of the values 0 except for s0 which is simply n-1 see table 1 for a breakdown of the different parameters of this model the solving of the system of differential equations was performed using the mathematica code 17  which also allows for the use of fittable parameters using the function nonlinearmodelfit 18  given that there is still very little data for portugal the data for italy was used as proxy this seems like the most reasonable approach instead of using data from china or another asian country given the cultural and health system proximity between the two countries in order to determine the parameters   i used the number of deaths as reported by the italian ministry of health and available online 19  for the estimation of the value of k2 the number of recovered was used after determining the values for these parameters they were used to fit the curve of infected cases for portugal where the values of  and  were fitted to obtain a model this model was then used to estimate the future evolution of future cases in portugal according to three different scenarios  out-of-control scenario nothing done the virus is free to spread  scenario in which the government takes severe mitigating measures and the population mildly adheres to self-protecting measures  scenario in which the government fails to implement mitigating measures yet still implements some and the population mildly adheres to selfprotecting measures 31 fitting of parameters  and  italy the number of deaths in italy was taken from 18 and the set of differential equations described in eq 1 fitted to obtain the best possible fit for parameters  and  an r2 value of 099255 was obtain with the fit the rest of the parameters are presented in table 3

medrxiv preprint as can be seen in the case of recovered cases the fit has not the same quality as the fit in 31 this is further evidenced by figure 2 where a graphical representation of the fit is shown after the two previous procedures we now have all the parameters we need to fit eq 1 to the number of portuguese active cases in order to determine the value of  and  the number of portuguese active cases was taken from 20 which is updated daily the values previously obtained of parameters   and k2 were used as explained previously because the fitting was difficult to obtain as a first

for this preprint  a graphical depiction of the fitted model is given in figure 3  in this scenario the out-of-control scenario in which the corona virus would be free to spread within the country would lead to a pic of 40000 infected around the 6th of april 2020 a scenario that will very likely be avoided given the strong containment measures implemented by the government  cc-by-nd 40

httpsdoiorg1011012020031820038612 doi medrxiv preprint the fitting of these parameters was difficult to obtain there is enough systematic error and lack of statistics to make the present results very unreliable in order to obtain the parameters for  and k2 an ersatz value for  had to be given in this model  is originally defined as the clinical outbreak rate in all the infected cases which is in itself difficult to understand what it means in the cases of the fits of  and k2 the ersatz value used for  had a very strong impact in the results of the other parameters in fact as it comes multiplied with  in the transfer from compartment et to compartments at and st i think the high variation in this value could very well be due to the huge uncertainty there is at the moment for the appropriate incubation time of this virus which some authors claim can be of up to 27 days 21  although this number is probably an outlier finally a case of an incubation period of 18 days seems to have been confirmed by a recent study 22  the other parameters are somewhat less elusive the obtained value for 00168 is 50 the value obtained by xia et al 13 of 00348 which shows the difference in case fatality rates between the sars-covid-2 72 currently for italy and mers estimated at 34 but then again the value should be 20 of this value and not 50 further implying that the case fatality rate of the sarscovid-2 is still difficult to determine and could be higher than previously thought finally from the obtained values it is also possible to determine a value for the basic reproduction number r0 which here i take as being simply the value r05916 which demonstrates how strong the capacity for spreading of this particular virus is in table 4 the final values of the obtained parameters are given  the paper by xia et al 13 further presents an extra 7 parameters to take into account control measures in time evolution of the epidemic these parameters are meant to take into account two things -isolation and monitoring measures taken by the government parameters d1 d2 d3 and d4 -self-protection measures taken by the population parameters l1 l2 and l3  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity 2 the l1 l2 and l3 parameters are basically multiplication factors for the transmission parameter  so in our model we only consider one value for it as we did for  the d1 d2 d3 and d4 parameters are summed to the parameters of spread between the infected asymptomatic and hospitalized cases further stressing their connection to implemented government measures the values provided by xia et al 13  when applied to the portuguese case seem to provide a very unrealistic scenario in which the values would immediately start to diminish perhaps this made sense in the case of the mers epidemic given that it was much more localised that the one provoked by this virus as such and for the lack of a better model i devised two different scenarios in addition to the outof-control scenario described in the previous section  scenario in which the government takes severe mitigating measures and the population mildly adheres to self-protecting measures scenario 1  scenario in which the government fails to implement mitigating measures yet still implements some and the population mildly adheres to selfprotecting measures scenario 2 the values for these scenarios are given in table 5 13  in the second scenario i keep the 50 reduction in the transmission rate but diminish the efforts of the government by half results are shown in figure 4  results show that measures can be effective in flattening the curve as it has come to be called this effect in recent times in the first scenario the effectiveness of the control measures seems to be at a maximum and a maximum of just about 700 cases would be reached this seems unlikely as of today there are 641 active cases in the country in scenario 2 the maximum is shifted to the 20th of april reaching a maximum number of 7000 active cases in the country in this scenario the transmission rate has been cut to a half but the government has not been effective in implementing control measures as said previously in the out-of-control scenario the peak would be reached at about 40000 people given the huge uncertainties concerning these numbers and the current lack of knowledge of the ongoing epidemic it is very hard to make sense of its evolution even using well-established sir methods the current work makes a series of assumptions which may or may not be proven correct in the future including the incubation period of the virus which is still not well-known this proved to be a major source of uncertainty to fit the results because it had a great influence in the other parameters especially parameter  which seems to describe a probability of the person being exposed to the virus being symptomatic or not instead this parameter seems to behave in this study as an indicator of the huge uncertainty of the value for the incubation period finally epidemiologists and pathologists will tell you that these parameters unlike what is considered in this study are not only not constant but dependent on time location culture and other factors it is therefore particularly hard to model the current epidemic of covid-19 also this study takes into account the particular situation for one country portugal and we know that in globalised times the likelihood that new foci of infections arise from outside visitors is also very high although currently most government have implemented serious travel restrictions it is now well-known exactly how this parameter could affect this model which does not take that into account in fact one of the major issues with the sars-covid-2 virus is that unlike the other sars it seems to be much less contained locally as is evident by the amount of countries afflicted the amount of actual active cases is another clear source of uncertainty this model takes the values of active cases and compares them with official confirmed numbers which not only may be smaller than the actual cases as are released at an administratively defined time which probably does not correspond to something realistic the author believes that the values obtained in this study should be taken qualitatively rather than quantitatively one can think of the scenarios as defining two limits of a likelihood interval and as such the actual figure of maximum number of active cases in portugal will likely be in the interval 700-7000 between the 9th-20th of april this can perhaps serve to advise the competent authorities in taking the appropriate measures it also serves to show the importance of control and self-protecting measures it is possible to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the who and health authorities without them this model predicts that the figures of active cases would reach a staggering 40000 people it also shows that with the appropriate measures this can be indeed brought down hopefully that will be the case not just in portugal but in the rest of the world
